0	5960	In 2009, James O'Keefe hoodwinked a number of media outlets, activists, and politicians
5960	10980	when he circulated recordings he had secretly made of employees working at Acorn.
10980	16000	In the recordings, a disguised O'Keefe and his associate, Hannah Giles, got advice on
16000	21240	everything from how to avoid paying a pimp to effectively trafficking children across
21240	23520	the US-Mexico border.
23520	28720	What O'Keefe kept secret is that this footage was heavily edited and completely misrepresents
28720	30440	the discussions he had.
30440	34920	The Acorn workers, in many cases, were simply playing along with O'Keefe, and after the
34920	41600	conversations alerted police to his activities, they weren't actively giving advice to criminals.
41600	45720	Unfortunately, the doctored tapes were enough to convince conservative media outlets that
45720	50440	Acorn was an agency committed to helping child traffickers and street pimps.
50440	54640	The backlash was enough to scare the US Census Bureau and the IRS into terminating their
54640	56300	contracts with Acorn.
56300	62460	By November of 2010, Acorn had to liquidate all of its assets and closed up for good.
62460	65640	How did this deceptive footage convince so many people?
65640	69300	And how did a phony journalist like O'Keefe seem so credible?
69300	74160	The hidden camera tactic has long been a favorite of news outlets, and the O'Keefe tapes cashed
74160	76320	in on that well-accepted strategy.
76320	81080	By adopting the appearance of a genuine journalist, he was able to falsify a degree of credibility
81080	85200	he never had and advance his particular conservative agenda.
85200	89920	In this case, shutting down a non-profit that helped register voters in low and moderate
89920	91840	income neighborhoods.
91840	95880	Pretending to be a reporter covering a story is the perfect disguise for anyone who has
95880	97280	an agenda to push.
97280	101860	They simply need to look the part and engage what appears to be journalism, all the while
101860	107120	leaving out facts, editing out context, and providing commentary that distorts reality
107120	108480	to fit their worldview.
108480	110240	And that brings us to Lauren Southern.
116200	121080	Lauren's Southern is a great example of someone creating narrative-driven pseudo-journalism
121080	123900	that poisons our understanding of the world.
123900	128220	In demonstrating how this type of pseudo-journalism works, I want to take a quick trip through
128220	133040	Southern's career and the many tactics she's employed to push her particular narrative.
133040	137820	That narrative being a mix of nationalism, white victimhood, and a desire to pull the
137820	141120	Western world back to the 1950s.
141120	146000	But to understand where Southern came from, we have to talk about the Toronto Sun.
146000	151040	This daily newspaper launched in Toronto in 1971 and became a prominent voice for conservative
151040	152040	news in the city.
152040	158260	A tabloid both in its format and content, the Toronto Sun eventually spread to television.
158260	163720	The cable news channel, The Sun News Network, launched in 2011.
163720	168240	Its format was similar to Fox News, where it had reporting on during the day and commentary
168240	169240	on in the evening.
171120	181320	The channel did not do well.
181320	187440	In three years, it lost $46.7 million dollars Canadian, and by 2015, it went off the air.
187440	190480	But the story of the conservative channel didn't end there.
190480	195680	One of the personalities of The Sun News Network was a conservative commentator named Ezrilevant,
195680	199920	the nationally known champion of free speech.
199920	203960	For those who don't know, Ezrilevant is a cheery fellow who is best known across Canada
203960	208580	for his defense of free speech, most notably when he has to defend his own free speech
208580	213320	when he sued for libel or when he sues newspapers for publishing the details of the horrible
213320	214560	things he says.
214560	219400	Three days after Sun News Network was shut down, Ezrilevant launched the YouTube channel,
219400	220640	The Rebel Media.
220640	226080	The Rebel Media has been home to many odious faces, such as white genocide conspiracy theorist
226080	232880	Faith Goldie, white genocide conspiracy theorist Gavin McInnes, and great replacement conspiracy
232880	234720	theorist Lawrence Southern.
234720	237920	The great replacement is a code word for white genocide.
237920	241640	For the record, all three of these people have left The Rebel Media, but it was the
241640	244160	platform that propelled them into the limelight.
244160	248400	So it's important to know to understand why we have these characters running around making
248400	251320	the world a generally shittier place.
251320	254720	Which brings us back to Lawrence Southern, who was recruited by Levant when he noticed
254720	256400	her at a conference he had organized.
256400	261800	Levant was apparently impressed by the tough questions she was asking during a panel discussion,
261800	265120	and later on he gave her a spot with The Rebel Media when it opened.
265120	269560	In time, she became one of the YouTube channel's biggest stars, appearing in incredibly successful
269560	274160	videos that, at first glance, have the appearance of journalism.
274160	281280	Until you look a little closer.
281280	286640	Lawrence Southern made her big internet debut in June of 2015, when she starred in a video
286640	292960	titled Lauren Southern Clashes with Feminists at Slutwalk.
292960	297680	Filmed at a Slutwalk in Vancouver, British Columbia, the video features Southern breathlessly
297680	303000	walking around asking questions of the participants, a tactic you often see used by real journalists
303000	305400	on a wide number of different outlets.
305400	310200	But much like the undercover O'Keefe tapes, copying the style of real journalists doesn't
310200	313040	make what you're producing real journalism.
313040	317960	For an example of real journalism, of the on-the-ground variety, here's a video covering
317960	323800	the Umbrella Revolution protests of 2014 in Hong Kong, as reported by Phoebe Greenwood
323800	324800	for The Guardian.
324800	327960	This is Admiralty in Hong Kong.
327960	331360	It is the heart of the Umbrella Movement, which is now in its seventh day.
331360	336200	Tens of thousands of people have come to the streets here, asking Beijing to allow them
336200	339680	a greater democratic say in who leads them.
339680	341840	It's an extraordinarily peaceful movement.
341840	346840	It's perhaps the most polite bunch of protesters I've ever come across, but tonight is the
346840	352300	deadline that they've given the chief executive, C. Y. Leung, to resign.
352300	356480	No one here really thinks that he will, but no one here really knows what will happen
356480	357480	if he doesn't.
357480	360000	Now, this is a great opening.
360000	364040	Greenwood presents the video of the protesters and provides some context for why the protest
364040	365040	is happening.
365040	369280	You really feel like you just learned something about the politics of Hong Kong and the people
369280	372400	who live there, and all of that's just in the opener.
372400	378180	Now, let's compare this to Lauren Southern's supposed report on the 2015 Vancouver Slut
378180	379180	Walk.
379180	382920	Hello, it's Lauren Southern here with Rebel, and I've just gotten a huge confrontation
382920	386040	with the Slut Walk, which we are following right now.
386040	392800	Essentially, I held a sign that said, we are not living in a rape culture in the West,
392800	393800	which we are not.
393800	397960	It is intellectually dishonest to think that we are living in a rape culture.
397960	402680	Rapists do happen, but the majority or the minority, the vast minority of men and women
402680	403680	are rapists.
403680	407360	And when we do find out they're rapists, they go to prison, they are punished.
407360	413360	Whereas in the third world countries and other places, men can get away with rape there.
413360	419640	And it's insane to focus on this one issue and say that we are living in a rape culture.
419640	420640	Rapists don't get high fives.
420640	423160	We don't have the government funding rapists.
423160	427120	And men get fired from their jobs just for making rape jokes.
427120	428320	Not even raping.
428320	431600	So to say we live in a rape culture is quite frankly ridiculous.
431600	434340	All right, let's go follow the walk.
434340	436560	So there's a difference here.
436560	441160	Southern immediately begins talking about herself and how her counter-protest wasn't
441160	442680	warmly met.
442680	447180	Southern also makes no effort to explain why the Slut Walk is happening or what the stated
447180	449560	goals of the organizers are.
449560	453020	He bare minimum when introducing a subject.
453020	456260	He instead launches into a response about how wrong they are.
456260	460420	A reporter not believing the claims of protesters is fine.
460420	464960	But they have to first present the claims of the protesters, expanding on what protesters
464960	470260	mean when they say rape culture and addressing criticisms to that explanation is far more
470260	474260	useful than responding to what the reporter imagines they mean.
474260	475780	Back to the Greenwood example.
475780	477820	I really like this little snippet.
477820	479940	Ah, you're recycling.
479940	483780	You don't think violence can help us in any way?
483780	485500	But recycling bottles can.
485500	487180	Um, sort of.
487180	491540	Now this question seems almost superfluous, but what it's subtly doing is presenting
491540	495200	the innocence and perhaps naivete of the protesters.
495200	501020	It could be interpreted as a subtextual criticism in expecting the notoriously anti-democratic
501020	505460	Chinese federal government to respect the demands of the citizens of Hong Kong.
505460	509860	But it also shows the importance of hope in a protest movement and the earnestness of
509860	511180	the people involved.
511180	515460	It's a simple question and a simple response, but it tells you quite a bit about the people
515460	516460	there.
516460	519940	Now contrast this with the segment in the rebel media clip.
519940	524420	Well, how do you believe your outfit is going to stop perpetuating rape culture?
524420	525420	It's my body.
525420	526420	It's my choice.
526420	527420	I can wear what I want.
527420	528420	And it shouldn't.
528420	532340	This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene, like wearing the caution tape that they would
532340	536500	normally put around a physical crime scene with when it's not regarding a person, but
536500	537780	regarding me.
538780	540780	Regarding people, it's not considered a crime scene, that's f***ed up.
540780	541780	It should be.
541780	543780	It's a violation of a person's rights.
543780	546380	So is this stopping rapes?
546380	551940	Now this exchange was generally a train wreck, and it ended with a terrible loaded question.
551940	555940	For those who aren't aware of what a loaded question is, it's one that often includes
555940	557380	an unfair assumption.
557380	562580	A popular example is if you ask someone, when did you stop beating your wife?
562580	567740	The assumption in the question is that the person being asked abuses their wife.
567740	573180	Being someone is your outfit stopping rapes, includes the assumption someone is dressing
573180	576180	up to change the action of rapists.
576180	578860	That's not why this woman is dressed up.
578860	580460	She'll tell you why she dressed up.
580460	582660	In fact, she did.
582660	584300	Right before you ask that question.
584300	585300	It's my body.
585300	586300	It's my choice.
586300	587300	I can wear what I want.
587300	588300	And it shouldn't.
588300	590540	This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene.
590540	595380	If someone believes a rape culture is failing victims of rape and sexual assault, and providing
595380	599740	cover for abusers and rapists, generating conversation would be a good way to address
599740	601100	that problem.
601100	606660	This is a conversation Southern could have actually engaged in, but she wasn't listening.
606660	611220	She was more interested in asking a question that made her subject look silly.
611220	614500	She didn't attend this protest report on the sled walk.
614500	616460	She came to push an agenda.
616460	620420	But I want to highlight this delicious little moment that happens immediately afterwards
620420	624180	when another member of the sled walk confronts Southern with some heavy facts.
624180	627460	I'm going to play the whole exchange because it's just great.
627460	630580	Any stats to back up anything that you've said this afternoon?
630580	631580	Absolutely.
631580	633060	You said that rapists go to jail.
633060	636580	Can you give me a stat to back that up based on the number of rapes that are reported,
636580	640180	the number of rapes that get taken to the cops, the number of rapes that get prosecuted?
640180	642980	Could you give me some stats to back up your pseudo reporting here?
642980	649500	Well, first of all, out of the amount of rapes that happen out of 100,000 people, 1.7 of
649500	652900	Canadians actually even just that's just reporting rapes.
653460	656220	You know that less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.
656220	657620	Okay, where's that?
657620	658620	To the cops.
658620	660900	It's from all of the women's organizations.
660900	662260	You can look it up online.
662260	665940	You can find it through the socialized organizations that study rape.
665940	669460	I participate with an organization that works as a rape crisis center.
669460	671220	We base that on the number of calls.
671220	676380	The police know based on the unofficial reports, the third party reporting and the direct reports.
676380	679860	This is not a secret that about 10% of rapes are reported.
679860	682460	So how do you know 10% of rapes are reported if the others aren't?
683060	687620	Because those people call the women's centers, they ask for help, they seek medical attention.
687620	688620	So they are reported.
688620	692580	And the segment ends with a response that's a bit of a gotcha that really just proves
692580	696860	Southern isn't really engaging with what the person is saying.
696860	701340	It basically evaded all of that useful information the woman in sunglasses gave.
701340	702820	Look at the first thing she says.
702820	705700	Less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.
705700	707260	Okay, where's that?
707260	708300	To the cops.
708300	712340	And then she goes on to mention all the other avenues in which rape is reported.
713340	714620	So they are reported.
714620	717900	The two police part is the crucial difference here.
717900	722060	A rape can't be prosecuted unless it's reported to the police.
722060	727020	This woman is giving you evidence and a clear claim as to why police aren't hearing about
727020	729740	the vast majority of rapes out there.
729740	734140	Southern is either refusing to engage with the person she's interviewing or simply can't
734140	738020	understand the point the woman in sunglasses is making.
738020	741900	The last third of this video is dedicated to Southern's counter-protest and the response
741900	742980	it generated.
742980	745500	This is perhaps the most ridiculous part of the video.
745500	750980	If you're truly there to report on something, how can you justify starting a second demonstration?
750980	754620	You're no longer covering the story, you're part of the story.
754620	758820	She ends the segment the same way it began, and nothing was learned.
758820	761700	This video wasn't successfully reporting anything.
761700	765980	Its only accomplishment was making Lauren Southern an internet star who advances a right-wing
765980	767140	agenda.
767140	770140	Take a look at how CBC News in Vancouver covered the story.
770140	773900	And apologies for the quality, I got this off the channel of someone who doesn't know
773900	775900	how to capture footage off a TV.
775900	778580	Dozens gathered in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery this afternoon.
778580	782860	Their hope was to raise awareness of victim blaming around sexual assault, many holding
782860	787060	signs carrying messages about rape culture, a problem the group says is pervasive in our
787060	788300	society.
788300	792020	The things went sideways when one woman arrived with a message of her own.
792020	812540	So, the story that was about the Slut Walk became a story about Lauren Southern, or
812540	815740	as the CBC reported, one woman.
815740	820180	I have to imagine this is something Southern either intended, or something she takes pride
820180	821180	in.
821180	825420	Overall, I got the poorly captured video from her YouTube channel.
825420	829660	This pattern of dreadful on the ground pseudo reporting continued through much of Southern's
829660	830660	early career.
830660	835820	She went to another Slut Walk in Edmonton, a third in Los Angeles, and no valuable reporting
835820	836820	happens.
836820	840380	She tries to capture protesters with poorly thought-out loaded questions, and she goes
840380	844820	the extra mile to make sure we always know how poorly she's being treated.
844820	849800	Our cameraman got shoved and pushed, my sign was ripped up, and I got a few middle fingers
849800	851680	and got called a bitch.
851680	856640	She always underscores how she feels afraid or frightened, and that the people she disagrees
856640	861160	with aren't just people she disagrees with, they're people who are, in some way, rude
861160	863660	or physically dangerous.
863660	869680	In other words, she's undermined their arguments by attacking their supposedly boorish characters.
869680	872680	That said, there is some unintentional comedy here.
872680	876600	This time, they did know who I was and did not want to speak to me because of that, so
876600	881080	they kept saying she's not a real reporter and don't talk to her.
881080	882620	They were right.
882620	887240	Someone who goes to a protest, holds up a sign countering their message, and then asks
887240	892640	them loaded questions on camera to make them look silly isn't a reporter, they're someone
892640	897880	with an agenda, someone who is desperately trying to make their political opponents look
897880	899760	terrible.
899760	903160	Before we move on, I want to provide a little bit of extra context here.
903160	908020	The Slutwalks began in 2011 in Toronto as a response to the comments of Toronto Police
908020	910440	Constable Michael Sanguinetti.
910440	914840	He was addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum and said,
914840	918320	I've been told I'm not supposed to say this.
918320	923120	However, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.
923120	928080	The public was justifiably concerned that some officers were blaming the victims of
928080	932920	sexual assault, and to voice their displeasure, the first Slutwalk was held in Toronto on
932920	934920	April 3rd, 2011.
934920	939000	These demonstrations quickly spread across Canada and through the United States.
939000	943480	And there you go, you just learned more in the last 30 seconds about why the Slutwalk
943480	948680	was happening than in a half hour's worth of Southern's pseudo-reporting.
948680	952240	Also I should give a little more credit to the woman in sunglasses because as far as
952240	957120	I know, she was the first one to ever refer to Lauren Souther's work as
957120	959120	your pseudo-reporting here.
959120	963600	When Southern added context to her videos, perhaps portraying the views of protesters
963600	968200	in their oral words rather than trying to trap them with loaded questions, Southern
968200	972080	could have engaged with them honestly rather than trying to shape them into the strawman
972080	974040	she was more comfortable tackling.
974040	978240	By not sharing this information with her audience, Lauren Southern is presenting the protesters
978240	983080	as a bunch of eccentric weirdos who have spontaneously decided we live in a rape culture.
983080	985880	And that's the whole point of why the video was made in the first place.
985880	989880	It's not to report on the event as it happens, but to distort the event to fit a right-wing
989880	993960	narrative through a deceptive omission of facts.
993960	997460	Southern moved away from covering protests in North America and took her grand circus
997460	1000240	to Europe for more pseudo-reporting.
1000240	1004920	This time it was on something she was even less qualified to cover, the role of immigration
1004920	1006360	in Europe.
1006360	1010200	Southern's video about a demonstration in London campaigning to remain in the EU is
1010200	1017320	titled Lauren Southern Attacked by Anti-Fascist Thugs in London.
1017320	1021440	And to be honest, the title gives away everything that's wrong with this video.
1021440	1026840	This isn't, as the description claims, Lauren Southern reporting for The Rebel Media.
1026840	1031480	This is a video about Lauren Southern being attacked by supposed thugs.
1031480	1033600	The video opens with text.
1033600	1037840	Not about the demonstration, but about how Southern was in danger at the rally.
1037840	1042640	The first images we see are of a camera pointed at the ground as the cameraman tries to orient
1042640	1043640	himself.
1043640	1047200	The rest of the video is a garbled mess, and it creates the impression that as soon as
1047200	1050200	Southern showed up, things got messy and violent.
1050200	1053280	Now this is a real problem if you're a journalist.
1053280	1055920	How do you cover an event that includes a hostile element?
1055920	1060240	If you step into an area and get immediately attacked, you might need to rethink your strategy
1060240	1064520	and maybe find a go-between or maybe you have to reach out to people indirectly to get their
1064520	1066180	comments and opinions.
1066180	1069300	But I did leave out an important fact there.
1069300	1072700	Southern's crew didn't get attacked as soon as they entered the park.
1072700	1077260	I know this for a fact because a few days later, The Rebel Media uploaded a video titled
1077260	1079620	Full Length Version.
1079620	1084660	Lower and Southern attacked by anti-fascists at London Brexit Rally.
1084660	1089380	There are two problems with this title, aside from the fact that it's schlocky clickbait.
1089380	1092940	It isn't the full length version of events because it's missing about a minute that
1092940	1094740	was included in the first video.
1094740	1100140	Also, it's not a Brexit rally, it was a rally against the Brexit movement.
1100140	1103180	A small detail, but a sloppy mistake nonetheless.
1103180	1107500	What's far more interesting is how this video opens where we hear Southern describing
1107500	1109700	her strategy for covering this rally.
1109700	1113380	I literally don't even have to interview anyone, I can just stand here and it exposes
1113380	1114940	what this group is like.
1114940	1118620	That's a damning thing for a journalist to say.
1118620	1123100	And more damning, Southern freely admits to not having interviewed a person the whole
1123100	1124700	time she was there.
1124700	1131300	Of course, she doesn't literally mean she hasn't talked to anyone because there's
1131300	1136820	some footage of her talking to a guy who went up and took her hat and threw it in the garbage.
1136820	1140940	He shouldn't have done that, but it's a far cry from the impression the first video
1140940	1145500	gives you of Southern being attacked by anti-fascist thugs.
1145500	1149180	As best I can tell from the second video, Southern's strategy on covering this rally
1149180	1153260	was to stand around in a silly hat and make commentary about people while a cameraman
1153260	1154420	filmed them.
1154420	1159020	How can a supposed journalist justify describing the opinions and views of people around her
1159020	1161180	without taking a moment to speak to them?
1161180	1165180	Even if all she has are her loaded questions, that's better than not talking to someone
1165180	1167180	who's only a few meters away from you.
1167180	1171060	Aside from the clown who stole her hat and a few heated confrontations, it's difficult
1171060	1174860	to see just how viciously Southern and her crew were actually attacked.
1174860	1179340	And speaking genuinely, it's a shame that some demonstrators weren't on their best
1179340	1180540	behavior.
1180540	1184780	But this doesn't for a second let us Southern, who's reporting amounted to her standing
1184780	1188740	around making fun of people and then acting surprised when people got upset.
1188740	1193300	While the first video got nearly 2 million views, this longer version struggled to get
1193300	1195340	even 70,000.
1195340	1199660	The rebel media put out the edited one for a reason, and the headline gives it away.
1199660	1203060	This was an honest reporting about the anti-Brexit protesters.
1203060	1207220	This was done purely to frame them as dangerous and violent.
1207220	1211580	The con of placing Lauren Southern in supposed danger is a pattern you'll see in many of
1211580	1212580	her videos.
1212580	1215980	There's always something that comes up in a video that scares her.
1215980	1220620	As another example, in her video, Why Lauren Southern Needed Security to Walk Through Mowland
1220620	1225540	Beak, Belgium, she begins to panic when her film crew gets stares while they wander around
1225540	1227060	at 11pm.
1227060	1230900	The idea that a woman with a camera crew, speaking English, wandering around the street
1230900	1236820	in the middle of the night, catching a few glances, doesn't seem particularly strange
1236820	1249060	to me.
1249060	1250740	Southern is clearly scared here.
1250740	1255220	It makes me wonder why she just didn't pack it in while there was still daylight.
1255220	1259220	Filming at night is always harder because you need to lug around heavy lighting equipment,
1259220	1261140	and there aren't as many people around to speak to.
1261140	1265820	It's almost as if she was trying to manufacture a situation where it would look like she's
1265820	1266820	in danger.
1266820	1270500	Let's listen to what she says when she starts discussing people who don't want their faces
1270500	1271540	filmed.
1271540	1276820	This could suggest a number of things, but before you have any reasonable ideas like
1276820	1281420	maybe people just don't want to appear on camera and they're going about their day,
1281420	1294220	Southern is ready to speculate with something else, something less generous.
1294220	1299100	Without a grossly irresponsible bit of commentary, not wanting your face on camera doesn't make
1299100	1300580	someone a criminal.
1300580	1323580	Does Southern have any reason to believe there's a crime issue in Mullenbeek?
1323580	1331860	Listen to what Southern said before she asked the guy the question.
1331860	1336580	Why did she decide to show this guy instead of the other people she mentions who say there's
1336580	1337580	no crime?
1337580	1342860	I'm not sure what gives this shopkeeper special knowledge of the situation, but wouldn't
1342860	1344740	actual crime statistics help here?
1344740	1348260	Here's a crazy idea, let's actually look at those.
1348260	1353140	According to the Brussels Institute for Statistics and Analysis, the total number of criminal
1353140	1360660	offenses in Mullenbeek actually went up in 2016 from 9,184 to 10,087.
1360660	1365380	An increase of about 10% isn't really a crime wave, and of course it should be noted that
1365380	1372380	it went back down in 2017 to 8,818, but this video is from 2016, so I'm not going to criticize
1372380	1373660	it for not knowing the future.
1373660	1378420	It's better to look at stats when they have a bit of context to them, so is Mullenbeek
1378420	1383740	especially dangerous as a neighborhood compared to other locations in Brussels?
1383740	1387120	A look at the numbers suggests no, definitely not.
1387120	1394200	With a population of 96,629 and a total number of crimes of 10,087, that works out to one
1394200	1400220	crime per 9.6 citizens, or as it might be more commonly presented, 1,044 crimes per
1400220	1401220	10,000 people.
1401220	1406820	Out of 19 neighborhoods in Brussels, Mullenbeek is ranked 6th as most crimes per capita.
1406820	1411140	So while it certainly isn't the safest place to be if you're in Brussels, there's no
1411140	1414460	real evidence to suggest it's especially dangerous.
1414460	1421340	Or more dangerous than say, downtown Brussels, which saw 40,191 crimes in 2016 working out
1421340	1429140	to roughly one crime per 4.4 citizens, or 2,277 crimes per 10,000 people.
1429140	1433940	So Mullenbeek is safer both proportionally and in total crime than walking around the
1433940	1436540	most populous area in Brussels.
1436540	1439540	But why did Southern choose Mullenbeek to begin with?
1439540	1444380	This was part of a popular right-wing narrative at the time that Mullenbeek was a no-go zone
1444380	1445380	in Brussels.
1445380	1449300	A small number of residents who had lived in the area had committed terror attacks in
1449300	1454880	Europe, most notably the 2015 attack in Paris that killed 130 people.
1454880	1460100	This tragedy was used to demonize an entire neighborhood as the breeding ground for jihadis.
1460100	1463820	Southern's contribution to this body of journalism was to walk around the neighborhood, talk
1463820	1467080	to a few people, and then get very scared in the evening.
1467080	1469540	Did we learn anything in her video?
1469540	1473380	Did it provide any real context that might inform its audience?
1473380	1477980	No, we just got another sample of a right-wing narrative designed to portray the Mullenbeek
1477980	1481820	neighborhood as dangerous without any substantive evidence.
1481820	1486700	This is part of a larger anti-immigrant narrative, especially in anti-Muslim immigrants, that
1486700	1489460	runs throughout right-wing media.
1489460	1493620	You can see even lazier examples of this in Southern's video of her walking around
1493620	1500820	a German town in 2016, titled Lauren Southern, I Thought I Was in Germany, Turkey, and her
1500820	1508020	infamous 2017 video, The Streets of Paris, both of which feature no interviews, no substantive
1508020	1514080	research, and nothing more than someone walking around with a camera gawking at things, completely
1514080	1517860	devoid of the speculative commentary found in the Germany video.
1517860	1522420	Southern's Paris video in particular is a shining example of meaningless footage.
1522420	1527460	Walking through Paris while gawking at the non-white people is not only not journalism,
1527460	1532500	I am struggling to describe it as anything other than racist.
1532500	1536500	What precisely is someone supposed to get out of this?
1536500	1541900	What's suggested in the video is that the face of Paris is changing, and the only real
1541900	1547140	change that this video demonstrates is that there are a larger number of faces that are
1547140	1549060	not white.
1549060	1552960	There is literally nothing else you can get from this video.
1552960	1557460	The description tries to provide cover by pointing out how no one was speaking French,
1557460	1561860	but since the audio is a music track, we have to take Southern's word on that, and being
1561860	1563980	bilingual hardly seems like a threat.
1563980	1568100	The point she raises about French braids is mystifying.
1568100	1571260	She could have also mentioned that no one was eating French toast.
1571260	1577100	Sources such as this one emphasize how uninterested Lauren Southern is in reporting anything.
1577100	1581820	She may be adopting the on-the-ground style you often see real journalists use, but instead
1581820	1585860	of reporting anything, she is using it to smuggle right-wing talking points under the
1585860	1587640	guise of journalism.
1587640	1591860	The videos are designed to hide facts and distort realities, so you'll buy into the
1591860	1600580	worldview Southern is pushing.
1600580	1604300	If you aren't familiar with right-wing talking points and narratives, videos pretending to
1604300	1607820	be reporting like Lauren Southern's might seem compelling.
1607820	1612140	Perhaps it may even seem like I'm projecting some right-wing stereotype on a woman who's
1612140	1614640	honestly trying her best to report the facts.
1614640	1618460	So to try to push back on that, I'm going to spend a bit of time looking at the ideology
1618460	1623400	that drives Southern, which she happily illustrates for us in a short book published in 2016.
1623400	1629260	It has the friendly title of Barbarians, how the baby boomers, immigration, and Islam screwed
1629260	1630820	my generation.
1630820	1636260	It's a mere 82 pages long, with one of the biggest fonts and margins I've ever seen
1636260	1637520	in such a tiny book.
1637520	1641800	If you got rid of the citations, it would be slightly under 20,000 words.
1641800	1646700	It's more like a long essay rather than a book, or maybe more accurately, a series of
1646700	1648800	very short essays.
1648800	1653900	Much of the book is populated with poorly sourced ideas, personal stories, and misreadings
1653900	1656420	of history, art, and current affairs.
1656420	1660560	I couldn't possibly detail everything she gets wrong, so I'll narrow it down to a few
1660560	1663380	points that describe the narrative in Southern's mind.
1663380	1668180	Towards the end, Southern offers four recommendations on how to save the West.
1668180	1673780	And they are building border walls, an immigration policy based on merit and national origin,
1673780	1678020	protecting free speech, and making people ashamed for needing welfare.
1678020	1682620	The welfare one has just a really shitty thing to do, but I want to focus in on the national
1682620	1685140	origin part of the second point.
1685140	1690700	Although Southern claims not to be a racist, points like this make me pause.
1690700	1693100	She also writes this.
1693100	1697660	Immigration policy in the West simply fails to be remotely meritocratic.
1697660	1701460	Immigrants are not let in to fill niches where our countries need help or to contribute in
1701460	1703300	some way to society.
1703300	1707300	It's even considered controversial in some circles to suggest that immigrants should
1707300	1709420	be able to pull their own weight.
1709420	1711260	All of this must be reversed.
1711260	1716120	In the US, a good start would be repealing the Immigration Act of 1965 so that things
1716120	1721340	like national origin can be factored into our calculus, and so that the limits of immigration
1721340	1724300	from other Western countries can be removed.
1724300	1728580	Everywhere else, the same sort of measures must be taken.
1728580	1733260	The first thing you'll notice is that no sources are cited for any of this.
1733260	1738940	While Southern does on occasion provide them, I counted 33 sources out of 48 footnotes
1738940	1739940	provided.
1739940	1744460	Every look at any Western nation's immigration process will show you the hoops foreign national
1744460	1747100	has to jump through in order to immigrate.
1747100	1752540	It often involves interviews, providing documentation for skills, and other requirements that demonstrate
1752540	1753540	merit.
1753540	1757180	And Lauren Southern completely contradicts herself when she talks about how national
1757180	1759900	origin should be factored into the calculation.
1759900	1764220	She isn't even subtle about when she says limits on Western countries should be removed.
1764220	1769100	She wants immigrants not coming from Western nations to be subject to greater selection
1769100	1770140	pressures.
1770140	1774700	If potential immigrants are being chosen based on their merit, what does their nationality
1774700	1776220	have to do with that?
1776220	1780860	If two doctors are applying to immigrate to Canada, one from Norway and the other from
1780860	1785660	Pakistan, and all things about them otherwise are equal, why would Lauren Southern want
1785660	1787540	to turn away the doctor from Pakistan?
1787540	1792420	Or at least, why does that Pakistani doctor have to face restrictions that the Norwegian
1792420	1793860	one wouldn't?
1793860	1797740	I won't pretend I'm the first person to notice Lauren Southern saying something about immigration
1797740	1801300	that, at the very least, sounds a little racist.
1801300	1806020	For a more comprehensive look at this, check out Sean's excellent video, The Great Replacement
1806020	1808820	Isn't Real, featuring Lauren Southern.
1808820	1812540	Another popular theme in Southern's commentary is an appeal to a traditional lifestyle for
1812540	1813540	women.
1813540	1819060	That is to say, women should dedicate themselves to raising children in order to be happier.
1819060	1823620	She often cites science she doesn't understand to produce opinion pieces that, instead of
1823620	1827860	engaging with scientific evidence, distort it to fit a right-wing narrative.
1827860	1833100	For a more thorough examination of this, I highly recommend another video by Sean titled,
1833100	1837060	What Every Girl Needs to Hear, a Response to Lauren Southern.
1837060	1841060	And after two shoutouts, I hope Sean sends me a nice check for putting him on the map
1841060	1842060	like this.
1842060	1843060	You're welcome.
1843060	1846660	I really only highlight these two ideologies that exist in Lauren Southern's commentary
1846660	1849460	to draw a connection to her pseudo-reporting.
1849460	1852700	Everything she does is in service to this right-wing narrative, and how it hearkens
1852700	1857900	back to a golden age, specifically the 1950s, as best I can narrow it down.
1857900	1862740	Her book specifically takes aim at Baby Boomers, who squandered the success of, as they're
1862740	1868340	labeled in the media, The Greatest Generation, that is, the generation that fought the Nazis
1868340	1873540	in World War II, which, I will admit, was pretty nice of them.
1873540	1878260	Southern is trying to pull the West back to the time before the Baby Boomers supposedly
1878260	1879900	ruined everything.
1879900	1884660	In the interests of charity, I'm not certain the Jim Crow laws, rampant sexism, and rampant
1884660	1890220	homophobia of the era enter into Lauren Southern's imagination when she says she and her fellow
1890220	1891220	travelers are,
1891220	1895980	We're longing for an age we've never lived in, and we're trying to recreate something
1895980	1899740	that we never grew up being taught or understood.
1899740	1905740	To be as generous as possible, Lauren Southern may not be a traditionalist hiding her secret
1905740	1911460	racism and sexism, but in the best-case scenario, she's a traditionalist who doesn't understand
1911460	1917140	the racism and sexism that were implicit parts of the era she longs to be a part of.
1917140	1921680	And her ignorance does not excuse the harm inherent in her message.
1921680	1925860	And that message is important to understand when it's being pushed to you through the
1925860	1928380	context of pseudo-journalism.
1928380	1929860	Are you a racist?
1929860	1933420	No, I'm not a racist, and the alt-right hates me.
1933420	1937340	They don't have any idea what they're talking about, these are just names that they throw
1937340	1938340	around.
1938340	1947340	Quite frankly, when I went to South Africa...
1947340	1951140	Now that we've taken a look at Lauren Southern's early attempts at journalism and the ideology
1951140	1955000	that her pseudo-reporting masks, I want to look at some of the more advanced techniques
1955000	1957140	she's recently employed.
1957140	1963020	The slickly-produced documentary titled Farmlands uses Southern's tactic of throwing her into
1963020	1967900	a new environment with little knowledge or research to advance a right-wing narrative.
1967900	1972020	Perhaps most disturbingly, though, she uses real subjects to advance this narrative and
1972020	1975100	push for this idea of an impending race war.
1975100	1979700	A full debunking of this film may be necessary at some point, but in the interest of keeping
1979700	1984900	this video under an hour, I'm just going to highlight a few specific points.
1984900	1990140	First off, Southern freely admits that she has no statistical proof for her claims.
1990140	1997220	About the most gruesome murders imaginable, with almost no statistical proof of their
1997220	1999020	existence.
1999020	2003900	By that, she means there are no hard numbers for how many white farmers are being killed.
2003900	2009580	But a lack of specific data doesn't always mean an absence of data, so she almost cleverly
2009580	2012360	finds a different source for her information.
2012360	2017900	She interviews several people from Blood Sisters Crime Scene Cleanup, an outfit that is responsible
2017900	2021700	for cleaning up various crime scenes across South Africa.
2021700	2026780	Southern is basing much of her claim on numbers she gets from CSC in this interview.
2026780	2030300	But they don't really provide any real numbers.
2030300	2034580	In fact, they will tell you that they don't have a full set of data.
2034580	2042020	Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm
2042020	2050540	or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9 percent.
2050540	2056820	The figures that I've just given you is, according to our statistics, government statistics will
2056820	2057820	differ.
2057820	2062220	I don't suppose you can tell us much about white others.
2062220	2070780	Well, we don't work closely with them because we don't do every scene, but their figures
2070780	2073580	are funnily a lot lower than ours.
2073580	2076560	I don't have a particular reason for that.
2076560	2082260	What this answer is actually evidence of is not that farm murders are going up, but that
2082260	2086700	the number of crime scenes CSC has been called into has gone up.
2086700	2091740	This could mean everything from CSC's market share expanding, or the number of murders
2091740	2093540	actually going up.
2093540	2097060	Not an open and shut statistic, it's vague.
2097060	2101040	If I were to hazard a guess, the reason CSC has been getting more calls is because their
2101040	2103260	business has been expanding.
2103260	2107940	They started their business in the mid-2000s and are currently franchising it, so more
2107940	2113420	people have been operating under the CSC banner and therefore covering more crime scenes.
2113420	2119300	There's also the success of the book written by the two sisters who founded the CSC, and
2119300	2122900	its reception in the media might also be leading to a few new jobs.
2122900	2124740	This stat needs more context.
2124740	2128500	Instead, Southern says this.
2128500	2135920	This was the first time on camera a qualified government associate had confirmed my worst
2135920	2137320	fears.
2137320	2145020	Not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers are much higher than we imagined.
2145020	2146780	Are they though?
2146780	2150260	Didn't Southern say there was no data to begin with?
2151260	2160100	So what are these government numbers that don't
2160100	2161100	seem accurate?
2161100	2165540	We're never told as the audience, but don't worry, I'll fill you in on this a little bit
2165540	2166540	later.
2166540	2170340	The questions as to why the CSC crews are getting more work are never really asked,
2170340	2174620	and we're only shown a few pieces that build this race war narrative that the film is advancing.
2174620	2179300	This is best revealed when the CSC reps are asked about the motivation of the murders.
2179300	2184140	How on earth can you expect them to be able to credibly answer that question?
2184140	2188580	These people aren't law enforcement investigating the murders, they are literally just people
2188580	2190780	who wipe the blood off the floor.
2190780	2202940	90% of the increase we found is due to unemployment, racial discrimination, and there's no hope.
2202940	2206740	If you don't start your own business in South Africa, where are you going to work?
2206740	2208460	There's no work.
2208460	2212740	Racial discrimination against who, if you don't mind me asking?
2212740	2214940	Yeah, I have to be careful.
2214940	2215940	Careful?
2215940	2218940	Yeah, well, I have to be a little bit careful.
2218940	2226300	We work very closely with government, and I spoke to Simon about it outside.
2226300	2231020	Racial discrimination against people.
2231020	2234300	What's suggested here, of course, is that they don't want to risk their government
2234300	2238460	contract by saying racial discrimination against white people is the cause for the
2238460	2240780	supposed increase in murders.
2240780	2245140	This right here is a perfect example of how the film provides just enough evidence to
2245140	2247140	let the audience fill in the gap.
2247140	2251100	But was there more evidence here that could have been provided to give a little more context
2251100	2252460	to the segment?
2252460	2256980	Something that maybe would have contradicted the narrative Southern and her crew are trying
2256980	2258300	to push?
2258300	2262060	During this interview we see some B-roll of Lauren Southern researching the farm murders
2262060	2263060	claim.
2263060	2265020	Hey, I know that website!
2265020	2269320	Southern claims she found evidence that these murders were racially based from the far corners
2269320	2270320	of the internet.
2270320	2274260	And by this far corner, I think she means the third result to pop up when you type in
2274260	2277060	South African farm murders into Google.
2277060	2281620	AfricaCheck.org is a website dedicated to thoroughly examining issues in Africa, and
2281620	2286580	as best I can tell, does a good job of looking at the issue of farm murders, explaining what
2286580	2288980	is and is not known about them.
2288980	2293860	The page Southern was looking at is an article titled, Fact Sheet, Statistics on Farm Attacks
2293860	2297960	and Murders in Essay, obviously being South Africa.
2297960	2303940	So does this website suggest that murders on farms in South Africa are based on race?
2303940	2307580	Southern should have scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page because, under the
2307580	2312740	section titled, Is There a Political Agenda Behind These Attacks?, you can see a breakdown
2312740	2318940	of the motivations of farm attacks as of 2001, where 52 attacks, or 2% of the total, were
2318940	2320780	motivated by race.
2320780	2325900	And keep in mind, these numbers only reflect attacks and not murders.
2325900	2330740	These are the only numbers on this page that discuss race as a motivating factor, and may
2330740	2336300	not even be reliable according to the 2003 National Operating Coordinating Committee.
2336300	2337300	Who are they?
2337300	2341060	They're the group responsible for this little bit of text here that was underneath the graph
2341060	2344620	that Southern was supposedly reading.
2344620	2349020	The 2003 Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks included that none of the statistics collected
2349020	2354240	between 1991 to 2001 were completely accurate and should be viewed and interpreted with
2354240	2355860	caution.
2355860	2360780	Looking through the AfricaCheck.org website, I couldn't find a single article that suggested
2360780	2363300	that these crimes were motivated by race.
2363300	2365500	Maybe Southern was looking somewhere else.
2365500	2368140	I'd be curious to know where.
2368140	2373260	And of course, journalists always cite their sources, which is exactly why the description
2373260	2376540	box has none.
2376540	2378540	But the murders are surely real, right?
2378540	2380900	The website can at least confirm that.
2380900	2385260	The stats on the page, which are the official government stats on murder I mentioned, were
2385260	2387740	right there for Lauren Southern to check the whole time.
2387740	2390980	If only she had scrolled a little bit further.
2390980	2394760	The stats on the page Southern was looking at show murder rates are rather flat for farmers
2394760	2399280	in South Africa, or according to police data, might be going down slightly.
2399280	2403920	But more importantly, AfricaCheck describes the data is impossible to calculate, not just
2403920	2408680	because murders may not be adequately reported, but because of how difficult it is to calculate
2408680	2411160	the number in farmers in South Africa.
2411160	2415520	Maybe this is what Southern meant when she said there weren't any real stats to consult.
2415520	2419220	So where did she get the idea that there was a problem in the first place?
2419220	2422680	It might have been useful to ask someone at crime scene cleaners how many murder scenes
2422680	2425760	they clean up in the air, and not just how much it's gone up by.
2425760	2429280	If the numbers were higher than what was reported by the police, you'd have some
2429280	2433280	actual evidence for your claim that the government is lying about the number of murders.
2433280	2434880	Imagine if someone did that, though.
2434880	2439080	If someone actually did some real journalism to check the claim out and see how many sites
2439080	2442280	CSC covered in a year that were murders, that'd be pretty good, right?
2442280	2444040	That'd be great journalism.
2444040	2445040	So I did it.
2445040	2449680	According to a portfolio published by CSC, on average, they clean up 33 murder sites
2449680	2450920	a year.
2450920	2455760	That's presumably all murders, since they don't specifically state farm murders.
2455760	2460280	The most recent number for annual farm deaths, according to the police of South Africa, is
2460280	2461280	74.
2461280	2465520	So the government's numbers are actually over twice as high.
2465520	2467360	So what did that guy say again?
2467360	2474800	Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm
2474800	2483680	or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9%.
2483680	2485440	He's not even talking about murders here.
2485440	2487160	He's talking about violent attacks.
2487160	2493480	So why does Lauren Southern say, not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers
2493480	2496040	are much higher than we imagined.
2496040	2500600	It's because she's trying to twist what he says into her narrative of farmer murder
2500600	2502200	rates going up.
2502200	2507080	In other words, she's distorting data to push forward this idea of an impending race
2507080	2508080	war.
2508080	2512640	A huge portion of this film is dedicated to interviewing people in dire living conditions
2512640	2515720	or people who have lost loved ones in violent crimes.
2515720	2520720	These are powerful stories and my heart goes out to people who have to live in really terrible
2520720	2521720	conditions.
2521720	2526240	These anecdotes are meant to suggest the overall message of the film that white people are
2526240	2528600	being wiped out across South Africa.
2528600	2533420	The stories in this film are presented in a way to push that idea forward and certain
2533420	2537560	details that may contradict that narrative are conveniently left out.
2537560	2541920	When a film's thesis is clearly about a supposed race war and then it just drops an interview
2541920	2546240	where a family member is crying their eyes out over the murder of a loved one, the audience
2546240	2550720	is left to assume that this is another piece of evidence that a race war is on its way.
2550720	2551720	Here's an example.
2551720	2557160	Janine Eichenfelt is interviewed about the murder of her father, Schlock Featherstone.
2557160	2562560	She recounts the gruesome details and understandably becomes emotional having to tell her story.
2562560	2566440	Her pain is important to acknowledge as a reminder of how a murder impacts not just
2566440	2568600	the victim but everyone around them.
2568600	2573520	And as a quick preface to everything I'm about to say, I genuinely feel awful for her
2573520	2575480	and she has my deepest sympathies.
2575480	2580800	I see no reason to think that she was in any way responsible for what Lauren Southern did
2580800	2582160	with this interview.
2582160	2587760	She is deserving of our sympathy rather than our scorn as someone who has lost someone
2587760	2593880	in such a horrible way and then had that loss exploited by a duplicitous filmmaker.
2593880	2598520	The murder of Featherstone actually fits the alleged purpose of this documentary looking
2598520	2602240	at various farm murders that happened across South Africa.
2602240	2607000	But does it fit Southern's narrative of black South Africans attacking white South African
2607000	2611900	farm owners in an attempt to right a perceived political injustice?
2611900	2615620	The actual facts surrounding this murder are not difficult to find online.
2615620	2620740	A quick google of the murderer's name, Winston Boyson, gives you the result of an appeal
2620740	2625540	that was made earlier this year and that appeal quite helpfully includes some of the details
2625540	2626620	of the murder.
2626620	2631700	The first important fact not mentioned in the film is that Boyson killed two people.
2631700	2635420	The first victim, Brenda Finnis, was Boyson's girlfriend at the time.
2635420	2639220	A violent interaction between the two left her dead of a stab wound.
2639220	2643700	The police were on the scene and attempted to arrest Boyson, but he managed to escape.
2643700	2647660	He spent several days on the run and made his way to Featherstone's farm, where Boyson
2647660	2649460	had worked in 2014.
2649460	2653420	Boyson went there in an unsuccessful effort to convince one of his former colleagues to
2653420	2655260	help him evade the police.
2655260	2660180	Featherstone was unaware of his presence, but before he departed the farm, Boyson entered
2660180	2662100	the house to steal a firearm.
2662100	2666420	When he tried to leave, he was discovered by Featherstone, and in response, Boyson
2666420	2667420	shot him.
2667420	2671180	Featherstone attempted to make his way to a phone to call for help, and as he was doing
2671180	2675340	that, Boyson shot him several more times, murdering him.
2675340	2679020	Afterwards, Boyson stole some food and Featherstone's vehicle.
2679020	2683300	He was later apprehended in the bush after fleeing from the vehicle when he saw some
2683300	2686340	lights that he assumed were law enforcement.
2686340	2688580	Those are the events according to the court document.
2688580	2693820	Now I have to ask, does this sound as though Featherstone's death was the product of
2693820	2695100	racial hatred?
2695100	2698860	Does it sound like race had anything at all to do with the murder?
2698860	2702980	Or perhaps this story was as simple as a man on the run from the law who murdered an innocent
2702980	2704180	bystander.
2704180	2708460	In what way does this event back up Southern's claim that white farmers are being attacked
2708460	2711700	by the black majority in South Africa for their land?
2711700	2716100	These details, which took seconds to find online, are omitted from the film.
2716100	2719340	Even the claim that Boyson got 15 years in prison is false.
2719340	2723580	He was sentenced to 15 years for the murder of Finis, a lifetime in prison for the murder
2723580	2727980	of Featherstone, and another 15 years for the theft, so the point about the government
2727980	2734540	trying to protect the murderer, as subtly suggested by the film, is also not true.
2734540	2739820	Of course, this appeal happened in February of 2018, and farmlands debuted in August
2739820	2741380	of 2018.
2741380	2746380	And it should be noted that this interview was certainly done before February of 2018.
2746380	2749820	It's possible Lauren Southern was too far in production to update the story with additional
2749820	2751460	narration or captioning.
2751460	2755300	But I don't personally believe this, as an update would have undercut the whole point
2755300	2758540	of the film and why this interview exists within it.
2758540	2762700	I also believe Southern was at least partially aware of the facts surrounding this case,
2762700	2764500	and she purposely chose to omit them.
2764500	2768100	Here's some additional context that was given to this interview when Southern originally
2768100	2772820	published it to her YouTube channel as a teaser for the documentary in January of 2018.
2773540	2778900	Janine and other families like hers have told me they are not convinced these brutal attacks
2778900	2785560	are just random acts, but that the South African government may very well be complicit in allowing
2785560	2791580	them to happen as they continue their political agenda to drive out white farmers and take
2791580	2792580	their land.
2792580	2797180	There is no evidence in the interview or any of the facts surrounding the case that this
2797180	2799940	murder had anything to do with government rhetoric.
2799940	2803260	So on what basis was she advancing this talking point?
2803260	2807980	What evidence did she have that this murder was motivated by racial tensions?
2807980	2812340	Southern removed this bit of commentary from the actual film, but the subtext remains and
2812340	2815880	it makes it a more subtle and deceptive film.
2815880	2820880	The message is the same, that the South African government is motivating its citizens with
2820880	2823740	its rhetoric to murder white farmers.
2823740	2828340	And there is evidence to suggest that Southern knew more details about this particular murder
2828340	2829780	than she might let on.
2829780	2834980	The original clip lets slip into crucial detail when the second victim, Brenda Finnis, is
2834980	2841980	mentioned in passing.
2841980	2845400	Why is this the only mention of a second murder victim?
2845400	2850340	It makes perfect sense for Eilhem Felt to want to focus on her father, but even she
2850340	2851780	mentioned the second victim.
2851780	2856740	I simply don't have enough charity in me to assume that Southern was such a poor interviewer
2856740	2860140	that she had no follow-up questions about a second murder.
2860140	2863860	What seems far more likely here is that she omitted the details so she could lie about
2863860	2865940	the reason Featherstone was murdered.
2865940	2870940	She used an innocent man's death to advance a racist narrative.
2870940	2875300	After the victim exploitation, Southern goes as far as saying that segregation might be
2875300	2878020	the only way to prevent a race war.
2878020	2884060	On and off camera, many people, both black and white, did suggest segregation as a potential
2884060	2886580	solution to this crisis.
2886580	2893180	And even more worrying is the growing number of people preparing for a race-based civil
2893180	2897300	war if another solution cannot be found.
2897300	2902500	And interviews members of Sweetlanders, a group that is preparing for just that thing.
2902500	2906840	And it's here where the race war narrative I kept mentioning really comes together.
2906840	2910540	And obviously, it's not something you would open the film up with.
2910540	2918380	It's something you have to slowly guide someone to by presenting bad stats and personal stories,
2918380	2922500	anecdotes that are horribly manipulated and misrepresented to advance this narrative.
2922500	2927380	So when you're finally here, at the end, where the race war thing comes up, you're
2927380	2930900	ready to believe it because you've been primed to believe it.
2930900	2936580	This bit of information is the poison pill this whole film was designed to pass to you.
2936580	2941820	One gets a strange response from Simon Roche where he gives vague rationalizations as to
2941820	2943680	why the race war is coming.
2943680	2947260	This is almost certainly covering for the real reason that the Sweetlanders' preparations
2947260	2951900	are based on prophecies from a guy's name, Steiner von Rensberg.
2951900	2955140	Another fact that conveniently gets left out of the film.
2955140	2959380	Instead of another digression about the many right-wing conspiracies that surround South
2959380	2964620	Africa, I highly recommend this excellent video, South Africa and the Far Right, part
2964620	2966380	one by Rational Disconnect.
2966380	2969820	He goes into the history of this race war narrative and how it's used by the Far Right
2969820	2974780	to advance a specific narrative that white people and black people can't get along.
2974780	2979780	He also debunks Lawrence Southern's film in about a minute, which makes me feel like
2979780	2983540	I'm being really inefficient here.
2983540	2985540	This is not reporting.
2985540	2989820	This is a careful distortion of facts used to advance a false dichotomy.
2989820	2994500	This film is utterly convinced that the black and white populations of South Africa simply
2994500	3001220	can't live together, and the reason for that lies with the anger of the black population.
3001220	3004340	In one of her most recent videos, Lawrence Southern declared that she would be leaving
3004340	3009700	the world of YouTube to focus on making larger documentary films, like Farmlands.
3009700	3013780	We can expect a highly polished production that's deeply deceptive and advances a hateful
3013780	3018340	narrative, one that exploits real victims and suffering and coops it to fit her narrative
3018340	3021380	of white people under attack by the non-white world.
3021380	3024580	These documentaries are not factual or honest.
3024580	3030380	Much like her earlier reporting, they are advancing a particular right-wing narrative.
3030380	3033940	After I finished recording and editing most of this video, Lawrence Southern announced
3033940	3038140	her newest documentary film project, Borderless.
3038140	3042620	And it more or less matches up exactly with what I thought it would be, specifically that
3042620	3047700	narrative of white people under attack by the non-white world.
3047700	3051780	Borderless once again sends her to Europe, where she'll probably conflate immigrants
3051780	3056580	and refugees, include scenes where she feels like she's in danger, and feature heavily
3056580	3063700	edited interviews that are anecdotes designed to make immigrants appear like evil threats.
3063700	3068180	Things she probably won't touch on are stats that show the positive impact of immigrants,
3068180	3074260	socially and economically, how European anti-immigrant sentiment often includes white immigrants,
3074260	3080740	and that Europe is not a homogenous culture that she so cheerfully describes as the West.
3080740	3085220	After she passes around the donation hat and lovers of pro-white people documentaries throw
3085220	3090100	in their money, she could produce something of value that critically engages with the
3090100	3091100	subject.
3091100	3095020	That would even be nice to see, I mean, I like surprises.
3095020	3096900	But I'm not holding my breath here.
