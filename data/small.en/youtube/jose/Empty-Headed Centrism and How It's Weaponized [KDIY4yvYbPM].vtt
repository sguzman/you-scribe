00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
I was working on a video a few weeks back defending Don Lemon from charges of racism.

00:05.800 --> 00:10.560
For those who missed that mini-outrage, Lemon said white men, particularly right-wing white

00:10.560 --> 00:16.320
men, were responsible for most of the terrorism in the United States, a verifiable fact.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.880
The backlash was predictable, calling him a racist, Nazi, etc.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.440
You know, that thing the left is always accused of, but is constantly heard from voices on

00:25.440 --> 00:26.440
the right?

00:26.440 --> 00:29.960
In making that video, I kept asking myself, how did I get here?

00:29.960 --> 00:35.160
As someone on the left, why am I defending a center-left journalist working for CNN?

00:35.160 --> 00:39.520
Have the lines of defense been pushed so far back that I'm arguing from the center now?

00:39.520 --> 00:53.000
It's time to push back against centrism a little, and the trap we're all stuck in.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.600
So I have to talk about a YouTuber named NuanceBro.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.280
You can tell he's a man of nuance, because in the recent U.S. midterm election, according

01:01.280 --> 01:06.280
to his shirt, instead of voting for a Democrat or a Republican, he voted for nuance.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.800
I don't think nuance picked up many seats, though.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.960
He claims to be making videos that look at both sides of an issue, and then uses facts

01:12.960 --> 01:14.960
and reason to figure out the truth.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.240
He has a few debunking videos where he takes on Black Lives Matter, gun control, and the

01:19.240 --> 01:24.160
pink tax, and he has commentary videos where he defends various Trump policies and attacks

01:24.160 --> 01:25.960
left-leaning media.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.160
On the other hand, he also criticized Candace Owens for denying global warming one time.

01:31.160 --> 01:35.120
So that's the sort of balance you see while glancing over his channel.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.840
Highlighting one example briefly, during the recent kerfuffle over CNN's Jim Acosta having

01:39.840 --> 01:44.200
his press credentials revoked, Acosta had bumped into a female aide working for the

01:44.200 --> 01:45.720
Trump White House.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.720
There was a very stupid uproar about this, and NuanceBro didn't want to get left out

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
of it.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.080
Like a good little centrist, he came down on both sides of the issue.

01:54.080 --> 01:59.560
He didn't fall into the obviously stupid line that karate master Jim Acosta had viciously

01:59.560 --> 02:04.240
chopped this young woman's arm, because, you know, there's a video that shows it's

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
clearly accidental.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.080
So I guess credit to NuanceBro for not bawling for one of the dumbest talking points I've

02:10.080 --> 02:13.520
seen in the last, well, only couple of weeks.

02:13.520 --> 02:38.320
There was another part to NuanceBro's take.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.640
Here's the clip he used to prove that.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.640
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.880
I wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
in the midterms.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.880
Here we go.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.160
Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.

02:55.160 --> 02:59.760
As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.920
It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.920
Thank you for telling me that.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
I appreciate it.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.680
Why did you why did you characterize it as such?

03:09.680 --> 03:12.320
Because I consider it an invasion.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.280
You and I have a difference of opinion.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.600
They're hundreds of miles away, though.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.640
They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
That's not an invasion.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.320
Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
You run CNN.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
All right.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.320
And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.560
If I may ask one of the questions, Mr. President, if I may ask one of the questions, are you

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
worried?

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
That's enough.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
That's enough.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
I was going to ask one of the other folks.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.560
That's enough.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
Pardon me, ma'am.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.560
Excuse me.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.560
That's enough.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.960
If I may ask on on the Russia investigation, are you concerned that that you may have

03:41.960 --> 03:45.800
I'm not concerned about anything with you may have a certain investigation because it's

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800
a hoax.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.800
Are you?

03:47.800 --> 03:48.800
That's enough.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.800
Put down the mic.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.360
Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?

03:53.360 --> 03:58.080
Acosta was pretty aggressive in his questioning, but ultimately he did sit down and let someone

03:58.080 --> 03:59.240
else have a turn.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.480
The whole exchange lasted two minutes.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.160
More important than Acosta's questioning was that Trump's answers were non-answers.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.040
When Acosta calls him out on it, Trump pivots to insulting him instead.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.680
The caravan was not an invasion.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.520
It's a it's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border

04:16.520 --> 04:17.520
with the U.S.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.520
Thank you for that.

04:18.520 --> 04:25.040
And why did you why did you characterize it as such as I consider it an invasion?

04:25.040 --> 04:26.440
You and I have a difference of opinion.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.760
Do you think that saying we have a difference of opinion on what an invasion is is a bullshit

04:32.760 --> 04:33.760
answer.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.520
And both Trump and Acosta know it.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.920
So Acosta pressed him on it, which is what journalists are supposed to do.

04:40.920 --> 04:46.600
And speaking of rudeness, during that two minutes, Trump said that here we go, that

04:46.600 --> 04:51.000
well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this could end.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Why?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.880
Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.

04:53.880 --> 05:00.560
You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you

05:00.560 --> 05:01.680
working for them.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.040
You are a rude, terrible person.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.000
You shouldn't be working for CNN.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.200
Now, whose behavior is unsuited to being at that press conference?

05:10.200 --> 05:14.700
Nuance Bro also used some clips of Acosta shouting out questions at press events and

05:14.700 --> 05:19.800
presents this idea that the press should sit quietly, wait their turn and be polite as

05:19.800 --> 05:21.800
possible to the president.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.600
When the president is lying to your face, calling you names and saying you're the enemy

05:26.600 --> 05:31.700
of the people, I think the days of sitting politely and waiting for your turn are over.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.620
This play to civility has been keeping the press docile for years and it's nice to

05:35.620 --> 05:37.060
see that changing.

05:37.060 --> 05:41.220
Nuance Bro's appeal to that is an appeal to a servile press that behaves in obedience

05:41.220 --> 05:43.620
to the power structures in the government.

05:43.620 --> 05:48.520
In other words, his appeal to nuance is an inherently right-wing stance.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.420
But here I am again, defending CNN, from the supposed center no less.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.420
How does this keep happening?

05:55.420 --> 05:59.880
We need to talk about centrism, both the real and fake kind.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.920
Before discussing political theory, I want to offer this disclaimer.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.840
I am not an expert on the subject.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.480
Although this comes from a basic understanding of political theory obtained from some light

06:08.480 --> 06:19.200
reading and the forethought to ignore especially stupid commentators such asâ€¦

06:19.200 --> 06:21.480
This is a graph of the left-right spectrum.

06:21.480 --> 06:26.040
I know the two-dimensional graph is more popular nowadays, but for the purposes of this video

06:26.040 --> 06:28.480
I want to focus on this one-dimensional one.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.600
Since it was made by me, it is, of course, absolutely accurate in all ways without any

06:32.600 --> 06:35.800
trace of flaw or imperfection.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.760
People find themselves across plenty of different points on the spectrum determined by what

06:39.760 --> 06:41.720
they believe on a variety of issues.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.000
A centrist would exist in this middle area.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.180
To land here, they would need to have a mix of right and left opinions that average out

06:48.180 --> 06:49.280
to the middle ground.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.000
Now before going on, I should mention this video isn't about people who happen to fall

06:53.000 --> 06:55.160
into this region incidentally.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.520
If that's where you are politically, you're probably wrong on a few issues, probably on

06:59.520 --> 07:01.840
the right, but that's not what this video is about.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.800
This video is about people who choose to be in the center.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.920
People who make a purposeful effort to ensure that they balance both sides of a political

07:08.920 --> 07:11.320
equation with a sense of fairness.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.360
These are the centrists who are being played.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.960
Now let's make this image more complicated by talking about the Overton window.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.040
And no, I'm not talking about the shitty novel Glenn Beck wrote about two people who

07:23.040 --> 07:26.000
start a make-out session by discussing the flat tax.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.800
This book exists, do not read it.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.640
The Overton window, a political science tool created by Joseph P. Overton, describes the

07:33.640 --> 07:36.360
range of permissible political thought within a system.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.180
It helps to think of the left-right spectrum as a much longer continuum than it is typically

07:41.180 --> 07:42.180
presented as.

07:42.180 --> 07:47.080
If we zoom out, the right and left we see in our world today can be understood more

07:47.080 --> 07:51.440
broadly in the context of history, where we can move much further in either direction.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.160
And generally speaking, throughout most of recent history, we've been moving to the

07:55.160 --> 07:56.160
left.

07:56.160 --> 08:01.600
If the Overton window is the current range of typical political discourse, it moves along

08:01.600 --> 08:04.400
the spectrum, to the left or right.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.160
So when we talk about taking a position in the center, it's a center that's defined

08:08.160 --> 08:10.200
by the time and place you live in.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.560
In other words, you're taking a position in the center of the Overton window.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.480
But what happens when that window starts to move?

08:17.480 --> 08:22.440
The original Overton window argued that politicians set the parameters for discourse, so when

08:22.440 --> 08:27.640
Democrats tilt to the right to appeal to centrists, and Republicans go so far right they're appealing

08:27.640 --> 08:31.040
to fascists, the window itself shifts to the right.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.400
With the rise of the Tea Party in the aughts, to the embrace of nationalism in Donald Trump

08:35.400 --> 08:39.840
this year, it's plain to see that right-wing ideology is on the ascent in the United States

08:39.840 --> 08:45.240
within political discourse, albeit perhaps not in actual public opinion.

08:45.240 --> 08:50.480
Here on YouTube, we've seen a surge in debates about race realism, ethno-states, anti-feminism,

08:50.480 --> 08:55.320
and other toxic ideas, many of these ideas having long been consigned to the dustbin

08:55.320 --> 08:56.520
of history.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.720
But now they're making a comeback, broadening the conversation and trying to reintroduce

09:00.720 --> 09:03.920
the ideas into our political discourse.

09:03.920 --> 09:08.520
This alteration of our political discourse can stretch or outright push the Overton window

09:08.520 --> 09:10.080
further right.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.840
For those of us on the left, instead of debating more interesting topics or having to fight

09:14.840 --> 09:19.360
for the protections of a free press from a president who doesn't like being asked

09:19.360 --> 09:24.200
tough questions, but where does this leave the centrist?

09:24.200 --> 09:28.000
Anyone who genuinely fell into the center should be starting to feel a bit more like

09:28.000 --> 09:29.320
they're on the left.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.840
Some of the ideals you claim to profess are currently under attack from the right, which

09:33.840 --> 09:38.560
still has considerable power in the US government and, to be honest, a lot of governments around

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
the world right now.

09:39.560 --> 09:44.320
But the committed centrist, who sees virtue in always taking the middle ground, they find

09:44.320 --> 09:48.600
themselves being dragged along with the window, staying committed to seeing the virtue in

09:48.600 --> 09:53.400
both sides, even if that means moving along with a side that is now becoming increasingly

09:53.400 --> 09:58.780
hostile towards the values that this committed centrist supposedly held.

09:58.780 --> 10:04.120
Their commitment lies in appearing thoughtful, weighing both sides of a situation.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.640
The Acosta example is great.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.080
The right to a free press is in the very text of the Constitution, and freedom of speech

10:11.080 --> 10:15.360
is something we have heard about endlessly from these committed centrists.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.880
But now it's being abandoned, all in an appeal to remaining a committed centrist and

10:19.880 --> 10:24.120
trying to give credence to calls for civility from the Trump White House.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.040
In Nuance Bro's case, he's supporting kicking journalists out of the press bowl because

10:28.040 --> 10:32.560
they ask a few too many questions in a way that he doesn't consider respectful.

10:32.560 --> 10:36.380
This is how the right is playing centrists, and dragging them further to the right under

10:36.380 --> 10:40.360
the guise of remaining even-handed.

10:40.360 --> 10:44.640
And while I finished really quickly with this one, so while you're still here, why not

10:44.640 --> 10:49.800
