4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,040
In 2016, conservative commentator and guy who will absolutely not go to any gay barbecues,

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,240
Ben Shapiro decided he would take a break from penning an endless series of books about how to

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,040
own the left with facts and logic, and decided to try his hand at writing some fiction.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,520
The title of his first original novel is True Allegiance. This is not a good book.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,720
Do not buy or read it. And now with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get started.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,760
The first thing that a person sees when opening up this book is a terrific cell phone. The very

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,560
first page includes praise for the book, including this quote from Salon. Meet our new Ayn Rand.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,320
Of course, the full quote actually reads, Meet our new Ayn Rand. Ben Shapiro's hand-fisted

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,320
propaganda fiction is even worse than you guessed. But it's actually even worse than that. Even though

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
the book calls it praise for true allegiance, this article was published in 2015, a year before True

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,120
Allegiance was released. The author was actually taking a shot at Ben Shapiro's short story

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,640
collection titled What's Fair that was published digitally that year. The rest of the accolades

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,400
come from conservative fixtures and a few creative types. Here's a brief sample. It's prophetic.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,320
Just a little too real for comfort. Is it really fictional? Yes to that last one. That's how

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,480
novels work. But to address the other comments, the opening pages of this book are trying very

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,320
hard to convince us that this book describes a plausible depiction of the real world. I want

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,640
you to think about that as we go through its plot. This is a tough book to read. Particularly

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
in public, you have to hold it in just such a way that no one can tell you're reading a book by Ben

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Shapiro. The actual prose is a lot easier to grasp. The novel is split into three parts,

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
with chapters divided amongst five central characters, although Ben breaks this rule drifting

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
to other characters all the time. The main character is Brett Hawthorne. And yes, I do need

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,160
to say it like that. Brett Hawthorne is the youngest general in US history at 41. He spends

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,560
most of this novel murdering terrorists and getting angry at those damn liberals who would

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,040
rather send them winter coats. Our next major character is President Mark Prescott. He's a

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,680
president obsessed with how he's perceived in the media, and he's trying to appease the American

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,440
population by bringing the troops back home and going massively into debt to China to pay for work

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,400
programs. He's generally a cowardly guy. He's also a thinly veiled combination of Barack Obama

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,320
and Bill Clinton. Our next major character is Ellen Hawthorne, Brett's wife. Ellen does

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,240
something working for the governor of Texas. I think she's an aide for him. It's really hard

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,200
to tell because she goes from photographing dead children at the border to leading the National

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,800
Guard, and then she's suddenly like a proxy for the governor. I really don't know what her

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,520
specific title is. She just does whatever the plot needs her to do. Next we've got Soledad Ramirez.

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,640
She runs a ranch that falls on hard times when the EPA shuts down access to a river to protect

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,680
a threatened species. It prevents her from watering her cattle and destroys her ranch,

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,680
so she resorts to terrorism. This is an obvious nod to the Cliven Bundy story of a few years back

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
when ranchers took over a government building because he wanted to keep using land stolen from

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,560
the government. Our last character is, brace yourself for this one, Levon Williams, a drug dealer

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,680
from Detroit who hustles his way into a civil rights movement that's a stand-in for Black Lives

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,400
Matter. If there's one character who will just drive you up a wall with the naked racism of it,

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,480
it's Levon, so look forward to that. And so there we have our principal cast, three protagonists

44
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,480
and two antagonists. The book opens with a prologue that takes us into the story in Media Reyes.

45
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
It's a scene from further along in the story where the George Washington Bridge is collapsing

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
after a terrorist bombing. Leaving that aside from now, let's go to the first chapter where

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
Brett Hothorn is stationed in Afghanistan, which is quickly falling into the hands of the Taliban

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
after the feckless left-wing President Prescott decided to pull out the majority of the troops.

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,240
As Kabul crumbles around him, we learn about Brett's backstory. We find out he has a friend

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,720
named Derek who taught him how to get out of scraps using his wits instead of fighting.

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Fun fact about the rest of this book, every scrap Brett gets into,

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
he escapes by beating up or murdering the other person. We don't hear from his buddy Derek,

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,000
who the book is quick to tell us is his black friend, until much later on when we find out

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
he grew up to become a plot device. Brett and Ellen have a special way of saying goodbye to one

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,360
another. Take a bullet for you babe. I shuddered every time I had to read that.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Back in the United States we meet President Prescott. He's recently come up with a new

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,120
governmental program called the Work Freedom Program to get Americans working again. Here's

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
a fun fact that I'm sure is just a coincidence. One of the campaign slogans the Nazis used in the

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,200
1930s was work, freedom, and bread. The phrase comes up from a 19th century German novel,

60
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,600
Arbeit Mach Frei. Where criminals attained freedom through work, it was also the phrase

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,760
emblazoned on the gates to concentration camps. I think Ben is trying to suggest something here

62
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,560
by having the president create a Work Freedom Program. As Prescott delivers his speech we meet

63
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,240
Soledad, who has decided to take the impending doom of her ranch into her own hands when she

64
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,440
hires someone to bomb a U.S. federal building. The woman who bombed an office belonging to the

65
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,720
U.S. government is a hero, but the Taliban soldiers who bombed the U.S. embassy in Kabul

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,720
two chapters ago are villains. It's strange to see a book use such frightening morality that

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,080
justifies actions on the basis of the one performing them, but here we are. Soledad,

68
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,640
captive in her ranch, is surrounded by law enforcement who would easily arrest this

69
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,880
one 50-something-year-old lady except that there are dozens of biker ranchers surrounding them,

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
ready to die for Soledad. I guess they're ready to just go to war with the cops, okay.

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Next we go to Detroit to meet Levon, who's got a fancy crack operation because Ben's knowledge of

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,520
black culture is from movies from the 1970s and 80s. Levon meets Jim Crawford, a civil rights

73
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,640
leader who takes Levon under his wing after Levon poorly quotes Hamlet. Jim responds,

74
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,760
quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet. Ben thinks that's what black people talk like.

75
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,760
Then, in the same chapter, we cut away to a new character, Officer Ricky O'Sullivan,

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,600
who is confronted by a young boy named Kendrick Malone late at night. Apparently, this boy was

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,760
just wandering around the streets of Detroit in the middle of the night. I can't describe the

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,960
madness of this scene, so let me just read some of it. As a bit of context, O'Sullivan thinks

79
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,280
Kendrick has a gun concealed in his pants, but at this point he can't see it.

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,000
Fuck you, honky. The kid shot back. Get the fuck out of my neighborhood. Then he laughed,

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,840
a cute kid's laugh. O'Sullivan looked for sympathy behind those eyes. Found none.

82
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh shit, O'Sullivan thought. Then he said, hands up, right now. It goes on like this for a little

83
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,280
while, but later on the scene. You go home, white boy, said the kid. His hand moved lower.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,240
Suddenly, O'Sullivan's head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a preternatural energy.

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,440
He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn't going to get shot in the corner of Iowa

86
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,920
and Van Dyke outside a shitty convenience store and in a shitty town by some eight-year-old,

87
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,680
bleed out in the gutter of some city the world left behind. He had a life too. The gun felt alive

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,440
in his hand. The gun was life. Yeah, that's right. The kid is eight. As you might have guessed,

89
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,120
this ends with the cop murdering the child. And after he realizes he just shot a child who was

90
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,360
holding a toy gun, not a real one, we get this line. When he looked up, he saw them coming.

91
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,200
Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit coming out of the darkness, congregating. He could feel

92
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,600
their eyes. Soledad's chapter also ended with people surrounding law enforcement, but in that

93
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,120
case, it was the heroic biker ranchers surrounding the cruel cops who were trying to arrest this

94
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,400
harmless woman who bombed a government building. In this chapter, it's a bunch of scary black

95
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,120
people surrounding this innocent cop whose only crime was murdering an eight-year-old.

96
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,920
I would almost think that this symmetry was intentional. I'm not sure Ben is that clever,

97
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,800
unless he was trying to expose his ridiculous bias here. This is Ben's way of showing us who

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,280
the good people are and who the bad people are. It underscores what I mentioned earlier. Their

99
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,240
actions aren't material. It's their identity that will inform who we should consider a protagonist

100
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,240
and who we should consider an antagonist. And next, we finally meet Brett's wife, Ellen. The

101
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,320
chapter we meet her in is boring, but it establishes that she works for Governor

102
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,600
Bubba Davis of Texas and that there are drug dealers arriving in Texas by helicopter and

103
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,800
they murder one of Ellen's friends. And this plot point doesn't have any lasting ramifications

104
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,080
aside from letting us know that the border is soft and under threat by Mexico. I mean,

105
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,880
drug dealers, right? It's drug dealers who are coming across the border, sure.

106
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,720
Ben is cramming a lot of topics into this story. I'd say way too many for 266 pages,

107
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,440
but who am I to disagree with the cool kid's philosopher? Back in Afghanistan, Brett Hawthorne

108
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,840
finds out that the US has been betrayed by the US ambassador to Afghanistan. Apparently,

109
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,720
this guy was a big donor to the Prescott campaign and he was rewarded with becoming

110
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,680
ambassador to Afghanistan. Honestly, that sounds more like a punishment than anything else.

111
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
Maybe this is why he betrayed America. We never really get an answer to the question of why he

112
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,360
betrayed America. The plot point is pretty much dropped after this revelation. It's a brief

113
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,040
scene where Brett opens the ambassador's briefcase, finding a map with two sets of coordinates,

114
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,480
one set in Iran and one set in Iraq. And from there, he somehow figures out the ambassador

115
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,760
sold Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction to Iran. I'm not sure how I figured this one out.

116
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,400
He just kind of did. Ben also helpfully rewrote history by giving Saddam Hussein nuclear weapons

117
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,960
he never had. I don't know why he couldn't just pretend it was chemical weapons that were never

118
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,360
found, but Saddam had nukes in this story. Whatever. After that, Brett gets captured

119
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,040
by some terrorists. Governor Bubba Davis gets a lengthy introduction. We find out that the

120
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,080
governor was once a big player in the oil industry and then he ran for office when he found out the

121
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,440
Environmental Protection Agency was threatening the production of oil. It's amazing how a rich

122
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
oil tycoon running for office to protect his own business is presented as some kind of hero in this

123
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,880
book. It seems like there's a problem with the system if a rich person can afford to run for

124
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,080
office when their money is at threat. Here's a passage from the book describing Bubba's campaign.

125
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,600
In his opening campaign speech, he named the three top environmental officers in the state and read

126
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,400
off how much they'd received from lobbyists from the environmentalists and how much those

127
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,720
environmental groups received from global competitors like the Saudi government.

128
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,440
Why would Saudi Arabia, which makes its money off of oil, want to finance people

129
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,560
protested against oil? Or these environmentalists specifically against American oil? Typically,

130
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,880
they argue for green energy and getting off oil entirely. It doesn't make sense. Even when Ben

131
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,160
is writing fiction, his conspiracy theories don't seem believable. Also, this scene of an angry Bubba

132
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,480
reminded me of something. Well, go fuck yourself then, he sputtered slamming the phone down on his

133
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,320
carefully crafted maple desk. He looked up. Oh, hey Ellen, glad you're back. I did not hit her.

134
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,200
It's not true. It's bullshit. I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi Mark. Back with Soledad,

135
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,800
she's eventually spirited away from her ranch by Aiden Foster, formerly in law enforcement. Aiden

136
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,640
just couldn't stomach being on that side anymore. And oh god, here we go back and leave on story.

137
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,000
We find out that the recently murdered eight-year-old Kendrick was actually sent there by

138
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Levon and Jim so they could manufacture a story about the cops shooting a kid. Yeah,

139
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,720
that's really how it happened. Ben has given us the most ghoulish black activists I've seen in

140
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,680
a book in a very long time. A large group of, as the book puts it, mostly young black men

141
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,040
start protesting. Levon, who is apparently a master of manipulating the media, tricks them

142
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
into covering the story from the angle that the shooting of an eight-year-old kid is wrong.

143
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm not sure you need to trick the media into believing that a child getting shot by a cop is

144
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
a bad thing, but that's how this novel frames it. Ben introduces a new character who gets a focal

145
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,360
point chapter just for this one time only. He's a terrorist from the Middle East and you better

146
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,600
believe his name is Muhammad. In Muhammad's story, we also meet Ibrahim Ashami, a bin Laden-like

147
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,600
figure who, in spite of being a sloughest terrorist, is somehow being supported by Iran.

148
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,960
Considering how much ISIS and Iran are at odds with one another, this is a stretch. It's supposed to

149
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,760
be showing readers that theocratic Muslims will put aside their differences when it comes to

150
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,800
fighting against America. This reads into a broader paranoia about Muslims, that they will

151
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,400
one day create a universal alliance and start attacking the West. It's a grotesque caricature

152
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,920
of Muslims and Islam in general, and it's also exactly what Osama bin Laden was trying to do on

153
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,200
9-11. By having the US respond violently in the Middle East, he was hoping all Muslims would unite

154
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,160
together and team up to fight America. And 18 years later, it's pretty obvious that he failed.

155
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,600
We also get this line, where Muhammad is sitting in a cafe in Tehran and getting very frustrated.

156
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,800
He was getting sick of listening to the Western-style, sinful music blasting over the speakers.

157
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,200
What, he asked himself, does it mean to hit me baby one more time?

158
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,200
So I guess in Iran, music is over 20 years out of date, and pretty neat that they, I guess,

159
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,840
can play American music right there in public. Muhammad picks up a nuke from a Russian guy,

160
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,920
which is weird because I thought it was the American ambassador to Afghanistan who was

161
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,280
hooking them up with Saddam Hussein's nukes, unless this ambassador was also working for Russia.

162
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,680
It's never really explained because Russia's involvement and the ambassador, all this stuff,

163
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,160
is just sort of forgotten about. Brett is in the hands of Ashami, and we get a terrible

164
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,800
comeback line when Brett, after hearing America get talk-town to by Ashami, says,

165
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,240
we live for something. We live to kill bastards like you.

166
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,320
Most of Brett's lines read like this one. While captive, Brett sees a landmark through an open

167
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,080
window and somehow figures out not only is he in Tehran, but that he must be at the same coordinates

168
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,320
on the map he found in the briefcase. I don't know how he puts that one together. Brett is

169
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,960
filmed in a hostage video, and he sends a message back to America by blinking in Morse code.

170
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,480
This was first done in 1966 by Jeremiah Denton when he spelled out torture while describing his

171
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,720
captivity in Vietnam. Ben even describes it in this book. While Denton only blinked out torture,

172
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,640
Brett manages to blink out Airstrike Now, 514231 356961.

173
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,080
Somehow the terrorists don't notice one of the most famous examples of an American sending a

174
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,320
secret message back home, or that he's blinking really weirdly for three minutes.

175
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,440
Also, those coordinates are in the middle of Tehran, so to kill Ashami, Brett is gasking

176
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,800
the president to launch an airstrike on the capital city of Iran. This would start a war

177
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,920
killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, but in Brett's mind that's worth it to

178
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,280
get one terrorist. Because Prescott isn't a complete maniac, he decides to send in a special

179
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,560
forces team instead. Except he waited four days, letting Ashami slip through their fingers,

180
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,800
and Brett apparently didn't need that team to save him anyway because even though he's got a

181
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,440
broken arm and he's been awake for two days straight, he's able to murder both of his guards

182
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
and escape. And on the way out, he saves the team that had come to rescue him, because the building

183
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,560
has been set up to explode, and he just sort of hauls them out of there. I'm not sure why the

184
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,280
building exploded, or why there were only two guards though. The terrorists can't afford recruits,

185
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,240
but they can afford extra bombs for all their buildings. Brett knows Mohammed is heading to

186
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,560
America for another attack. He doesn't tell the president because he thinks he's a giant wimp,

187
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,200
so he decides to solve this problem alone. In the wake of all these events, we finally get the

188
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,400
bombing of the George Washington Bridge from way back in the prologue. Back in Texas, Governor

189
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,800
Davis is using the National Guard to patrol the border, which is, from the book's perspective,

190
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,880
working really nicely by turning the southern part of Texas into a police state. It's a bit

191
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
frightening how often this book talks about how nice it is to have armed military personnel

192
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,040
everywhere. Since the president hates America, he's annoyed by safety at the border. But Baba

193
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:47,040
doesn't care. He's just a Texas badass. Ben loves his characters. In Detroit, Levon is unveiling his

194
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,320
master plan to get the city to bow to the will of his angry black man mob so he can start making

195
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,920
reforms to the police system. He wants an all-black police force, and this apparently means they'll

196
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,560
have to have lower education standards and allow in more criminals. Gee, I wonder what Ben is saying

197
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,760
about the black community here. We're getting a caricature of a civil rights leader in the making,

198
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,800
and it's being used to make a broader point about the black community. It's not the legacy of racism

199
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,720
that's held them back, but the evil people who take advantage of the community's

200
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,880
rage and loose moral character. They seem like the violent and angry community easily led astray by

201
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,200
the worst members inside of it. Unless you doubt his expertise, Ben has intimate knowledge of the

202
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,120
black community. Remember this line from earlier on? Quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet.

203
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Thanks to a Republican district attorney, the officer who shot the child won't be charged,

204
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,320
and people are getting angrier. Back in the US, Brett is trying to track down Muhammad,

205
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,640
and we get a cringy scene where Ben Shapiro reveals he doesn't understand what racial

206
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
profiling is. In this scene, a Port Authority security guy is refusing to help Brett racial

207
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,280
profile records of people entering the US. Look, Brett burst out, losing his patience.

208
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,800
I don't give a rat's ass at this point whether it's racial profiling or not. Maybe you're right,

209
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,160
maybe Muhammad is a light-skinned Norwegian woman or a Cherokee elder, or maybe he's a Persian or

210
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,280
Arabic-looking son of a bitch who hangs out with other Persian or Arabic-looking sons of bitches

211
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,040
who look like Ibrahim Ashami. If I end up being wrong and he looks like Helen Mirren, feel free

212
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,800
to tell the New York Times editorial board about it. At this point in the story, Brett has a physical

213
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,000
description of Muhammad. In an earlier scene, he describes him. He's about 5'9", 140", skinny,

214
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,280
maybe 17 years old, blue eyes, angular face, sharp, big nose. So if he knows he's looking

215
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,480
for an Arabic guy and has such a specific description, how is that racial profiling?

216
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,040
Racial profiling is questioning people on the basis of their race, not targeting a specific

217
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,000
person whose ethnicity you know and who you have reason to believe will commit a crime.

218
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,800
Maybe Brett is worried about a fake name, but looking up an Arabic man that he has already

219
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,760
seen makes perfect sense. It's the difference between stopping someone on the street because

220
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,480
they look like someone who is trying to commit a crime and stopping someone on the street because

221
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,040
they belong to a certain ethnic group that you just happen to believe commits crimes.

222
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,200
You have a crime which you have evidence is going to occur versus an imagined crime that you think

223
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,920
might occur because that racial group is always responsible for crimes. You see the difference

224
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,640
now. Ben, I suspect, doesn't. We also finally get to hear from Brett's best friend Derek. Remember

225
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,920
him? Well, he's not just your token good black guy, he's also your token Muslim because he goes

226
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,920
by Hassan Abdul. And what makes him a good Muslim, you ask? Well, he infiltrates mosques and informs

227
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,560
on other Muslims to the government. His role in this book is to hand off some information to Brett

228
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,040
and then get murdered because he's just a plot device, not a character. Bubba Davis sends Ellen

229
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,520
to parlay with the president as Prescott demands the National Guard be taken from the border to

230
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,400
help the cleanup in New York City after the bridge was bombed. On Soledad's side of things, we find

231
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,240
out that her new right-hand man, Aidan, is childhood friends with Ricky O'Sullivan, the cop who shot the

232
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,040
eight-year-old black child. So now the threads are coming together as Soledad's team decides to head

233
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,400
to Detroit to rescue Ricky. Their plan is kind of weird. They're going to have the biker ranchers

234
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,080
drive into the middle of the angry mob, which has congregated outside the prison Ricky is currently

235
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,520
staying in. The biker ranchers will start a fight and as things turn violent they'll sneak Ricky out

236
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,000
in the confusion. While this is going on, Levon has Jim, his civil rights mentor, murdered, leaving

237
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,920
Levon in control of the movement. Remember Ashami, the terrorist who's apparently the mastermind

238
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,920
behind all these attacks? You might as well forget about him because we found a new Muslim leader who

239
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,800
will be the focus for the rest of this book. Muhammad and his nuke have hooked up with an

240
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,600
imam named Omari, who runs a major mosque in the US. Omari has close ties to the president because

241
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,520
of course the left-wing president is unknowingly friends with a terrorist. The president is bending

242
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,320
to all of Levon's requests, like letting him influence the police department, not just in

243
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,280
Detroit, but eventually in cities across the US. And now I'm just going to skip ahead to the end of

244
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,400
Levon's story here because from this point on nothing really happens. He becomes more powerful

245
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,120
and he gets everything he wants because the president is afraid of being called a racist.

246
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll have more to say about Levon later on. Soledad is finding more people deserting her

247
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,640
terrorist cell and soon the only ones left are her, Aiden, and Officer Ricky. The last biker to

248
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,280
leave them is a guy named Ezekiel, who then helpfully lets us know is black and this guy betrays

249
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,520
them. He's secretly been working with the US government and he gives a scarf with a tracking

250
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,440
device implanted on it to Soledad. It's also strange that he's the only biker whose race is

251
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,840
explicitly mentioned, just a detail I noticed. Soledad gives that bugged scarf to Aiden and it's

252
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,000
in his hands when the president, you know, the feckless coward who would have tea with a terrorist

253
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,680
decides to order a drone strike on American soil. Personally I think it would be easier to just

254
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,760
arrest three people who are driving around on motorcycles but I guess the drone is, uh,

255
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,360
I don't know, doesn't make sense. Since Aiden is the one holding the tracking device,

256
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,080
the operation is botched and it's Aiden who's killed when Soledad was originally the main

257
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,800
target. This brutal murder hardens Soledad, so much so that she's decided she needs to assassinate

258
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,560
the president. She's still supposed to be one of the heroes by the way. Back with Brett. He's now

259
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,520
running around with the evidence from his now dead best friend that Omari is working with

260
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,040
Muhammad and they secretly are going to plan some sort of terrorist attack in New York City.

261
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,080
All while Brett is trying to stay one step ahead of the president's goons. I guess the president

262
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,920
wouldn't want to know about an impending terror attack because he's friends with the guy

263
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,960
perpetrating it. Ellen arrives in New York trying to find her husband and we learn that Muhammad

264
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,840
wasn't in New York to bomb the George Washington Bridge. He's actually part of a second bombing

265
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,960
plot, this one to detonate a nuke inside of New York City. From what I can gather, the plan

266
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,600
was to set off one large bomb in New York City on the George Washington Bridge. Then the president

267
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,000
would call back the military from Afghanistan to help with the cleanup and then with all that

268
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,760
military personnel concentrated they would detonate a second bomb to kill everyone. In this case the

269
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,800
bomb would be a nuke. Generally speaking I think detonating a nuclear weapon inside of New York City

270
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,680
is going to be a knockout punch no matter what comes before it or how much military may or may

271
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,640
not be inside there. But I'm not the terrorist mastermind in a pen Shapiro novel so what do I

272
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,760
know? Amari is now the guy who's detonating the nuke and his plan is to do so during the president's

273
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,520
big speech in New York City where he's pushing his new work freedom program. Brett mindlessly

274
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,480
wanders through the crowd during the president's speech when he bumps into Soledad. He notices her

275
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,600
arm in her purse in a way that can only be understood as her secretly holding onto a gun.

276
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm not kidding here's how Ben describes that in the book. He'd seen that arm angle before.

277
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,760
He knew what a person looked like before they pulled a gun from concealment. He could feel

278
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,560
the threat before he even knew he felt it. He could feel it before he felt it. That's just

279
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,960
ah that's good writing isn't it? Brett grabs Soledad. The gun goes off not shooting anyone and

280
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,480
Brett is the one who's tackled by the president's goon as Soledad just melts into the crowd. Brett

281
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,160
is placed under arrest and in that commotion Amari decided not to detonate the nuke. I'm not really

282
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,480
sure why he waited but the president decides to fly away with his inner circle that includes

283
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,320
Amari and Ellen who he's decided is now a hostage to use against Governor Bubba. As they're in the

284
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,440
air president Prescott decides to circle over New York City a few times for a pafoto op. Seizing on

285
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,800
this opportunity Amari is going to threaten to detonate the nuke. Ellen rises to the occasion

286
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,160
in this moment by confronting Amari when all the other passengers can't described in this

287
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,840
unbelievable line. The other passengers looked around uncomfortably paralyzed by a peculiar

288
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,160
inability to overcome their political correctness. That's right the passengers are too politically

289
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,920
correct to stop someone trying to detonate a bomb or maybe he wasn't trying to detonate a bomb.

290
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,560
Amari said he wanted to negotiate with Prescott to get some sort of concession but Ellen reacts

291
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,720
too quickly and instead she detonates the nuke. Instead of stopping the terrorist she does his

292
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,480
job for him and blows up a nuke over New York City and killing hundreds of thousands. The book tells

293
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,040
us it's only hundreds of thousands but the blast I guess would only kill that many. The fallout would

294
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,360
kill millions. I don't think Ben understands fallout because Brett is in New York City when

295
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,240
this happens and he somehow is fine. You wouldn't be if a nuclear bomb exploded over a city the

296
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,160
fallout would kill so many people. Well we already know Ben doesn't understand nukes right because

297
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,280
of this clip. President Trump wanted to nuke hurricanes which by the way I don't even care

298
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,840
whether it does anything it just sounds cool. Just the idea anytime you're talking about nuking

299
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,880
a random thing that's not really gonna hurt anybody I'll admit the 13 year old boy of me

300
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,320
is kind of for it. Oh god he's so dumb. I bet you didn't expect that plot twist though right?

301
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Ben is ending his book by nuking New York City. But wait there's an epilogue in it we find out

302
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,080
that our new president is going to be former VP Allison Martin who for some reason we have not

303
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,960
heard about until now. She blames the nuke going off on Ellen which is more accurate than she

304
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,160
realizes but she thinks it was because Ellen was a suicide bomber sent by the governor of Texas

305
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,440
which is as good a pretense as any to lead the country into a civil war. We also get a glimpse

306
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,440
outside of the US borders where we find an international coalition led by China including

307
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,320
Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia who are launching a massive invasion of the United States. This comes

308
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,040
completely out of nowhere and makes no sense whatsoever. It's maybe the dumbest thing in this

309
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,960
book and it's a very competitive field and in the closing scene we see Brett rescued from prison by

310
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,200
Soledad and together they're going to start a new terror cell which means a sequel.

311
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,920
Some people use VPN for enhanced security and safety. Personally I use it for accessing

312
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,880
different parts of the internet that aren't accessible in my home country of Canada. One

313
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,480
of my favorite shows to watch on Netflix is Kim's Convenience. It's a really great Canadian show

314
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,920
about a Korean family that has a convenience store in my hometown of Toronto. It just finished up

315
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,360
its third season but if I go to Canadian Netflix you'll see there are only two seasons. Season

316
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,200
three is coming on October 2nd. Of course that's not the case for other Netflixes around the world

317
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,960
so what I can do is open up NordVPN and with a few quick clicks I can move IP address from Canada to

318
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,320
the United States or maybe maybe we'll wait to the next election before trying the United States.

319
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,400
Instead I'll move to where my family is from that's Spain and we just click there. Nord will

320
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,680
find the best server to make sure I've got decent latency so the stream comes in okay

321
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:28,560
and then it switches and there we are. So I go back to Netflix, I refresh the page

322
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:37,840
and boom three seasons and that's how I use NordVPN. As part of this sponsorship viewers of this video

323
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,960
can get a special 70% off a three-year plan at nordvpn.com slash Jose. This special offer makes

325
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,600

326
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,640
viewers can support this channel and get a little something extra back as well so do click on that

327
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,600
link below if you're in need of a decent VPN. Style is very subjective. I'm a fan of simple

328
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,040
effective prose and some writers can use language so effortlessly you could read them writing about

329
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,720
anything. Ben Shapiro is not one of these writers. One of the things he does in this book that

330
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,920
constantly bugged me were these short little one sentence paragraphs. Here's how he ends one scene.

331
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,480
He glanced up at the face of the secret service agent on his back. A thick burn scar marked his

332
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,640
face near his ear. Then everything went black. The short sentences are meant to emphasize each

333
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,840
one. It's like writing in bold or under lighting the sentence except less obvious. Unless you do

334
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,400
it all the time and Ben uses this technique dozens of times. She felt tears well in her own eyes.

335
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,200
She couldn't cry. Not yet. So she went to work as usual. Ben also has a problem with starting so

336
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,760
many sentences particularly action scenes with the word then. Then without hesitating he stabbed

337
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,320
the boy through the eye. When he looked up he saw the explosives packed along the ceiling.

338
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,120
Then he noticed a camera operated by remote in the corner of the hallway. The annoying thing

339
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,440
about these sentences is that they're just as effective without the word then. This is what

340
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,160
they look like removed and they're fine. By constantly starting a sentence with then it

341
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,000
creates the impression that this story is being told to me by a child. And I want to give some

342
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
special consideration to the many names Ben has come up with for this novel. Here are some of my

343
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:43,760
favorites. Brett Hawthorne. Mark Prescott. Levon Williams. Ricky O. Sullivan. Bubba Davis. Jack

344
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:57,920
Blatch. Southers. Ibrahim Ashami. Jim Balaban. Bill Collier. Billy Barron. James Easton McLawrence.

345
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:08,400
Aidan Foster. Beauregard Feldkopf. And a special shout out to Jeff Jeffords, the soldier who's only

346
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,440
mentioned in one paragraph where we find out his head was cut off and sent to Governor Davis.

347
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,680
For anyone planning to write a book where gruesome decapitation happens, try not to give

348
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,680
the victim a silly name like Mark Markson or Bill Billson. One thing we get a lot of in this

349
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,680
266 page book is characters. Dozens of them. Many appearing for no more than a few paragraphs,

350
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,640
but what's most telling is how these characters are presented to us. Let's take the subplot of

351
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,280
Ricky O. Sullivan shooting the eight-year-old boy. The boy's name is Kendrick Malone, though we

352
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,440
don't even learn that until after he's been murdered. The scene where the two encounter one

353
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,880
another is told entirely from Ricky's perspective. We see the fear, doubt, and regret through his

354
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,320
eyes, creating sympathy for the character. We never get Kendrick's perspective. Part of that

355
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,880
may be because they were trying to hide that this was a setup, but even after he dies, we do meet

356
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,600
his mother, Regina Malone, who's briefly described as a slightly overweight black woman. And that's

357
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,840
about it. She's never a focal point. We never really learn anything about her aside that she's

358
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,680
being used as a prop by Levon and Jim. The Malone family, although victims in this narrative, are

359
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,320
without a story or perspective. They're just props being used to tell us the story of a sympathetic

360
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,360
police officer and two conniving civil rights frauds. When we find out Officer Ricky isn't

361
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,080
being charged with the crime of murdering a child, we get a brief rundown of the district attorney,

362
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,960
Kim Donahue. She's introduced as a straight-shooting Republican who got into office after her

363
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,000
Democratic competition dropped out of the race because of a sex and corruption scandal. Ben

364
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
tries to give her backstory so we can feel sympathy for her when Detroit's black community

365
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,760
is enraged by her decision to not press charges against Ricky. Ben has no interest in even trying

366
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,640
to present the grievances of black residents of Detroit. People are reduced to easily manipulated

367
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,800
props. We get no backstory or history for Regina Malone or Kendrick. They're just there to be

368
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,080
manipulated by others. We can see this pattern repeated throughout the book. We get a lengthy

369
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,880
story and explanation to create sympathy for Soledad as she descends into terrorism. We see her flee

370
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,520
from her ranch, see her friend get hit with a drone strike, and then watch her try to assassinate

371
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,160
the president. This is taken from the final page of the book after Soledad has rescued Brett and

372
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,080
they're driving towards freedom. Brett looked at her. You're that terrorist. I prefer rancher.

373
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,840
The government made me a terrorist. No, said Brett. You make you into a terrorist.

374
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,280
You're free to get out at any time. Brett went silent. This part of the book could easily be

375
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,600
considered apologetics for a certain type of terrorism and it's all told in a way that we're

376
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,440
supposed to feel sympathy or compassion or at least understanding for Soledad and her actions.

377
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,360
This book is filled with terrorists but we never get more than the briefest explanations for why

378
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,760
they're doing what they do, at least when they're from the Middle East or if they're Muslim.

379
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,000
What's telling is who he attempts to give depth, characters whose actions he feels that need to be

380
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,080
rationalized as blameless like the cop who shoots an eight-year-old kid or justified like the ranchers

381
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,440
who decide to bomb buildings and naturally the lines being drawn are to advance a distinctly

382
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,720
right-wing worldview. Ben doesn't seem concerned or interested in the stories of the Black residents

383
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,800
of Detroit who aren't scumpags or any terrorists who are swept up under this charismatic leader or

384
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,480
even the charismatic leader himself. No, these are cardboard cutouts for the more detailed

385
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,680
protagonists to fight against. One of the major players I've only briefly touched on in this book

386
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,080
is the media. A quick way of understanding who the novel is trying to portray as sympathetic

387
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,360
is seeing what their stance towards the media is. For example, Brett and Ellen show open disdain

388
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,640
or disgust for the press at every turn, whereas President Prescott is enthralled by them. And

389
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,400
Levon uses the media as a tool for manipulation. In these two cases, the media is portrayed as being

390
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,760
powerful enough to lead around the most powerful man in the world but so weak and fragile that it

391
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,560
can be easily manipulated by a drug dealer. The media is a corrupting force in these books,

392
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,720
although Ben points out a few exceptions like box news or conservative bloggers. The few times we

393
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,720
meet reporters or journalists in this book, they're often grimy sneaks like Jack Blatch,

394
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,840
who spreads fallacious stories about Brett cheating on Ellen, or they're empty-headed reporters who

395
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,320
fawn over Leon, particularly reporters who, the book makes sure we know, are white and female.

396
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,920
Just to add a little extra bit of racism to this. The novel is creating this world run by the media

397
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,120
and that media has been captured by people with bad intent, typically activists with left-wing

398
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,080
politics. Considering this book itself is a piece of media, it's not a huge leap to assume

399
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,360
it's playing the same game, acting as a form of propaganda to advance a narrative. Damn the facts

400
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,160
and logic it has to trample under its feet. If the left does it, this book seems to argue,

401
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,120
shouldn't the right do it as well? Left-wing activists are never portrayed as honest actors

402
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,320
in this novel. They are often drug dealers or hustlers seizing power or environmentalists

403
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,040
employed by a foreign government. That one random scene in the book's epilogue of the various

404
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,480
nations on earth led by China uniting to invade the US isn't as random as it seems. It actually

405
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,800
makes perfect sense in the worldview of this book. It's presenting a vision of America that is under

406
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,320
siege, seemingly from within, but in truth the danger comes from outside its borders.

407
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,720
This is an intensely tribal book, dripping with fear and paranoia. Fear of non-Americans,

408
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,320
and often American people of color, as an existential threat to the United States.

409
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,600
And those who represent the liberal establishment are enabling these people to destroy America.

410
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,840
It's a bit scary to think what sort of mind produces this kind of fiction,

411
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,640
a mind so wracked with fear over a world that's out to destroy everything it holds valuable.

412
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,120
Going back to some of those quotes plastered on this book, it's even more troubling to see them

413
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,880
speaking on how real this book felt. And it must be a feeling because it's literally non-factual,

414
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
it's completely made up, and it's hilariously inaccurate whenever it discusses geopolitical

415
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,720
dynamics in the real world. Aside from the outrageous plot, to identify with the concerns

416
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,960
of this book is to identify with fear and paranoia. To assume the world, or more accurately America,

417
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,160
is headed towards chaos with one more loan to the Chinese, or every time there's a protest

418
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,400
over a black child being murdered. There are a few small moments in this book where I got the

419
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,280
impression that it was starting to sound like an honest depiction of the mainstream left in America.

420
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,200
I remember one speech by President Prescott that seemed to be a version of something you might have

421
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,480
heard former President Obama say, only not as well written. But then the game would be given

422
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,160
away completely by diving into Prescott's mind to get some vapid line about how much he loves

423
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,280
the cameras, or that he's ogling some blonde in the front row. Ben can't seem to portray left-wing

424
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,080
politics as anything more than a farce, as if there's nothing genuinely motivating that side

425
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,760
of the political spectrum. At least, not anything more meaningful than vanity. I suspect these are

426
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,880
the strawmen Ben wishes he was fighting against, and sometimes thinks he is. By using fiction,

427
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,520
he can make them say the things he thinks they secretly believe. Ironically, this book isn't

428
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,120
giving us a glimpse into anyone's mind, except for Ben Shapiro's. Books very rarely portray the

429
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,640
world in a completely comprehensive and meaningful way. In the hands of truly great writers, they

430
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,920
provide us insights into these small fragments that make up the human experience. What shabbier

431
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,600
writers reveal is something about themselves and how they see the world. Ben's book doesn't reveal

432
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,720
any worthwhile social commentary, rather it lets us look deep into his small paranoid mind and

433
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,320
displays the ugly, prejudiced lens through which he sees the world. And Ben wants us to see it that

434
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,880
way too. Feel like I gotta repeat, please don't read this book. I got my copy from the library,

435
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,000
I did not give Ben Shapiro another sale. Genuinely believe we can learn something using literary

436
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,920
analysis regardless of the quality of the book, and I feel like I learned something reading this,

437
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,360
and it wasn't a complete loss. I hope maybe you got something out of this video too. All those

438
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,040
names you see flashing up on the screen are my delightful, lovely patrons who make videos like

439
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,680
this possible. If you would also like to be one of those lovely people, you can head over to my

440
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,920
Patreon and offer a small monthly donation. If you'd like to support me in a non-financial way,

441

Also, if you want to be updated on the comings and goings of my YouTube channel, remember to

443

444
