0	2760	Where do people get their ideas?
2760	6920	In the case of this video, I took my general distaste for the work of noted conspiracy
6920	11840	theorist and soy hater Paul Joseph Watson, and decided to follow his work for a week
11840	17800	and tabulate the many omissions, poor framings, and outright lies that shape his work.
17800	20280	But something weird happened along the way.
20280	25760	I had decided upon the week of January 14th, 2019 as my starting point.
25760	31280	With the very first article, my whole idea fell apart, and I fell into a weird rabbit
31280	32280	hole.
32280	37800	The article in question is titled, Leftist French Website Calls for Heterosexuality
37800	44160	to be Banned, published on January 14th on Infowars, the home of conspiracy theories
44160	46880	and pending litigation for slander.
46880	54800	Watson's article is a less than favorable framing of a piece by Mérôme Jardin, titled,
54800	59760	Interdire le Artreu Sexuality, for the French outlet media part.
59760	63600	And I apologize for that terrible French pronunciation there.
63600	69480	Watson's article describes the content of the Jardin piece, and includes some generally
69480	73200	negative remarks, but doesn't go into it too deeply.
73200	78200	The first question I had was, does Paul Joseph Watson speak French?
78200	82440	He has a lot of translated sections of the original French article, but he doesn't really
82440	84280	attribute it to anyone.
84280	86560	So where did these translations come from?
86560	88680	Did he just come up with them on his own?
88680	90880	So I decided to look this up.
90880	95840	It led me to, as far as I can tell, one of the few English language articles about the
95840	101320	Jardin piece that wasn't just a reposting of the Watson article from Infowars.
101320	106840	It was posted on a blog called, Diversity Machte Frei, which Google Translate tells
106840	111160	me is German for diversity power free.
111160	112880	But more about the blog in a bit.
112880	118040	The article, Call for Heterosexuality to be Banned in France, was published on January
118040	122120	12th, 2019, two days before the Watson article.
122120	125920	I know you're all probably thinking, ooh, a plagiarism case.
125920	126920	Sort of.
126920	133000	There's actually something much more interesting going on here, so just hang in there for a
133000	134000	moment.
134000	137760	The first thing I noticed about the blog post is that it's strikingly similar to the Watson
137760	142800	article, so much so that every quoted section from the Watson article is an exact match
142800	145360	for the blog article.
145360	148320	Translation is not an exact science.
148320	152360	Translations may contain subtle differences, depending on the translator.
152360	157120	Take, for example, these translations of the first paragraph of the French article.
157120	161240	I sourced both of these individually, and even when you take into consideration that
161240	167880	words such as sexism and biphobia are typically only translated in one way, you can still
167880	173120	see the subtle differences in the translation that show different people worked on them.
173120	177880	The first paragraph is included in both the Watson and the Diversity Machte Frei blog
177880	181080	article, and they are identical.
181080	186760	There is no difference between them whatsoever, aside from a few opening words that the Watson
186760	188560	quote cut off.
188560	194320	In fact, every quoted section is identical aside from the word femicide, which was spelled
194320	199160	incorrectly as feminicides in the Diversity blog.
199160	202800	I suppose it was nice of Watson to correct the spelling there.
202800	207640	But going further than the quotations, take a look at all these additional claims in the
207640	211860	Watson article that aren't just quotes from the original Jardine article.
211860	216280	Every single one of them can be found in the translated sections originally posted in the
216280	218320	Diversity blog.
218320	222600	That may not sound like a big deal, since they're talking about the same French article,
222600	225080	why wouldn't they make the same claims?
225080	229920	Except the translation on the Diversity blog only includes four paragraphs from the original
229920	234760	French article 17, not counting the concluding sentence.
234760	239580	Now what are the odds that the Watson article, supposedly based on having read the original
239580	245080	French article in its entirety, would have happened to hit the exact same points as this
245080	250360	blog post that translated less than a quarter of the article's content?
250360	251660	But we're not done yet.
251660	254800	The final few paragraphs of the Diversity blog read,
254800	262440	The bio of the author, Mérôme Jardine, says he was a member of ACTA Paris, 1998-2013,
262440	268700	a gay campaigning group, and is a member of CCIF, Collective Against Islamophobia.
268700	272620	Which is hilarious, since I don't think this guy will last long after the Muslim takeover
272620	274320	of France.
274320	277560	Watson's article ends,
277560	282900	The irony behind the piece is that Jardine is also a member of the CCIF, Collective Against
282900	284880	Islamophobia.
284880	289520	One wonders how his opinion will be received amongst France's Muslim population, which
289520	292760	currently stands at almost 9%.
292760	297040	Kind of strange how they ended on the exact same point, isn't it?
297040	302500	Although Watson, I suppose, gets some tiny bit of credit for adding the factoid about
302500	307220	the Muslim population of France, in an article that has nothing to do with Islam.
307220	308820	Funny how that worked out.
308820	314100	Countless writers have taken the work of others, synthesized or built upon it in some way.
314100	318420	Typically though, they add more than just a random stat at the end.
318420	322260	And even more typically, they actually credit their source.
322260	326900	At the very least, Watson should credit the Diversity blog for the translation.
326900	330560	Although that might expose how little work he did for this article.
330560	333600	And it might expose something else as well.
333600	337880	Diversity Macht Preu, you can get a sense of what this blog is about by checking out
337880	339880	some of their articles.
339880	342900	There are a few overlaps with Watson's InfoWars work.
342900	347660	We have these two articles about a woman in Germany being pulled over for wearing braids.
347660	352640	The Diversity blog's article was dated January 8th, the Watson article January 9th.
352640	356520	There's an article here about the French Green Party founder saying Europeans should
356520	359160	have less children to make room for migrants.
359160	363760	Diversity blog's article is dated January 4th, Watson's is dated January 11th.
363760	369840	And an article about Germany issuing a manual to schools warning about signs of, according
369840	373080	to Watson's article, right-wing parents.
373080	376840	And according to Diversity blog's article, Nazi parents.
376840	382640	The Diversity blog's article is dated December 4th, the Watson article December 5th.
382640	387680	In many of these cases, Watson, to his credit, does more to build on the story than the Diversity
387680	392160	blog does, enough to make it seem as if he got these stories from somewhere else.
392160	393720	And heck, maybe he did.
393720	398160	It's entirely possible that the Diversity blog and Watson just run in the same circles
398160	402560	and cover a lot of the same stories using similar themes such as the left trying to
402560	405360	destroy Europe via immigration.
405360	410800	Although when it comes to that first article, responding to the Jardin piece, I can't assume
410800	412440	that's just a coincidence.
412440	414640	The articles are way too similar.
414640	417480	One is clearly lifted from the other.
417480	421160	But this isn't just a case of plagiarism.
421160	425680	There's a bit more to that Diversity blog than I've told you so far.
425680	427160	And it's pretty ugly.
427160	431280	While Watson is happy to cover the same stories as the blog when it applies to conservatives
431280	435900	supposedly being under attack in Europe, he doesn't really touch the other stories the
435900	438800	blog pushes out on a regular basis.
438800	445520	Titles with titles such as A Very Jewish Coup, the Plot to Stop Brexit, Rich Muslim
445520	452240	States are hiring Jews to sell Islam to Christians via interfaith institutes.
452240	457080	As Christians celebrate Christmas with their families, Jews fantasize about their saviour
457080	459840	crawling through excrement.
459840	464680	So yeah, this blog is probably run by a Nazi.
464680	469020	And if you need a little more evidence than that, one of the few places that loves to
469020	474960	repost this blog's content happens to be the home for neo-Nazi scum on the internet,
474960	477040	the Daily Stormer.
477040	479400	This is definitely a Nazi's blog.
479400	483400	And the Daily Stormer has had an interesting relationship with Paul Joseph Watson over
483400	484400	the years.
484400	486640	In short, they don't like him.
486640	487640	At all.
487640	491780	Not because they disagree with the vast majority of his talking points, though.
491780	497260	As one 2015 article describes it, Watson is known for ripping off the Daily Stormer
497260	501940	and other pro-white sites and removing Jews from the discussion.
501940	506900	Now if the Daily Stormer said the sky was blue, I'd look out the window to check,
506900	510940	but there's clearly a kinship between Watson and his site.
510940	514320	Watson portrays the Daily Stormer as being hostile towards him.
514320	518940	But this doesn't result from some kind of profound ideological divide.
518980	521980	He says in this tweet they attack him, and that's true.
521980	526540	But only insofar that Watson doesn't quite go far enough to call out their imaginary
526540	530500	menace that's supposedly the source of all the evils in the world.
530500	533020	In this case, it would be the Jewish people.
533020	534660	Which they're obviously wrong about.
534660	536060	Do I have to say that?
536060	537060	Do I have to say they're wrong?
537060	538420	I'm gonna say it anyway.
538420	541220	They're totally wrong about the Jews being fined everything.
541220	543740	That's a hideous conspiracy theory.
543740	548500	Watson's career has largely been spent working for Alex Jones and Infowars.
548500	553740	Infowars' single biggest work is a 2005 book titled Order Out of Chaos, a diatribe
553740	557620	about how the US government was responsible for 9-11.
557620	562940	One telling line within describes briefly how Watson believes the world works, particularly
562940	565900	in how it relates to the Jewish people.
565900	571020	Many people identify Zionism and the expansion of Israel as the head of the New World Order
571020	572060	Hydra.
572060	575740	In reality, Israel is just another tentacle of the beast.
575740	579820	The globalists do not owe allegiance to any particular country.
579820	584380	They will use any nation or movement as muscle to rhyme through their agenda.
584380	588340	So the point of contention between the likes of Watson and Stormfront is simple.
588340	593220	They both believe in the same theory of a group of global elites controlling the world.
593220	596260	Only Watson will claim that the group is exclusively Jewish.
596260	602980	Instead, he sees it as some sort of sinister left-wing cabal that is using identity politics
602980	606260	to, I don't know, make everyone gay, I guess.
606260	610820	What's so frustrating about these commentaries is that they're not completely wrong about
610820	615900	the world being organized in a way that favors a ruling class over all others, but instead
615900	620020	of trying to create a broad international coalition of the people against those who
620020	625100	would oppress them, they either scapegoat a religious minority or pretend that fascism
625100	626660	is going to save us.
626660	629340	These obviously aren't real solutions.
629340	634220	In an article by Nico Hines of The Daily Beast, we got a deep look into Watson's history,
634220	637420	particularly how he got his story ideas in the past.
637420	642200	He's a talented guy in that way, able to spit out these fake news stories very quickly.
642200	648060	This comment comes from Kelly Jones, Alex Jones's ex-wife who previously had a fairly
648060	651380	heavy hand in running the operations of InfoWars.
651380	655920	According to Kelly Jones, much of Watson's prolific career writing for InfoWars would
655920	661440	involve Jones reciting ideas to Watson over the phone, who would then turn them into articles.
661440	667160	If anything, this demonstrates Watson has a history of repackaging the ideas of, well,
667160	669040	unbalanced individuals.
669040	673040	If we want to know what motivates Watson, Kelly Jones can actually offer us a possible
673040	679160	explanation describing her time managing the prison planet, eventually InfoWars, payroll.
679160	683640	Early early on, Paul Watson was making monthly what people make in a year.
683640	687000	We're talking about the kind of money that would drop jaws.
687000	690920	Before I go further, I should mention Watson called this article a hit piece.
690920	694780	Although throughout the article they cite government records and interviews with many
694780	699080	of his former friends and colleagues, that seems quite credible.
699080	703400	Watson's only critique after the article came out was the tweet below.
703400	707840	None of the information Kelly Jones provides has anything to do with knowing Watson personally
707840	711960	and is used to provide context of his working relationship with her husband.
711960	717200	The Daily Beast article suggests, quite strongly, that Watson's intense suspicion about the
717200	722080	government, as seen in his earlier writings, where he pivots to conspiracy theories in
722080	728520	the face of any and all public tragedies, has slowly moved towards a more xenophobic variation.
728520	733200	We can see a great example of Watson's race to a conspiracy theory answer in one of his
733200	737640	early 2015 videos, where he actually came out against Donald Trump.
737640	740480	Donald Trump is a stooge for Hillary Clinton.
740480	741480	He's a plan.
741480	746800	He's a ringer to sink the chances of Republican candidates who actually have a chance of
746800	748360	defeating Hillary.
748360	751720	Watson claimed to have evolved on this issue.
751720	756640	Just how he evolved I think can be more easily summed up in these three tweets.
756640	761800	In the context of Donald Trump threatening military action in Syria off the heels of
761800	767920	a chemical weapon attack, Watson posted these three tweets within a 14 hour period.
767920	770940	I guess Trump wasn't Putin's puppet after all.
770940	774020	He was just another deep state neocon puppet.
774020	778060	I'm officially off the Trump train.
778060	780900	First time I've ever lost Twitter followers.
780900	782780	Interesting.
782780	786700	I am off the Trump train in terms of Syria, which I will criticize.
786700	790180	But I have not turned on Trump, as the media claims.
790180	791380	Fake news.
791380	797340	I suspect the truth of Watson's motivations lie in the second tweet in that little three
797340	799100	act Twitter play.
799100	802700	Watson has an audience, an audience that makes him a lot of money.
802700	805980	He'll say what he needs to, to keep getting paid.
805980	810860	It's difficult to say whether or not Watson is entirely disingenuous, though.
810860	814740	Maybe he flirts with more extreme viewpoints for the financial benefits, but he's certainly
814740	819860	built a career being a conspiracy theorist who doggedly challenges the government, often
819860	823620	with dreadful completely wrongheaded conclusions.
823620	828420	Although Watson may make himself presentable and make a concentrated effort to appear reasonable,
828420	832580	he's still repackaging crackpot commentary as his own.
832580	836900	Whether it's in service to genuinely agreeing with it or to make a quick buck, it doesn't
836900	837900	really matter.
837900	842980	He's trying to stealthily insert neo-Nazi commentary into the public discourse, and
842980	845700	that's bad enough.
845700	850060	I want to give a shout out to my Twitter followers who helped me out with the translations for
850060	853900	the first paragraph of the Jardine article.
853900	859300	One asked to remain anonymous, but the other one is Timba on Toast, whose YouTube channel
859300	860300	you should totally check out.
860300	865980	He has a fantastic video on Dave Rubin, and I know a thing or two about Dave Rubin videos.
865980	869460	If you enjoy this video, I highly recommend you like it.
869460	873500	Leave a comment, and if you haven't already, just subscribe.
873500	876860	And if for some reason you can't get enough of me, you can ask me a question on Curious
876860	878660	Cat, or follow me on Twitter.
