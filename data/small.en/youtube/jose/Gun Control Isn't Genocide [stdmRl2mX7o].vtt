00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Wow, there's a title for you. Gun control is not genocide.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.680
That seems like a non-controversial opinion, if I've ever seen one.

00:09.680 --> 00:15.520
I came up with it after watching the video I want to talk about today.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.400
I think we might have a disagreement here.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.840
Does anyone remember Mike Adams? He's the self-styled health ranger who

00:23.840 --> 00:27.680
produces a stream of nonsense for the website Natural News.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.840
Natural News is a crackpot website that does its best to misunderstand science

00:31.840 --> 00:37.360
and fear-monger scary scientific terms. It was popularized by fellow voice

00:37.360 --> 00:41.600
howling in the wilderness and angriest man on the planet, Alex Jones.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.840
We know we're under attack! We know it! We're breaking the conditioning!

00:45.840 --> 00:52.880
Ahh! Ahh! We're coming for you, globalist! Ahh! Coming for you!

00:52.880 --> 00:55.920
Coming for you! We know what you're doing!

00:58.400 --> 00:59.040
I'm sorry.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.840
Back in August of 2012, Adams produced a mini-documentary titled

01:05.840 --> 01:09.680
Gun Control is Genocide. It's actually part two of a series,

01:09.680 --> 01:11.600
but I'll mention part one a little later.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.200
Whenever there's a renewed push for gun control legislation,

01:15.200 --> 01:21.520
Infowars trots out this gun control is genocide documentary and the cycle of stupid is renewed.

01:22.240 --> 01:27.280
You might not recognize it from YouTube because YouTube deleted the entire Natural News channel

01:27.280 --> 01:34.480
back on March 3rd of 2018, but the mini-documentary lives on in the much sketchier domain of Vimeo.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.960
It's only about eight minutes, but, well, I wouldn't even recommend wasting that much time.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.040
Let's just talk about why it's nonsense.

01:43.760 --> 01:49.200
A democracy is based on the fundamental concept that a distribution of power among the many

01:49.200 --> 01:54.400
creates a better society. It is the concentration of power among the few,

01:54.480 --> 02:00.080
such as what we see in a dictatorship that leads to corruption and exploitation of the people.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.720
Adams not only gets the idea of a monopoly of force wrong, he also gets democracy wrong.

02:07.920 --> 02:13.120
In the United States and most other countries in the world, from Canada to China, the government

02:13.120 --> 02:18.800
already has a monopoly of force, more commonly understood as a monopoly of violence. The basic

02:18.800 --> 02:23.440
idea is that individuals living in a state understand that only the state can claim a

02:23.440 --> 02:28.560
legitimate use of force against citizens. There are laws in most countries against assault

02:28.560 --> 02:32.720
and murder, and typically when a crime is committed, it's the police who handle it,

02:32.720 --> 02:37.600
and not an angry mob or vigilante. There are exceptions in case of self-defense,

02:37.600 --> 02:43.200
but generally speaking, most modern nations have a state monopoly on violence.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.000
And as for how Adams gets democracy wrong, when he says the sharing of power, that's

02:48.000 --> 02:52.880
not really the same as the sharing of weaponry. It means the distribution of political power,

02:52.880 --> 02:59.440
usually through voting. I can't believe I have to explain this, but democracies don't choose

02:59.440 --> 03:06.160
their elected officials by one side threatening the other with guns. True global anti-gun movement

03:06.160 --> 03:11.760
would see governments abandoning the use of force against the people. The armed raids on

03:11.760 --> 03:16.960
California raw milk producers, for example, or the use of guns to force parents to vaccinate

03:17.120 --> 03:22.960
their children against their will are all the result of a monopoly of force in the hands of

03:22.960 --> 03:28.720
the government. This part's kinda nice. It's important to understand that not all state violence

03:28.720 --> 03:34.480
is good, and while the monopoly on violence is probably better than vigilantes running around

03:34.480 --> 03:39.520
taking care of whatever they deem necessary, it's telling that in this documentary the best

03:39.520 --> 03:45.280
examples Adams could come up with were raids against raw milk farms and vaccination. I'm not

03:45.280 --> 03:50.480
sure anyone is being vaccinated at gunpoint, and the only evidence of that I could find was this

03:50.480 --> 03:56.080
painting by an artist from Sesame Street magazine. No joke, the guy who drew this used to do work for

03:56.080 --> 04:01.200
Sesame Street magazine, until they realized he was a crazy dude and they just kinda cut him off.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.920
So there are great examples of the government using its monopoly of violence irresponsibly.

04:07.920 --> 04:13.760
For instance, when you see an unarmed man shot by police, usually black. Of course,

04:13.760 --> 04:18.480
this video was made in 2012, before Black Lives Matters really came into the spotlight.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.280
What are Health Ranger Mike Adams' thoughts on police officers murdering innocent people?

04:24.000 --> 04:32.400
Oh, that's, um, oh, that's a hot take. Sorry for the pun. But putting aside any Twitter hot take,

04:32.400 --> 04:39.200
he consistently tweets about BLM. But by BLM, he means the Bureau of Land Management. It's

04:39.200 --> 04:44.640
strange that he never thought of trying to turn that into a hashtag. Until September 2015, when

04:44.640 --> 04:49.440
the Black Lives Matter movement really picked up steam on Twitter. So what he's trying to do is

04:49.440 --> 04:56.880
hijack the BLM hashtag to support white ranchers taking over a government building. Charming dude.

04:58.240 --> 05:05.120
That braces us for the next section. R.J. Rummel at the University of Hawaii has extensively studied

05:05.120 --> 05:11.120
what's called democide, the term describing death by government. According to his extensive

05:11.120 --> 05:17.200
research through over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have

05:17.200 --> 05:25.360
been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. That's six times as many people have

05:25.360 --> 05:32.080
died from government-inflicted murder than have died in battle. In other words, if you think war

05:32.080 --> 05:39.600
is bad, a monopoly of violence in the hands of government is far worse. All right, let's talk

05:39.600 --> 05:46.160
about Rudolph Joseph Rummel. He came up with the term democide, which is used to describe when

05:46.160 --> 05:52.400
government murders its own citizens. His stats on democide are widely circulated on Infowars and

05:52.400 --> 05:58.080
other nonsense websites. And of course, these stats are, at best, contentious, as Rummel seems to take

05:58.080 --> 06:03.360
the highest possible number of dead in every instance. As an example, the number of those

06:03.360 --> 06:09.040
murdered by the government in China was originally considered to be 35 million in Rummel's first book

06:09.040 --> 06:14.880
on the subject in 1991, but later he decided that the government was also responsible for the 38

06:14.880 --> 06:22.640
million killed by famine. So he revised that figure of 35 million to 72 million in his 2005 book.

06:23.440 --> 06:28.160
Maybe that's a fair assessment. I'm not really interested in being a malapologist here,

06:28.160 --> 06:32.720
but I'm not convinced Rummel's stats can be considered authoritative if he's literally

06:32.720 --> 06:36.400
doubling them when he finds a new degree of responsibility towards the government.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.920
That said, it's difficult to engage with an academic who is written so prolifically on a

06:41.920 --> 06:47.440
subject, especially when I have literally never heard of him outside of an Infowars website.

06:47.440 --> 06:53.760
But as you might not be surprised, very little of what Rummel has to say, at least from my research,

06:53.760 --> 06:58.320
has anything to do with gun control. The closest I could find was this quote.

07:17.440 --> 07:24.000
As a family member. As one simply seeking happiness. Most of what one does now is subject

07:24.000 --> 07:30.160
to government rules, regulations, and laws, and can be vetoed by judges or bureaucrats who are

07:30.160 --> 07:38.320
backed up ultimately by the gun. That kind of makes him sound like he'd be a fellow traveler with

07:38.320 --> 07:43.760
Mike Adams in his ilk, but it still doesn't go anywhere towards a stance on gun control.

07:44.480 --> 07:50.640
If someone can point me towards Rummel's thoughts on gun control, I'd be highly curious. Rummel is

07:50.640 --> 07:56.880
very much a fan of classical liberalism, kind of an ominous term nowadays, although he was talking

07:56.880 --> 08:02.640
about that well before it was cool with the centrists. But when Rummel talks about the

08:02.640 --> 08:08.640
concentration of power, he's talking about the difference between democracies and communist

08:08.640 --> 08:13.520
states. He very much comes across as someone who bought into the red scare, and it's strange how

08:13.520 --> 08:17.600
he pays close attention to the communist governments failing their people like the famine

08:17.600 --> 08:22.240
in Mao's China, but he seems less interested in acknowledging how many people have died from a

08:22.240 --> 08:27.680
lack of healthcare or due to homelessness in democracies. Apparently he doesn't see this as

08:27.680 --> 08:33.360
the responsibility of a government in a democracy. Adams tries very hard to tie gun control to the

08:33.360 --> 08:39.520
stats presented by Rummel, but Rummel's work is pretty explicitly about democracy. And Adams

08:39.520 --> 08:43.920
doesn't understand that democracy is not a product of an armed standoff, it's a divide that

08:43.920 --> 08:50.160
can't be bridged in an eight minute documentary, or by an idiot. Halfway into this mini talk,

08:50.880 --> 08:58.720
shit starts getting weird. Really weird. And because the right to self-defense is a divine right,

08:59.360 --> 09:05.120
those who act to erode or nullify such a right are acting in violation of nature,

09:05.120 --> 09:10.080
and in violation of our creator, those who support gun disarmament in...

09:11.680 --> 09:16.720
First I want to hold on to this image, because this woman perfectly captures my response to the

09:16.720 --> 09:23.520
idea of God having given people guns. As a non-believer, I'm not really sure what to say to this

09:23.520 --> 09:32.160
except... Wow. As I mentioned earlier, this is actually part two of a documentary. That first

09:32.160 --> 09:38.560
part of the documentary was titled The Divine Right of Self-Defense, and it's about how animals

09:38.560 --> 09:44.560
defend themselves sometimes with projectiles like the spitting cobra. I want to play a very short

09:44.560 --> 09:49.040
clip from this first documentary to show some of the sound effects Mike has added to this little

09:49.040 --> 09:54.960
squirrel. The California ground squirrel is known to distract predators such as the rattlesnake and

09:55.040 --> 10:00.080
gophersnake from locating their nest burrows by kicking sand into their eyes.

10:01.360 --> 10:07.120
So intense. Anyway, I'm not going to really talk about that video much more. It basically says the

10:07.120 --> 10:12.560
same things in this video while throwing in some shade towards police officers and plenty of other

10:12.560 --> 10:18.400
examples of animals throwing things, projecting things at each other. The gun control is genocide

10:19.120 --> 10:26.960
itself. It's really called gun control is genocide. I still can't get over that. The

10:26.960 --> 10:32.320
doc dates itself by talking about the shooting at the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012

10:32.320 --> 10:39.040
where gunfire killed 12 and wounded 58. I'd also like to note how strange it is to think that this

10:39.040 --> 10:46.320
was only six years ago. This seems so far away, so far back in the past, and thinking about how

10:46.320 --> 10:51.600
little has been done to change this. It makes much of Adams's commentary seem even stupider,

10:52.480 --> 10:59.760
if that's possible. In banning concealed carry weapons in the hands of legal and lawful owners

10:59.760 --> 11:06.400
in their city, Aurora officials created precisely the conditions that allowed a massacre to result

11:06.400 --> 11:13.200
in a large body count. They forced the citizens to be defenseless, even while knowing their own

11:13.280 --> 11:19.600
police forces could not provide protection to everyone. Aurora may, in fact, have been

11:19.600 --> 11:25.040
selected by the shooter precisely because the city's gun restriction laws would practically

11:25.040 --> 11:31.600
guarantee a disarmed crowd. Laws that ban concealed carry, it turns out, create what

11:31.600 --> 11:40.000
might be called a hunting preserve for psychopaths. Another wow moment. I usually don't see such a

11:40.000 --> 11:44.960
fluid stream of nonsense every day, but hey, the internet is a magical place like that.

11:45.840 --> 11:51.360
First off, the idea that gun control would have no effect on the 2012 shooting is ridiculous.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.760
The shooter, James Holmes, had visited three different psychiatrists, and one of them had

11:55.760 --> 12:00.320
described him as having homicidal thoughts that didn't prevent Holmes from going out

12:00.320 --> 12:05.600
and legally buying three guns in the weeks leading up to the shooting. In the interest of

12:05.600 --> 12:10.080
balance, let me be a dirty centrist for a moment here because there's a caveat to that.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.960
The psychiatrist who noted Holmes' tendency towards homicidal thoughts decided not to put

12:14.960 --> 12:19.920
him on a mental health hold because she believed he was borderline and putting Holmes on hold would

12:19.920 --> 12:25.280
have inflamed him. That might put the onus on her, but keep in mind that someone put on mental

12:25.280 --> 12:31.440
health hold, which means 72 hours or less at a mental health facility, does not have to give up

12:31.440 --> 12:36.880
any guns they may have purchased before being put on hold. And yeah, Holmes had purchased a gun

12:36.880 --> 12:42.320
weeks prior to the psychiatrist noticing his homicidal thoughts. If police were given the power

12:42.320 --> 12:47.200
to confiscate the weapons of a man with homicidal thoughts, and if mental health professionals could

12:47.200 --> 12:52.400
be confident that putting someone on hold would ensure that they then wouldn't be able to go out

12:52.400 --> 12:58.640
and easily kill some people afterwards, it might have helped things. But this is getting pretty

12:58.640 --> 13:01.760
heavy, so I hope Mike can cheer us up with something.

13:28.640 --> 13:40.160
Hold on, what the fuck is this? Did Mike Adams record this? Is this some kind of

13:41.680 --> 13:47.920
first-person home invasion fantasy he's showing us? Oh god, Mike, these are home videos you shouldn't

13:47.920 --> 13:53.680
be sharing with the world to make fun of. And oh god, Mike, do you have any more of these?

13:53.680 --> 14:01.280
Anyway, back to the prayer. I pray that we see through the propaganda and the deception

14:01.280 --> 14:06.640
of citizen disarmament politics. He doesn't talk about this in the video, but I want to mention it

14:06.640 --> 14:13.840
anyway. What is up with these pro-gun people and Nazis? Can they really not think of any other

14:13.840 --> 14:20.080
examples of countries with gun control laws without mentioning the Nazis? Modern Germany

14:20.080 --> 14:25.840
has gun control laws and seemed like it's more similar to the US than the Germany of the 1930s.

14:26.640 --> 14:31.840
The gun laws of Germany in 1938 actually made owning firearms much easier for the average

14:31.840 --> 14:36.720
German citizen. It restricted gun ownership of Jewish people, but plenty of Jewish people

14:36.720 --> 14:41.440
actually had guns leading right up to the Holocaust. Turns out that owning guns wasn't

14:41.440 --> 14:48.080
enough to stop state violence. But perhaps an engaged political class that stands in solidarity

14:48.080 --> 14:54.400
with a persecuted minority might be a stronger deterrent. What does Mike Adams have to say about

14:54.400 --> 15:03.760
Black Lives Matter again? Oh yeah. I'll spare you the rest of the prayer when Mike Adams reads out

15:03.760 --> 15:10.560
for us, especially since it's got a lot of images of dead bodies and even worse, more of Adams's

15:10.560 --> 15:14.880
drivel. He never really addresses the fact that dozens of countries around the world have

15:14.880 --> 15:19.840
thoughtful gun legislation and have not descended into some kind of Nazi hellscape.

15:21.280 --> 15:27.040
Responding to Adams's use of rumble, his sighting of the Holmes case, and even discussing Nazi gun

15:27.040 --> 15:32.560
laws introduces nuance and complexity that you don't see in his work. Even at only eight minutes,

15:32.560 --> 15:38.320
the video still makes the same tired points repeatedly without adding anything new. I didn't

15:38.320 --> 15:43.440
know you could get this repetitive with such little real estate. The simplistic trappings

15:43.440 --> 15:47.840
of people like Adams are so effective, not just because they mislead, but also because they

15:47.840 --> 15:53.360
nullify discussion, or at least make it very difficult for anyone with a rebuttal. Gun control

15:53.360 --> 15:58.960
is genocide. When you put it that simply, anyone who wants to believe such an obvious lie will

15:58.960 --> 16:05.040
swallow any garbage you present them, even things that are obviously not true. And while I hope this

16:05.040 --> 16:11.760
response went some way into debunking his falsehoods, I suspect that Adams's fans don't really care.

16:11.760 --> 16:17.280
He's telling them something they want to believe, and that's enough. In the future, I want to try

16:17.280 --> 16:23.040
something different. I imagine we'll still be laughing at buffoons like Mike Adams, but reacting

16:23.040 --> 16:28.400
and debunking only gets us so far. I want to understand where people like Mike Adams come from

16:28.400 --> 16:34.000
and what drives them to spread garbage information. It's probably just money, isn't it?
