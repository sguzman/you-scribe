0	4800	Wow, there's a title for you. Gun control is not genocide.
4800	9680	That seems like a non-controversial opinion, if I've ever seen one.
9680	15520	I came up with it after watching the video I want to talk about today.
15520	18400	I think we might have a disagreement here.
18400	23840	Does anyone remember Mike Adams? He's the self-styled health ranger who
23840	27680	produces a stream of nonsense for the website Natural News.
27680	31840	Natural News is a crackpot website that does its best to misunderstand science
31840	37360	and fear-monger scary scientific terms. It was popularized by fellow voice
37360	41600	howling in the wilderness and angriest man on the planet, Alex Jones.
41600	45840	We know we're under attack! We know it! We're breaking the conditioning!
45840	52880	Ahh! Ahh! We're coming for you, globalist! Ahh! Coming for you!
52880	55920	Coming for you! We know what you're doing!
58400	59040	I'm sorry.
61680	65840	Back in August of 2012, Adams produced a mini-documentary titled
65840	69680	Gun Control is Genocide. It's actually part two of a series,
69680	71600	but I'll mention part one a little later.
71600	75200	Whenever there's a renewed push for gun control legislation,
75200	81520	Infowars trots out this gun control is genocide documentary and the cycle of stupid is renewed.
82240	87280	You might not recognize it from YouTube because YouTube deleted the entire Natural News channel
87280	94480	back on March 3rd of 2018, but the mini-documentary lives on in the much sketchier domain of Vimeo.
95120	100960	It's only about eight minutes, but, well, I wouldn't even recommend wasting that much time.
100960	103040	Let's just talk about why it's nonsense.
103760	109200	A democracy is based on the fundamental concept that a distribution of power among the many
109200	114400	creates a better society. It is the concentration of power among the few,
114480	120080	such as what we see in a dictatorship that leads to corruption and exploitation of the people.
121120	126720	Adams not only gets the idea of a monopoly of force wrong, he also gets democracy wrong.
127920	133120	In the United States and most other countries in the world, from Canada to China, the government
133120	138800	already has a monopoly of force, more commonly understood as a monopoly of violence. The basic
138800	143440	idea is that individuals living in a state understand that only the state can claim a
143440	148560	legitimate use of force against citizens. There are laws in most countries against assault
148560	152720	and murder, and typically when a crime is committed, it's the police who handle it,
152720	157600	and not an angry mob or vigilante. There are exceptions in case of self-defense,
157600	163200	but generally speaking, most modern nations have a state monopoly on violence.
163200	168000	And as for how Adams gets democracy wrong, when he says the sharing of power, that's
168000	172880	not really the same as the sharing of weaponry. It means the distribution of political power,
172880	179440	usually through voting. I can't believe I have to explain this, but democracies don't choose
179440	186160	their elected officials by one side threatening the other with guns. True global anti-gun movement
186160	191760	would see governments abandoning the use of force against the people. The armed raids on
191760	196960	California raw milk producers, for example, or the use of guns to force parents to vaccinate
197120	202960	their children against their will are all the result of a monopoly of force in the hands of
202960	208720	the government. This part's kinda nice. It's important to understand that not all state violence
208720	214480	is good, and while the monopoly on violence is probably better than vigilantes running around
214480	219520	taking care of whatever they deem necessary, it's telling that in this documentary the best
219520	225280	examples Adams could come up with were raids against raw milk farms and vaccination. I'm not
225280	230480	sure anyone is being vaccinated at gunpoint, and the only evidence of that I could find was this
230480	236080	painting by an artist from Sesame Street magazine. No joke, the guy who drew this used to do work for
236080	241200	Sesame Street magazine, until they realized he was a crazy dude and they just kinda cut him off.
242240	247920	So there are great examples of the government using its monopoly of violence irresponsibly.
247920	253760	For instance, when you see an unarmed man shot by police, usually black. Of course,
253760	258480	this video was made in 2012, before Black Lives Matters really came into the spotlight.
259040	263280	What are Health Ranger Mike Adams' thoughts on police officers murdering innocent people?
264000	272400	Oh, that's, um, oh, that's a hot take. Sorry for the pun. But putting aside any Twitter hot take,
272400	279200	he consistently tweets about BLM. But by BLM, he means the Bureau of Land Management. It's
279200	284640	strange that he never thought of trying to turn that into a hashtag. Until September 2015, when
284640	289440	the Black Lives Matter movement really picked up steam on Twitter. So what he's trying to do is
289440	296880	hijack the BLM hashtag to support white ranchers taking over a government building. Charming dude.
298240	305120	That braces us for the next section. R.J. Rummel at the University of Hawaii has extensively studied
305120	311120	what's called democide, the term describing death by government. According to his extensive
311120	317200	research through over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have
317200	325360	been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. That's six times as many people have
325360	332080	died from government-inflicted murder than have died in battle. In other words, if you think war
332080	339600	is bad, a monopoly of violence in the hands of government is far worse. All right, let's talk
339600	346160	about Rudolph Joseph Rummel. He came up with the term democide, which is used to describe when
346160	352400	government murders its own citizens. His stats on democide are widely circulated on Infowars and
352400	358080	other nonsense websites. And of course, these stats are, at best, contentious, as Rummel seems to take
358080	363360	the highest possible number of dead in every instance. As an example, the number of those
363360	369040	murdered by the government in China was originally considered to be 35 million in Rummel's first book
369040	374880	on the subject in 1991, but later he decided that the government was also responsible for the 38
374880	382640	million killed by famine. So he revised that figure of 35 million to 72 million in his 2005 book.
383440	388160	Maybe that's a fair assessment. I'm not really interested in being a malapologist here,
388160	392720	but I'm not convinced Rummel's stats can be considered authoritative if he's literally
392720	396400	doubling them when he finds a new degree of responsibility towards the government.
397280	401920	That said, it's difficult to engage with an academic who is written so prolifically on a
401920	407440	subject, especially when I have literally never heard of him outside of an Infowars website.
407440	413760	But as you might not be surprised, very little of what Rummel has to say, at least from my research,
413760	418320	has anything to do with gun control. The closest I could find was this quote.
437440	444000	As a family member. As one simply seeking happiness. Most of what one does now is subject
444000	450160	to government rules, regulations, and laws, and can be vetoed by judges or bureaucrats who are
450160	458320	backed up ultimately by the gun. That kind of makes him sound like he'd be a fellow traveler with
458320	463760	Mike Adams in his ilk, but it still doesn't go anywhere towards a stance on gun control.
464480	470640	If someone can point me towards Rummel's thoughts on gun control, I'd be highly curious. Rummel is
470640	476880	very much a fan of classical liberalism, kind of an ominous term nowadays, although he was talking
476880	482640	about that well before it was cool with the centrists. But when Rummel talks about the
482640	488640	concentration of power, he's talking about the difference between democracies and communist
488640	493520	states. He very much comes across as someone who bought into the red scare, and it's strange how
493520	497600	he pays close attention to the communist governments failing their people like the famine
497600	502240	in Mao's China, but he seems less interested in acknowledging how many people have died from a
502240	507680	lack of healthcare or due to homelessness in democracies. Apparently he doesn't see this as
507680	513360	the responsibility of a government in a democracy. Adams tries very hard to tie gun control to the
513360	519520	stats presented by Rummel, but Rummel's work is pretty explicitly about democracy. And Adams
519520	523920	doesn't understand that democracy is not a product of an armed standoff, it's a divide that
523920	530160	can't be bridged in an eight minute documentary, or by an idiot. Halfway into this mini talk,
530880	538720	shit starts getting weird. Really weird. And because the right to self-defense is a divine right,
539360	545120	those who act to erode or nullify such a right are acting in violation of nature,
545120	550080	and in violation of our creator, those who support gun disarmament in...
551680	556720	First I want to hold on to this image, because this woman perfectly captures my response to the
556720	563520	idea of God having given people guns. As a non-believer, I'm not really sure what to say to this
563520	572160	except... Wow. As I mentioned earlier, this is actually part two of a documentary. That first
572160	578560	part of the documentary was titled The Divine Right of Self-Defense, and it's about how animals
578560	584560	defend themselves sometimes with projectiles like the spitting cobra. I want to play a very short
584560	589040	clip from this first documentary to show some of the sound effects Mike has added to this little
589040	594960	squirrel. The California ground squirrel is known to distract predators such as the rattlesnake and
595040	600080	gophersnake from locating their nest burrows by kicking sand into their eyes.
601360	607120	So intense. Anyway, I'm not going to really talk about that video much more. It basically says the
607120	612560	same things in this video while throwing in some shade towards police officers and plenty of other
612560	618400	examples of animals throwing things, projecting things at each other. The gun control is genocide
619120	626960	itself. It's really called gun control is genocide. I still can't get over that. The
626960	632320	doc dates itself by talking about the shooting at the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012
632320	639040	where gunfire killed 12 and wounded 58. I'd also like to note how strange it is to think that this
639040	646320	was only six years ago. This seems so far away, so far back in the past, and thinking about how
646320	651600	little has been done to change this. It makes much of Adams's commentary seem even stupider,
652480	659760	if that's possible. In banning concealed carry weapons in the hands of legal and lawful owners
659760	666400	in their city, Aurora officials created precisely the conditions that allowed a massacre to result
666400	673200	in a large body count. They forced the citizens to be defenseless, even while knowing their own
673280	679600	police forces could not provide protection to everyone. Aurora may, in fact, have been
679600	685040	selected by the shooter precisely because the city's gun restriction laws would practically
685040	691600	guarantee a disarmed crowd. Laws that ban concealed carry, it turns out, create what
691600	700000	might be called a hunting preserve for psychopaths. Another wow moment. I usually don't see such a
700000	704960	fluid stream of nonsense every day, but hey, the internet is a magical place like that.
705840	711360	First off, the idea that gun control would have no effect on the 2012 shooting is ridiculous.
711360	715760	The shooter, James Holmes, had visited three different psychiatrists, and one of them had
715760	720320	described him as having homicidal thoughts that didn't prevent Holmes from going out
720320	725600	and legally buying three guns in the weeks leading up to the shooting. In the interest of
725600	730080	balance, let me be a dirty centrist for a moment here because there's a caveat to that.
730080	734960	The psychiatrist who noted Holmes' tendency towards homicidal thoughts decided not to put
734960	739920	him on a mental health hold because she believed he was borderline and putting Holmes on hold would
739920	745280	have inflamed him. That might put the onus on her, but keep in mind that someone put on mental
745280	751440	health hold, which means 72 hours or less at a mental health facility, does not have to give up
751440	756880	any guns they may have purchased before being put on hold. And yeah, Holmes had purchased a gun
756880	762320	weeks prior to the psychiatrist noticing his homicidal thoughts. If police were given the power
762320	767200	to confiscate the weapons of a man with homicidal thoughts, and if mental health professionals could
767200	772400	be confident that putting someone on hold would ensure that they then wouldn't be able to go out
772400	778640	and easily kill some people afterwards, it might have helped things. But this is getting pretty
778640	781760	heavy, so I hope Mike can cheer us up with something.
808640	820160	Hold on, what the fuck is this? Did Mike Adams record this? Is this some kind of
821680	827920	first-person home invasion fantasy he's showing us? Oh god, Mike, these are home videos you shouldn't
827920	833680	be sharing with the world to make fun of. And oh god, Mike, do you have any more of these?
833680	841280	Anyway, back to the prayer. I pray that we see through the propaganda and the deception
841280	846640	of citizen disarmament politics. He doesn't talk about this in the video, but I want to mention it
846640	853840	anyway. What is up with these pro-gun people and Nazis? Can they really not think of any other
853840	860080	examples of countries with gun control laws without mentioning the Nazis? Modern Germany
860080	865840	has gun control laws and seemed like it's more similar to the US than the Germany of the 1930s.
866640	871840	The gun laws of Germany in 1938 actually made owning firearms much easier for the average
871840	876720	German citizen. It restricted gun ownership of Jewish people, but plenty of Jewish people
876720	881440	actually had guns leading right up to the Holocaust. Turns out that owning guns wasn't
881440	888080	enough to stop state violence. But perhaps an engaged political class that stands in solidarity
888080	894400	with a persecuted minority might be a stronger deterrent. What does Mike Adams have to say about
894400	903760	Black Lives Matter again? Oh yeah. I'll spare you the rest of the prayer when Mike Adams reads out
903760	910560	for us, especially since it's got a lot of images of dead bodies and even worse, more of Adams's
910560	914880	drivel. He never really addresses the fact that dozens of countries around the world have
914880	919840	thoughtful gun legislation and have not descended into some kind of Nazi hellscape.
921280	927040	Responding to Adams's use of rumble, his sighting of the Holmes case, and even discussing Nazi gun
927040	932560	laws introduces nuance and complexity that you don't see in his work. Even at only eight minutes,
932560	938320	the video still makes the same tired points repeatedly without adding anything new. I didn't
938320	943440	know you could get this repetitive with such little real estate. The simplistic trappings
943440	947840	of people like Adams are so effective, not just because they mislead, but also because they
947840	953360	nullify discussion, or at least make it very difficult for anyone with a rebuttal. Gun control
953360	958960	is genocide. When you put it that simply, anyone who wants to believe such an obvious lie will
958960	965040	swallow any garbage you present them, even things that are obviously not true. And while I hope this
965040	971760	response went some way into debunking his falsehoods, I suspect that Adams's fans don't really care.
971760	977280	He's telling them something they want to believe, and that's enough. In the future, I want to try
977280	983040	something different. I imagine we'll still be laughing at buffoons like Mike Adams, but reacting
983040	988400	and debunking only gets us so far. I want to understand where people like Mike Adams come from
988400	994000	and what drives them to spread garbage information. It's probably just money, isn't it?
