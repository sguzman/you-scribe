0	12160	When I first thought about responding to a PragerU video, I was going to fact check one
12160	17160	of their convoluted distorted fact dump videos, like this one titled, Conservatives Are the
17160	19280	Real Environmentalists.
19280	23040	When President Trump announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate
23040	27520	Accord, environmentalists warned of imminent disaster.
27520	33080	But a year later, it turned out that the United States led the world in reducing carbon
33080	34280	emissions.
34280	38040	It did so without surrendering its national sovereignty.
38040	41840	The claim here is that the U.S. brought down emissions, all while ignoring the Paris Climate
41840	42840	Agreement.
42840	46280	Considering the Paris Agreement has no means of enforcing its goals, we don't get an
46280	51720	explanation for why leaving it helped, or why its policy would somehow stop the U.S.
51720	55440	from lowering its emissions, but apparently international agreements are somehow surrendering
55440	57040	national sovereignty.
57040	59360	The video doesn't dwell on stuff like that on purpose.
59360	62480	Let's take a closer look at the supposed hypocrisy here, though.
62480	66200	The U.S. is apparently the leader in reducing emissions, while the EU and China all had
66200	67200	increases.
67200	70880	Of course, if we actually look at the sources for these claims, we get a different picture.
70880	78560	In 2019, emissions went down in the United States by 140 megatons, or 2.9% of total emissions,
78560	81360	bringing the total to 4.8 gigatons.
81360	84040	Here is what the PragerU vid said about the EU.
84040	89880	The EU released an additional 40 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air that year.
89880	91720	So we now have this very clear comparison.
91720	95360	The U.S. is lowering emissions, while the EU is increasing them.
95360	101140	Except when you look at the IEA numbers, that PragerU used to trumpet the U.S.'s accomplishments,
101140	105360	we find out the EU has actually decreased its emissions, even more so than the U.S.,
105360	112520	with a drop of 160 megatons, or 5% of its total emissions, to reach 2.9 gigatons.
112520	117000	So in 2019, not only did the EU do a better job of lowering its emissions than the U.S.,
117000	119840	it also seems to be decreasing at a much faster rate.
119840	123240	So where did PragerU get its numbers that the EU's emissions have been going up?
123240	126200	Well, turns out there was a little bit of rhetorical trickery here.
126200	132240	The EU released an additional 40 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air that year.
132240	138720	Yet a year later, it turned out that the United States led the world in reducing carbon emissions.
138720	140680	We're not comparing the same years.
140680	145800	The PragerU video is looking at numbers that come from 2017, also cited by the IEA.
145800	149320	But if you look at their list of sources, they quote an article from Scientific American.
149320	154760	I can only imagine the reason PragerU didn't use the primary IEA source in its lengthy
154760	158280	list of sources, is they don't want the few people who actually read these sources
158280	162320	to notice that they're cherry picking data, deliberately choosing one of the U.S.'s better
162320	166120	years and comparing it to one of the EU's worst years, something that would be very
166120	169880	obvious if you were citing two IEA reports from different years.
169880	171520	And now I'm already exhausted.
171520	177320	It took me, what, three minutes to contend with about 30 seconds of nonsense from a PragerU
177320	178320	video.
178320	182680	That's why so many responses to PragerU videos, excellent as they may be, tend to stretch
182680	183680	on and on.
183680	187400	I didn't even get to the part where it ignores the per capita pollution stats when comparing
187400	191560	the U.S. to China, or even the supposedly extreme goals of the Paris Climate Agreement
191560	194040	don't go nearly far enough to combat climate change.
194040	197440	And if we're talking about reducing emissions, it shouldn't be seen as some sort of global
197440	198440	horse race.
199440	203600	It has to be looked at from the context of reducing global emissions in a way that will
203600	208080	positively impact the climate, and reduce the effects of climate change.
208080	211680	So this comparison between the EU and the U.S. as to who's doing a better job when
211680	216680	neither side is doing nearly as much as they should be, is pretty pointless.
216680	221360	And what PragerU videos do so well is stake out a conservative position, present moderation
221360	225840	as being on the extreme left, and then disguise their claims with half-truths and cherry pick
225840	226840	data.
226840	230560	Another result is a YouTube video that's the equivalent of conservative junk food,
230560	235560	no real substance, and arguments that completely sidestep the real issues.
235560	240500	So instead of a lengthy debunk, I want to talk about another PragerU video I found,
240500	243800	one of the emptiest videos I've come across in a while.
243800	249840	It's titled The Intolerance of Tolerance, presented by Greg Kochel.
249840	252400	Before I begin, you might be wondering who Greg Kochel is.
252400	255560	He's been banging on about tolerance meaning something different to the left for close
255560	256960	to 15 years.
256960	261720	He's a Christian apologist who affirms that evangelical Christianity is under direct
261720	262720	attack.
262720	268760	In a 2013 speech, also titled The Intolerance of Tolerance, he drops observations like this.
268760	275880	A sentiment, I think, began to change very rapidly regarding two religions.
275880	287040	Suddenly, our culture became much more sympathetic to Islam, and much more hostile to Christianity.
287040	291360	That's a statement so obviously not true, you barely even have to look at the spike
291360	296740	in hate crimes post-9-11 that has consistently stayed above previous levels.
296740	300160	And to look at the other half of his claim, we can look at the numbers against Christians,
300160	305120	and FBI stats from 2013, the year Kochel gave this speech, doesn't get granular enough
305120	306800	to look at evangelicals.
306800	311840	But even if we assume that all Protestants are evangelicals, they represent 3.8% of all
311840	318200	victims of hate crimes, a far cry from the 13.7% of victims being Muslim, especially
318200	322320	when you consider the relative size difference in these two populations.
322320	327260	And as for changes over time, if we compare to the pre-9-11 levels, Protestant Christians
327260	331880	have been around 3.6% of the victims of hate crimes, while back then Muslims were at about
331880	333640	2%.
333640	337960	So while Christian levels have been pretty even, anti-Muslim sentiment is very clearly
337960	338960	going up.
338960	341680	So yeah, this guy isn't exactly one for facts.
341680	346680	And this is a video that will absolutely prove that as he presents us a lot of rhetoric and
346680	348880	almost no facts or evidence.
348880	353040	What's exasperating about this video is how it uses imaginary positions that people
353040	354760	on the left supposedly have.
354760	355760	Here's one example.
355760	363080	To be tolerant today simply means you agree with politically correct, that is, left-wing
363080	364080	positions.
364080	365280	That's all it means.
365280	366800	This is easy to show.
366800	371840	Name one position that differs from the left that they don't label intolerant.
371840	378240	The evidence he provides that tolerance is a common refrain among the left is nothing.
378240	379240	Absolutely nothing.
379240	384520	Not even an anecdote, just a vague feeling that this is how the left operates.
384520	387320	It's a thing that could be true, I guess.
387320	392280	But it's hard to really say without any actual evidence about how true it may be.
392280	395280	Intolerance is then attached to a really cringy acronym.
395280	403000	As Dennis Prager puts it, six herb, sexist, intolerant, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic,
403000	405280	racist, bigoted.
405280	411120	So this is framing these labels as personal attacks, supposedly bypassing the actual arguments.
411120	415080	I would sooner argue that these labels are applied as a direct result of the arguments
415080	416080	being made.
416080	420280	So if someone is using a racial stereotype or trying to trot out bogus race science
420280	424520	as part of their argument, a type of rhetoric that has been shown to be damaging to certain
424520	428280	racial groups, why is it wrong to call it racist?
428280	431960	It's possible to use one of those labels incorrectly, of course, but they describe
431960	436480	things that still exist in the real world to deny that they exist, in effect, provides
436480	440080	better camouflage for racists to sneak in their arguments.
440160	443920	Here's another example of how this video misunderstands rhetoric on the left.
443920	449080	The left says all behaviors and ideas have equal value, that no behavior or idea is any
449080	450600	better than any other.
450600	452240	They don't act that way.
452240	454540	I have no idea what he's talking about here.
454540	458880	How can you agree that all ideas are equal when the left supposedly only favors ideas
458880	460120	on the left?
460120	463560	This is obviously being set up to pretend the left is being hypocritical and apply value
463560	465560	judgments just like people on the right do.
465560	470040	The only problem is, no one on the left believes or has ever claimed to believe that all ideas
470560	472520	and behaviors are equal.
472520	477400	Ascribing a belief to the left that isn't true and then calling him up for hypocrisy
477400	480280	that doesn't exist is a complete waste of time.
480280	483980	It's much more convenient for Coco's argument to pretend this is true, and once again we
483980	486640	get no evidence that the left believes any of these things.
486640	489600	We're just supposed to assume that it's true.
489600	493960	Eventually, though, we do get some evidence of the left supposedly using those bad labels
493960	495760	to silence discussion.
495760	501400	Two news stories are cited, one of JK Rowling facing backlash for a comment considered transphobic
501400	505480	and another news story of Martina Navratilova facing similar criticism.
505480	508760	The problem is, when you look at the sources for these stories, you find the criticisms
508760	512960	are pretty fair and make thoughtful responses, they don't just scream transphobe and move
512960	513960	on.
513960	519040	The Fox article details why JK Rowling's tweet was transphobic, providing the backstory,
519040	523040	context, and Rowling's own personal history with statements that have upset a segment
523040	524040	of her fanbase.
524480	528840	I especially like the one that was directed towards Navratilova after she wrote transgender
528840	531680	women could not fairly compete against cis women.
531680	537560	This comes from Athlete Ally, an advocacy group for LGBTQ people in sports that expelled
537560	540040	Navratilova from their advisory board.
540040	545400	Athlete Ally unequivocally stands on the side of trans athletes and their right to access
545400	548480	and compete in sport free from discrimination.
548480	553400	Martina Navratilova's recent comments on trans athletes are transphobic.
553440	558640	If you stopped reading at transphobic, yeah, I guess it would just seem like they're labeling
558640	563200	her transphobic and calling it a day, but they go on to describe why they use that term
563200	565800	and why it's very fitting to the statements she made.
565800	571000	Based on a false understanding of science and data, and perpetuate dangerous myths that
571000	577160	lead to the ongoing targeting of trans people through discriminatory laws, hateful stereotypes,
577160	579960	and disproportionate violence.
579960	585520	It seems respectful, thoughtful, and reframed for making any personal judgments about Navratilova.
585520	590480	Just because someone says something transphobic doesn't necessarily make them a transphobe,
590480	594760	although I would say it's strong evidence to support that claim, but I respect the restraint
594760	595760	here.
596760	602080	Anytime comments can be labeled as hateful, folks like Kocal take it personally.
602080	606720	It seems there is no way to adequately describe anything considering transphobic or bigoted
606720	608760	without running into that problem.
608760	612720	Here is Kocal describing what he hears when he's called intolerant.
612720	615880	The conversation is about Mr. Kocal's personality.
615880	616880	Right?
616880	620920	Mr. Kocal's intolerant, Mr. Kocal's arrogant, Mr. Kocal's narrow-minded.
620920	623520	I guess you're saying that I'm mean.
624280	626200	Whoa, all right!
626200	628880	Why don't I just agree to that?
628880	631800	Why don't I agree with you that I'm really mean?
631800	635600	And then we'll just settle that issue, and we can set it aside, and we can get back to
635600	638000	what we're supposed to be talking about here.
638000	641200	Intolerant is often used as a more polite way of describing views that could be considered
641200	646200	bigoted or hateful, not every time of course, but with regard to, say, the earlier examples
646200	647200	of J.K.
647200	651200	Rowley and Martina Navratilova, yes, I would say that claiming trans people are not the
651200	655120	gender they say they are, denying their existence and perpetuating a social order
655120	659480	that increases their social isolation, leading to real mental and physical harm, is a form
659480	660480	of intolerance.
660480	664040	It's so much easier to call those statements what they are.
664040	665040	Transphobic.
665040	667800	It doesn't mean that the person saying them has to be thrown into a gulag.
667800	670600	It does mean that they should rethink their comments.
670600	674680	What this video is supposedly arguing for is treating all people as equally valuable,
674680	676080	not their ideas.
676080	681960	True tolerance means we treat all people as equally valuable, with kindness and with
681960	687840	civility and with the freedom to express their ideas, even when we disagree with them.
687840	689480	If we did not challenge J.K.
689480	694000	Rowley or Martina Navratilova when they said things that could be considered transphobic,
694000	697320	or at least didn't challenge them in the ways they used names they didn't like being
697320	701920	called, are we perhaps ignoring the real harm created by transformative rhetoric?
701920	706640	I think it's important to confront people's ideas and label them what they are when they
706640	708800	clearly demonstrate those qualities.
708800	713640	A fuller critique, yes, does go into detail why those things are bad, but to say that
713640	719600	the label itself is shutting down conversation when it really is just a response to a statement,
719600	723640	putting it into a context, and attaching to it an understanding that is being denied by
723640	726240	people who'd rather not these words be applied.
726240	728120	It's not the label that's the problem.
728120	730080	It's what the label represents.
730080	734200	A popular understanding in the culture that they are, in fact, wrong.
734200	738000	And let's not pretend that only the left applies labels to people.
738000	741240	This is obviously not tolerance.
741240	743800	This is blatant intolerance.
743800	748760	Your accusers are guilty of doing exactly the same thing they're accusing you of doing.
748760	752520	If we're going to use this dopey argument that the left uses the word intolerant as
752520	757100	a cudgel to stifle debate, as soon as he applies the label intolerant on me, I could just use
757100	761500	the same tactic he does and say he's trying to hijack the debate, calling me a name, and
761500	764100	I could easily ignore the substance of what he's saying.
764100	768140	I hope you noticed I didn't actually do that, I responded to most of his video here.
768140	772380	I'm not going to pretend my feelings are so badly hurt that being called intolerant
772380	777060	has completely stopped me from making my arguments and countering his.
777060	780820	What this entire discussion is about isn't about the labels, it's the feelings people
780820	781820	have when they're applied.
781820	785740	We're being asked to spare the feelings of people who want impunity to use rhetoric
785740	787380	that harms others.
787380	791040	Videos like this read to me like conservatives are waving the flag of defeat, they have no
791040	794100	real arguments left and are instead trying to police our language.
794100	796460	That's why this video is so devoid of any real substance.
796460	801100	In fact, there's a PragerU video from July of 2018 starring Dave Rubin that says a lot
801100	803340	of the same things already.
803340	805980	It was titled, So You Think You're Tolerant.
805980	811500	The left, sadly, has become utterly intolerant of anyone with whom they disagree.
811500	815660	The videos are so similar that the sources cited are literally copied and pasted from
815660	817020	one video to the next.
817020	821220	The Kokol video also does this to another PragerU video starring Michael Moles.
821220	825720	Technically, this isn't plagiarism because PragerU is just copying itself, but it does
825720	829500	show us how these talking points get repeated with nothing of substance being added, and
829500	833780	that this video is offering no facts or evidence of its own, just recycling the same complaints
833780	835460	as seen in other videos.
835460	838780	Looking at the list of sources for the Kokol video, we can see how much effort went into
838780	839860	his thesis.
839860	843740	Of the 24 sources cited, here are the unique ones.
843740	848340	We have the Vox article on J.K. Rowling and the Nation article on Martina Navratilova.
848340	851100	There are three other PragerU videos cited.
851100	854940	There's a quotation from philosophy professor Peter Krieft.
854940	859260	Kokol cites the YouTube speech I pulled clips from in this video, and he cites his own website
859260	860740	five times.
860740	863020	Of those five links, four of them are broken, by the way.
863020	864420	You might want to get that fixed.
864420	869340	I'd say something quick about citing yourself that's actually a completely legitimate move.
869340	872900	If you're citing something published through a third party, like an academic journal or
872900	878660	reputable media outlet, but citing your own website or your own speech, that adds nothing.
878660	881260	That's just you saying the same thing twice.
881260	886660	The other 11 sources are lifted directly from other pages, sometimes copied and pasted verbatim,
886660	890020	often referring to news stories that aren't mentioned in the video at all.
890020	892300	Not that anyone reads these sources, of course.
892300	896140	One of the sources cited is a video by Michael Knowles, and when I clicked on it, I saw it
896140	897780	had 46 views.
897780	901620	To sum this up, this video is devoid of value and free of facts and effort.
901620	904680	It is conservative junk food.
904680	908980	As a small code up to my people on the left, sometimes we can be a little mean and could
908980	913620	be a little bit nicer, but don't fall for these sort of crocodile tears from people
913620	917820	on the right who say they simply cannot engage with debate on the left because we use these
917820	918820	mean names.
918820	924120	It's just a trick to get us to stop using terms that have real value and impact.
924120	927140	The statement from Athlete Ally summed it up so beautifully.
927140	931200	When we use the word transphobic, we're describing something that's presenting a false understanding
931200	935320	of science and data that perpetuates dangerous myths that leads to the ongoing targeting
935320	939560	of trans people through discriminatory laws, hateful stereotypes, and disproportionate
939560	940640	violence.
940640	942360	That's what the word transphobic means.
942360	946220	When people say we use it to shut down arguments, that's not true.
946220	950820	We're responding to their statements by describing them for what they actually are.
950820	953500	They want to pretend transphobic means nothing.
953500	958280	That seems more like them shutting down the argument because we used a word that they
958280	959560	simply don't like.
961960	963240	Yeah, another short video.
963240	967360	I don't know if I'm going to make this a habit or not, but this was fun to make.
967360	969840	And this one was a little rough around the edges.
969840	972000	I hope not too rough.
972000	973400	The big video is still coming.
973400	977560	I don't know when, sadly, maybe in the next three weeks.
977560	980360	I hope I genuinely don't know.
980360	982720	It's another one of my sitcom retrospectives.
982720	985320	It's literally the longest video I've ever done.
985320	987040	And I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
987040	990920	I think it's one of my better videos, so I really hope people will see it soon.
990920	994200	And for people wondering when the next conservative book review is coming, I am halfway through
994200	998200	a book that is just the most racist thing I've ever read.
998200	999200	It's...
999200	1000200	It's...
1000200	1001200	Wow.
1001200	1002200	It's going to be a wild one.
1002200	1003720	Everyone should look forward to that.
1003720	1008280	The lovely names you now see moving up the screen are my delightful patrons.
1008280	1012440	If you would like to be one of these delightful people, you can head over to my Patreon and
1012440	1015040	sign up for a monthly donation.
1015040	1018600	Once again, please only do this if it's something you can financially do.
1018600	1019600	These are trying times.
1019600	1023720	So if this isn't a realistic option for you, don't do it.
1023720	1027320	But if it is, I appreciate anything anyone can spare.
1027320	1031360	If you would like to support this channel in some way that doesn't involve signing
1031360	1036080	up to my Patreon, you can do the YouTube usual, as I've just decided I'm going to call it
1036080	1040920	like, comment, and if you haven't already, subscribe, and hit the bell.
1040920	1043840	If you'd like to leave a comment but don't know what to say, tell me what your favorite
1043840	1046400	song is, and I will listen to it.
1046400	1047400	That sounds fun.
1047400	1051760	Thank you everyone for watching, and I hope you all have a lovely day.
