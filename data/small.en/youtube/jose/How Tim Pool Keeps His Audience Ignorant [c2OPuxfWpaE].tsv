800	4360	This video was originally recorded on December 28th.
4360	7120	Things clearly have changed a lot,
7120	9840	especially with the events that happened on January 6th
9840	11140	in Washington, D.C.
11140	13080	I recorded several minutes
13080	15020	and placed them at the end of this video.
15020	17760	The rest of the video is as it was originally recorded,
17760	19800	and I hope the conclusion will tie it together
19800	21160	in a way that makes sense.
22160	23360	The world is weird, it makes me mad,
23360	26400	but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.
26400	31600	When someone tunes into a news commentary channel,
31600	33640	they're expecting two different things,
33640	34960	to learn about the news of the day
34960	38000	and be provided with a context in which to understand it.
38000	39800	This is the basis for most YouTube channels
39800	41200	that comment on the news.
41200	42480	They're all structured the same way,
42480	45760	with a brief rundown of the story and then some analysis.
45760	47600	Depending on the political leanings of the channel,
47600	50040	you can get news from whatever point on the political spectrum
50040	51880	you might be interested in hearing from.
51880	53920	And correspondingly, their choice of stories
54040	57080	and how they're presented will reflect that worldview.
57080	59160	It's true of every political YouTube channel,
59160	60000	this one included.
60000	63000	You're never getting the capital T truth about anything,
63000	64520	rather you're getting the perspective
64520	66000	of the person speaking.
66000	67760	Which brings us to Tim Pool.
67760	69480	Across his three YouTube channels,
69480	71560	he publishes multiple videos daily.
71560	74240	This can mean he uploads six or seven different videos
74240	77400	from 10 to 30 minutes in length on his main two channels,
77400	79280	Tim Pool and Timcast,
79280	82600	and videos that can stretch on for four hours
82600	85160	on his Timcast IRL channel.
85160	87840	Tim Pool's main two channels focused exclusively
87840	90040	on his own perspective on the news of the day.
90040	91760	And his perspective provides his audience
91760	93800	with a selection of news stories and analysis
93800	95400	that makes them less informed
95400	98360	after having watched one or more of his videos.
98360	99480	Here's a quick example.
99480	100320	Back in mid November,
100320	102360	the United States was seeing another surge
102360	103560	in COVID infections.
103560	105480	Now imagine you're someone who goes to Tim's channel
105480	107360	looking for the latest update on COVID.
107360	109320	On November 17th, 2020,
109320	110760	you would find a video titled,
110760	114240	stores stripped as COVID lockdown sparks panic.
114240	117440	Tucker Carlson warns of the great reset.
117440	119480	The main thrust of this video is some commentary
119480	121360	about how the threat of COVID is overblown,
121360	123280	tests may not be trustworthy,
123280	125680	and that there's some kind of nefarious plot
125680	128800	with the elites trying to reshape society.
128800	130280	Here's how Tim breaks down
130280	132280	the increasing number of COVID cases.
132280	136720	Number of US deaths per day has not spiked.
136720	138680	Look at where it was early on.
138760	141960	And now it's actually, there's a spike right here.
141960	143040	It's a little spike.
143040	145080	It's going up and we're worried about that.
145080	148480	And I can understand saying we need to take precautions
148480	150320	to prevent this spike from skyrocketing,
150320	152320	but take a look at cases.
152320	154320	Number of new infections per day is higher
154320	155640	than it's ever been,
155640	158800	but the death rate is way, way, way down.
158800	162520	I'm not convinced we're facing extreme circumstances just yet.
162520	166040	It makes no sense to destroy the lives of so many people.
166040	167320	Number of cases are going up,
167360	168960	but since deaths remained low,
168960	171080	Tim says the danger is being overblown.
171080	173280	He repeated this in a November 18th video
173280	176920	titled, Protests Overforced, Vaccinations Erupt,
176920	181080	Democrats Openly Violate Lockdown, Dark Winter is Coming.
181080	182760	That's really ominous.
182760	185240	Right now, the fact we can point out
185240	187960	is that hospitalizations are not going up
187960	189960	and deaths are only spiked a little bit,
189960	191040	not as bad as it was.
191040	192800	It went up and then it went back down.
192800	194480	Now let's compare this to some commentary
194480	196360	from another commentator, Sam Seder,
196360	198880	in a video a few days prior, November 13th,
198880	203720	titled, Sam Breaks Down the Startly New COVID Numbers.
203720	207320	Hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators.
207320	212120	So what's going on today in terms of infections
212120	214160	is going to implicate hospitalizations
214160	216400	two to three weeks from now.
216400	219080	It's gonna be a really tragic lesson
219080	224080	for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.
224080	225920	This is not to mention, you know,
225920	227960	the implications, long-term implications
227960	231440	for a lot of people of getting COVID.
231440	234760	It is, we're just watching this slow motion tragedy.
234760	237360	A very different prognosis.
237360	239480	What Tim sees as alarmism orchestrated
239480	241720	by a group of elites to enact their agenda,
241720	243360	Sam presents as a real danger
243360	245600	that will lead to higher death rates in the near future.
245600	246960	With the benefit of hindsight,
246960	249520	we can very easily see who got this one right.
249520	251520	Throughout December, deaths have been skyrocketing
251520	252640	in the United States,
252640	255920	with reports now regularly reaching over 3,000 a day.
255920	258760	And this isn't a case of a commentator having psychic powers.
258760	260520	It's been well known for a while that,
260520	263520	when it comes to indicators on the severity of the COVID crisis,
263520	265680	deaths are a lagging indicator,
265680	268240	typically lagging behind infections.
268240	270440	That's because after being diagnosed with COVID,
270440	273640	people usually have two weeks before the symptoms get serious.
273640	276360	So if there's an increase in the number of cases being reported,
276360	277720	a spike in the number of deaths
277720	279840	is likely to occur a few weeks later.
279840	281840	The fact that Tim looked at both numbers
281840	284280	of infections and number of deaths on the same day
284280	285600	without mentioning this fact,
285600	287040	and if anything providing commentary
287040	290000	that ran contrary to the idea that a big spike was coming,
290000	293280	left his audience misinformed about the danger of COVID-19.
293280	296720	This is one small example of how Tim keeps his audience ignorant.
296720	298680	In a look at the sources used by Tim Pool
298680	300560	from a sample of his videos in 2020,
300560	302960	the numbers reveal that the vast majority of Tim Pool's sources
302960	303920	are right-wing,
303920	307440	accounting for 59% of the sources he uses in his videos.
307440	309400	But even more than that, Tim's attitudes
309400	311480	towards the media sources he uses
311600	312880	and the sources he presents
312880	314920	reveals even more about his commentary.
314920	317800	Here's an example of how Tim speaks about the mainstream media.
317800	320200	The mainstream media has been lying to them
320200	322200	and covering up these stories.
322200	324000	They don't get it.
324000	325480	How insane is it?
325480	327320	When he speaks about right-wing media,
327320	328960	his tone quickly shifts.
328960	333160	For example, here are some comments he made about right-wing populist Tucker Carlson.
333160	337360	Tucker Carlson has once again saved the world.
337360	339960	Yes, I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek,
339960	341440	but to a certain extent,
341440	343400	you could say Tucker Carlson literally saved the world.
343400	344960	Wow, okay.
344960	348120	This reveals a very clear bias towards right-wing media,
348120	349880	one that colors Tim's commentary,
349880	352600	giving it a distinctly right-wing slant.
352600	356040	He'll accuse the far-left media, at least in his mind,
356040	358960	of taking every opportunity to advance its agenda,
358960	362240	whereas Tucker Carlson, who is at the very least
362240	365920	also pushing an agenda, is some kind of savior.
365920	367400	When you take that into consideration,
367400	369920	it's not surprising that most of the new stories he presents
369920	372160	come from a right-wing perspective.
372160	374240	This reliance on right-wing media
374240	377680	has led Tim to advance some questionable right-wing narratives,
377680	379840	most recently pushing the idea that Donald Trump
379840	382320	has a chance of retaining his presidency.
382320	385440	In the days following the November 3rd, 2020 federal election,
385440	387720	it became increasingly clear that Joe Biden
387720	390800	would be declared the next president-elect.
390800	393600	There's a fun supercut of all the times Tim pull predicted
393600	397880	a landslide victory for Republicans in that very election.
397880	399760	No amount of mail-in ballots will matter.
399760	404600	If Trump gets 537 or 36, or even 538,
404600	406240	every single electoral vote.
406240	408600	We all know Joe Biden will lose.
408600	409880	Like, let's be real, man.
409880	412400	As I've stated a million and one times,
412400	413560	Donald Trump's gonna win.
413560	414960	The Republicans are gonna sweep.
414960	419960	Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden has defeated Donald Trump.
420600	422440	Everything I've told you will be wrong
422440	424240	and completely meaningless.
424240	425680	So keep that in mind.
425680	428240	Since then, Tim has argued that he was only presenting
428240	430920	a hypothetical based on a story he read
430920	433760	and that he didn't think this was a likely outcome.
433760	435960	In the astronomical event that Donald Trump
435960	439280	somehow pulls off a triple hat trick in these states,
439280	442640	I'm gonna play that crab dancing song, Bagatcha, uh-huh.
442640	445240	Although it's not really what I meant back in the day,
445240	446800	but you know, several months ago when I was like,
446800	447840	I think this will lend itself
447840	449560	to a Donald Trump landslide victory.
449560	453200	As a reminder, he had made this prediction many, many times
453200	456480	and certainly within two months before the election.
456480	457480	I'll tell you what I think's gonna happen.
457480	458520	I think they're cheating.
458520	460000	I think Trump's gonna landslide.
460000	462920	I think Trump would have had a landslide no matter what.
462920	464480	I think the polls are fake.
464480	466760	And I think what's happening now is Trump's gonna win
466760	468800	and they're gonna say, ah, but he didn't really win.
468800	470480	Now that we've seen those fun clips,
470480	472480	let's talk about coping.
472480	474240	While some people are very happy to point out
474240	477000	that Tim is coping over being wrong in his predictions,
477000	478740	this is missing the more important part
478740	480440	of what's going on with Tim's channel.
480440	483640	His viewers don't turn in to watch him get high on copium.
483640	486000	They're going there for a fix themselves.
486000	488440	You see, Tim isn't a user.
488440	490400	He's a copium dealer.
490400	491320	Here's what I mean.
491320	494160	Although a Biden victory was increasingly obvious
494160	496840	following the days of the election as the votes were counted
496840	498320	and he had a clear lead,
498320	499940	you wouldn't know it looking at the titles
499940	502000	of many of Tim Poole's videos.
502000	505300	They read, Wisconsin lawmaker says electoral college
505300	509880	should reject results paving way for Trump win.
509880	513680	Major victory for GOP, judge rules mail-in voting
513680	515540	likely unconstitutional.
515540	519400	Trump may win or block PA.
519400	521820	Leftists and Democrats start panicking
521820	524400	as they realize Trump is actually winning
524400	526040	political victories.
526040	530160	These headlines are dripping with a Trump-flavored sweat
530160	532780	beckoning any of his supporters for a quick taste
532780	534640	of this delicious copium
534640	537280	with the promise that things are swinging in Trump's favor
537280	539380	that hope still lives on.
539380	542160	When it comes to the actual contents of these videos,
542200	544900	I would be misrepresenting them if I didn't mention that.
544900	547240	Tim believes that these various efforts
547240	550200	to win Trump the presidency are long shots.
550200	552440	He certainly does say that quite a bit,
552440	554720	but there's always a but.
554720	556960	I don't think it's very likely that Trump pulls this off.
556960	559480	I really, really don't, but he's a trying
559480	561600	and his argument seems to make sense.
561600	564120	You know, Joe Biden is gonna win this one,
564120	565460	but this is where it gets crazy.
565460	569000	So it may seem astronomical that Trump actually succeeds,
569000	570480	but he's gaining ground
570480	573860	in every place he needs to gain ground.
573860	574840	That's the best way to put it.
574840	576520	I've said over and over again
576520	578200	that it seems that the likely that Trump
578200	581640	actually pulls off some victory here is astronomical,
581640	582640	but possible.
582640	584440	And Tim was constantly pushing back
584440	585980	when it would be clear that Joe Biden
585980	588800	could be safely declared the president-elect.
588800	591520	At first he was saying it was December 14th
591520	593320	when the electoral college voted.
593320	595060	Until we get to this point
595060	597580	where we have certified results on the 14th,
597580	599260	then it was January 6th
599260	601340	when the results are tabulated by the vice president.
601340	603180	The vice president becomes president-elect
603180	605940	as far as I can tell on January 6th.
605940	608380	I was wrong before, I thought it was the 14th.
608380	611940	And then January 20th, the date of inauguration itself.
611940	614420	The only date that matters is January 20th
614420	615700	as per the constitution.
615700	617880	The impression this creates in the minds of his viewers
617880	620980	is that there might be something to this whole Trump comeback,
620980	623360	that there's a chance it could work.
623360	625380	Even though Tim personally doesn't believe it,
625380	627500	he's always quick to mention his opinion
628260	629100	but it doesn't really matter.
629100	631140	But it doesn't matter what I think as I often say.
631140	633860	Tim believes it's his job to deliver the news
633860	635900	and let his audience make of it what they will.
635900	638120	People wanna say Trump is gonna lose, fine, that's for them.
638120	639440	That's not what I do, okay?
639440	642300	I try to be rational, reasonable,
642300	644380	understand what's happening and tell you.
644380	647060	But it's the news he's choosing to deliver that matters.
647060	649520	Dozens of his videos were devoted to every morsel
649520	651420	of a chance he could spot of Donald Trump
651420	653360	overturning the results of the election.
653360	655980	Something that any Trump friend would be desperate to hear.
656020	657860	Part of delivering the copia means
657860	660540	not just choosing the right sources or spectacles
660540	662540	but also choosing the right stories.
662540	664680	The ones that will keep his audience hopeful
664680	666180	and keep them watching.
666180	668360	It isn't surprising to find dozens of comments
668360	670980	under his videos from desperate Trump fans.
670980	672980	Here are a few examples.
672980	674260	As a non-American,
674260	677260	I have to say Americans should never back down.
677260	678700	The future of the world and freedom
678700	680700	depend on Trump's winning.
680700	682480	We don't care about mass riots.
682480	685820	We care about getting it right and not turning into China.
685820	689260	Trump won PA by a landslide, it's clear.
689260	692180	Democrat sloppy cheating is so obvious.
692180	693640	It's legitimately disgusting
693640	696420	and only proves we live in a banana republic.
696420	698220	And Tim reinforces the actions
698220	700300	of Trump supporters at every turn.
700300	701140	If you're a Trump supporter,
701140	704080	you probably believe he's gonna do it.
704080	705900	While the left is saying Trump will lose
705900	707640	and the right is saying Trump will win.
707640	710100	There's rational moderate people saying like,
710100	712140	Trump might win, okay?
712140	713780	And that's how you make the copia.
713800	716300	Tim himself acknowledges how remote the chances are,
716300	718460	but by fixating on every minor development
718460	719780	and its implications,
719780	721620	he keeps hope alive in Trump supporters.
721620	723140	All the while hiding behind the idea
723140	725700	that he's only talking about something possible,
725700	728380	not necessarily something probable.
728380	729500	But when he says that,
729500	731420	he isn't doing it to inform his audience
731420	733100	of the realistic possibilities.
733100	735380	He's doing that to protect his own credibility.
735380	738140	If he was providing adequate commentary for these stories,
738140	740620	he would be highlighting how incredibly remote
740620	743500	and absurd it is to think that these will actually happen.
743520	745860	All of these stories are nonsense.
745860	748100	And while I could claim the benefit of hindsight
748100	749380	saying they wouldn't work out,
749380	752140	even at the time these were absurd long shots,
752140	754420	meant to just pump out video after video
754420	756500	presenting them as the next big chance
756500	757900	or a possible opportunity
757900	760100	for a change in the outcome of the election,
760100	762100	even with the little disclaimers,
762100	764820	simply isn't giving his audience an accurate depiction
764820	766500	of what's happening in the world.
766500	768620	It's only giving them false hope.
768620	770440	The reaction from his audience makes it clear
770440	772300	that anyone tuning into these videos
772300	774260	is doing so to hear about how Trump
774260	777700	might still get a second term in 2021.
777700	780220	And just to nail this point home a little bit harder,
780220	783180	I wanna highlight the short saga of the Texas lawsuit,
783180	784980	which would supposedly overturn the results
784980	787500	in several states Trump had lost during the election.
787500	789300	Tim got on the ground floor with this story
789300	791160	before it had been thoroughly undermined
791160	792700	by the mainstream media.
792700	795500	On Twitter, Tim expects patience on this revelation,
795500	798220	claiming that before making any statements on this new case,
798220	800540	we should wait and see how the Supreme Court ruled on it.
800540	802620	That same day, he released a video titled,
802620	805400	Texas just nuked Democrats from orbit
805400	810140	with SCOTUS lawsuit calling election unconstitutional.
810140	811540	Because Tim was lurking late at night,
811540	813940	this video came out early in the life cycle of this story
813940	816660	before the mainstream media had torn this story to pieces.
816660	818940	And blissfully ignorant of the real possibilities
818940	821800	of this working out, they were actually really low,
821800	824500	Tim is breathless in describing it.
824500	826780	They're probably gonna win this one, and this is huge.
826780	828320	This is gonna change the outcome of the election.
828320	830640	In my opinion, we'll see.
830640	831600	A few days later, though,
831600	833520	when the Supreme Court dismissed the case,
833520	836160	Tim takes a different tone in the video.
836160	839560	Texas GOP calls for new union of states
839560	843040	as SCOTUS denies lawsuit disputing election.
843040	845260	It's not over.
845260	847520	I'll tell ya, it is not over until Joe Biden
847520	850640	is in the White House, and even then, it might not end.
850640	851600	They don't get it.
851600	853400	They don't understand what's happening.
853400	856840	Tim went out on a limb for this story, and he got burnt.
856840	859400	It ended up going nowhere and doing nothing,
859400	861800	like every attempt Trump and his team have made
861800	863880	to change the results of the election.
863880	865480	But Tim can't have his audience walking away
865480	867760	from his videos feeling dejected and defeated,
867760	869300	and so he pushes the deadline
869300	872240	of when things will be over to never.
872240	874280	Things will never be over.
874280	877360	Trump supporters will never accept this election,
877360	880280	and soon, we're gonna have a civil war.
880280	882660	Tim's rule as copium dealers should be understood
882660	886360	as broadly anti-left and specifically pro-Trump.
886360	888660	That is to say, he's more likely to produce content
888660	891280	that attacks left-wing social views and politicians,
891280	893120	and more likely to defend right-wing ones
893120	895920	as they relate specifically to Donald Trump.
895920	897960	That isn't to say he never does the opposite
897960	899240	of either of those things.
899240	902200	It's just highly unlikely he'll either title a video
902200	904600	or spend most of his time praising the left
904600	906580	or criticizing Donald Trump.
906580	908840	What's quite striking is how protective he is
908840	910960	of Trump in general, especially the critiques
910960	912160	that come from the left.
912160	913680	Some of the better examples of this
913680	916160	are in the Timcast IRL channel,
916160	918200	where he has informal conversations with guests
918200	919800	and happened to invite individuals
919800	921220	who were to the left of him.
921220	923920	In the first case, on October 27th, 2020,
923920	927440	Tim spoke with YouTube political streaming personality, Bosch,
927440	930060	when speaking about Trump's response to the COVID pandemic.
930060	932880	Tim has a very strange defense of Trump's response.
932880	936280	We know Trump was given information and then lied about it.
936280	937760	And that's your opinion is?
937760	938680	That's not an opinion.
938680	939920	Yes, no, no, no, no, I'm saying,
939920	942720	and your opinion is he shouldn't have,
942720	945120	and mine is, I don't know,
945120	947080	maybe there would have been a panic, maybe there wouldn't.
947080	948600	I can't help but thank Tim's feelings
948600	951040	on government officials lying to the American public
951040	953360	has changed since this video came out.
953360	956160	Here's an example from a video less than three months later.
956160	957720	Anthony Fauci says, don't worry,
957720	958960	we can accomplish herd immunity.
958960	960560	And then he keeps moving the goalposts.
960560	961840	So he was lying the whole time.
961840	963200	That's authoritarianism.
963200	965920	The idea that you're too stupid as an individual,
965920	967160	that your rights don't matter
967160	969560	and that we should withhold information from you
969560	971400	because we're smarter than you.
971400	973360	Tim hates lying now,
973360	975080	or maybe it's only when someone
975080	976720	other than Trump is doing it.
976720	978560	And for the record, Fauci's reason
978560	981200	for changing the required herd immunity projection
981200	983120	was new scientific information
983120	984600	and his message is being tailored
984600	986960	to encourage as many Americans as possible
986960	988400	to take the vaccine.
988400	991880	It's a lot more complicated than branding Fauci a liar.
991880	994240	Anyway, let's get back to the conversation with Vosch.
994240	996920	What I'm trying to talk about is the totality of evidence
996920	998520	that he has mishandled this pandemic.
998520	999600	And it's interesting to me
999600	1002000	that you were extremely unwilling to criticize him for that.
1002040	1003480	Because what's the alternative?
1003480	1004320	The alternative.
1004320	1006560	What would have happened in any other circumstance
1006560	1008720	where we have no control group?
1008720	1009800	What am I supposed to say?
1009800	1011880	Well, the Trump would have backflip and saved a life.
1011880	1013560	How many would have had to have died
1013560	1015160	before you would criticize him?
1016080	1016920	I don't know.
1016920	1017760	Give me a number.
1017760	1018600	We don't know.
1018600	1020120	Wait, so you could have led a million?
1020120	1022840	So what you're telling me is that we have no idea
1022840	1024560	what would have happened if Trump did anything else.
1024560	1026840	And now we're supposed to make a determination.
1026840	1028120	The idea that you can't criticize
1028120	1030080	the Trump administration response
1030080	1032840	because we don't know for certain what the outcomes
1032840	1035080	of other courses of actions would be
1035080	1037480	deflates literally any criticism
1037480	1039720	someone can have for a past action.
1039720	1041680	And when Tim is confronted on this point,
1041680	1043080	his response is to point out
1043080	1046840	how he hasn't criticized Nancy Pelosi.
1046840	1049200	You are taking the choice to defend Trump.
1049200	1050760	You are the partisan here.
1050760	1053080	You're not a distanced anti-authoritarian.
1053080	1054520	You are standing with him.
1054520	1057280	And you are saying, yes, I am anti-authoritarian.
1057280	1058680	I am anti-establishment.
1058680	1060600	But also, we don't know if him
1060600	1062440	lying to the American people was bad.
1062440	1063440	It could have caused a panic.
1063440	1065080	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1065080	1065920	Can I make a video right now
1065920	1067720	where I just scream about Nancy Pelosi
1067720	1068640	causing all of the problems?
1068640	1069480	I haven't done that.
1069480	1071040	Although still strange,
1071040	1073560	the idea that he's not trying to attack either side
1073560	1075600	for the pandemic response,
1075600	1078240	this would be a consistent line of reasoning
1078240	1081280	if we hadn't heard Tim say this a few minutes earlier.
1081280	1083800	We had several governors praise Trump for his response
1083800	1085360	in, I think it was May.
1085360	1086200	Look, look, look.
1086200	1088680	A quarter of the deaths from COVID worldwide
1088680	1089920	in a country with four percent.
1089920	1091520	Nursing homes where the governors
1091520	1093800	of Democrat controlled states put sick people killing.
1093800	1095040	Wait, wait, wait, again, that's not good.
1095040	1096920	I feel like we're engaging in what aboutism, right?
1096920	1099720	We see that Tim is quite willing to blame Democrats
1099720	1102200	when it comes to defending the Trump administration.
1102200	1104120	But whenever Vosch had criticisms
1104120	1105840	for the Democrats throughout the stream,
1105840	1108360	Tim never felt the urge to balance out those
1108360	1109680	with a critique of Trump
1109680	1112720	or praising the Democrats in any way, shape, or form.
1112720	1114640	To be fair, in this conversation,
1114640	1117160	Tim lets criticism of Trump get some air
1117160	1118960	and offers a few himself.
1118960	1122280	I think Trump has very serious problems.
1122280	1123800	I think he lies often.
1123800	1125560	I think he's a blaggart.
1125560	1127080	He boasts, he won't shut up.
1127080	1129360	And I think most people know he's got a mouth
1129360	1133000	that he couldn't stop blabbing to save his own campaign.
1133000	1134720	I think he caused a lot of his own problems.
1134720	1137520	And there is an actual really great argument
1137520	1139680	that he should have been honest with the American people.
1139680	1142840	On the hours upon hours of Tim Pool content,
1142840	1145160	I watched to research this video.
1145160	1149080	That clip was the hardest I saw him go on Donald Trump.
1149080	1151240	We can see this behavior again in the conversation
1151240	1154120	with another political streaming personality, Destiny,
1154120	1156120	on December 3rd of the same year.
1156120	1157320	And Bolivia, when he kept trying to recognize-
1157320	1158280	Democrats did that too.
1158280	1159120	Regardless-
1159120	1161160	These conversations are especially revelatory
1161160	1163040	as we see Tim is often unable to counter
1163040	1164400	the arguments put against him
1164400	1166400	without digging into a rolodex of anecdotes
1166400	1168680	he seems to have citing fringe stories
1168680	1170200	and personal experiences,
1170200	1172080	counting on the fact that his guest
1172080	1173600	either hasn't heard of those stories
1173600	1175240	or doesn't have personal experiences
1175240	1177120	that run contrary to his.
1177120	1180040	It's very difficult to present academic research,
1180040	1181920	statistics, or other facts
1181920	1184800	to only hear them countered by some strange anecdote
1184800	1186120	you know few details of
1186120	1188400	and are only hearing from a single source.
1188400	1190720	And this is where Tim feels most comfortable,
1190720	1192160	not only in these discussions,
1192160	1194960	but all his videos thrive on this specific presentation
1194960	1198600	of reoccurring oddball stories he repeats endlessly.
1198600	1199880	And we can see what happens
1199960	1202560	when one of Tim's faulty claims is checked in real time.
1202560	1204880	He even said, we want to pressure you
1204880	1207280	so that you can make memories.
1207280	1209200	And do you remember when he said that, right?
1209200	1211480	He said, we want you to, you know,
1211480	1213320	when we pressure you this way,
1213320	1215520	then you can form memories.
1215520	1217360	I'm pretty sure exactly what he said was that
1217360	1218200	when we pressure you,
1218200	1220160	you're more likely to remember what actually happened
1220160	1221000	is what he said.
1221000	1221920	That under some pressure,
1221920	1223520	the truth will come out or whatever it was.
1223520	1225120	Ultimately, I think the argument is kind of pointless
1225120	1225960	on this one guy. Sure.
1225960	1227760	He moves on instantly.
1227760	1228920	And before moving on myself,
1228920	1231040	there's one comment I can't leave alone
1231040	1232560	from these conversations.
1232560	1235160	I was told in a matter of speaking to lie
1235160	1236520	on more than one occasion,
1236520	1238840	that if there is a certain bit of news reporting,
1238840	1240920	that's true, but would be offensive to our audience.
1240920	1242280	We don't report it.
1242280	1243880	We side with the audience.
1243880	1245280	That's what I was told to do.
1245280	1246920	Can you give me like a, not a specific example,
1246920	1248200	but like, what's like a general example of that?
1248200	1249040	What do you mean by that?
1249040	1250520	Let's say there's two guys in the street,
1250520	1251760	Proud Boy and Antifa.
1251760	1256040	And Antifa walks up and punches the Proud Boy in the face.
1256040	1258840	If I reported that Antifa punched a Proud Boy in the face,
1259640	1260480	that would be offensive to our audience.
1260480	1261320	We don't report it.
1261320	1262240	We have to side with the audience,
1262240	1264360	which means when the Proud Boy got back up
1264360	1266560	and punched Antifa back, that's what we report.
1266560	1268520	To hear this criticism from Tim,
1268520	1270840	who so fiercely sides with his own audience
1270840	1274480	and their absolute love of Trump is ridiculous.
1274480	1276800	Not that Tim acknowledges the pro-Trump elements
1276800	1279200	in his audience, as we can see here.
1279200	1280320	With this audience, I noticed,
1280320	1281320	I don't want to be too general,
1281320	1283760	but when I start to dump on Trump,
1283760	1285080	if I just start to insult him,
1285080	1287600	people get really angry at the other stuff I say
1287600	1288880	in the conversation.
1288880	1292440	If I don't trash Trump, I've noticed it, a trend,
1292440	1294400	because a lot of people that watch this show
1294400	1295920	seem to love him.
1295920	1297480	Well, you're looking at the comments.
1297480	1299760	I look at the comments, I'm talking about the text comments.
1299760	1301000	Yup, that's why a lot of the comments
1301000	1303880	are making fun of me quite a bit as well, especially now.
1303880	1305880	The idea that comments under his videos,
1305880	1307520	highly voted up ones no less,
1307520	1310000	are somehow not representative of his audience
1310000	1311440	is ridiculous.
1311440	1313600	His claim of controversy driving their popularity
1313600	1314760	is misleading.
1315760	1317080	And all of this brings me to the reason
1317080	1319080	I wanted to make this video in the first place.
1319080	1321600	I got a bit annoyed when I saw Tim Pool
1321600	1326600	starting to produce videos that promote vaccine skepticism.
1326600	1328200	Let's quote one thing out of the way,
1328200	1329040	he said,
1329040	1329880	he said,
1329880	1330720	he said,
1330720	1331560	he said,
1331560	1332400	he said,
1332400	1333240	he said,
1333240	1334080	he said,
1334080	1334920	he said,
1334920	1335760	he said,
1335760	1336600	he said,
1336600	1337400	he said,
1337400	1338240	he said,
1338240	1339080	he said,
1339080	1339920	he said,
1339920	1340760	he said,
1340760	1341600	he said,
1341600	1342440	he said,
1342440	1343280	he said,
1343280	1344120	he said,
1344960	1346040	right off the bat.
1346040	1349400	It would be wrong to call Tim an anti-vaxxer,
1349400	1351320	and he quite clearly states he thinks
1351320	1353800	there's probably nothing wrong with taking any vaccine
1353800	1355840	for the COVID-19 virus.
1355840	1356680	But,
1356680	1358280	and if you were paying attention in this video,
1358280	1359500	you knew there would be a but,
1359500	1361760	Tim is quite willing to play into the paranoia
1361760	1362880	around the vaccine,
1362880	1364580	including using techniques
1364580	1366820	that are common among anti-vaxxers.
1366820	1369400	In the December 17th, 2020 video titled,
1369400	1371680	Viral Video Shows Nurse Vaccination Syringe
1371680	1372900	was empty.
1372900	1377020	Media is the cause of vaccine fear mongering.
1377020	1379340	I think the mainstream media,
1379340	1381600	these news outlets are trying to freak us out
1381600	1382440	about the vaccine.
1382440	1383400	I mean it.
1383400	1385080	Tim is supposedly calling out the media
1385080	1387500	for creating skepticism about the vaccine.
1387500	1391020	Ironically, this is something he does in this very video.
1391020	1394200	Look, you have these PR events or whatever.
1394200	1395980	We don't need them.
1395980	1398120	It's the weirdest thing to me.
1398120	1399680	We have flu shots every year.
1399680	1401080	You tell people there's a flu shot,
1401080	1402600	have at it, we don't care.
1402640	1406320	The fact that Tim compares this to getting the flu shot
1406320	1408400	as if millions of people haven't had their lives
1408400	1410400	completely changed by this pandemic
1410400	1412360	demonstrates how he really likes to
1412360	1414920	downplay the impact this virus is having.
1414920	1416920	It's sort of true whenever he talks about the pandemic.
1416920	1419700	He never mentions that the virus itself is dangerous.
1419700	1423920	He mostly gets angry at lockdowns or dancing nurses.
1423920	1425960	I look at that and I get angry.
1425960	1427600	The first bit of evidence Tim shows us
1427600	1429640	is a news story from El Paso
1429640	1431760	about a local news report showing a nurse
1431760	1433360	receiving the vaccine,
1433360	1435320	but it appears the syringes plunger
1435320	1436860	had already been pushed in.
1436860	1438200	An event that, by the way,
1438200	1440480	had five different people receive the vaccine.
1440480	1443560	Why this story is getting any kind of coverage
1443560	1445080	is kind of weird.
1445080	1446640	There are hundreds of these stories out there,
1446640	1448620	especially on local news channels.
1448620	1450820	They want to present some positive developments
1450820	1452760	on this year-long pandemic.
1452760	1454280	This non-story got traction
1454280	1456920	because it was spread on social media as suspect.
1456920	1458720	Even if the event had been botched,
1458720	1461400	this speaks less to the efficacy of the vaccine
1461400	1463300	and more to the people who set up this event.
1463300	1466200	The dude literally did not receive a vaccine.
1466200	1469400	I'm casting the PR event in a negative light.
1469400	1471240	Oh, hey, Tim, got this one right.
1471240	1474520	And he wants to assure people that the vaccine is fine.
1474520	1477360	But there's always a but, isn't there?
1477360	1479320	This is the illusion of nuance
1479320	1481840	Tim loves to introduce to his audience.
1481840	1482880	But there can be side effects.
1482880	1485520	That's a fact, and you really should understand.
1485520	1487540	Here's an example of him providing
1487540	1490560	supposedly reasonable concerns about the vaccine.
1490560	1493360	There have been people who developed Bell's Palsy
1493360	1495760	after getting the vaccine.
1495760	1497880	They're saying, but it's not any different
1497880	1502040	than the natural statistics on people getting Bell's Palsy.
1502040	1504480	The issue is there's still the correlation.
1504480	1506000	There is no issue though.
1506000	1509200	For the 43,000 people who received the Pfizer vaccine,
1509200	1510880	four developed Bell's Palsy.
1510880	1512920	And of the 30,000 in the Moderna group,
1512920	1515800	three reported some degree of facial paralysis,
1515800	1517320	a symptom of Bell's Palsy.
1517320	1519400	The standard rate of developing some kind
1519400	1522240	of partial facial paralysis within the United States
1522240	1523520	is one in 10,000.
1523520	1525960	In other words, when Tim says there's a correlation
1525960	1529080	between receiving the vaccine and developing Bell's Palsy,
1529080	1530360	that isn't true.
1530360	1533200	A correlation would require the incidence
1533200	1536160	of partial facial paralysis to go up
1536160	1537360	after receiving the vaccine.
1537360	1539320	But since it stays the same,
1539320	1542040	there is no evidence of a correlation.
1542040	1544240	But I'm not a medical expert.
1544240	1546280	My basic understanding of math aside,
1546280	1548400	let's see what a medical expert says.
1548440	1550600	Here's a quote from Dr. Irene Kim,
1550600	1552680	assistant professor of head and neck surgery
1552680	1554800	and director of the Facial Nerve Center
1554800	1558640	in the Division of Facial Plastic Surgery at UCLA,
1558640	1560880	who echoes the FDA when she says,
1560880	1563040	the information we have is insufficient to say
1563040	1564760	that there is a causal relationship
1564760	1566960	between Bell's Palsy and the vaccine.
1566960	1568040	Back to Tim's video.
1568040	1569680	He overstates another side effect
1569680	1572600	when talking about anaphylaxis.
1572600	1576160	I believe anaphylaxis was a point,
1576160	1579840	I think it was a 0.685% probability.
1579840	1583280	So that's like one in 160 or so.
1583280	1586240	I'm not sure where he got the specific figure from.
1586240	1587400	When he tweeted about this,
1587400	1590080	he included a link to a Euronews article,
1590080	1594560	though the 0.685% number is nowhere to be found.
1594560	1598000	I suspect Tim is getting this rate of 0.685%
1598000	1603000	from the Pfizer study in which 0.63% of the 22,000 people
1603360	1606720	who received the vaccine reported hypersensitivity-related
1606720	1609600	adverse effects compared to the 0.51%
1609600	1610880	who received the placebo.
1610880	1613920	Most importantly, Pfizer said there were no cases
1613920	1615360	of anaphylaxis.
1615360	1617800	And to clarify what anaphylaxis is,
1617800	1619960	one definition I found describes it as,
1619960	1623200	a serious life-threatening allergic reaction.
1623200	1626160	This is the most serious type of allergic reaction
1626160	1629280	a person can get, and if you don't have an EpiPen
1629280	1632120	or something nearby, you can quite easily die.
1632120	1636360	Tim saying that one in 160 people who get the vaccine
1636360	1640160	will get anaphylaxis is completely absurd
1640160	1642440	and dangerously misleading.
1642440	1646400	Why can't we have a regular conversation about this?
1646400	1647720	There are side effects.
1647720	1649480	It shouldn't be mandatory.
1649480	1650840	How simple is that?
1650840	1652840	Although Tim calls himself pro-vaccine,
1652840	1654680	overstating the side effects of vaccines
1654680	1656840	is a common tactic of anti-vaxxers.
1656840	1658760	Though the bigger point he makes in this video
1658760	1661680	is a libertarian-esque rant about how important it is
1661680	1663520	to have the choice on whether or not
1663520	1665560	to receive the vaccine, which is the real point
1665560	1668120	of this video, so he can say this.
1668120	1671600	Why is it that for years we can have people say things
1671600	1672440	like, I can't remember who it was,
1672440	1673800	there was some celebrity lady,
1673800	1676520	and she said, not in any way anti-vax,
1676520	1678200	just think people should have a choice
1678200	1680000	as to whether or not that they get vaccinated,
1680000	1681680	and they called her an anti-vaxxer.
1681680	1683600	The funny thing about this freedom argument
1683600	1686440	is that it's one that's been used by anti-vaxxers
1686440	1688240	going back over 100 years.
1688240	1691440	Here's an image from a pamphlet from 1885
1691440	1695160	talking about the supposed dangers of the smallpox vaccine.
1695160	1697160	You can see this echoed today with fear-mongering
1697160	1700400	about Bill Gates using vaccines to usher in a new world order
1700400	1702840	and that mandatory vaccines to have access
1702840	1705320	to public services, like public schools,
1705320	1707520	is taking away people's freedoms.
1707520	1710640	Tim's paranoia here is of the more mild sort,
1710640	1713280	where he fears every small business will be shut down
1713280	1715360	and people will be forced to get vaccinations
1715360	1718720	to shop at Walmart, something that seems unlikely.
1718720	1720760	He also talks about how he thinks people
1720760	1722560	should have the choice to homeschool their kids,
1722560	1724160	which, last I checked,
1724160	1726560	wasn't being outlawed in the United States.
1726560	1728880	And that's Tim's content all over.
1728880	1731240	He presents a reasonable take on vaccine
1731240	1734080	but pairs it with some subtle fear-mongering,
1734080	1736600	all the while taking potshots at the media.
1736600	1738680	Here's an example of how he projects anti-vaxx
1738680	1741920	talking points into the mouths of media figures.
1741920	1744560	This dude goes on TV
1744560	1747440	and says probably one of the stupidest things
1747440	1749840	I think anyone could have even said.
1749840	1751400	You know what, but maybe I'm wrong.
1751400	1753400	Maybe he's just being honest.
1753400	1755560	He said something to the effect of,
1755560	1758480	even if you get the vaccine, you can still get COVID.
1758480	1760600	You can still get infected and you can still spread it.
1760600	1761960	So you gotta wear your mask.
1761960	1762800	You can't travel.
1762800	1763640	It's a misconception.
1763640	1764840	Wait, wait, wait, what?
1766160	1768120	Is this serious?
1768120	1771320	Tim refuses to do even the most basic research
1771320	1772880	on what the vaccine does.
1772880	1775000	The function of this vaccine is to prevent
1775000	1777080	the most serious symptoms of COVID,
1777080	1779160	symptoms that have killed hundreds of thousands
1779160	1780720	of people around the world.
1780720	1783120	What's unknown is how effective, if at all,
1783120	1786040	it will be in reducing the transmission of the virus.
1786040	1787640	So until herd immunity is reached,
1787640	1789600	it's important to maintain social distancing,
1789600	1791400	mask wearing, and limited travel.
1791400	1792440	This is not the same as saying
1792440	1794960	the vaccine doesn't work at all.
1794960	1796960	But instead of doing research to clarify
1796960	1799280	this Twitter comment, Tim would sooner pretend
1799280	1801160	someone in the media is saying the vaccine
1801160	1803560	just doesn't work, which gives him
1803560	1805640	the perfect excuse to say this.
1805640	1807320	So many people thought it was impossible.
1807320	1808320	Guess what?
1808320	1810160	Maybe it was.
1810160	1812120	Maybe this is the trial.
1812120	1813880	Like, we're desperate.
1813880	1815160	We got a lockdown.
1815160	1816160	People are scared.
1816160	1819280	Not conservatives, you know, but the left.
1819280	1823440	And so they brushed this out.
1823440	1826280	And it's as simple as that.
1826280	1828720	This is not the nuanced perspective
1828720	1831080	about the vaccine it pretends to be.
1831080	1834320	It certainly isn't full-on anti-vax content
1834320	1836180	the same way his pro-Trump videos
1836180	1838300	aren't full-on MAGA content.
1838300	1841420	It's a slightly more nuanced and restrained take.
1841420	1843700	But ultimately, it's pushing his audience
1843700	1845900	in the same direction, to be more skeptical
1845900	1848540	of the vaccine and to be more supportive of Trump.
1848540	1850300	One of the most reasonable things Tim says
1850300	1852900	in this video is that people should trust their doctors.
1852900	1855480	Advice I wholeheartedly support.
1855480	1858220	Does Tim ever wonder why he has highly upvoted
1858220	1860620	comments like these under his video?
1860620	1862380	Not getting vaccine.
1862380	1864100	I'm not anti-vax.
1864100	1867020	I'm just not interested in being a guinea pig.
1867020	1870780	10 you years from now, there will be ads on TV.
1870780	1872320	Did you get COVID vaccine?
1872320	1874960	Join class action lawsuit today.
1874960	1877280	Don't you trust your doctors?
1877280	1879600	Um, no.
1879600	1884600	99.9% survival rate versus 2% severe side effects
1884600	1888120	with a 95% efficacy rate?
1888120	1891280	You decide which odds you're willing to take.
1891280	1893280	If this video was intended to reduce
1893280	1896720	people's fear of the vaccine, it obviously isn't working.
1896720	1899840	If anything, it's having the exact opposite effect.
1899840	1902020	And the cherry on top is how he turns this video
1902020	1905400	into another chance to defend Donald Trump.
1905400	1908680	I think these news outlets really want to undermine
1908680	1910640	our faith in the vaccine.
1910640	1913300	And a lot of people think the vaccine isn't safe,
1913300	1915280	but I'll tell you what, you wanna know
1915280	1917000	why I think they like doing this?
1917000	1919480	They hate Donald Trump.
1919480	1922080	Warp speed was Trump's initiative.
1922080	1924520	It worked, the vaccine came out.
1924520	1926540	Everyone's happy about it.
1926540	1928380	Because it wouldn't be a Tim Pool video
1928380	1931980	without another hit of that pro-Trump copium.
1931980	1935340	Taken on their own, very few single Tim Pool videos
1935340	1936820	are especially bad.
1936820	1939820	And what Tim's prolific amount of videos
1939820	1942100	create a media environment for his viewers
1942100	1943620	that keeps them happy.
1943620	1946200	And Tim has a tendency to speak out of both sides
1946200	1948380	of his mouth to the point of parody.
1948380	1949820	Far be it from me to question
1949820	1952060	an actual legal expert on this.
1952060	1952900	For sure.
1952900	1955180	10 seconds later.
1955180	1957580	But I have to question what he's saying.
1957580	1959380	And a clip like that encapsulates
1959380	1961960	one of the many problems with Tim Pool's content.
1961960	1964540	He speaks on topics he knows very little about
1964540	1967220	and the things he knows he often misrepresents.
1967220	1969260	Tim Pool's videos make his audience
1969260	1971420	more ignorant about the world.
1971420	1973260	This isn't my first Tim Pool video.
1973260	1975020	I focused on him specifically
1975020	1976700	and three other videos on this channel
1976700	1979180	and mentioned him in passing a few other times.
1979180	1981580	In my previous videos, one of the major failures
1981580	1983900	I think I had was not taking the time
1983900	1987900	to also discuss how deeply unimportant he is as a person.
1987900	1989860	While the comments making fun of his hat,
1989860	1992100	his manner of speaking, and his intelligence
1992100	1993700	might be fun for a laugh,
1993700	1995060	and I've probably had a few less
1995060	1997060	at the guy's expense in this very video,
1997060	1998960	I think it's important to stress that
1998960	2002020	if Tim decided that tomorrow he would stop making videos
2002020	2003660	and retire to the wilderness,
2003660	2006820	this would not be the end of terrible news analysis
2006820	2007820	on YouTube.
2007820	2010060	Another person would rise to fill the beanie
2010060	2012800	and YouTube has no shortage of loudmouth commentators
2012800	2015000	ready to spoon feed their audience trash
2015000	2016160	and tell them it's news,
2016160	2018700	and this is true across the political spectrum.
2018700	2020360	What I hope this video does is highlight
2020360	2022040	some of the techniques to watch out for,
2022040	2023500	the repeated use of sources
2023500	2025520	from one side of the political spectrum,
2025520	2027480	the embarrassingly wrong predictions,
2027480	2030960	and the absolute refusal to criticize certain politicians.
2030960	2033080	There's no easy way to spot these people,
2033080	2035920	but here are a few tips I found personally helpful.
2035920	2037880	If a single person or small team
2037880	2040600	are producing huge volumes of content,
2040600	2043320	commenting on a wide number of issues,
2043320	2045280	the odds are good that they don't know nearly enough
2045280	2047960	to be covering such a wide array of topics.
2047960	2049480	If someone says they're giving you news
2049480	2050480	right down the middle
2050480	2052680	and their comment section is filled with partisans
2052680	2054120	for one political side,
2054120	2056980	the news you're getting probably isn't neutral.
2056980	2059200	Don't let someone extrapolate anecdotes
2059200	2060720	into broader social trends,
2060720	2062080	demand numbers or research
2062080	2064100	before believing anyone who makes comments
2064100	2066600	about entire nations or groups of people,
2066600	2068900	and be wary of small anecdotes
2068900	2071100	and stories that can't be falsified.
2071100	2072380	If someone tells you a story
2072380	2074500	from their personal experience
2074500	2076020	or an obscure news event
2076020	2078380	that may have only been covered by a few sources,
2078380	2081300	be very wary of anything they tell you next
2081300	2082500	because often there's no way
2082500	2084820	to fact check any of these stories.
2084820	2087600	This person could just as easily make up anything
2087600	2089900	that some random friend told them
2089900	2091180	or use a one-off event
2091180	2094300	that isn't representative of anything.
2094300	2096680	They may not even be doing this to deceive you.
2096680	2098460	It could just be a simple misunderstanding
2098540	2099780	of how the news works.
2099780	2101780	You can't understand the world at large
2101780	2104140	by talking to your buddy down the street.
2104140	2105940	You actually have to do some work.
2105940	2107960	And if you're the sort of person who has some time,
2107960	2110300	try fact checking a few random videos.
2110300	2113500	If someone can be shown to be consistently wrong,
2113500	2116140	they're probably not worth listening to.
2116140	2119080	And credits roll, end of YouTube video.
2120460	2121340	Or that was the plan
2121340	2123700	before an angry mob of Trump supporters
2123700	2124940	broke into the US Capitol
2124940	2127660	to stop accounting of electoral college votes.
2127660	2130460	Details are still hazy so early into this event,
2130460	2132420	but this video would be incomplete
2132420	2134900	if I didn't make a few connections here.
2134900	2137260	To describe the events as neutral as I can,
2137260	2139820	President Trump staged a rally in Washington DC
2139820	2142660	on January 6th, making his case to his supporters
2142660	2145340	that the recent federal election was illegitimate.
2145340	2147020	This follows two months of claiming
2147020	2149220	the election has been illegitimate.
2149220	2153420	We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
2153420	2155380	I love Pennsylvania Avenue.
2155380	2157120	And we're going to the Capitol.
2157440	2158280	Following the speech,
2158280	2160440	his supporters marched on the Capitol building
2160440	2163160	where the certified election results were being counted.
2163160	2165520	Security at the building was quickly bypassed
2165520	2168320	and there were several acts of vandalism and theft.
2168320	2170020	The counting of the results was halted.
2170020	2172160	Elected officials were escorted to safety
2172160	2174480	and eventually several arrests were made.
2174480	2176420	Eventually the building was cleared,
2176420	2178440	the counting of the votes was resumed
2178440	2182680	and Joe Biden was declared the president-elect.
2182680	2184160	These are the events that occurred,
2184160	2185320	but what's really important
2185360	2187560	is how people consume commentary about them,
2187560	2189240	which will affect how we understand them
2189240	2191160	in a broader context.
2191160	2194140	I spent a lot of time in this video talking about Tim Poole,
2194140	2197520	but he's just a case study for a much larger problem.
2197520	2199800	There's a right-wing echo chamber that reaches all the way
2199800	2201400	from the lowliest of grifters
2201400	2204400	to the highest offices around the world.
2204400	2208120	For example, when Representative Matt Gaetz said this.
2208120	2210480	And I don't know if the reports are true,
2210480	2213760	but the Washington Times has just reported
2213760	2215280	some pretty compelling evidence
2215280	2217660	from a facial recognition company
2217660	2218840	showing that some of the people
2218840	2222760	who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters.
2222760	2225100	They were masquerading as Trump supporters
2225100	2226960	and in fact were members
2226960	2230320	of the violent terrorist group Antifa.
2230320	2233120	Here he's amplifying a story that had been discredited
2233120	2234440	from the Washington Times,
2234440	2236120	a right-wing outlet with a long history
2236120	2237400	of distorting the news.
2237400	2239960	The story was so incredibly false
2239960	2242280	it had to be heavily edited after the fact.
2242280	2244800	Of course, after the fact is after it was repeated
2244800	2247160	by a politician in an official hearing.
2247160	2248440	And if we look at Tucker Carlson,
2248440	2250600	we can see an example of something similar.
2251560	2254260	Millions of Americans sincerely believe
2254260	2256960	the last election was fake.
2256960	2258880	You can dismiss them as crazy.
2258880	2260640	You can call them conspiracy theorists.
2260640	2262220	You can kick them off Twitter.
2263440	2265620	But that won't change their minds.
2265620	2267800	Rather than trying to change their minds
2267800	2269720	to convince them and reassure them
2269720	2272120	that the system is real, that the democracy work,
2272120	2274360	as you would do if you cared about the country
2274360	2276120	or the people who live here,
2276120	2278800	our new leaders will try to silence them.
2278800	2281160	Tucker acknowledges the angry mob is right-wing,
2281160	2283400	but he not only presents them as more legitimate
2283400	2285240	to any left-wing demonstrators,
2285240	2288760	but he also justifies the anger felt within the mob.
2288760	2292240	To me, it seems obvious that these people were stirred up
2292240	2295800	by claims that the election was fraudulent or invalid,
2295800	2298000	claims that had been coming from the mouth of the president
2298000	2299620	and his supporters for months.
2299620	2300840	We shouldn't be surprised that people
2300840	2303640	who were repeating these claims are so quick to try
2303640	2305800	and cause confusion around this event.
2305800	2308120	We need to call moments like these what they are,
2308120	2311120	a desperate attempt to rewrite reality in front of our eyes,
2311120	2313880	the invention of conspiracy theories and rationalizations
2313880	2315840	that shift blame away from the harmful rhetoric
2315840	2317320	these people employ.
2317320	2318880	This isn't about presenting the truth.
2318880	2320400	It's about finding a version of events
2320400	2323320	that can be politically capitalized on by the far right
2323320	2325360	so they can seize more power.
2325360	2329020	Whether he knows it or not, Tim is part of this machine.
2329020	2331860	I don't particularly care if he's a cynical grifter
2331860	2332980	or a useful idiot.
2332980	2335760	The point is he endlessly produces content
2335760	2338540	that attacks the left while excusing the excesses
2338540	2339380	of the right.
2339380	2341660	We can see that pretty clearly from his reaction
2341660	2343380	to the events on January 6th.
2343380	2345880	He's very quick to assign blame for the events
2345880	2349100	to the left, the media, and he offers a rationalization
2349100	2351660	for his role in all of this as well.
2351660	2353700	Let me tell you the difference between me and Jake Tapper.
2353700	2355500	I should say for the most part, CNN.
2356440	2358820	I have condemned all the violence,
2359460	2361260	I'm not gonna pretend to be a psychic
2361260	2362740	who can see the future.
2362740	2365060	But when I predicted this over and over again,
2365060	2368020	telling you what I'm seeing and what I think will happen,
2368020	2369940	well, then they blame me.
2369940	2374420	They say, it's your fault, my fault, that I warned you
2374420	2378660	and I told you what needed to be done to prevent this.
2378660	2380220	How insane.
2380220	2382060	I hope the earlier sections of this video
2382060	2384140	help portray a criticism of Tim's content
2384140	2385860	in a way that he doesn't acknowledge.
2385860	2387620	Condemning violence is fine,
2387660	2390240	but it doesn't absolve him from devoting so much of his time
2390240	2392620	to entertaining the delusions of Trump supporters.
2392620	2394380	Whether it's encouraging their fantasies
2394380	2395660	of overturning the election
2395660	2397920	or stoking paranoia about vaccines,
2397920	2400460	Tim Poole's content twists the news of the day
2400460	2401660	into right-wing narratives,
2401660	2404800	letting them live in the world of alternative facts.
2404800	2407260	These Trump supporters have been fed a constant diet
2407260	2409100	of misinformation about the election
2409100	2411600	and misinformation about the world for some time.
2411600	2413780	Tim is constantly hammering on the point
2413780	2416540	that back in June, Chris Cuomo on CNN said
2416540	2418860	that protests don't have to be peaceful
2418860	2420900	as if this was a major contributing factor
2420900	2422620	in inflaming tensions.
2422620	2426220	But how many Trump supporters are honestly watching CNN?
2426220	2429260	I think they're more likely to be watching Steven Crowder
2429260	2430980	or maybe they're listening to politicians
2430980	2433700	like Rudy Giuliani at the very rally they were attending
2433700	2435920	that day say things like this.
2435920	2441100	Let's have trial by combat.
2441100	2442860	Or maybe they were listening to Tim
2442860	2445220	who puts out video after video
2445220	2448100	warning people about an impending civil war.
2448100	2451140	Someone is clearly feeding this audience
2451140	2452920	misinformation and fear.
2452920	2454620	And I don't think it's that cable station
2454620	2455820	that none of them are watching.
2455820	2457660	And I don't think it's any of the politicians
2457660	2459620	they clearly don't support.
2459620	2461500	It's the people in the media like him
2461500	2463860	who are constructing these narratives for them.
2463860	2466520	During his live stream on January 6th,
2466520	2469260	Tim had on a panel of voices largely doing
2469260	2470820	what he always does on his channel,
2470820	2472300	attack the left and the media
2472300	2474260	and play defense for Donald Trump.
2474280	2477020	But during the live stream, YouTube had to censor his chat
2477020	2479440	for frequent incitements to violence.
2479440	2483280	So what I'm being told is that,
2483280	2484780	for those that are just tuning in,
2484780	2487900	chat has been disabled because people in comments
2487900	2490100	are inciting violence, calling for more
2490100	2490980	and things like that.
2490980	2493180	Tim was cognizant enough not to complain too much,
2493180	2494900	incitements to violence are obviously
2494900	2496420	against YouTube's rules.
2496420	2498260	But is it really surprising to him
2498260	2500000	that so many people in his audience
2500000	2502380	are frothing at the mouth for this?
2502380	2504980	The comments under his videos tell the same story.
2504980	2508620	Tim's content attracts a right-wing audience for a reason.
2508620	2509940	It gives them a vision of a world
2509940	2511660	that validates their feelings.
2511660	2514200	It validates all the rage and fear they feel
2514200	2516360	about the world around them.
2516360	2519580	The American writer Flannery O'Connor had a wonderful quote,
2519580	2522940	"'The truth does not change according to our ability
2522940	2525820	"'to stomach it emotionally.'"
2525820	2528220	Tim's content isn't about delivering the truth
2528220	2529380	to his audience.
2529380	2532940	It's about giving them stories that let them avoid it.
2532940	2534580	This was a tough video to make.
2534580	2536420	Originally, it was just a quick check-in
2536420	2539180	on the content of Tim Pool to make sure it's still awful
2539180	2541460	because I thought we were kind of due for that.
2541460	2543020	It got a bit away from me and ballooned
2543020	2544180	into something much bigger.
2544180	2546460	And then the events of January 6th happened
2546460	2550280	and I needed to add more to it still.
2550280	2552700	Much thanks goes out to Tim Pool Clips
2552700	2555660	who helped me with the earliest version of this video.
2555660	2557300	He was a great resource.

2559780	2561580	Also, thanks to Tim Bon Toast,
2561580	2565300	he was very helpful in bouncing some ideas off of.
2565300	2567300	I think he's got some stuff cooking about Tim Pool
2567300	2569820	in the future, so take a look out for that.
2569820	2573480	Thank you so much to all my patrons for being patient.
2573480	2576900	Content has been a little slim on my channel lately,
