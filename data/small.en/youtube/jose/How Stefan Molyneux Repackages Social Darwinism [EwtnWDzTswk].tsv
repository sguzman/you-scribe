0	4000	I nearly died watching this video.
4000	8360	Stefan Molyneux promised he would tell me why I hated Trump.
8360	15520	He promised me I had to wait for over 50 minutes before his tedious lecture finally got to
15520	16880	the goddamn point.
16880	19440	So for anyone who wants the spoiler, here it is.
19440	24040	People hate Trump because he's threatening to take away government assistance programs.
24040	29080	There, just saved you an hour and five minutes.
29080	33160	Although when you think about it, that sounds like a leftist critique, doesn't it?
33160	37320	Why did it take Stefan 50 minutes just to get there?
37320	40960	Well that's because leading up to you, he takes you through a reading of history that
40960	45680	mixes up bad science, a love of capitalism, and a touch of racism.
45680	48560	Uh, I mean, race realism?
48560	50600	I think that's what he calls it.
50600	54520	But of course we all know that's just repackaged racism, and if you don't know that, I have
54520	58440	a video of mine you can watch, and that explains the whole thing.
58440	63080	A lot of what Stefan says in his video isn't really new.
63080	67600	Stefan has this shtick where he drones on and on about a variety of topics hitting the
67600	69720	same talking points and tropes.
69720	74960	I once heard advice that if you really believe passionately about something, prepare to be
74960	77120	boring about it.
77120	79160	Stefan has really taken that to heart.
79160	82760	I'm gonna try and not do that with this video though.
82760	88160	I need to mention something that Stefan didn't really bring up in his video, and that's social
88160	89800	Darwinism.
89800	92560	Here's a definition of social Darwinism to get us started.
92560	98040	A 19th century theory, inspired by Darwinism, by which the social order is accounted as
98040	103640	the product of natural selection of those persons best suited to existing living conditions
103640	108400	and in accord with which a position of laissez-faire is advocated.
108400	114480	This theory was used to rationalize the oppression found through imperialism and capitalism prevalent
114480	116160	throughout the last few centuries.
116160	121080	The basic idea behind it is that the British Empire was able to flourish because of their
121080	123400	essential superiority.
123400	128940	That is, they were born to rule, while other races were born to serve.
128940	136480	Or as Stefan would put it, some people are naturally more capable and others less capable.
136480	140920	The origins of social Darwinism can be traced back to English philosopher Herbert Spencer
140920	144040	and his conception of society as a social organism.
144040	148880	In Spencer's estimation, society, like an organism, needs to change and evolve on
148880	152520	its own without the onerous hand of a government.
152520	157040	Although often attributed to Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection, the term
157040	163080	survival of the fittest was actually coined by Spencer, writing in his 1864 work Principles
163080	168360	of Biology, where he adapted Darwin's recently published theory into his own framework.
168360	173240	You may have noticed I said adapted because, even though Spencer's work was called social
173240	178520	Darwinism, his theory of the social organism predates Darwin's theory by nearly a decade.
178520	184000	Back then, Lamarckian evolution was the leading theory on why different species exist.
184000	188520	As a quick sidebar, Lamarckian evolution is the idea that our offspring inherit the traits
188520	190240	we acquire throughout our lives.
190240	195640	So, for example, a physically fit couple who got in shape through exercise will pass on
195640	198560	that physical fitness to their baby.
198560	203240	You can see this idea of evolution manifest itself in the anime Dragon Ball, where Goku's
203240	208560	sons Gohan and Goten have different power levels at age 6 because Goku had gotten stronger
208560	210640	in between the time of their conceptions.
210640	215680	And if this sounds completely idiotic to you, that's because it should.
215680	219760	It doesn't make any sense, because that's not how genes work.
219760	221080	Back to Spencer.
221080	226480	An earlier version of his social organism theory can be read in his 1851 work Social
226480	231400	Statics, published 8 years before Darwin's On the Origin of Species.
231400	235520	And it shows the Lamarckian roots of Spencer's theory.
235520	240280	Here he's basically talking about how society can evolve by shedding some of its weaker
240280	247600	members and instead focusing on more of its, as Stefan might put it, capable people.
247600	253360	It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death.
253360	259800	Nevertheless, when regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal
259800	265160	humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence, the
265160	270720	same beneficence that brings to early graves the children of diseased parents and singles
270720	279200	out the low-spirited, the intemperate, and the debilitated as the victims of an epidemic.
279200	281360	I wouldn't take this guy as a moral instructor, basically.
281360	284840	I would see him as a fucking maniac, Jesus.
284840	289320	If we look further in history, we can actually see Social Darwinism's roots go back even
289320	294960	further than the disturbing psychopathic rants of Spencer.
294960	300000	Here's a rather telling quote from slightly before his time.
300000	306720	One writer compared the extermination of these races by white settlers as being like the
306720	311960	melting of snow before the advancing rays of the sun.
311960	315440	Oh yeah, that was pretty rough.
315440	323080	As best I can tell, that quote is slightly paraphrased from the writings of Alexis de
323080	326240	Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont.
326240	331280	These are taken from writings about their travels through America in the very early
331280	335680	19th century, where they witnessed the effects of colonialism first hand.
335680	340440	We can probably travel back even further and find more examples of people being assholes
340440	343320	to the poor and to different races.
343320	347960	But Social Darwinism's origins have less to do with Darwin's theory and more to do
347960	352960	with assholes who believed in the superiority of their race or class.
352960	359440	Their misappropriation of science was an effort to give that form of discrimination some legitimacy.
359440	364600	The marriage of this hatred with Darwin's new theory via Spencer and other Social Darwinists
364600	366560	was fashionable in the 19th century.
366560	371400	I'm going to go back to that BBC doc I showed you a few moments ago to explain it more succinctly
371400	373400	than I can.
373400	381480	But evolution also suggested that there had to be losers in this great cosmic process
381480	387600	and the losers were those peoples who could not compete.
387600	393760	And once put into competition with superior races were doomed to disappear.
393760	399240	And this was likely to happen to all the native peoples in North America and the Pacific
399240	401920	and in Africa.
401920	407080	Across the world, the crimes of imperialism now came to be taken as proof that the Social
407080	411720	Darwinists were right.
411720	416760	Social Darwinism went on to be a strong rationalization for the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism,
416760	421760	a form of capitalism that insists the system works best when the government does as little
421760	423960	as possible to intervene.
423960	428520	If workers were exploited and owners were getting fat off profits, this was explained
428520	432120	through the lens of Social Darwinism as the natural order.
432120	438480	Stefan, as most other Social Darwinists, take the position that the inferior people, or
438480	443220	less capable people, will be less successful at passing on their genes.
443220	448160	That is, at least according to Stefan, until communism showed up and started demanding
448160	453720	that the damn government step in with its social programs like education and healthcare
453720	459440	just to make sure these damn poor people who are less capable would survive and have a
459440	461960	higher quality of life, I guess.
461960	465480	Makes one wonder why these inferior people are still with us if they should have been
465480	468560	bred out of the population so long ago.
468560	473640	Stefan's logic goes, people who hate Trump are afraid that their social programs will
473640	479580	go away, and the reason they need those social programs is because they are genetically inferior.
479580	483980	In other words, he's repackaged Social Darwinism and doesn't have the courtesy to tip his
483980	489900	hat to Herbert Spencer, Thomas Huxley, William Grant Sumner, and all the other Social Darwinists
489900	490900	of the past.
490900	491900	What a dick.
491900	497680	Although I guess if he's a dick, he really is living up to their legacy.
497680	502000	And to clarify one thing here, not all visions of Social Darwinism are the same, I'm giving
502000	503800	you a very brief overview here.
503800	508860	Some Social Darwinists were believers in imperialism, others not so much.
508860	512600	If you're curious though, one book that's been recommended by more well-read people
512600	518080	on the subject than me is Richard Hofstetter's Social Darwinism in American Thought.
518080	523240	It was published in the 1950s, but considering this is a 19th century ideology, it's still
523240	524960	pretty applicable.
524960	527800	So why is Social Darwinism wrong?
527800	532320	Social Darwinists will use the mantra of survival of the fittest, but evolution is
532320	539080	actually more accurately survival of the most adaptable, which is not nearly as catchy unfortunately.
539080	542960	Let's use cats as an example, because eh, the internet loves cats, right?
542960	548240	So when we think of the most evolved, so to speak, of cats, you might think of the biggest
548240	553580	and baddest one out there, the tiger, and yes it's the tiger, shut the fuck up lion people.
553580	558780	But interestingly, a far more successful hunter is this little guy, the black-footed
558780	559780	cat.
559780	565300	See here on video it's so cute, oh god it's so fucking cute, oh I can't, oh my god I
565300	571200	want one of these so much, they're wild animals, they deserve to be free and ugh.
571200	574660	It's one of the smallest cats in the wild, and while there is some slight concern to
574660	578660	its welfare as a species, it's generally thought to be in pretty good shape, or at
578660	582520	the very least, it's in far better shape than the tiger.
582520	587520	This adorable cat survives not because it's the biggest, strongest one out there, but
587520	590600	because it's adapted to its environment successfully.
590600	595640	As a small side note though, while tigers may be less successful hunters than the black-footed
595640	599920	cat, I need to stress that the only reason they're threatened as a species is because
599920	605360	of the invasive homo sapiens who are taking up its space and in some cases killing them?
605360	609840	No shade to the tigers, you guys are, you guys are the fucking best.
609840	613720	Nothing comes in all shapes and sizes, and there is no hierarchy in evolution.
613720	619440	Nothing is more or less evolved than the other, things only need to be able to reproduce,
619440	623360	and from an evolutionary standpoint, that's really all that matters.
623360	629240	Now when you think about it, we've all, and I say we as in all organisms living on this
629240	634160	planet, have been evolving for the same amount of time, so a single-celled organism isn't
634160	640080	any more or less evolved than a human because single-celled organisms are still reproducing,
640080	643400	they're still pretty successful, they're all over the place.
643400	647860	Here's the real kicker though, unlike that example I used above of the two cats, it turns
647860	652440	out human beings are all part of a single species.
652440	657000	Implicit in the idea of social Darwinism is that human beings can be divided into different
657000	658000	groups.
658000	661200	In this particular case, it would be different races and classes.
661280	665960	I've already talked about the arbitrary nature of race, but can class be explained by genetic
665960	667440	differences?
667440	668440	Turns out, no.
668440	674320	In a paper titled, Genetics in Social Class by Dr. N. A. Holtzman from Genetics and Public
674320	679680	Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins Medical, he concludes that the roots of social class differences
679680	682080	do not lie in our genes.
682080	687120	Consequently, genetics cannot be used as a justification for maintaining a ruling class,
687120	692600	limiting procreation among the poor, or minimizing social support programs.
692600	696880	The difficulty of class mobility being reduced to genetic weakness is a way of rationalizing
696880	701720	the inequalities that are created and reinforced by a system that keeps the rich rich and the
701720	703240	poor poor.
703240	708560	Reading between the lines of Stefan's argument of more capable and less capable humans, we
708560	712520	can see that this is just a way for him to pretend that the differences in social standings
712520	716280	between races and classes are part of the natural order.
716280	720800	Stefan has made the mistake of assuming that the way something is is the way it ought to
720800	722320	be.
722320	725920	That's conservatism in a nutshell, really.
725920	731880	Imagine if someone had said that about, I don't know, slavery or women having the right
731880	734260	to vote.
734260	739240	Another problem for Stefan is that he's looking at the present without thinking of the history
739240	743320	as also a series of present moments.
743360	748040	If we chose a different point of history and used his perspective, you could actually come
748040	750440	up with a completely different conclusion.
750440	753680	Imagine if you were in the 13th or 14th century.
753680	759040	You could argue that the Mongolians were the superior race because the Mongol Empire controlled
759040	763560	most of Asia and was one of the largest empires in human history.
763560	769540	In the 7th and 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate was enormous and was the largest single entity
769540	774100	controlling the highly coveted Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean.
774100	777620	Were the people of the Umayyad Caliphate the superior race?
777620	783780	The Han Dynasty of the, uh, Otts, I guess, were at the helm of a massive and powerful
783780	785060	Chinese empire.
785060	790220	If we were in that point of history, were the Han Chinese the superior race?
790220	795900	You can say that all those empires faded away and were displaced by others later on, but
795900	799780	how can you possibly say that that would never happen again?
799780	804500	What makes white people so special that their empire will be the last one?
804500	809180	The British might have thought that their empire was the greatest of all time, and now
809180	815060	it pales in comparison to what the United States is capable of doing with its pseudo-empire.
815060	820260	And for the record, I would certainly agree that the rise of an empire is influenced in
820260	826900	a small way by the genes of the empire builders, because all people are products of their genes
826900	833100	in society, but you can extrapolate the personalities and characteristics of imperialists to anyone
833100	835180	with the same skin color.
835180	840500	History teaches us quite clearly that all peoples are capable of creating empires.
840500	846040	That doesn't mean it's natural for one race to supplant another, it just means sometimes
846040	850680	assholes can exploit broken systems to attain power and abuse it.
850680	853760	Which brings us back to Donald Trump.
853760	858680	You don't need Stephon Molyneux's half-assed babble to tell you why you hate Trump.
858680	861560	Anyone who hates him can probably tell you why themselves.
861560	864560	Personally, I hate Trump's misogyny.
864560	865560	I don't even know what.
865560	867560	And when you're a star, they let you do it.
867560	868560	You can do anything.
868560	869560	Whatever you want.
869560	870560	Grab them by the pussy.
870560	872560	I can do anything.
872560	874600	Racism, xenophobia.
874600	879120	Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here, referring to African
879120	882820	countries and Haiti, the president then went on to talk about how they needed to bring
882820	885240	in more people from places like Norway.
885240	886240	Jingoism.
886240	893440	We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing
893440	897640	our companies and destroying our jobs.
897640	901120	And perhaps most of all his unbridled stupidity.
901120	906000	My two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.
906000	907000	There.
907000	908000	Was that so tough?
908000	910080	Geez, less than half the time, too.
