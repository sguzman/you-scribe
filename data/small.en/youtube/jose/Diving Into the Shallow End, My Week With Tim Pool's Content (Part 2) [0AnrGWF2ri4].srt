00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Part 2 of 2.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,900
And looking back on this week, I can safely say I'm so glad it's over.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:20,900
The world is weird, it makes me nervous, I get to talk about it, but how I say.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,620
Only touches on the subject in a few videos, I did want to highlight this specifically

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,500
because it encapsulates what right-wing propaganda does so effectively.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,160
Even if Tim doesn't think of himself as right-wing, the fact that he parrots their

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
talking points uncritically makes his personal opinions irrelevant.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
When it comes to trans issues, he helps spread a conservative narrative.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,400
In Far Leftists Are Tearing, JK Rowling to Shreds after a transphobic tweet.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,360
Tim came out, as you might have guessed, in favor of JK Rowling and her transphobic tweet.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,600
If JK Rowling is going to speak up for a woman who is unjustly fired, she did the right thing.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,500
And this is exactly what you can expect from the fringe, authoritarian left who want to

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,860
now destroy her over this.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,760
Male and female exist.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,940
She is correct.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,340
She said gender expression identity is different and people can express themselves however

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,420
they want.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,380
She took the fair and reasonable approach.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,180
She actually ceded the gender framing to the left.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
But because she said male and female are real, and a male can never become a female, that's

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,180
it.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:42,000
Before covering the trans issue, I'd like to note Tim's framing of JK Rowling in general.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
When Rowling does something that might appeal to the left, like revealing one of her characters

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,140
was actually gay, it's considered pandering.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,560
But when appealing to the right, by defending a turf, she's apparently standing up for

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,100
something she believes in.

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,920
This is another example of how Tim frames left and right-wing opinions.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,760
One is cynical and disingenuous, and the other one is genuine and heartfelt.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,840
The story of the woman Rowling was tweeting her support of could make for a whole video

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,940
in and of itself, but I want to focus on Tim's opinions about trans people and how these

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,740
opinions frame his commentary.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,880
Up until the point we develop technology that can radically alter your DNA and reconstruct

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,280
your body at the cellular level, males cannot become female or vice versa.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,920
Now you can become a trans, you know, you can transition, and you can present as male

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,160
or female, but that's different from literally being as such.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
He backs this up by saying,

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,580
They're facts!

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,480
It's biological fact!

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,720
Where's reality going?

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,660
This is the standard right-wing talking point.

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,480
When someone is assigned male or female at birth, this is something stamped on them to

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,340
never be altered or changed, and something that is apparently instantly evident at the

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,840
moment of birth.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Let's jump ahead to Hollywood leftists just proved they are spineless cowards bending

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,480
the knee to far-left Twitter Roddy.

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,720
He's very concerned about science in this one.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,660
I have some bad news for people.

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,740
Science is a thing.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,240
And you can't just say something is anti-science without actually having academia to back it

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
up.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,080
In this video, Tim goes off against GLAAD and HRC, who, you would think, might know

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,580
something about trans people.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,200
But Tim is about to blow them out of the water.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,800
He opens with this powerful statement.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
My opinion.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
I am not saying these things to be hurtful.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,880
I am saying that currently, based on human knowledge and the structure of the English

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,240
language, what they said is just fundamentally false.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,640
If you Google the word woman, they tell you a woman is an adult human female.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,320
And now we are getting to the point where definitions literally don't make sense.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,700
But he doesn't stop there.

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,440
He goes with the strongest science he knows.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,760
Here's the Wikipedia page for women.

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,200
I have shown this many a time.

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,640
It says, a woman is a female human being.

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
The word woman is usually reserved for an adult.

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Girl is usually the term for a female child or adolescent.

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,040
The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,360
such as women's rights.

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,320
My favorite part is when he gets to the section on the page that explains trans women are

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,960
also women, and he just gets angry about it.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,160
However, it also says some women are trans.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,180
That literally makes no sense.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,580
If you want it to be true, that's fine.

75
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,460
It's not an argument about opinions or ideology, I'm literally telling you.

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,060
You can't simultaneously say at the same time.

77
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,500
A woman is a female human being, and some women are trans.

78
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,060
The some women are trans would then actually mean that some women are trans men.

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,620
So Wikipedia is an authority until Tim decides it isn't.

80
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,720
Tim is at his most honest here, though.

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,820
That means I need you to define what this means so that I can agree with you.

82
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,620
Because right now, basically, I have no idea what you're trying to say.

83
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,940
I really, really don't.

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,660
But he offers a path forward.

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,020
If it turns out, because yes, I've read much of this academic literature.

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,580
So I've seen the arguments.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,900
I am just saying right now, we are not in that place.

88
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,900
This is the standard conservative pushback against the idea of trans people.

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,600
When in doubt, cite science without pointing towards any specific researcher or findings

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
or anything, really.

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,340
The word science, and in this case a Wikipedia page that disagrees with you, is all that

92
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
anyone needs.

93
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,660
Tim's spin on this is to repeatedly claim how much he respects trans people and will

94
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,680
use their pronouns out of politeness, but ultimately he doesn't see any scientific

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,440
basis in them saying they are the gender they identify with.

96
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,120
For those of us not as well versed on this as Professor Poole thinks he is, I'd point

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,940
people towards a lovely article in Scientific American by neuroscientist and doctoral candidate

98
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,040
Simone D. Sun that makes a good case for the biological underpinnings of being trans

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,640
and the complexity of the male and female labels we use so freely.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,560
Turns out it's far more complicated than people assume and not firmly fixed as someone

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,680
such as Tim would have you believe.

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,580
By covering for people like J.K. Rowling when they say something anti-trans, Tim is helping

103
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,480
uphold a conservative narrative that trans people's lived experiences are delusions.

104
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:18,380
Tim's analysis of pretty much all news stories reveal a complete lack of curiosity.

105
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,400
He will complain about the mainstream media jumping to conclusions or not doing their

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,440
due diligence, but there are several examples of how his bias guides him through news stories

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
to frame them within a general anti-left sentiment.

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,360
In the video, 5 students ARRESTED for beating a 14 year old allegedly for wearing a MAGA

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
hat.

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,200
I probably didn't need to say MAGA like that, but I will leave it in.

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,880
He credulously repeats the common narrative of right-wingers being under attack for supporting

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,200
Trump in public.

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,360
One important caveat to this video's title is that at the time of the attack, the kid

114
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,420
was not wearing a MAGA hat.

115
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,020
At the time of the incident, he wasn't wearing the hat.

116
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,380
Question it, whatever.

117
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,560
The argument is that he had worn it in the past, was bullied for it, so stopped and then

118
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,020
got bullied again.

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,020
The only piece of evidence we have, a video of this attack, shows the kid not wearing

120
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
a MAGA hat.

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,680
So why does Tim believe that this is somehow linked to it?

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,500
Because this is so, well it's common enough, I kinda believe it.

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,780
So Tim just believes it, because, well, it's happened before.

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,740
This isn't how journalism works.

125
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,620
You can't just take a claim on face value because you believe it happened before.

126
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,120
The onus is still on the person making the claim to provide evidence.

127
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,380
The story was publicized by the boy's mother, who happens to run a fairly prominent Twitter

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,880
account with nearly half a million followers.

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,400
This is the only source saying the boy was being bullied for wearing a MAGA hat.

130
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,320
She also claims it was a hate crime because her son is white and his attackers were black.

131
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,480
There's an official statement from the school, which Tim mentions, that says the fight had

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,440
nothing to do with clothing.

133
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,500
There was no evidence found during the investigation that indicated the student was wearing any

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,760
of this apparel at the time of the altercation, or that his wearing of such apparel on a prior

135
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,280
occasion motivated the incident.

136
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Boom.

137
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
There it is.

138
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
That's the important point.

139
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,160
You gotta be careful, man, because there are people who take advantage of your good

140
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
will on the left and the right.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Tim responds to this by suggesting the school might be lying.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,720
I understand the school has reason to try and deflect and be like, no, no, no, it doesn't

143
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
happen at our school.

144
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,800
But I also want to make sure you're all aware, tons of people lie.

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,440
They are grifters and they will come for you.

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm not accusing them of anything.

147
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,480
He never assumes this of the boy's mother, or at least he doesn't assume the mother

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,920
might not have all the facts, that a GoFundMe was started by the boy's mother so that

149
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,000
she can homeschool him is similarly mentioned without the faintest bit of suspicion.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
But the most telling line is here.

151
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,720
How do you prove a negative?

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
You know what I mean?

153
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,680
Like, if the school is saying it was not motivated by a previous political hat, how do you know

154
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
that?

155
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
That's just not how proving anything works.

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,480
If there's a claim and no evidence is provided for it, as a journalist, you should try finding

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
it.

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,160
If you can't find that evidence, then guess what?

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,200
You don't run the story.

160
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,720
I lean more towards the likelihood of this being true, regardless of what the school

161
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,600
said, simply because it fits with what we've seen in the past.

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,140
This is the perfect example of the laziness of Tim Poole.

163
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,380
He would sooner believe the framing he sees on Twitter rather than the school's investigation

164
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,200
because it fits in with the persecuted conservative narrative he already believes is true.

165
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,600
This is what happens when you let narratives determine how you view the news of the day.

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,960
This seems grossly irresponsible to me, and reading the comments we can see what his audience

167
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,200
took away from this.

168
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,920
Imagine if five of white's kids did this to a black kid.

169
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
Worldwide news for weeks.

170
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,320
Can you imagine eight white kids doing this?

171
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,040
CNN, the KKK is back, and lynchings of POC have begun again.

172
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
God help us.

173
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,800
They beat him because he was white, and their best excuse was he was wearing Trump's merch.

174
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,680
It makes one wonder why Tim Poole's audience gets so worked up about white people.

175
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,200
But what's most alarming to me about this story is that the kids seen fighting in the

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,000
first video are getting charged, which seems pretty extreme for kids so young.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,360
But no one seems to care that they now have criminal records before they've even gotten

178
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,120
their driver's license.

179
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,580
Fights on school buses happen every day, but thanks to the coverage from conservative media,

180
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,980
this one almost certainly got more scrutiny than it otherwise would have.

181
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,660
And Tim is part of the problem when he propagates baseless stories like this one.

182
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,980
Although he claims to be a liberal, someone who parrots conservative media stories, especially

183
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,220
ones like these, with racist undertones of white people being under attack, aren't just

184
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,580
fostering hatred.

185
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,660
There are direct, real-world consequences to this.

186
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,380
Another conservative narrative Tim loves to repeat is that there's an impending civil

187
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
war.

188
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,420
What would that topic in 95 Second Amendment sanctuaries emerge in Virginia if there's

189
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,440
a second civil war it starts here?

190
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
In this video, Tim boldly claims,

191
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,700
Well, now we can see what's happening in Virginia.

192
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,580
As the Democrats won a majority and now they're trying to enact a ton of laws, essentially

193
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
gun confiscation.

194
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
It's kind of complicated.

195
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
Of course it's complicated.

196
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,980
I know I say it a lot, but it is.

197
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,380
I genuinely don't know what he's talking about here.

198
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,340
It would help if he explained which laws Democrats are passing within Virginia that are threatened

199
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,240
to take away people's guns.

200
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,540
But he doesn't.

201
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,020
I know this is a common talking point on the right, but where's the evidence that this

202
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,340
is actually happening?

203
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,220
The only details Tim offers refer to the Republicans being responsible for these Virginia counties

204
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,900
passing laws to protect gun ownership.

205
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,180
Tim believes guns are essential to living in the middle of nowhere.

206
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,020
He provides us a chilling example.

207
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,140
If you're in the middle of nowhere and you see, I don't know, a coyote?

208
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,660
Or a villain?

209
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Because guess what?

210
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,660
People can be bad too.

211
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
What do you do?

212
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,300
You're out in the middle of nowhere.

213
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,860
You're in your little car.

214
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,460
You pull off on the side of the road.

215
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,980
You know, you're going to change your tire.

216
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Who knows what?

217
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,660
And all of a sudden you see this shambling dude lurking all about and he pulls out a

218
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
knife.

219
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah.

220
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
You're going to call the police?

221
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Congratulations.

222
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
They'll be there.

223
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
They're 200 miles away.

224
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
No.

225
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,940
So in this scenario, there are shambling, knife wielding villains on the prowl in the

226
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,020
middle of nowhere.

227
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,340
Does Tim think rural America is like Silent Hill?

228
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,900
But let's get back to the real narrative Tim is pushing here that the left is coming

229
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
for everyone's guns.

230
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,100
And how are they going to do it?

231
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,740
With immigration.

232
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,700
Immigrants are religious and they're going to bring with them more conservative values

233
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,220
than progressives will have.

234
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Progressives are secular.

235
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Okay.

236
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
Latino migrants from Mexico.

237
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
They're not.

238
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
They're Christians.

239
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Okay.

240
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,900
That's a good win for conservatives, but they also don't have the same constitutional values

241
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
that Americans have.

242
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,420
So yes, they will vote Democrat and they will vote to take away your rights in the

243
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,940
long run.

244
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,780
But things are going to shift very religious and there will be a lot of conservative aspects

245
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,620
that come back like Christmas, for instance.

246
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,260
So immigrants will arrive with their religious values and apparently not assimilate, turning

247
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,740
the democratic party into the party of Christian conservatism.

248
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
This is quite the prediction.

249
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,500
If you know anything about the evangelical base of the Republican party.

250
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,420
Just a side note, when did Christmas go away?

251
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
I think he's trying to explain that here.

252
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,020
All the people screeching that some guy said Merry Christmas.

253
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh no.

254
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Who cares?

255
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,620
Yeah, you realize in like 30 years, happy holidays will be gone because the people you're

256
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,180
inviting into the country are overwhelmingly Christians, you know, I don't think they

257
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
get it.

258
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,060
I'm pretty sure Christmas was just celebrated in the US.

259
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,820
Can someone confirm that for me?

260
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,580
But that aside, there's a more sinister point Tim is making here.

261
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,100
So they're Christians, but they're not constitutional Americans.

262
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,900
They don't look at free speech and these issues the same way.

263
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,500
That's the real threat to our rights.

264
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,820
This is a common conservative narrative, this idea that immigrants will not assimilate

265
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,500
and demand the country upend the Constitution to limit people's rights.

266
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,740
Tim doesn't even understand why he just buys into the idea that immigrants have distinct

267
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,580
cultures and won't become real Americans that believe in American ideals.

268
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,260
For what it's worth, Tim clarifies and says literally everybody can come to the United

269
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
States.

270
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,900
All of them, every single person, okay, if it's legally done.

271
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,100
And he explains it's illegal immigration.

272
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
That's the issue.

273
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,900
To be as charitable as possible, maybe Tim thinks the real danger is making illegal immigrants

274
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,260
citizens will shift the balance of immigrants and native born Americans so that immigrants

275
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,180
would be empowered to vote away everyone's rights.

276
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,020
I don't understand how this can be anything other than prejudice to assume that anyone

277
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,020
coming to America will do so in an effort to reshape the country, to take away everyone's

278
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
rights.

279
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
It's not the end of the world.

280
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
Y'all need to calm down.

281
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,060
And I like how this video ends with Tim telling people to calm down right after he spent 12

282
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,140
minutes talking about how there was an impending civil war.

283
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
Thanks for the advice, Tim.

284
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,740
Since I chose a week close to the holidays, I got a nice dose of festive content from

285
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Tim.

286
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,140
Here's one video that's strangely titled, Soon Merry Christmas Will Be Hate Speech.

287
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,460
Comedian got in trouble at work for saying it.

288
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,420
Tim's discussing two stories here.

289
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,540
One is of comedian Whitney Cummings supposedly being reported to HR for wishing someone a

290
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:07,300
Merry Christmas, and the other example is Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch being

291
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:19,620
criticized for saying Merry Christmas on Fox News.

292
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,700
You can see the glee Tim gets when he hears a story about people being stupid.

293
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,240
I wonder if he watches his own videos.

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,400
And speaking on the Whitney Cummings incident, taking this chat show anecdote on face value,

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,440
it sounds like an intern was perhaps too sensitive.

296
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,080
And that's assuming there's no missing context here.

297
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:45,440
Tim frames it like this.

298
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,320
The punishment for Cummings, near as I can tell, was someone from HR mentioning it to

299
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
her.

300
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
And that's it.

301
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
How nightmarish.

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,000
The second story is more interesting, and it would have made more sense if Gorsuch had

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
made his statement in a less obvious way.

304
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:13,040
But let's look at the actual clip of him saying Merry Christmas.

305
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,600
So the context here is that Fox News pretends that you can't say Merry Christmas on TV,

306
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,760
and when Ainsley Earhart says she loves that he says it, it reinforces the idea that there's

307
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,960
a war on Christmas, a conspiracy theory Fox News has been pushing for 15 years.

308
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,080
Overall it's a minor point, and somehow became the focal point of this interview when

309
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,120
I think the real question is why a Supreme Court justice is making a rare TV appearance

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,740
on a partisan show like Fox and Friends.

311
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,760
The outrage over the left going crazy appeared in article after article, each one mentioning

312
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,000
an article that was published in Salon and a handful of tweets complaining about the

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,660
Merry Christmas dog whistle.

314
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,060
This is the perfect example of a manufactured story, and how the right wing is so effective

315
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,980
in repeating their talking points, they believe they can spin it into a bigger deal than it

316
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,460
really was, and Tim is playing his part in tarnishing the left with a ginned up story

317
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
of outrage.

318
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,820
And don't look, the Republicans are also fundraising off this appearance, that's not

319
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,100
suspect at all.

320
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,740
This video also features Tim racing to the defense of Fox's All-American Christmas ad,

321
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,340
which was criticized for being too white.

322
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,620
They're angry that a commercial for Ainsley Earhart doesn't include people of color,

323
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,980
what the commercial probably has like what, three people in it?

324
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,700
These people are insane.

325
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,180
Just for fun, how many people were in this commercial?

326
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,460
December, join us for an All-American Christmas, all month long on Fox Nation, bringing you

Christmas.

332
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,340
Plus, we're breaking into the Christmas vault for some classic holiday entertainment.

333
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,100
It's an All-American Christmas on Fox Nation.

334
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,980
So Tim was almost close.

335
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,020
It wasn't three people, it was closer to 24.

336
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,100
The War on Christmas idea has long been a staple at Fox News, and the Salon article

337
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,540
I mentioned taking all the heat at least goes to the trouble of describing its origin with

338
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,140
Bill O'Reilly back in 2004, and it includes a link to a political article that goes into

339
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,660
further historical detail.

340
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,140
Tim, of course, doesn't engage with any of this, and instead pretends like people pointing

341
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,220
out the conspiracy theory are, in fact, the conspiracy theorists themselves.

342
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,300
That a Fox host and a Supreme Court justice simply saying, Merry Christmas, I love that

343
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,060
you say that, is actually them trying to validate a conspiracy theory, you're actually the

344
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,660
one pushing the conspiracy theory.

345
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,540
So I will ask, how long do you think until they start actually banning people for saying

346
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
things like this?

347
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,820
Ironically, Tim talking about people getting banned for saying Merry Christmas, a statement

348
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,220
not backed up by any of the facts and any of the stories here, is actually perpetuating

349
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,020
the War on Christmas conspiracy theory.

350
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,780
A few tweets and one article Salon criticizing something isn't the same as asking for words

351
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,260
to be banned.

352
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,700
Tim also deploys one of his most commonly used tactics when it comes to ignoring the

353
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
left.

354
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,540
He simply writes them off as crazy.

355
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,860
This is the epitome of just, you know what, I've never seen a more insane leftist article.

356
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay.

359
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,980
This is one of the most common talking points he deploys and a classic method used to sidestep

360
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,940
any real discussion or debate when you can write off your opposition is crazy.

361
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,140
You don't have to engage with them in a meaningful sense.

362
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,140
And I know while Tim has tried addressing people on the left in debates, like his recent

363
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,500
embarrassing conversation with Sam Cedar, he's revealed that he isn't equipped to be

364
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,260
having these discussions.

365
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,260
And I admit it's it's I'll call it dickish utilitarianism is typically the villain in

366
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,660
most movies.

367
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
I don't care.

368
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Yeah.

369
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,900
So, so for instance, like Thanos was the utilitarian and Captain America was deontological.

370
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
I did.

371
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,860
So Thanos willing to reduce the suffering by killing, you know, hundreds of trillions

372
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,220
versus the thousands of trillions, which would be living better off.

373
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,620
So maybe that's why he would sooner write off the left as crazy or detached from reality.

374
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,380
He's not capable of really engaging with them in a meaningful way.

375
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,740
I suspect a lot of that comes from him generally not understanding what he reads as evidenced

376
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,780
by the many previous examples already in this video.

377
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,060
Here's another example of how he doesn't really read the articles he highlights.

378
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,940
In the war on Christmas video, I mentioned he waved away all claims about Fox News pushing

379
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,980
a war on Christmas narrative with they say Fox News is a long history of claiming there

380
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,500
is a war on Christmas tracing back to a 2004 segment by former talk show host Bill O'Reilly

381
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,760
called Christmas under siege.

382
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,700
This is insanity.

383
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,860
He literally just said Merry Christmas and said, I love you say that.

384
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,340
I don't know what that's supposed to mean other than Merry Christmas.

385
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,140
And here's what happens when he gets further along in the article.

386
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,540
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
It's also anti-Semitic.

388
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,820
They added that too.

389
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,100
You know what, man, I'm over it.

390
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,140
It seems like Tim was genuinely surprised to read that bit almost as if he hadn't

391
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,020
read the article fully before deciding to make a video on it or being more fair than

392
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,060
maybe I should be.

393
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,940
Maybe Tim forgot about that part.

394
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,800
He certainly didn't have anything to say about it.

395
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,780
And that's how Tim handles most of his topics.

396
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,420
He points out ridiculous lefts being writes them off as crazy and absolves himself of

397
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,580
the weighty business of addressing their criticisms.

398
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,860
And those are the exact anti-left wing narratives that his right wing audience snaps up so

399
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,420
readily.

400
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,600
With those major themes all covered, I did see a few videos that don't fit into any

401
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,980
specific category that still display some of the poor tactics Tim uses to talk about

402
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
the news.

403
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,820
In a video charmingly titled Greta Thunberg Accidentally Calls for Execution of Politicians

404
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,780
Take the Greta Thunberg Challenge, climate activist Greta Thunberg is of course a hot

405
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,980
button topic being an advocate for climate change and Tim, though a believer in climate

406
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,900
change supposedly, isn't a fan of Greta.

407
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,980
The heart of this video is Greta's claim that she wants to put politicians against

408
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,980
the wall with regard to climate change, which Tim and conservative media took to mean she

409
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,420
wants to lead a violent revolution putting these politicians against the wall where they'll

410
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
be executed.

411
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,800
Do you know what it means to put someone against the wall in English?

412
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,520
It's a reference to, you know, putting someone against the wall and then aiming a weapon

413
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,360
at them because you're sentencing them to no longer being alive.

414
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,740
But Tim breaks ranks here, surprisingly.

415
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,820
He does the unthinkable and gets more input from a Swedish journalist who explained that

416
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,800
in Sweden, the phrase, up against the wall, also means being in a tight spot.

417
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,720
I reached out to a local journalist and I asked them, what does it mean?

418
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,080
And he told me it's a very common phrase that means pushing them up against the wall

419
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,400
and likes, it's like basically my understanding is when they don't do what you want to do,

420
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,640
you hold them accountable about pushing them to the wall and like, you know, solding them.

421
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
Like, you know, that's basically it.

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Here's a fun fact.

423
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,800
That's also what it means in English, at least according to the dictionary.

424
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
But the heart of why Tim doesn't like Greta is that while he agrees with her message,

425
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,520
he thinks she's just being too mean.

426
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,480
You need to stop propping her up.

427
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:33,720
So leaving aside how gross it is for an adult man telling a teenage girl she should smile

428
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,960
more, this is the exact sort of tone policing that's the real enemy of discourse.

429
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,800
The idea that if only Greta were nice and polite, climate change would be solved, or

430
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,520
at least people would finally listen.

431
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,240
Scientists have been politely requesting governments take a moment to do something about emissions

432
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
for decades.

433
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
The time for politely asking for change has passed.

434
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,600
Throughout the video, Tim keeps pivoting back to Greta needing to convince random people

435
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
walking down the street.

436
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,800
This isn't about asking someone to ride a bike to work.

437
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,180
The only way to solve climate change is through action at the highest levels of government.

438
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,580
Religious people are precisely who Greta was scolding, and if Tim believes that governments

439
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,660
won't take action because the 16-year-old girl wasn't nice enough, he isn't qualified

440
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,280
to be speaking on the subject.

441
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,420
And before leaving, I do feel like I need to mention that Tim had two videos about UFOs.

442
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:31,100
Massive surge of credible UFO sightings in 2019 theorists think aliens will reveal themselves,

443
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,620
and Trump's Space Force is now official.

444
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,260
New branch comes conspicuously around the same time as UFOs.

445
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,540
I gotta say, I had no idea that Tim Poole was into UFOs, but it's the least surprising

446
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,100
new thing I learned while watching a week of his content.

447
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,260
Tim buys into some pretty kooky stuff, so sure, why not UFOs?

448
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,100
Heck, he even thinks the massive waste of taxpayer money that is the Space Force is

449
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,460
Donald Trump's coolest idea.

450
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,820
For some reason, there are a lot of people ragging on Trump for wanting a Space Force,

451
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,980
and I gotta admit, this is the coolest thing Trump has ever done.

452
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,740
And he thinks this is a step towards the Federation, as seen on Star Trek.

453
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,140
You know, we have all these shows, you know, you have Starfleet and Star Trek, and you

454
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,140
have these sci-fi movies where there's like a fleet in outer space.

455
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,100
This is the beginning of that, okay?

456
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,460
I'm not sure why the beginning wasn't NASA, the government agency that's dedicated

457
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,860
to space travel and has already been to the moon, but I guess they're not training people

458
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,900
to blow up aliens, so less cool, I guess.

459
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,980
I'm a fan of the Star Trek that's about science and exploration, meeting new aliens

460
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,300
to be their friends, not blow them up.

461
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,580
But I'm obviously not being fair.

462
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,380
Tim isn't here to push conspiracy theories, he says so himself.

463
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,140
I am not here to push stupid conspiracies or anything, I'm just here to have a little

464
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,060
fun with these UFO stories.

465
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,660
And here he is definitely not pushing a conspiracy theory forward.

466
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,300
Is something interesting that should be mentioned, that we have an uptick in all of these credible

467
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:03,180
stories about UFOs, Navy pilots, going back years, saying this is real, and then all of

468
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,860
a sudden, a space force being signed into law.

469
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,820
Is it possible that in reality, it's not about aliens, it's about the fact the U.S. government

470
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,380
is recognizing finally, and they are, that there is something happening in space and

471
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,100
in the atmosphere we can't understand?

472
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,060
He's just having fun, you guys.

473
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,020
Perhaps now, the Space Force, in the next few years, they're going to be like, look

474
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,940
at this thing we built, even though we've already had the technology for a long time.

475
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,620
I don't know, I don't know, I just like the idea, I think it's fun, I'm not telling

476
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,260
you it's true, I know all the stupid lefties are going to be like, Tim pushes UFO conspiracies

477
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,500
all the time, oh calm down, okay, this story is real, it's from the independent left-wing

478
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,100
side, I think it's just fun to talk about.

479
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,740
And the sad thing is, if Tim limited his videos to discussions about UFOs and big feet, it

480
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,540
would be far less damaging.

481
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,940
Believing in stupid conspiracies isn't nearly as harmful as what he does now, disseminating

482
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,140
right-wing talking points and actively reframing news of the day to fit right-wing narratives.

483
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:05,500
I don't care about Tim Pool, it's what he represents, that's the problem.

484
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,020
People like Tim Pool, who use their supposed status as being on the left-wing and then

485
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,940
go on to trash the left-wing with right-wing talking points and narratives, will always

486
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
exist.

487
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,700
When Tim Pool calls it a day in his career, someone else who uses the same techniques

488
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,220
will show up and take his place.

489
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm hoping this exercise in looking at Tim Pool's work will help you see some of the

490
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,380
warning signs in the future, and hopefully you'll be able to spot future Tim Pools

491
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,060
at first glance.

492
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,380
How they'll weigh the benefit of the doubt towards conservatives.

493
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,820
How they'll only read stories superficially.

494
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,140
How they'll dismiss arguments with personal insults and their general reluctance to ever

495
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,020
criticize in any meaningful way, besides someone supposedly disagrees with politically.

496
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:56,180
Before I go, I just can't resist, using some of the random clips I couldn't find

497
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,400
a place for in this video that just make Tim look stupid.

498
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,420
There is no context for these, I just wanted to dunk on him a little.

499
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,980
So let's have fun doing that.

500
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,660
Here's Tim saying socialism can't work unless you get rid of money.

501
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,180
So the only true socialist or communist system can't have money in it.

502
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,740
Here's Tim saying something obviously not true about the president who has the thinnest

503
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
skin ever.

504
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,140
Do you think Trump cares about people calling him bad names?

505
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
I don't think so.

506
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,780
Tim apparently believes entitled college kids expect factories to be handed to them.

507
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,260
You look at the factory that someone else put time and energy to build.

508
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,120
All of the workers, whatever your opinion is about labor.

509
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,420
Somebody made a plan.

510
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,700
Somebody worked hard, saved money.

511
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Somebody got a loan.

512
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
They hired people.

513
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Everyone contributed to build a factory.

514
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,420
Now you deserve that because you took feminist dance at a local college and you were indoctrinated

515
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:54,100
into the idea that people shouldn't be allowed to build a company and own property.

516
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Okay, whatever.

517
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Have those opinions.

518
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,260
Here's Tim offering some survival advice.

519
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,020
You can be homeless.

520
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,500
You can have no clothes.

521
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,140
You can be in the middle of the woods.

522
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,620
But you can pick up a rock and congratulations, now you've got something.

523
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,540
You can start doing something.

524
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,500
Go watch ancient technology on YouTube.

525
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I love these channels.

526
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,900
He built a mud hut in an oven.

527
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
He got a house.

528
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
He builds a house.

529
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
It's amazing.

530
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
A lot of dirt.

531
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Brilliant.

532
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,860
I don't know how a person naked in the woods watches YouTube, but okay.

533
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Tim mistakenly thinks a common phrase comes from a card game.

534
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,780
There's something I've cited, you know, several times, mostly in the past.

535
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,460
I'll bring it back up.

536
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,780
It's this Magic the Gathering card.

537
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,340
If you're familiar with the game, Magic the Gathering, it's a card game.

538
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Swords to plowshares.

539
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,180
For the record, the phrase actually originates from the Bible, which predates Magic the Gathering

540
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,420
by at least a couple of decades.

541
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,140
I didn't get to any of Tim's horrible videos about British politics, but if you want to

542
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,380
know the sort of experts he consults, here's who he talks to.

543
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
I should say this.

544
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
I'll defer to Sargon.

545
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,420
Alright, if you guys watch Sargon's content, because he's from there.

546
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,420
He knows better than me.

547
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,900
Also, I thought it was funny that he didn't know how the UK House of Lords works or that

548
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
it existed.

549
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,580
Did you know that the UK has a House of Lords?

550
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,620
I didn't understand this.

551
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,540
I thought it was like the House and the Senate.

552
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,620
No, it turns out the House of Lords are like appointees of like land owners from historic

553
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,620
times.

554
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm thinking Bernie Sanders was born nearly 100 years ago.

555
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
What generation is Bernie in?

556
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
He's not a boomer.

557
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
No, he's not a boomer.

558
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
What is he?

559
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Greatest generation?

560
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I mean, I don't know.

561
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
I don't know.

562
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
What generation is it?

563
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
It's greatest, right?

564
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,340
Bernie is actually a part of the silent generation, but just barely though, he was born in 1942.

565
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,300
Just shy of a few years of being a boomer.

566
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,620
Thank you all for bearing with me.

567
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
That was cathartic.

568
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,340
Whenever I make videos looking at some noxious conservative dirtbag, it's not as painful

569
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,580
for me as people think.

570
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,060
And I see all these comments saying, oh, thank you for your sacrifice for suffering through

571
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
this.

572
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,220
And while it's not a painless experience, you get used to it pretty quickly.

573
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,900
And when you're only looking at one video or a documentary film, you sort of become

574
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,540
numb to the awfulness.

575
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:05,700
This though, this was one week of 42 videos watching six a day from Tim Pool.

576
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,300
And ah, this one really, really hurt.

577
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,900
His content is just so bad.

578
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,700
There is so much rambling, so much nonsense.

579
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,820
It was rough.

580
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
It was rough.

581
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,860
But I do it all for you.

582
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,580
Those used in particular are my patrons.

583
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,300
But even if you're not a patron, I appreciate anyone who takes their time to watch my videos.

584
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,940
And if you'd like to show me said appreciation, there is of course the aforementioned Patreon

585
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,300
where you could give me a little money to do more videos like this and me or maybe videos

586
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,020
where I get to watch things I enjoy and have fun and tell you about them.

587
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,300
You can also do the usual YouTube things of liking, commenting, subscribing or sharing

588
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,700
this video with friends.

589
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
That's cool, too.

590
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,940
You can also follow me on Twitter, ask me some questions on curious cast.

591
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,900
And I'm thinking of doing a new Q&A video probably when I hit my next patron goal, which

592
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,300
has a very short, short, short, short bonus video that everyone will be seeing on this

593
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
channel.

594
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
And I'll throw in a Q&A.

595
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Because why not?

596
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
It's been a while.

597
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,940
I think the last time I did one, I had like 2,500 subscribers.

598
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,380
There are a lot more of you now.

599
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,660
Look for a community post and that's where the questions will go.

600
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,700
Thank you all for watching my video, bye.
