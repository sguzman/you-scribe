0	6940	Thanks to the very generous patrons over on my Patreon, I am now earning over $100 a month on this channel.
6940	13060	So that means they've unlocked an old video I made two years ago responding to a Sargon of Akkad video called
13300	18120	Social Justice is in Cool. Fair warning, the audio here is pretty rough.
18220	23220	The mic I used was pretty terrible and originally I was just gonna release the audio
23220	28700	but I realized huge chunks of it don't make any sense without certain visuals, so I've kind of patched that in.
28700	33940	But this is very much a quick video that I hope people will enjoy while I've got something bigger in the works.
34200	38440	It's honestly not my best work. There's a reason I didn't put it online.
38440	43580	I didn't think it was especially great, but I thought it would be a fun extra and maybe people can get something out of it.
44240	51120	Now that Carl Benjamin is currently running for office, this video seems like an artifact from before he was making a fool of himself
51200	55860	on an international stage. I think this video is a nice reminder that he was never that bright.
55860	61220	He was never that thoughtful. And the main reason I never uploaded it was because I realized I was essentially
61620	68060	responding to a completely vacuous statement about what is and is not cool. As one of his commenters put it,
68060	71580	he was basically operating at the level of an obnoxious high school kid.
71780	76820	Which seems about right for his entire career to be honest. Enough of my rambling. Here's the actual video.
76820	79980	I hope you all like it and once again apologies for the audio.
79980	86020	I've noticed that over the last 10 years people have been posting nonsense on YouTube.
86580	92020	As a rational person, I've decided it's fallen upon me to point out how wrong they are. So here I go.
92340	94340	First guy I want to talk about is
94500	98600	Sargon of Akkad and his video, social justice is uncool.
99220	106220	One of the first examples he uses is Sarah's Scribbles, a webcomic by Sarah Anderson, which he classifies as
106700	108700	self-indulgent nonsense.
109300	115300	He mentioned something about the comics having the preachy quasi-religious rhetoric of social justice.
115420	121580	The problem is the webcomic he points out has nothing to do with social justice.
122500	130660	Unless time management is a social justice issue now. Next he points out how white nationalists are parodying this particular webcomic.
130660	135980	I guess white nationalists parodying something means it must have a social justice agenda.
136220	142380	But I don't really follow the train of thought here since I generally don't let white nationalists frame my criticisms.
142380	150140	And it sounds like Sargon is alluding to that Anderson is asking for it with her content.
150540	158460	That's pretty classy. Anyway, we're just warming up here. A bigger example Sargon wants to talk about is the comic book industry and its
158900	160900	stark decline.
161000	165700	Social justice apparently means including Hillary Clinton and Justin Trudeau in a comic book.
166700	173660	I'm not really sure why this is the case, but he'd be horrified to know that politicians have been in comics for many years.
173820	181260	From recent appearances like Obama and Spider-Man to older ones like JFK and Superman. It's something that's been going on for decades.
181980	188620	As for the Hillary story, it turns out it wasn't published in any sort of watchman titled by DC Comics.
188900	196060	It was actually created by two independent artists, Aaron Edwards and Arlen Schumer for their website The Outline.
196780	201340	They're reimagining the original watchman series as if it were taking place following Trump's election.
202140	206300	Kind of an interesting idea, although the reverence for Hillary is kind of
207500	209180	uh
209180	211180	odd, I guess.
211180	218620	But the important thing is that this is not a comic being published by DC Comics. It's just taken from some random website.
219740	223740	And God knows why DC is jumping on this bandwagon. Well,
224620	230300	they aren't. Now Thor, holy shit. Apparently this new Thor comic is
230780	234140	that this comic is an act of cultural conquest.
234700	235900	Who knew?
235900	243900	He takes issue with Absorbing Man's dialogue. Apparently it's standing in for old Thor readers, or at least those who have issues with an e-fennail Thor.
244700	246540	This is a really cynical reading.
246540	253260	Basically assumes that all the old Thor readers are reactionary manchildren who are upset that their favorite character lost his name.
253500	256860	The point here is that Absorbing Man is supposed to sound small and petty,
257180	260860	representing a fraction of the readership. A fact backed up by the sales numbers,
261020	267660	but we'll get to that shortly. If someone really misses Guy Thor, you can actually still read a button in the other Thor comic.
268300	269980	Some conquest.
269980	271980	Captain America is a Nazi.
271980	275340	Actually, he's a Niger, whose history is a bit more complicated than that.
275900	280860	Maybe instead of looking at an article about the story, we can actually look at its contents.
281580	288060	In this particular narrative, the Red Skull, Captain America's arch enemy and a actual Nazi,
288620	294700	rewrote history using the cosmic cube to change Captain America's past so that he's a member of Hydra.
295340	301740	Call me a cynical comic reader if you must, but I suspect this change may not be permanent.
301980	304780	That perhaps the villain might actually lose in the end.
305020	309820	Sort of like how Spider-Man did that a few years ago when Doctor Octopus took over his mind for a year,
310060	314940	or when Iron Man was made evil by a magic spell gone awry. In other words,
315020	320220	it's an unfinished comic book story that will end with Captain America going back to his old patriotic self.
321180	325980	That's right, it's not even finished yet, but hey, let's accuse it of all sorts of shit.
326380	329420	But as for that particular story's commentary on America,
330060	334140	it's actually not about Captain America fans being Nazis, believe it or not.
334540	337020	I mean, who would call the readership Nazis?
337580	342700	And it's pretty good from what I've read so far anyway, and I'm hoping to read the rest of it when it's finally finished.
343340	350540	Sargon hones in on comments from Marvel's VP of Sales, David Gabriel, who in a recent comment mentioned how sales have been dropping
350940	356460	due to the influx of new characters, including visible minorities and women in Marvel's recent titles.
356860	360140	Neither Gabriel nor Sargon seem to think this is quite the case,
360620	367580	but on Sargon's side, he's jumped to it being because these characters are about social justice and are being rewarded with
368060	369980	terrible sales.
369980	373500	I have to assume the characters he mentioned so far are his examples,
374060	376700	so if we take the examples of the new Thor,
376940	381980	Hydra Cap, and Maki Bird, only that last one was cancelled. And for what it may be worth,
382060	385020	I think Maki Bird is all like Solo, Prowler,
385420	391740	Hellcat, Scarlet Witch, and the rest, who are Marvel characters who just can't seem to hold an ongoing title.
392140	394460	Dozens of new titles are launched every year.
395180	399020	In fact, most of the time they get cancelled because they just don't sell that well.
399420	402940	This is actually the cover of a Marvel magazine.
403580	405180	Civil War 2.
405180	407020	Civil War 2.
407020	409020	Civil War 2.
409100	415180	Feminism is the hegemonic ideology that they kowtow to, and if you want to enjoy Marvel comics,
415420	419580	you'd better enjoy feminism as well, because you're going to get a lot of it.
419740	423500	The fact that we're talking about Maki Bird exclusively is a strange exception,
423500	431020	unless you're going to tell me how a crappy Punisher knockoff like Solo is pushing a social justice agenda and had shitty sales for the same reason.
431580	437500	When it comes to female Thor, it turns out she sells pretty well, and she's actually been an overall successor of the comic.
438140	444540	Although Marvel has seen an overall decline, Thor has been one of the more reliable performers, consistently in the top for sales for Marvel.
444940	451580	That's for Hydra Cap. It's a bit early to tell how well that's selling. For what it's worth, the big,
452140	456220	you know, first issue of the events centered around him, for some reason
456860	460140	number zero. That was the top-selling comic in April.
460780	465420	Yeah, I don't really see Marvel being hurt by that particular social justice agenda comic.
465740	472140	Next, in the video, Sargon takes on some articles that have criticized Gabriel's statement by reading their headlines in a mocking tone.
472540	476140	He doesn't really engage with any arguments here, so it's hard to know what to address.
476700	482700	He didn't really acknowledge stuff like an endless series of event comics, an oversaturation of the number of titles,
482860	487660	the industry overall being in a downturn, or even stiff competition from DC Comics.
487820	494380	But I guess none of those are really arguments that resonates as strongly with him as William N'Jall and Social Justice Warriors.
495020	501660	And it's a lot easier to do that than to actually try and look at the real and many various reasons why Marvel Comics is
501740	503740	not doing so well right now.
504220	509740	Okay, the next thing we're talking about is how cringy David Key Harbor's speech was at the SAG Awards.
510300	512940	I don't know, I guess it was a little overwrought,
513180	519580	but maybe I'm a little less sensitive to an artist's feelings as though their work has some power to affect the world positively.
519980	524140	But yeah, what an asshole wanting to do something positive through entertainment.
524680	527900	Regardless of what anyone thinks of that speech, I think it'll
528600	535420	probably end up with a lot of people tuning into the second season of Stranger Things. That's just a hunch though.
535820	537820	Next up is Samantha Bee.
538140	543660	Apparently it's impossible to sit through one of her clips, so impossible that her ratings have been going up
544540	547740	by a lot. Her ratings started off humbly enough with about
548140	550140	900,000 viewers
550220	556300	since Trump's election though. Since then, her ratings have reached an average of 2.1 million.
557020	561180	In fact, she's doing so well that TBS just picked her up for another 26 episodes. So
562060	564060	I guess there's some people out there who like her.
564460	567500	The rest of the video is just talking shit about the new Bill Nye show.
567900	574460	And since that shows, ratings are unknowable since Netflix hasn't really released them. We can't really know how popular it is.
575340	584220	And personally, I haven't actually watched the show and I'm not really comfortable talking about it without having hard facts to back up my claims about its popularity.
584460	585660	You know, there's
585660	587660	a lesson in there somewhere for
587980	589980	someone who isn't me.
590300	595820	The video ends with some girl in a black mask promoting the level of wit displayed at a protest.
596220	602380	He doesn't really have any facts or evidence to back up his claims. He's picking and choosing what he likes to fit a particular narrative.
603020	604060	Something.
604060	610620	Anything to advance the notion that social justice is some kind of virus infecting media that will soon destroy it.
610860	613580	I guess he sees himself as something of a heroic figure.
613980	619260	Standing tall against the tide of social justice as it destroys all the things he doesn't care about.
619660	625420	But sales and ratings of this stuff doesn't seem to back it up. People actually enjoy watching and reading all this stuff and
625660	629580	you know, they seem to be able to do it without it getting the Sargon stamp of cool.
630540	631580	And
631580	632700	ultimately
632700	634060	does that really matter?
634060	637900	Sargon's voice is howling in the wilderness for a time that's slipping away when
638440	646380	superheroes were all white guys or when comedy didn't have a political conscience or when we all heeded the sage wisdom of a woman in a balaclava.
646860	652060	Personally, when I see media I don't like, I generally stop watching it and move on with my life.
652860	654140	Or
654140	655980	sometimes
655980	657980	write and produce an entire YouTube video.
658780	664300	Thanks for watching that video. If you want to see more of these old videos get unlocked, I've got at least one more.
664380	666380	It's very short and has me singing and
667020	669420	maybe some other stuff I will reveal.
670380	676780	Become one of my patrons and bring the world more videos like this, I guess. Or actually good ones I produce more regularly.
676940	683100	Also, you can subscribe to this channel, like, comment, etc. Follow me on twitter and curious cat questions.
684300	686300	I think that's about everything. Except for
686300	688940	thanks for watching.
