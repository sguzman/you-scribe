00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hey everyone, I am here with my promised Q&A, and I got a bunch of questions on Curious Cat,

00:06.240 --> 00:12.400
and I'm gonna do my best to answer them right now. The first question. After your brilliant

00:12.400 --> 00:17.120
video on Dave Rubin, thank you, there have been a number of other great video analyses covering

00:17.120 --> 00:22.320
other aspects of why he and his show are so flawed and dishonest. Now that Rubin's been

00:22.320 --> 00:26.800
covered so well, do you think Joe Rogan should be next to receive this treatment?

00:26.800 --> 00:32.400
The Cerst did a video on his show being the start of an alt-right pipeline, but otherwise

00:32.400 --> 00:38.160
there's been very little from leftist YouTube criticizing him and his show directly, mostly

00:38.160 --> 00:44.400
just of individual guests on it. The real difficulty with covering Joe Rogan is that he has

00:44.960 --> 00:51.520
so much content. It would take literally thousands of hours of listening to his stuff to get a sense

00:51.520 --> 00:56.720
of what his show is about and how he's evolved and changed over the years. Personally, I don't have

00:56.800 --> 01:02.000
the time to invest in this. If I could come up with an angle to tackle this, I would be interested

01:02.000 --> 01:08.400
in doing that, but until I come up with that angle, which would mean a more focused and narrower

01:08.400 --> 01:14.560
domain when it comes to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, sadly I'll have to pass on this for now,

01:14.560 --> 01:18.720
but who knows what the future will bring, and if I get that right angle, I'll go for it.

01:19.680 --> 01:28.000
Next question. Is municipal tap water in Canada drinkable? Yeah, generally speaking it is. In any

01:28.000 --> 01:33.360
major city, you can drink the tap water and you'll be just fine. That's not always true if you live

01:33.360 --> 01:39.280
on a reservation of some kind. This typically affects more remote areas of Canada, and I don't

01:39.280 --> 01:45.600
know too much about this subject. The debate is generally framed as a mix of governmental

01:45.600 --> 01:51.680
incompetence and corruption within the tribal system as the government's treatment of Indigenous

01:51.680 --> 01:57.840
peoples in Canada has generally ranged from bad to awful. If you're in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver,

01:57.840 --> 02:03.360
whatever, you're gonna be fine. Next question. What are your thoughts on the state of educational

02:03.360 --> 02:09.040
television in Canada? I live in Alberta and recently our CTV2 affiliate, originally an

02:09.040 --> 02:14.240
education channel for the province, stopped airing their educational programming. I don't like the

02:14.240 --> 02:20.000
sound of educational programming being taken away from anywhere. Honestly, this question I don't

02:20.000 --> 02:25.440
have a very good answer for, so you'll have to excuse me. Instead of giving you a half an ass,

02:25.440 --> 02:32.240
kind of like, sort of maybe this, I'm gonna have to do something you don't see enough of on YouTube

02:32.240 --> 02:38.080
and just say, I don't know, I'm not knowledgeable about this, and I'd have to do some real research

02:38.080 --> 02:43.840
and some real digging to give you an actual answer that has some semblance of knowledge or insight

02:43.840 --> 02:48.880
into the situation. Shooting from the hip about a topic I know very little about is just something

02:48.880 --> 02:56.160
I don't enjoy doing, and I think it's something people should do way less of, way, way less of

02:56.160 --> 03:02.880
on YouTube. Next question. Will you remember us when you're famous? I don't think I'm ever gonna

03:02.880 --> 03:08.800
be famous, and I kind of like that. There are a lot of good things that come with fame, usually

03:08.800 --> 03:14.000
some sort of financial stability, a lot of opportunities to do exciting and new things,

03:14.000 --> 03:20.240
and I'd rather have all of those perks and none of the downsides. Fame isn't really a goal with this,

03:21.200 --> 03:27.040
but if I do become famous, of course, I will remember you, anonymous question asker. How could

03:27.040 --> 03:33.840
I forget? Opinion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Remember what I said about not

03:33.840 --> 03:38.960
commenting on things I don't know anything about? I know nothing about this. The only

03:38.960 --> 03:44.720
sentiment I could possibly offer here is that I hope this Commonwealth does right by the people

03:44.720 --> 03:50.240
of Poland and Lithuania. I'm gonna not talk about it, otherwise I'm gonna be like Dave Rubin with

03:50.240 --> 03:57.120
his commentary on Bolsonaro and his getting rid of the SJW stuff. No one needs that. No one needs

03:57.120 --> 04:02.880
that on YouTube. Next question. Why are my YouTube recommends so terrible? I'm guessing you watched

04:02.880 --> 04:08.800
a single video by, I don't know, Sargon of Akkad? Maybe you watched a quartering video? That

04:08.800 --> 04:14.240
usually kills your recommendations and suddenly you're down this grotesque anti-SJW rabbit hole.

04:14.240 --> 04:19.680
It's the YouTube algorithm. It's pretty garbage. I have a separate YouTube account I use for my

04:19.680 --> 04:25.280
research, so it's got the worst recommendations, which helps when I'm researching a video, but

04:25.280 --> 04:29.760
whenever I'm watching my own stuff I log into a different account. Why would I waste time

04:29.760 --> 04:34.400
logging into an account that's just going to give me garbage videos? I'm glad people stopped

04:34.400 --> 04:38.880
making those Captain Marvel videos because my recommendations for about two weeks after I made

04:38.880 --> 04:45.440
that video about Get Woke Go Broke being a lie was just angry stupid. Oh Captain Marvel's gonna

04:45.440 --> 04:50.560
fail videos and by the way, quick callback to that video. How much money did that make on its

04:50.560 --> 04:56.880
opening weekend again? Oh yeah, like nearly half a billion dollars. So Get Woke Go Broke my ass.

04:56.880 --> 05:03.120
I usually don't take a victory lap, but damn that one felt good. Next question. Dear Jose,

05:03.680 --> 05:09.120
besides running a YouTube channel and correcting skeptics, what other passions do you have?

05:09.120 --> 05:14.640
Favorite subjects in academia? Talents? Hobbies? Thank you for making this content and congratulations

05:14.640 --> 05:19.520
for 2,500 subscribers. Thank you for the congratulations and that's four questions,

05:19.520 --> 05:25.280
but since you're so nice I'm gonna answer them all. Other passions. I'm a pretty avid reader. I

05:25.280 --> 05:30.800
read a lot of different types of fiction. I'm a big lover of the arts. I love creative writing.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.520
I have not done nearly enough of it recently. I did a little bit today. It felt good, although

05:35.520 --> 05:41.040
what I created was crap, but that's the creative process. I was trying to teach myself to draw for

05:41.040 --> 05:47.680
a while. That didn't go so well, but I can still I can make decent things. I also love traveling.

05:47.680 --> 05:53.200
I've been to quite a few places now. Currently my goal is to see every continent on the planet

05:53.200 --> 05:59.680
except for Antarctica because of the ecological impact of tourism on that continent. Favorite

05:59.680 --> 06:05.760
subjects in academia? Probably English literature. I studied it in university and adored it. I also

06:05.760 --> 06:12.240
have a major in psychology, which while great, isn't quite as fun as English literature to be

06:12.240 --> 06:18.480
honest. Talents. But I used to sing. I played a few instruments, never any good. Maybe writing,

06:18.480 --> 06:25.200
I guess. That's kind of a talent. Hobbies. I do play a few video games, although not nearly as much

06:25.200 --> 06:31.600
as I used to. Having a boring life, that's my hobby. Next question. What's your opinion on the

06:31.600 --> 06:39.200
debate Nazis or don't debate Nazis debate? I think what I do on this channel is debate. And I mean

06:39.200 --> 06:46.160
debate in that I confront terrible ideas with my ideas, which are not so terrible. I might even call

06:46.160 --> 06:52.400
some of them good. In this channel, I try to interrogate and really test terrible ideas that

06:52.400 --> 07:00.640
includes ideas not only from Nazis, but very noxious people with shitty, fascistic, wrongheaded,

07:00.640 --> 07:06.560
toxic ideologies. In that sense, I am already part of the debate. What people usually refer to as a

07:06.560 --> 07:11.680
debate, particularly when they're challenging me to a debate in the comment section is if I'll

07:11.680 --> 07:16.720
actually take something like that seriously, is they want to have some sort of live stream

07:16.720 --> 07:21.520
confrontation where people will shout at each other while trying to trip them up with these

07:21.520 --> 07:26.640
silly rhetorical games and pedantic gotcha moments where they're trying to score points

07:26.640 --> 07:33.280
in some sort of absurd performance that's really more a mockery of debate and discourse. I would

07:33.280 --> 07:38.320
join in with the knowledge that what I am doing is not actually debating someone. This is some sort

07:38.320 --> 07:43.840
of weird performance that we're engaged in for an audience that is often under the delusion that

07:43.840 --> 07:50.320
they're seeing ideas clash in some sort of real-time environment. That's not really how people figure

07:50.320 --> 07:55.680
out what is or isn't true. If we're talking about academia, for instance, you'll see that in the

07:55.680 --> 07:59.840
literature. That's where the ideas will really come into clash and you'll see real debate happen

07:59.840 --> 08:05.280
because people will have time to research and think about their responses and provide evidence.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.880
We're not really set up as human beings to be debating machines where you can just

08:10.880 --> 08:17.280
plop down on a stage and rattle off a bunch of facts. That's why you see these fact-free debaters

08:17.280 --> 08:22.480
thrive in that environment because you can't really match them one-on-one because they don't

08:22.480 --> 08:28.080
use facts to begin with. So they're just debating from their gut using their opinions and feelings

08:28.080 --> 08:32.800
as if these are somehow evidence for their arguments. They aren't. They're just using

08:32.880 --> 08:37.840
debating tactics to win over an audience. Apart from leftist content, would you ever put your

08:37.840 --> 08:43.120
fingers in different video essay pies? My next video is going to be very much a departure and

08:43.120 --> 08:48.480
a different kind of video essay. It will be technically leftist content but it's going to

08:48.480 --> 08:53.360
be very different. I don't want to spoil the surprise just yet but I hope people give it a

08:53.360 --> 08:58.880
shot and I think people are going to hate it or love it and really those are the only two extremes

08:58.880 --> 09:05.040
I'm interested in. As for the future, I have so many ideas and things I'd love to do but I'm not

09:05.040 --> 09:11.680
ready to spill the beans on those just yet. Next question. Why is your voice so damn sexy?

09:12.640 --> 09:18.000
I think that's a question you can answer better than I can. I don't think my voice is anything

09:18.000 --> 09:23.120
terribly special to be honest. The reason it sounds a little bassy is because I actually turn

09:23.120 --> 09:30.080
up the bass a little when I'm mixing my audio. I kind of like it and I guess you do too.

09:31.280 --> 09:38.160
Next question. Do you enjoy watching cartoons or animes? Not nearly as much as I used to and

09:38.160 --> 09:43.440
that's more a product of just having less free time as I get older and you don't get much time

09:43.440 --> 09:49.360
for watching stuff sadly but I do have a couple of cartoons I enjoy. BoJack Horseman on Netflix

09:49.360 --> 09:55.040
is great. My favorite show of all time, if we're only counting seasons 2 through 9,

09:55.040 --> 10:00.720
could very well be The Simpsons. I used to watch a fair amount of anime and generally fallen off

10:00.720 --> 10:06.400
of that as well but my favorite TV series of all time as a complete package because it did not dip

10:06.400 --> 10:11.280
in quality like The Simpsons but it was good and pure and wonderful through its entire run.

10:11.280 --> 10:16.960
That is Nana. I mentioned it in my comic skate video and I will absolutely mention it again here.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.560
The anime was just so good it will shatter your heart and make you a better person for having

10:22.560 --> 10:29.280
had that happen. Other all-time favorite anime are my favorite movie ever Princess Mononoke and

10:29.280 --> 10:33.680
really anything by Studio Ghibli but Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are two of my other

10:33.680 --> 10:39.520
favorites. Cowboy Bebop is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I also loved Gundam

10:39.520 --> 10:45.520
Seed, a show that is both over and underrated if that's possible. Before anyone asks I'm not

10:45.520 --> 10:49.280
a huge fan of most other Gundam shows although I have watched quite a few.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.080
What's your favorite meme of this year so far? I'm tempted to say the Fiji water girl was my

10:56.080 --> 11:01.280
favorite but the one that made me laugh the hardest this year was the hallway pizza guy.

11:01.280 --> 11:08.240
I'm gonna just play the video. Next question, are you optimistic about the future? Yes, I actually

11:08.240 --> 11:14.320
am optimistic about the future. If I thought things were going badly and would continue to go badly

11:14.320 --> 11:22.320
I'd probably give up so it's a practical optimism. While researching a topic that has nothing to do

11:22.320 --> 11:28.000
with any of the videos I made I was learning more about millennial compensation and that increasingly

11:28.000 --> 11:33.680
something millennials are finding rewarding in compensation for their employment is some sort of

11:33.680 --> 11:40.000
positive social benefit. Instead of just asking for a higher salary they also enjoy compensation

11:40.000 --> 11:47.200
that includes an employer that will donate money to a worthy cause or institute programs that give

11:47.200 --> 11:53.840
back to the community. I think this is a signifier of the values of the younger generation coming up

11:53.840 --> 11:58.240
and I really hope and believe we can hold on to these values in the future where we're not just

11:58.240 --> 12:03.600
looking to make the most of our own lives in our world but improve the lives of everyone around us.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.960
That's the sort of thing that makes me optimistic. Next question, how much can you lift?

12:09.840 --> 12:18.880
So I only really use dumbbells and for those I'm currently at uh 22 and a half pounds for each

12:18.880 --> 12:26.320
dumbbell which is okay I guess I don't know. I lift weights maybe twice a week. I'm not super

12:26.320 --> 12:33.120
into it to be honest. I find other ways of staying fit. I compliment my weight lifting with a bit of

12:33.200 --> 12:40.960
running some yoga and some calisthenics. Last question and it's a good one. Do the needs of the

12:40.960 --> 12:49.360
many outweigh the needs of the few? Yes, yes they do. They also outweigh the needs of the one.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.640
That's a Star Trek reference for everyone who doesn't know that moment in Star Trek where Spock

12:54.640 --> 13:02.000
sacrifices himself to save everyone and it's pretty sad. I'm more a fan of Star Trek the next

13:02.000 --> 13:07.280
generation but the original series still has its own charm and I kind of love the hokiness of it.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.480
What a way to go out on a Star Trek reference. Thanks to everyone who submitted their questions

13:12.480 --> 13:16.960
and if you realize you suddenly had a question for me and you wanted me to answer it but just

13:16.960 --> 13:21.280
you didn't submit it you can still ask me a question just submit it on curiouscat. If you

13:21.280 --> 13:27.840
love the work I'm doing consider donating to my Patreon. Those who donate five dollars or more

13:27.840 --> 13:34.320
will even see their name in the credits for not the next video but the one after that. I kind of

13:34.320 --> 13:38.240
explained it in the previous video if you want more details but if you're the sort of person

13:38.240 --> 13:43.440
who loves seeing their name in credits this is your chance and if somehow this is the first

13:43.440 --> 13:48.080
video of mine you've ever seen I've got plenty of other videos on this channel you can check out

13:48.080 --> 13:52.320
and they will tell you what I'll tell you now. If you like any of my videos including this one you

13:52.320 --> 13:59.040
can subscribe, like, comment. Also you can follow me on Twitter and thanks for watching.
