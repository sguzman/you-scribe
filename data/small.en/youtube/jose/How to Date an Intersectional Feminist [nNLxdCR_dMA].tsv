0	10220	Oh, dating is hard. Really hard. Especially for leftist soy boys like me, who have never
10220	15740	really touched a woman. But hey, my pal, Roaming Millennial has posted some great advice
15740	21920	for how to date an intersectional feminist. Not really, of course. This is actually just
21920	26900	a video of her talking shit about an intersectional feminist. In this case, it's a woman named
26900	31820	Lyra Witt, who wrote an article about questions an intersectional feminist should ask on a
31820	36820	first date. Before really getting into those questions, Roaming Millennial gives Lyra Witt's
36820	46860	Twitter account a shoutout with this. Wow, that looks bad. Even worse if you decide not
46860	52340	to look at the context. Instead, if you spend about one minute looking into it, you'll
52340	57220	see that this tweet is actually at the end of a tiny little thread commenting on a story about a
57220	62820	mixed race girl growing up in Ireland who was raised by white parents. It's a sad meditation
62820	67460	on the limitations of colorblindness, and how pretending race is irrelevant is something that
67460	72980	does a disservice to real discrimination. The idea is that living in a cloistered white world can
72980	78100	leave someone of mixed racial background unprepared for a world that will judge them on the basis of
78100	84180	their skin color. Now, I can't read Lyra Witt's mind, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say
84180	89740	that her tweet about killing all the white people was a cheeky swipe at the idea of whiteness as a
89740	96060	default identity disregarding the real discrimination people of color face. I managed to decode that
96060	102220	tricky bit of subtext by reading the actual text of what she wrote. And if you really want to ignore
102220	108780	that context, I'd like to point out that Lyra Witt has a white father and a white husband. Maybe
108780	113020	Roaming Millennial should try doing some basic research when bringing up a tweet in the video.
113020	118260	She can start by scrolling up slightly. Let's actually get to the meat of the article and
118260	125500	Roaming Millennials rebuttal. Number one, do you believe that black lives matter? Yes, wonderful.
125500	130260	Let's start here. There are three categories that are non-negotiables for me, an understanding of
130260	134500	race, class, and gender. I don't want to have to have laborious discussions where I have to prove
134500	138500	to someone that white privilege or not black privilege exists. If they are willing to learn
138500	143540	and listen and make the space to decenter their whiteness, if they're white, that's a good place
143540	147980	to start. People aren't debating whether black lives do in fact matter. People are debating whether
147980	152420	systemic racial injustice still exists. Is someone having a different opinion than you on the issue
152420	156540	really that much of a turnout that you need to find out their position right away on the first date
156540	160700	in order to screen them out? Okay, what Roaming Millennial isn't getting here is that her position
161420	168780	and brace herself here is one of privilege. It's easy to be a non-black person and respectfully
168780	173820	disagree with a friendly person who doesn't think that systemic anti-black racial discrimination
173820	178860	exists because you literally don't have any skin in the game. If you're an asshole, you might not
178860	184220	even care, I guess. But if you're someone who cares about injustice, systemic discrimination
184220	188700	might bother you. And this may be another shocker, but there are some people out there,
189340	194860	let's just call them intersectional feminists, who are passionate about fighting injustice.
195500	201580	And if that passionate person is black and someone who therefore faces that systemic discrimination,
201580	205580	they might not want to date someone who thinks they're delusional. Basically,
205580	210460	this first point is a simple test of empathy and Roaming Millennial failed.
211180	216540	Number two, what are your thoughts on gender and sexual orientation? The gender binary is a tiny
216540	221740	box and I wish it didn't exist, but it does. I can't imagine being with someone who is transphobic.
221740	226300	As a feminist and woman of color, it would be a betrayal of what I stand for. Okay, this is
226300	231740	something I see all the time and it bothers me. Believing in a gender binary is not the same thing
231740	239420	as being transphobic. It kind of is transphobic. Not only does Roaming Millennial betray her
239420	244540	ignorance on the subject, but she also denies the lived experience of people who fall outside the
244540	250380	gender binary. Telling someone they're just confused in the face of evidence to the contrary
250380	255980	is a pretty shitty thing to do. Oh, and since I know Roaming Millennial is such a lover of
255980	260380	science and learning, I've included a link to my favorite science YouTuber, Concordance,
260380	267420	and his video on binary gender. Maybe take 10 minutes out of your life and learn how to
268300	273180	uh not be a dick, basically. There's no way straight to say that one, never mind.
273900	278860	Number three, how do you work to dismantle sexism and misogyny in your life? I've met cishet men
278860	283740	who hate women. They say they love women, but that love is conditional on not having their
283740	288780	toxic masculinity questioned or threatened in any way. And they love us as a monolith. They love
288780	293340	what women have to offer, whether it is sex, food, love care, emotional labor. They love us for what
293340	298140	we can do for them, not because of who we are for ourselves. Wow, don't you hate it when men
298140	302700	make their love for women conditional based on a woman's worldview? Gee, isn't it awful when men
302700	308540	are only interested in women based on superficial aspects? Self-awareness, zero. I think she's saying
309180	315660	a worldview is superficial. I'm actually not sure what she's trying to say because it's hidden
315660	320940	under the weight of this terrible joke. She thinks she's caught the author in a bout of hypocrisy.
321820	327420	This is the point she's responding to. Witt is saying that an intersectional feminist
327420	331500	probably wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to toxic masculinity.
332620	338060	In fact, I'd wager a guest that most women wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to
338060	343420	toxic masculinity. This seems obvious and sensible to me, and you would think Roman
343420	347900	Millennial would have understood it, having read it out loud just a few moments before her
347900	354940	commentary, but no. She thinks having an ideology and criticizing someone else for having a different
354940	362220	one is somehow hypocritical. It actually isn't when the two ideologies are polar opposites.
362220	369980	You could even say they're conflicting. Also, an ideology is not superficial. It's actually the
369980	378860	exact opposite. Jesus Christ. Let's move on. I grew up with Jewish, Israeli, and non-Israeli
378860	383180	friends and Palestinian friends. Before even understanding how power and oppression work
383180	387740	together, we understood the trivial hatred that colonized and put in constant danger the lives of
387740	393020	Palestinians every single day. Being pro-Palestine is not the same thing as being anti-Semitic. I
393020	397660	shouldn't even have to express that, but being pro-Palestine and BDS is a necessary part of
397740	402060	intersectionality. You know, I get why people like this aren't big fans of Israeli, got the whole
402060	406460	colonialism, settler, military power thing going on, but I don't understand why they would choose
406460	411260	to identify themselves as being specifically pro-Palestine. Try going to Palestine and talking
411260	419820	about all this LGBTQ non-binary gender stuff. Okay, so what do the LGBT policies of Israel or
419820	424700	Palestine have to do with what Whit is talking about? Does Roman Millennial think we should ignore
424700	429500	people being oppressed by a colonial power because they aren't down with the LGBT community?
430300	437020	Is this her trying to use SJW logic against itself? She doesn't really understand how SJW
437020	442380	or regular logic seem to work in this case. And this is basically just what about-ism run amok,
442380	447340	and it won't be the last time we see this. Number six, what is your understanding of settler
447340	452140	colonialism and indigenous rights? I didn't grow up in the United States. I was raised in Switzerland,
452140	455980	so my understanding of how Europeans committed genocide against indigenous populations here in
455980	460460	the U.S. was fairly limited. It required a good deal of my own research to really understand how
460460	465100	settler colonialism works and how devastating the eraser and violence against Native Americans is
465100	470780	and was. Your date thinks Native Americans are tropes or relics of the past? No thanks. No one
470780	478300	thinks that. Just nobody. Okay, okay, this shit. She just kind of says that no one believes in it.
478300	482460	Right after reading a section where the author admits that she was someone who believed in it
482460	488700	until she was educated on the subject. Are you taking in anything you're actually reading here?
488700	492860	If they support the school-to-prison pipeline, then there's a good chance they'll only value you
492860	497180	for your ability to nurture them without any reciprocation. I feel like what she's actually
497180	503740	saying here is that people who support capitalism can't love their partners. Love is just for
503740	512300	communists. And what the fuck? Love is just for communists? How did you get that from the idea of
512300	521500	someone supporting school-to-prison pipelines not being very nurturing? Wow. Er, wait, wait.
522220	528380	Did Roman Millennial just say capitalists support the school-to-prison pipeline?
529260	533020	She just gave the game away. Hit it, boys.
544700	550380	Number eight. Can any human be illegal? We live on a tiny planet with land and water within a
550380	555900	galaxy surrounded by a universe with an inconceivable number of other galaxies and planets. Yet here we
555900	560620	dictate where we are and who is allowed to be where we are. Don't even know what she was trying
560620	564460	to say with that. It seems like there were contradictory statements in those two sentences.
565180	570060	The problem with this line is that it's slightly incongruent and probably could have been worded
570060	574380	more effectively had it focused on the vastness of the earth rather than the vastness of the
574380	579580	universe, which we can't really access. That's just me wearing my editor hat, of course. Roman
579580	583580	Millennial doesn't make any sort of commentary on that. What she's saying here is that she doesn't
583580	590860	understand that the contradiction here is the point. You know, there's lots of space, yet we're
590860	600620	saying where people can and can't be. Do you get it now? No? Okay. But whatever. It's just really
600620	605660	weird to me how she can claim that white Americans stole this land, yet that at the same time no one
605660	610620	should be allowed to dictate where other people are. You can't be mad at whites being in the U.S.
610620	617020	while also saying that all people should be able to come to the U.S. Do you not see the difference
617020	624620	between letting people freely travel and migrate around the world and how that's different from
624620	632300	colonizing a land and genociding the population? How do you not understand this?
632940	637660	Number nine. Do you support Muslim Americans and non-Muslim people from Islamic countries?
637660	642620	I can't think of any other religion which has been vilified and lied about more than Islam in
642620	647660	a cultural and systemic way. I am not Muslim, so I will stay in my lane, but I cannot imagine for
647660	652140	a second even claiming to be a feminist if I didn't stand in solidarity with my Muslim friends
652140	658540	and family. Guys, we need to make this plane ticket happen. I'm not even meaning right now.
658540	664220	Let's send her to Saudi Arabia, home of the two most holy sites in Islam. Let's do it, guys.
664220	670380	So, Roaming Millennial says she's not meme-ing, but I assume she is because she's a liar,
670380	675500	or at least disingenuous, or maybe she doesn't know what meme-ing is. She doesn't understand
675500	679900	most of what she's talking about. So, yeah, maybe that's it. Anyway, Saudi Arabia is oppressive.
680780	685740	What does that have to do with oppressing Muslim people in the U.S.? Does Roaming Millennial not
685740	691580	think this is happening? Or does she think it's less important than people being oppressed in
691580	699500	other countries? What about Islam strikes again? Also, read the title of point nine again.
699500	704620	Whit explicitly writes non-Muslim people in Islamic countries needing support too,
705180	712780	so she was speaking out against oppression in Saudi Arabia. I don't know. I'm not surprised
712780	717980	you missed it. You missed most of this article. We're not really learning anything responding
718060	723980	to her, so here's a fun fact. The term whataboutism was coined as a response to Soviets who refused
723980	729980	to talk about their country's misdeeds to focus on American ones. And if Roaming Millennial is using
729980	733900	Soviet tactics, we did it again, boys. We won.
733900	749020	Also, I'm not a tanky. Buddhist Stalinism, etc.
749660	754620	Number 10. Does your allyship include disabled folks? Be mindful of others who mock disabled
754620	759820	people. That kind of cruelty is inexcusable. On a date with someone who uses ableist slurs,
759820	763500	walk away. I don't think you should be cruel to disabled people. Don't think you should
763500	788940	be cruel to anybody, really. But I have the feeling that this person would probably qualify
788940	793580	using the word retarded to describe something that was not literally retarded as ableist,
793580	799900	which I don't agree with. Why can't she just agree with wit and move on? Does she really need to
799900	806620	make something up just to talk shit? Also, for the record, using that word to describe someone
806620	812540	or something is a shitty thing to do. There's nothing really here to engage with. She's just
812540	818380	like, it's okay to say it, and doesn't explain herself. You know, I'm actually starting to think
818380	822780	that this list existing is a good thing and that all intersexual feminists should follow it
822780	826780	so that people can know who you are and get out of there as quickly as possible.
827340	832300	That's a great line for a closer. This list was designed to screen up people exactly like
832300	839580	Roman Millennial. Very ironic. Personally, if I was on my first date ever and they brought up
839580	843500	how shitty this Roman Millennial video was, I'd be crushing on her pretty hard.
843500	851180	I'm feeling kind of down now. I mean, if I listen to Roman Millennial,
851180	856780	intersexual feminists may be too nutty to date. Or at least the ones who follow that list, right?
856780	860780	But you know what does Roman Millennial even know? She can't even read a damn article.
860780	865180	So I'll wrap this up and I guess I'm gonna be alone forever. Bye!
