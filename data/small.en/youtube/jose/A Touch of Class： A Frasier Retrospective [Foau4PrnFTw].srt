1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Spin-offs almost never work.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,040
They usually miss the magic of their predecessor, run for half a season, and are quickly forgotten,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,760
resigned to the dustbin of TV history.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Frasier was not just an exception, it was one of those rare sitcoms that went from spin-off

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,040
to its own full-fledged hit.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,520
A classic of the 90s, Frasier ran for 11 seasons and was a critical darling, with 37 Emmy wins,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,320
which as of 2022 was the third highest ever for a series and the highest for any sitcom.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,040
Frasier was in some ways an unlikely success story.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,200
As big a hit as Cheers was, being a Cheers spin-off wasn't a surefire recipe for success.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,160
The first spin-off attempt, The Tortelles, lasted a mere 13 episodes before it was cancelled.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,280
When Cheers went off the air, a poll conducted by Pew found that, of all the Cheers characters

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,200
who might get a spin-off, only 2% of fans wanted to see one starring Frasier.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,280
Not the best of omens, but Frasier quickly went over any doubters by being a hit from

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
its very first episode.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,960
Of course, the story behind how that show came to be started before that first title

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
card.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,160
It's hard to explain Frasier without explaining all of Cheers, and luckily I've already done

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
that.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,360
If you'd like to hear a detailed breakdown of that show, please check out my video on

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Cheers.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,040
For everyone else, here's a quick refresher.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
Frasier Crane was introduced in season 3 of the series as a foil in the Sam-Diane will-they-won't-they

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
relationship.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Although the character was intended to make a quick exit, appearing as a temporary boyfriend

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,320
for Diane, Kelsey Grammer made such a strong impression on the show's producers that

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,420
they kept him around for the next eight seasons.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,520
In that time, he was left at the altar by Diane, met and married, Lilith Sternan, had

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
a child named Frederick, revealed that he had been married once before in his younger

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,800
days, and eventually divorced Lilith, only to seemingly reconcile in the final season

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
of the show.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,520
At the end of Cheers, Frasier was set to spend the rest of his days sitting in that bar in

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,200
Boston, listening to Cliff tell tall tales, watching Norm drink countless beers, and

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,240
inhaling dangerous levels of Sam Malone's many layers of cologne.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,280
But a Frasier spin-off took the character in a new direction.

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Let's briefly talk about Wings.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,280
The series was created by David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, all former writers on

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Cheers.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,520
It was through their production company, Grub Street Productions, that they approached Kelsey

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,700
Grammer about working on a new series.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,960
They had a good relationship from their time on Cheers together, so much so that Frasier

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:26,480
even made a guest appearance on an episode of Wings.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Originally this new project wasn't going to be a Cheers-related spin-off at all, but

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,880
rather an original series starring Kelsey Grammer.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,360
The idea they came up with was that of a wealthy mogul who was in a motorcycle accident and

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,400
then confined to his bedroom, running his entire empire from his bed.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,080
The idea was rejected by NBC and Paramount, and it was firmly suggested that the new show

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:57,760
would be about Frasier Crane.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,720
If Frasier was going to return, Kelsey Grammer insisted on the rest of the show being something

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,640
entirely new, so the character was packed up, moved to Seattle, and would start a new

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,000
life as a radio psychiatrist.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Frasier Crane would be played, of course, by Kelsey Grammer, the erudite, sophisticated

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,280
band returning to his hometown.

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,920
Although he had known Frasier for nine years on Cheers, in Seattle he would be far more

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,560
inclined to let his more cultured side show, with less time spent on bar stools and more

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
time spent in opera boxes.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,320
He would also spend less time being married and more time trying to figure out how to

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:42,680
be a single man in his forties.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,280
David Hyde Pierce was cast as Niles Crane, Frasier's younger brother.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,720
Although the initial idea for the show never included a brother character, he was added

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,200
after assistant casting director Sheila Guthrie pointed out how much Pierce resembled a young

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,580
Kelsey Grammer, particularly in his first appearance on Cheers.

62
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,600
After the character was created, the role went directly to Pierce, who created exactly

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:22,000
what you would expect of Frasier's brother, prim, eccentric, and dripping with snobbery.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Martin Crane was played by John Mahoney.

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,840
The gruff former cop who finds himself suddenly living with Frasier after he becomes unable

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,960
to handle life on his own due to a gunshot wound he received a few years prior.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,680
Martin was inspired by the real-life experience of series co-creator David Lee, who had been

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:51,360
helping take care of his in-form father at the time.

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Mahoney was the first choice for the character, and much like Pierce, was offered the role

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,600
directly.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,280
Jane Leves played Daphne Moon, Martin's physical therapist and live-in housekeeper

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,640
for Frasier and Martin.

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,420
Although initially there was some discussion on making her Latina, the producers eventually

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,800
made Daphne English, and Jane Leves, like Pierce and Mahoney before her, was pre-approved

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
for the role.

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Daphne provides a quirkier side of Frasier's home life, occasionally dropping in strange

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:36,520
stories from her days back in Manchester, and having the odd psychic vision.

78
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,320
Roz Doyle, played by Perry Gilpin, is the hard-edged foil to the more genteel character

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
of Frasier.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,840
She brings her frank way of speaking to bear in most scenes at the KACL radio station,

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,240
along with a very prolific dating life.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,680
The only character whose actor wasn't pre-approved, at first Lisa Kudrow, was cast to be Roz.

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,920
Gilpin was brought in when things didn't work out with her, although Kudrow would find

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:12,600
her own success a year later when she was cast as Phoebe in the show Friends.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,860
The final member of the cast was a lovable Jack Russell Terrier named Moose, who played

86
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,840
the role of Eddie, Martin's pet dog.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
Moose played Eddie for the first six seasons, but in later seasons, with Moose getting

88
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:39,440
older, his son Enzo took up the family business and also played Eddie.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
Although the principal cast was relatively small, Frasier made the most of them with

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,680
numerous episodes exploring the antics of the Korean men and the women who tolerated

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
them.

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,240
There were current characters who joined them, including Dan Butler as Bob Bulldog

93
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Briscoe, Edward Hibbert as Gil Chesterton, and Tom McGowan as Kenny Daly.

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,580
Even though Frasier was a spin-off, there was such a strong desire for it to be its

95
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,420
own show that very few cameos came from Cheers regulars, with one exception, Bebe Neworth,

96
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,160
who would reprise her role as Lilith, in every season of Frasier.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,860
Although the show had no theme song, its ending theme, tossed salad and scrambled eggs, sung

98
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,320
by grammar at his insistence, is one of TV's most memorable closers.

99
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,420
According to the series' composer, Bruce Miller, the lyrics weren't allowed to make

100
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,140
any reference to the subject matter of the show, including its title, and there has been

101
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,720
some speculation as to what the song even means.

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,200
Although the lyrics seem nonsensical, they actually do tell a story.

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,120
Hey baby, I hear the blues a-callin', tossed salad and scrambled eggs, refers to Frasier's

104
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,920
callers on his radio show.

105
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
The next part?

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,560
But maybe I seem a bit confused, maybe, but I got you pegged, refers to Frasier struggling

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
to understand his own life, but still being able to help.

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,320
But I don't know what to do with these tossed salad and scrambled eggs, the callin' again,

109
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:59,560
is a reference to an endless stream of people calling for help.

110
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,900
On September 16th, 1993, Frasier debuted and much of America was watching.

111
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,080
The premiere of Frasier was titled The Good Son, and was written by the show's creators,

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,320
David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, and directed by long-standing Cheers director

113
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
James Burroughs.

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,840
It very quickly filled in the blanks as to what happened with Frasier following the end

115
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
of Cheers.

116
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,000
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,640
My wife had left me, which was very painful, then she came back to me, which was excruciating.

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,080
Reflecting on this moment, writer David Isaacs said,

119
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,680
That got a big laugh.

120
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Bigger than it should have.

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,760
I thought to myself, we're going to be okay.

122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Part of the premise is given to us right away, with Frasier hosting a radio show in Seattle,

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,440
and we are introduced to his brother Niles in a creative way.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,000
Frasier made use of title cards to introduce scenes, so instead of having an awkward bit

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of dialogue where the relationship between Frasier and Niles is acknowledged explicitly,

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
the title card simply reads,

127
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
The Brother.

128
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,220
These title cards became an iconic part of the Frasier style, often framing your expectations

129
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,400
for a scene with some important information, or providing a joke to add a bit more levity

130
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
into the scene.

131
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,720
In the cafe, Niles helpfully introduces the idea that Martin should move in with Frasier.

132
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,080
All right, I'll make up the spare bedroom.

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Oh, you're a good son, Frasier.

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Oh god, I am, aren't I?

135
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Two cafe supremos?

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Anything to eat?

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,680
No, I seem to have lost my appetite.

138
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,200
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Martin is not thrilled with the arrangement.

140
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
We all know I am here.

141
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Your old man can't be left alone for ten minutes without falling on his ass and Frasier got

142
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
stuck with me.

143
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Isn't that right?

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
No, no!

145
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
No!

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
No!

147
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I want you here.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
They'll give us a chance to get reacquainted.

149
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,800
That implies we were acquainted at one point.

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Martin brings one piece of furniture with him to complete Frasier's carefully decorated

151
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,920
apartment, his iconic chair.

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,320
After a suggestion from Niles, Frasier decides to hire some help, and we then meet Daphne.

153
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
You were a policeman, weren't you?

154
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah, how'd you know?

155
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I must confess, I'm a bit psychic.

156
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,440
Martin instantly wants to hire her, partially, by suspect, to annoy Frasier.

157
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,600
The main conflict of this episode is between Frasier and Martin struggling to find a way

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
to live together.

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,240
Ever since you moved in here, it's been a snide comment about this, or a smart little

160
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
put-down about that.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,720
Well, I've done my best to make a home here for you, and once, just once would have killed

162
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
you to say thank you!

163
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
One lousy thank you!

164
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,200
After the fight, Martin makes a gesture to Frasier the best way he can.

165
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,120
Yeah, I'm worried my son doesn't know that I really appreciate what he's done for me.

166
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Why don't you tell him?

167
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,200
You know how it is with fathers and sons, you have trouble saying that stuff.

168
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel.

169
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Is that all?

170
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Yeah, I guess that's it.

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

172
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
My pleasure, Martin.

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, what I said, I said thank you!

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes, I heard.

175
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
What makes this a great pilot is that it not only establishes the premise and interests

176
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
of the characters, but also sets up one of the primary plotlines for the first few seasons,

177
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Frasier and Martin reconnecting after Frasier had spent 15 years away in Boston.

178
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200
One thing abundantly clear is that this show will be set in the world of the upper class.

179
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Frasier is obviously well off, and so is Niles, and while Martin and Daphne certainly aren't,

180
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,400
both of them will be living under Frasier's roof, reacting to the context he's created

181
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,600
for them, and Roz, while more akin to Daphne and Martin in class status, typically appears

182
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,480
in scenes at the radio station, the cafe, or Frasier's apartment in a supporting role.

183
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,800
When you look at the class backgrounds of the characters, this split between them matters

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,400
far less than the context they find themselves in.

185
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Ultimately, this show is about Frasier's world.

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Niles might be the best fit into it, but to an extent, all the other characters are trying

187
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,240
to fit into Frasier's world as well.

188
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,960
And this is all very ironic considering this whole episode is about Frasier fighting himself

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,160
in a new context.

190
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,240
It speaks to the power of perspective and how when a show focuses on one character,

191
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,160
it can very easily shape the world around them, and how they define this space.

192
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Living in an apartment that is almost timelessly classic in its design, working the cushy job

193
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,480
of radio psychiatrists and going to chic restaurants and art events, Frasier Crane is a man of

194
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,040
means and class.

195
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,440
He's also incredibly vain, arrogant, and sometimes a complete goof.

196
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,600
But none of these qualities make him particularly likeable.

197
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,960
The key to Frasier's appeal is that he very deeply cares about people.

198
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Frasier's job as a radiotherapist makes him something of a local celebrity in Seattle,

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,240
more so than you'd expect from someone on the radio.

200
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,400
And Frasier is more than happy to revel in that fame and fortune.

201
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,120
Then I will just tell them that they can take their five-figure deal and find someone else.

202
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Five figures.

203
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,680
Didn't I mention pressures?

204
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,280
This is for television, the big kahuna.

205
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Television.

206
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,760
The research has shown that a single television commercial can turn an obscure radio personality

207
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,600
into a national celebrity.

208
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,800
A year from now, someone like you could be broadcasting your message of hope and healing

209
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,840
not just to the Pacific Northwest, but to the entire nation.

210
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,560
That celebrity affords Frasier access to Seattle's more elite circles, often hobbing with the

211
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
most impressive of knobs.

212
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,720
What makes Frasier fun to watch is when that class status makes him the subject of mockery.

213
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,120
For example, when Bulldog tricks them into singing some Gilbert and Sullivan.

214
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,120
I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to Three Little Maids?

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Well, let me see.

216
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Three little maids from school are we?

217
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Where does the school go where they may be?

218
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Filled with the brim with girlish glee.

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,120
And the maids from school.

220
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,360
It's the classic comedy trope of laughing at someone in a higher class be humiliated.

221
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,960
And while it's easy to laugh at Frasier's class making him look silly, it does make

222
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,080
it tougher to empathize with him when it also isolates him from suffering.

223
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,880
In The Crucible, Frasier is the victim of fraud when a painting he's purchased is

224
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
revealed to be a forgery.

225
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I didn't paint it.

226
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Of course you didn't, you created it, you gave birth to it.

227
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I didn't do anything to it.

228
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I never saw this painting before in my whole life.

229
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,840
And you thought I was going to embarrass you?

230
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,760
The cops are unable to help Frasier, and a legal proceeding against the gallery he bought

231
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,080
the painting from would cost more than the painting is worth, leaving him with nothing

232
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,720
to do but hurl a brick through the gallery's window.

233
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
If you act like a barbarian, you will become a barbarian.

234
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Give him the brick, Frasier.

235
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
And let him get away with this!

236
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I know, I know.

237
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
What the gallery owner did to you was wrong.

238
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
It was humiliating.

239
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
But if you throw that brick through that window, you will have lost something more valuable

240
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
than your money.

241
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
You will have lost your mind.

242
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,080
Frasier, you can't do this!

243
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Injustice for Frasier is a blow to his ego, but not the material conditions of his life.

244
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,360
Niles' advice is good only insofar that Frasier can afford to take a little humiliation.

245
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,280
What if this was someone who has swindled out of their savings, or even their weekly

246
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
paycheck?

247
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,720
The reason here is that the privileged can afford for the system to fail them.

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,100
At the end of the show's fifth season, Frasier's stand against KACL's station manager gets

249
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,360
him and all of his colleagues fired.

250
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,840
And we see Frasier in Season 6 out of work for the first nine episodes.

251
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Frasier?

252
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,840
You're not famous anymore.

253
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,960
Kelsey Grammer spoke about these episodes with Frasier being out of work.

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
We thought it was a good storyline.

255
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,820
We got nine stories out of it.

256
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,200
We thought it was an interesting journey for him to take.

257
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,920
We always knew he was going to go back to the station, but I think it might have made

258
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,640
the audience uncomfortable because Frasier wasn't as attractive.

259
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,800
There was something more sad about him.

260
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,460
Frasier's suffering is a huge part of what makes the show work, but that's often seen

261
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,040
through his many failures in dating or struggling to hold a dinner party, being out of work

262
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
hit differently.

263
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
It's easy enough to empathize with a Frasier struggling to find someone.

264
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Dating is universal.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,760
And when his fancy dinner parties go awry, it's usually just his own vanity biting him

266
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
in the butt.

267
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,000
This pain wasn't as easy to laugh at.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,880
It was understandable without being relatable, because even out of work, Frasier wasn't hurting

269
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
for money.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,040
He was upset that he wasn't famous anymore.

271
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,960
It's possible to pity Frasier, but it's a lot harder to empathize.

272
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,480
And empathy is at the heart of what makes Frasier a great character.

273
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,200
We can see Frasier's personal empathy in his chosen profession as a psychiatrist.

274
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,100
Frasier's background in psychiatry means he's a medical doctor who has chosen to specialize

275
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,260
in mental health.

276
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,540
Although being a character created in 1984, he represents a very old-fashioned depiction

277
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,940
of a psychiatrist, one who fits the classic mold of having a patient sit on a couch while

278
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,700
they talk through their problems, as their psychiatrist takes notes and offers a few

279
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
insights.

280
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,620
Something you're more likely to see a psychologist do today rather than a psychiatrist.

281
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,140
Frasier practices his psychiatry through his radio show.

282
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Hello, Mark.

283
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
I'm listening.

284
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Okay.

285
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,700
Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, um, I've been watching myself on the

286
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,500
video camera, and the camera me is doing things I don't approve of.

287
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,940
These calls are often voiced by some pretty popular actors, including Mel Brooks, Ben

288
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,980
Steller, Elijah Wood, Mary Tyler Moore, and Kevin Bacon.

289
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,100
Frasier is a Freudian, which dates them even further back to the practice of psychoanalysis.

290
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,700
And psychoanalysis, as is sometimes mentioned on the show, doesn't have the best track

291
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
record.

292
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,780
In the episode, Chess Pains, after losing several games of chess against his father,

293
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,260
Frasier is obsessed with winning.

294
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,020
I am analyzing my options, unlike your winged abroach, I like to plan a strategy, like a

295
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:54,260
general leading his troops into battle.

296
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,420
Jack made Schwarzkopf.

297
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,260
Frasier, who fancies himself an intellectual force, can accept that his less-educated father,

298
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,020
who had never played chess before, is better than him.

299
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,820
So Frasier and Niles analyze why this is happening.

300
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,860
Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father, it's the natural order.

301
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,580
Yet, it's frequently a stumbling block, because the son's competitive stirrings

302
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,580
are accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.

303
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I see.

304
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,460
Yes, it's the classic edible conflict.

305
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
My God.

306
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,740
And it seems so obvious now, I've been letting him win.

307
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,700
Later, Martin cuts the heart of what's really happening.

308
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,180
This isn't about losing, is it?

309
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,460
This is about losing to me.

310
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
That's what's driving you nuts.

311
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,660
How could I lose to the old man?

312
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,020
I'm much smarter than he is.

313
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
I never said that.

314
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,500
No, you didn't have to say you've thought it all your life.

315
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
No, I haven't.

316
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
No, you're insulting my intelligence again.

317
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,420
The answer is painfully obvious.

318
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,660
Martin is just better at chess than Frasier.

319
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,220
In fact, there's an episode of Cheers where Frasier loses a game of chess to the slow-witted

320
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,980
Woody, raising serious questions about Frasier's chess skills.

321
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,260
Rather than accept that, maybe he needs to improve his chess game, Frasier and Niles

322
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,460
concoct this Freudian explanation as to why Frasier keeps losing.

323
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,980
It isn't a genuine attempt to understand the situation, but rather to protect Frasier's

324
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,940
ego on the presumption that an educated man like him must be better at chess than Martin.

325
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,380
Even when Frasier finally wins, he has to make a subtle nod to his little pet theory

326
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,940
about this being some kind of Oedipal struggle.

327
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,940
I'm sorry I beat your dad.

328
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,820
This once again highlights how Frasier is at its funniest when it's highlighting the

329
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,940
excesses of the character.

330
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,740
The series often includes skepticism towards psychiatry and psychology more broadly, or

331
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,980
at least the type practiced by Frasier and Niles.

332
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,180
I'm not like a psychiatrist who works with someone for years and years and it doesn't

333
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,580
matter if they ever get better.

334
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,300
A bust of Freud.

335
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Oh, well, that's really quite thoughtful of you.

336
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:56,340
I figured you'd appreciate the irony, since he's been proven wrong about practically everything.

337
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,060
I like to think that Freud's theories will stand the test of time.

338
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
Really?

339
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
Have you read either of his books?

340
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,820
Oh, what a relief.

341
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,540
I've been wringing my hands over nothing.

342
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
I mean, it's okay.

343
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,180
All I want to do is have sex with my dead mother.

344
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,540
That last clip is Frasier sighing in relief because he's figured out the meaning of

345
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,260
a particularly difficult dream he's been having where he finds himself in bed with

346
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,540
his colleague, Gil.

347
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,260
Well, look who's up.

348
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,020
Although dreams being secret desires people have isn't backed by much scientific evidence,

349
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,180
if you're someone who buys into dream analysis, the obvious reading here is that Frasier is

350
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:44,900
secretly gay, an interpretation he resists.

351
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,740
So he and Niles dive deep into their knowledge of dream analysis to pull together all sorts

352
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,340
of conclusions that will, supposedly, resolve the tension in Frasier's mind, letting him

353
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:02,020
avoid these dreams.

354
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,120
Once again, this analysis is very forced.

355
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,760
The tools of Freudian psychoanalysis are less a tool for greater understanding and

356
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,280
used instead to reassure Frasier's ego.

357
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,540
In the decades since his ideas were introduced, much of the work of Sigmund Freud has largely

358
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
been supplanted.

359
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,020
The best explanation I've heard as to why he should still be taught in an academic setting

360
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,760
is that his insights were incredibly important, even though his conclusions were ridiculous.

361
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,880
For example, his insight that human development is a product of not nature or nurture, but

362
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,580
rather nature interacting with nurture, was groundbreaking.

363
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,860
But his conclusion, that development was the guiding of sexual desire through distinct

364
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,300
stages from infancy to adolescence, leading to some kind of oral fixation, is completely

365
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,340
without empirical support.

366
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,100
While it might seem like I'm being a bit unfair to an older show, none of what I'm

367
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
saying is particularly new.

368
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,980
Freud's theories have been criticized for decades, and much of this was known in the

369
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
90s.

370
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,540
Frasier represents the classic idea of a psychiatrist in the world of pop culture, not reality.

371
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,160
The type of psychoanalysis done by Frasier is sometimes not much better than what Daphne

372
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:18,000
can figure out on her own.

373
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,520
By the end of this episode, Frasier realizes he's feeling frustrated at work because

374
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,440
he finds a lack of challenge in the colors he's getting, and according to him and Niles,

375
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,080
that should resolve the dream.

376
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,000
Except the episode ends like this.

377
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:52,520
And just to be clear, I'm not saying therapy is a bad thing.

378
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,680
In fact, working with a psychiatrist or psychologist can be incredibly helpful in improving one's

379
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
mental health.

380
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,960
What I am saying is that Frasier and Niles often let their biases impact their psychiatry,

381
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,800
particularly when they try to understand themselves, and that some of the theories and ideas that

382
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,120
they use are very out of date, even for the 90s.

383
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
There is another problem with the type of psychiatry practiced by Frasier and Niles

384
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
too.

385
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Generally speaking, it is very expensive.

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,800
While Frasier doesn't charge his colors anything, his background and expertise come

387
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
from a field of medicine that is very lucrative.

388
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,520
Psychoanalytic therapy can involve multiple sessions a week, sometimes lasting for years,

389
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,440
and at a cost of one to two hundred dollars a session in today's money, this type of therapy

390
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,320
can be very costly.

391
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,820
Another way in which this series demonstrates the barriers class places between acts of

392
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,160
compassion.

393
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,200
Although Frasier has chosen a field that puts his help out of the reach of all but the most

394
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,600
privileged, one overarching aspect of his character, and one that makes him particularly likable,

395
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,820
is that he genuinely wants to help other people.

396
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,040
This can be seen in him choosing to host a show where people can call in with their problems

397
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,900
for free, as limited to help as that may be.

398
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,100
One specific example of Frasier's compassion overcoming his vanity is in the episode Death

399
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Becomes Him.

400
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,420
When Martin's physician suddenly passes away, a man who was similar in physique, behavior

401
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:13,020
and temperament to Frasier, it leads him to question his own mortality.

402
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,540
Frasier becomes obsessed, planning his own funeral and trying to find a way in which

403
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,340
this doctor neglected his health.

404
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,660
He even crashes the man's shiva to learn more about him.

405
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:41,860
He only steps out of his vanity when the opportunity to help someone arises.

406
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,740
Frasier's insight comes from his own experiences, and he uses these moments of compassion for

407
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,340
others as opportunities to grow himself.

408
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,420
Which isn't the safest way to practice psychiatry, but on a more human, emotional level, it offers

409
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,780
the chance for two people to help one another.

410
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,780
In the episode Dark Victory, a disastrous birthday party for Martin leaves everyone

411
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:11,660
bickering.

412
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,900
With a blackout keeping them all indoors, Frasier makes the rounds with everyone in

413
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:39,140
his little extended family offer an advice to calm their various tensions.

414
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,180
It just makes me feel like I'm not very ambitious.

415
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,220
I mean, I could be working in a hospital or a clinic.

416
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,380
Of course you could, Daphne, but maybe that's not what's important to you right now.

417
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,340
I think you'd like being part of a family.

418
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,780
If you can't walk around Paris, you could sit at a nice cafe and let Paris walk past

419
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
you.

420
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,940
Maybe buy a glass of wine for a beautiful mademoiselle.

421
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,020
Get yourself a nice bottle of imported beer.

422
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,380
I only like Valentines.

423
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,900
In Paris, Valentines is imported beer.

424
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,740
Could it be that you're really upset just because you couldn't help that woman?

425
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,580
You know I really hate that.

426
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,540
When you take a simple criticism and you turn it back on me, well, I think I'm right.

427
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,180
Well, of course you're right while you think I hate it.

428
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,540
And at the end of it all, Frasier is left emotionally spent.

429
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,860
I tend to each one of you, and you all feel better, and the minute you get a whiff of mesquite

430
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:42,380
coming from down below, you are out the door, without so much as a thank you.

431
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,860
Well, thank you for the invitation, but I am frankly fed up with people and their problems.

432
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,300
The doctor is out.

433
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Oh, great.

434
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
You didn't feel that way.

435
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I am.

436
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Okay, apologies, except-

437
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Oh, great.

438
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
You'll come.

439
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,940
Frasier is a helper, from the colors on his show to his own family, and more than that,

440
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,620
he's willing to sacrifice his own downtime to help others.

441
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,780
Albeit while venting his frustrations at the situation, which is totally fair when

442
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,100
you consider his job is to help people, and having to do the same for the people in his

443
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,760
personal life might feel incredibly taxing.

444
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,340
But that gets to the heart of why he's a likable character.

445
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,660
He's willing to put others before himself.

446
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,460
One particularly clever part of this episode is that it takes place during a blackout,

447
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,500
which makes the fancy trappings around them disappear, leaving the characters with only

448
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
the props of their own baggage.

449
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,020
With all that gone, Frasier can navigate through the void, using only his compassion to connect

450
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,300
with his loved ones.

451
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,740
And it works very well.

452
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,100
Problems are solved, rifts are mended, and everyone is brought a few steps closer to

453
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
each other.

454
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,660
In the episode, The Thousandth Show, Seattle hosts a Frasier Crane Day episode, speaking

455
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,340
directly to Frasier's vanity.

456
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:54,260
For your sake and the stations to submit to a small, tasteful, low-key public rally.

457
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,860
A series of mishaps keep Frasier from the rally, and he's left to dwell on his own

458
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
sense of self.

459
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,140
I wanted my day.

460
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:08,300
I wanted hoopla and fuss, practically playing the whole thing myself.

461
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,900
When Frasier eventually gets to the rally via a limo ride, or rather, almost there,

462
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,140
he postpones attending because he's met someone who needs help.

463
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:25,340
Don't worry about me, I've got plenty of time, tell me more about your kids, alright?

464
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,100
I'm John, by the way, I'm Frasier.

465
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,900
The crumpled sign reflects how hollow the fame and fortune are compared to the act of

466
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,900
compassion.

467
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,380
Much like the blackout hiding Frasier's wealth, this obscuring of Frasier's fame

468
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,220
reveal that the true value of his character comes from how he helps people.

469
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,620
Frasier's wealth and radio show, fueled by his occasionally dubious psychiatry, create

470
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,540
a distance between him and the people he wants to help.

471
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,900
In the episode, Frasier's Edge, this becomes particularly evident.

472
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,340
After being told he'll be winning a Lifetime Achievement Award, Frasier has a crisis of

473
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:13,460
confidence and goes to see his old mentor, Dr. William Tewksbury, played by René Obejongwa.

474
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,860
Dr. Tewksbury reveals to Frasier that he has a tendency to keep people at a distance.

475
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
How's your practice?

476
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,340
I don't have a practice, I have a radio show.

477
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,580
Distance?

478
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Any children?

479
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,780
Yes, I have a wonderful son with whom I'm very close.

480
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
You live with him?

481
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,900
He lives in Boston.

482
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Distance?

483
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
With your wife?

484
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
My ex-wife.

485
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Yes, I know.

486
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Distance.

487
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Wasn't she a psychiatrist?

488
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Yes, she was.

489
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
She happened to be a damn good one, too.

490
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,020
Well, that's a handy choice for someone who'd rather share ideas than emotions.

491
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,660
Have you ever met Lilith?

492
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,060
No.

493
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,420
Well, she happens to be a very warm and loving woman.

494
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,220
Although psychoanalysis isn't always the best tool for providing therapy to someone,

495
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,020
it does make for a handy way of dissecting art, particularly art that holds it in high

496
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,020
regard.

497
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,780
This episode demonstrates the distance Frasier has created in his life, but it goes beyond

498
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,900
the personal relationships and professional choices he's made.

499
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,220
It goes deep into who he is as a character.

500
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,720
He lives in a social class that creates distance from the rest of the world.

501
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,040
He works in a profession only available to those with the means to pay for it.

502
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,400
And when he takes a step towards bringing his expertise to the people, it's done in

503
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,520
a way that keeps those people at a distance as well.

504
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,200
And somehow through all those distances, manages to make real connections and give people genuine

505
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
comfort.

506
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,560
Class, through the mediums of wealth and exclusive medical treatment, reveals itself to be a

507
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,360
barrier to expressions of human compassion.

508
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,800
Frasier is a likeable character, not because he uses his status to help others, but because

509
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,680
he can help others in spite of it.

510
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:56,200
Frasier simply wouldn't exist without Cheers, so it made perfect sense for some of those

511
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,680
old friends from Cheers to stop by for a few cameos throughout the years.

512
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,760
Frasier had been moved to Seattle, in part, to signify that this new show would be a departure

513
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,320
from Cheers, and the first season of Frasier deliberately avoided bringing back any other

514
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,640
Cheers alumni.

515
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,720
The one exception, naturally, was his ex-wife Lilith.

516
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,440
And the episode featuring her return, titled The Show Where Lilith Comes Back, was the

517
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:23,040
second most watched episode of Frasier ever.

518
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:41,400
Luckily for us, Frasier and Lilith still have that wonderful chemistry.

519
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,360
Lilith would make guest appearances in each of the show's 11 seasons, including a particularly

520
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:55,880
memorable episode where she hooks up with Niles.

521
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,680
Frasier's son Frederick, first played by Luke Tarsetano and then Trevor Einhorn, also

522
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:26,760
made several appearances, memorably offering some competition to Niles.

523
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,920
By the end of the series, we see how Frasier and Lilith have grown to have a meaningful

524
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:40,200
friendship together, and Frasier, in spite of Frederick entering his goth phase in the

525
00:32:40,200 --> 00:33:06,920
final season, still manages to have a connection with his son.

526
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,200
Frasier, in spite of the challenges of living on the other side of the country, manages

527
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,440
to hold onto the things that matter most to him from his time in Boston.

528
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,480
It's a charmingly uplifting message.

529
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,400
Of course, there were some other connections from Boston who also had cameos.

530
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,600
In the season two episode, The Show Where Sam Shows Up, Sam Malone, naturally played

531
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,520
by Ted Denson, makes a surprise appearance in Seattle.

532
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,200
This episode also provides some interesting bits of trivia, such as highlighting how much

533
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:47,880
David Hyde Pierce looked like a young Kelsey Grammer when he first appeared on Cheers.

534
00:33:47,880 --> 00:34:16,320
We also get some plot holes addressed, such as the truth behind Frasier's father.

535
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:25,320
In the episode, The Show Where Diane Comes Back, we get a cameo from Shelly Long, reprising

536
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,820
her role as Diane, Frasier's horror fiancé.

537
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,160
There was a very brief Diane cameo in season two, but it was this season three episode

538
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,520
that really brought her back for a proper Cheers reunion, complete with a stage production.

539
00:34:36,520 --> 00:35:00,760
The episode offers Frasier the chance to get some real closure with Diane after over

540
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:20,080
a decade of bitterness.

541
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,440
In season six, Woody Harrelson once again took up the role of Woody Boyd in an episode

542
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,280
you'll be shocked to learn was called The Show Where Woody Shows Up.

543
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,280
This episode really seemed to tie a bow on the idea that Frasier was no longer a spin-off

544
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,440
and had cemented its own identity.

545
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:19,360
The last of the Cheers reunions is also the

546
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,420
only one with an original name, Cheerful Goodbyes.

547
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,480
This brought back Cliff Clavin, played by John Ratzenberger, Norm Peterson, played by

548
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,600
George Wendt, and Carla Maria, Victoria Angelina, Teresa Apollonia, Lu Ponce, Tartale Lebec,

549
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
played by Rhea Perlman.

550
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,240
Of the Cheers reunions, this one is the most extensive and feels the least natural.

551
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,800
Even though it takes place in Boston, there's no sign of the original Cheers bar.

552
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,860
It also doesn't quite feel the same without Sam, Woody, or Rebecca.

553
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,760
The interactions between the two casts are interesting, but are mostly a novelty.

554
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
The presence of a guy who looks suspiciously like Cheers director James Burroughs, who

555
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,240
also directed 32 episodes of Frasier, along with cameos from a number of Cheers regulars,

556
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,480
makes the whole episode feel like a messy celebration of the series that birthed Frasier.

557
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,120
It might have made for a good Cheers reunion, but it being an average episode of Frasier

558
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,840
speaks even further to how far apart these two shows have grown.

559
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,240
The only principal cast member from Cheers still alive to not appear on Frasier at all

560
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
was Christy Alley.

561
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,360
It's been reported that the reason why was because Alley, a practicing Scientologist,

562
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,680
didn't approve of a show about psychiatry.

563
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,240
When asked in an interview about why Alley hadn't appeared on the show, co-creator

564
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
David Lee said,

565
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:30,560
I don't recall asking.

566
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
The original premise for Frasier was the building of a relationship between Frasier and his

567
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,280
father Martin.

568
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,480
Many of the early episodes of the series include moments where Frasier and Martin make an effort

569
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:56,320
to connect, and it's a bit of a struggle for them.

570
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:18,800
Martin is the voice of reason when it comes to making things work.

571
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,520
Importantly, Martin's not just being roped into a pet project of Frasier's to mend their

572
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,640
relationship, he wants to reconnect as well.

573
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,420
And rather than through Frasier's exercises, growing closer comes about just by them being

574
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,120
together more often, creating new opportunities to learn about one another.

575
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,200
It seems like a tall order, with Martin being so unlike his sons, but Kelsey Grammer summed

576
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
up the dynamic nicely, saying,

577
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,440
People always ask how Frasier and Niles came from a father like Martin.

578
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,160
Martin's in public service, into knowing what's right and wrong.

579
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,640
That's exactly what his sons were.

580
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,280
On the simplest level, he was a good man, and their hope was to become the same thing.

581
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,420
One sweet example is in the episode, Martin Does It His Way, where the Crane men bond while

582
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,320
trying to piece together a song Martin had written decades previously he was hoping to

583
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:12,220
send to Frank Sinatra.

584
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,660
While many of the bonding moments were like this, the series also didn't shy away from

585
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,180
other types of bonding.

586
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,140
In Beloved Infidel, a secret is revealed about Martin and an old family friend.

587
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:44,260
But eventually, Frasier finds out the truth.

588
00:39:44,260 --> 00:40:02,900
And the two have something to connect over.

589
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:50,700
The idea of bonding over trauma is a good one,

590
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,580
and the family connection makes it even stronger, helping forge this connection Martin and Frasier

591
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
were hoping for.

592
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,140
And by the fourth season, we started to see this father-son relationship take real shape.

593
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,820
In Our Father Whose Art Ain't Heaven, Frasier refuses a gift from Martin, and we see what

594
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:29,420
that gesture meant to the guy.

595
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:47,740
And Frasier wasn't the only son connecting to Martin.

596
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,940
Even the small gestures reveal how the two of them have grown closer together.

597
00:41:50,940 --> 00:42:16,620
This all raises some interesting questions about the show, if, by the halfway point,

598
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,140
the main premise of a father and son reconnecting had already reached its conclusion.

599
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,700
What's to be done with Martin?

600
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,940
To understand Martin, though, it's important to take a step back and understand who his

601
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,540
character is aside from his relationship with Frasier.

602
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,420
Martin is often positioned on the show as the average guy.

603
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,620
The working class everyman most of the audience can relate to.

604
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,580
Except, Martin isn't really the average blue-collar worker he's presented as.

605
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,860
He's a former cop.

606
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,500
And that has an impact on how he sees the world.

607
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Here's a brief example of his politics.

608
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,500
When Frasier is dealing with a con man in the episode, Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool

609
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:08,020
Me Twice, Martin makes his feelings about people in general clear.

610
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,900
Although we only get vague references to Martin's life before he became a cop, his time working

611
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,460
for the force has certainly cemented the idea that people are generally bad and need

612
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,300
the firm hand of the police to keep them in check.

613
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,580
Throughout the series, Martin is softened quite a bit, becoming more well-versed in

614
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,860
the finer things in life thanks to his time with Frasier, and becoming a kinder, gentler

615
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,820
person as a result of having a stronger home life in connection with his sons.

616
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,020
But his attitudes towards people more broadly doesn't change too much.

617
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,740
He can't share Frasier's optimism that people are generally good, and when he's given the

618
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,060
opportunity to offer some forgiveness of his own, he can't bring himself to do it.

619
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,940
In the season 8 episode, A Day in May, Martin attends the parole hearing of the guy who

620
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
shot him.

621
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,820
Even after speaking with the man's mother, Martin can't bring himself to make a statement

622
00:43:48,820 --> 00:44:01,980
in favor of his release.

623
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,540
Martin doesn't have to forgive the guy who shot him, but his rigidness here represents

624
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,700
a side of him that he carries throughout the series, this skepticism towards the idea that

625
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,220
people can change for the better, which is ironic considering in his own change throughout

626
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,300
the series, such as finally mustering the courage to tell his sons that he loves them.

627
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:45,500
Martin's struggle to connect with his sons

628
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,140
and his cynicism towards society present a man who is trapped in certain confining

629
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,980
elements of masculinity.

630
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,900
We see Martin get angry when Eddie is playing with a doll, or his deep discomfort when Frasier

631
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,780
wants to talk about his concerns that he may be gay.

632
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,180
Martin has a very fixed idea of what it means to be a man in the world, and it's what makes

633
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,180
him miserable.

634
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,020
It may also be part of the reason he chose to become a police officer, a job that reflects

635
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,100
masculinity that drenched him in cynicism.

636
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,900
Martin is both a victim and a critique of the times he lived in, and sometimes the show

637
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,940
goes out of its way to present that to us.

638
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:36,900
Here's Martin opining on women getting pregnant out of wedlock.

639
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,220
In later seasons of the series, Martin began something close to a redemption arc.

640
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,700
In The Return of Martin Crane, we see Martin leave his early retirement, rejoining the working

641
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,500
world as a security guard.

642
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,100
Although not exactly quite the high-stakes job of his younger days, it does let him reclaim

643
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,580
part of his life by feeling like he's part of society.

644
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,220
It's not as though he's in dire need of assistance, with him being quite happy living

645
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,940
with Frasier, but Martin needs something to feel like he isn't just slipping into the

646
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,220
back pocket of someone else's life.

647
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:15,860
Unadorably, part of Martin reasserting himself often involves treating his sons like kids.

648
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,020
This happened throughout the series and was one of the few ways Martin would assert control

649
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
over his life.

650
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,700
Martin's dating life was a subject throughout the series.

651
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,140
While he had had some success with women, it wasn't until the show's final season

652
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,260
that he met Ronnie Lawrence, played by Wendy Mallick, a former babysitter of Frasier and

653
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,260
Niles.

654
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:44,740
It's a bit strange, considering the dynamic they used to have, though it has been over

655
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,940
thirty years since Ronnie was a teenage babysitter working for the Cranes.

656
00:46:48,940 --> 00:47:08,940
Even so, Martin still feels a bit insecure.

657
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,060
Martin eventually tells Ronnie how strongly he feels about her, and the two grow closer

658
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,700
throughout the final season.

659
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,260
At the beginning of the series, Martin is a crotchety old man with a funny dog who lives

660
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,980
alone, with no real connections aside from his old buddies on the police force.

661
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,180
By the end, he's reconnected with his sons, found new family in Daphne and Roz, managed

662
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,900
to find his first lasting relationship since his wife passed away, a new purpose with a

663
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,500
new job, and he still has that funny dog.

664
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,540
Martin wasn't quite the everyman because it's difficult to believe that the average

665
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,180
man lives a life quite as tragic as his had been in that first episode, and one drenched

666
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,260
in so much cynicism and bitterness towards the world at large.

667
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,900
But by making him the everyman and highlighting his journey, it reveals that life can still

668
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,700
change, even in old age, in some of the most dire of circumstances, that you can discover

669
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,020
a new reason to wake up every morning.

670
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,500
Martin still carries the baggage of a cynical cop who's been shaped into someone suspicious

671
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,060
of the world around him, but by learning to find the good in his life, from family and

672
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,780
new friends, he's at least found some kind of happiness.

673
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,180
Frasier writer Joe Keenan explains this saying,

674
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,740
Martin could have stepped out of an Arthur Miller play.

675
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,700
The guy's lost everything he's loved, his wife, job, independence.

676
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,660
He has nothing left but his dog, chair, and two sons he feels look down on him.

677
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,220
Keenan warm-up to them gave the show its sweetest, most hopeful long-term arc.

678
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,940
In the episode Freudian Sleep, the cast of the show, Minus Ross, have a series of bizarre

679
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,420
nightmares while staying at a house in the mountains.

680
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:43,260
When we peer into Martin's dreams, though, they take a different tone.

681
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,020
Of all the sections, this one was a bit of a struggle, as Eddie is the character steeped

682
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,260
in the most scandalous of controversies.

683
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,380
I should acknowledge first one of the big ones that he has had a long-standing feud

684
00:48:53,380 --> 00:49:12,740
with a certain type of bird.

685
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,420
I'd like to remind my audience that we aren't hearing the bird side of the story for this

686
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,780
incident, so please don't rush to judgment of this particular Blue Jay.

687
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,500
Behind the scenes, there was also ongoing drama between the dogs who played Eddie, Moose

688
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,780
and his son Enzo.

689
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,500
Co-creator Peter Casey explains,

690
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,620
Moose and Enzo hated each other.

691
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,980
They couldn't be on the set together.

692
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,140
Apparently it was one of those classic parent-child Hollywood rivalries.

693
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,100
Even with all this controversy swirling about, there were a number of wonderful Eddie moments.

694
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,140
Much of this should be credited to his trainer, Matilda Cagney.

695
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:48,380
She even got a nod in one of the episodes.

696
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,620
It's difficult to analyze the majesty and depth of the Eddie character, so I won't

697
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,700
go into too much more detail aside from the fact that throughout the series he was, unquestionably

698
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,700
and unwaveringly, a very good boy.

699
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,980
There were also the revelations in his groundbreaking biography, the details of which can be safely

700
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,740
passed over in this video.

701
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:16,660
You can see this book out of your careers to learn more about this pup.

702
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,220
One of the signature styles of Frasier was its use of farce.

703
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,740
These comedies of errors revolved around a misunderstanding or misunderstandings spiraling

704
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,740
out of control.

705
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,740
An early example is the episode The Matchmaker, where Frasier's new boss thinks he's gay.

706
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:49,580
Another would be the innkeepers, where Frasier and Niles open a restaurant together.

707
00:50:49,580 --> 00:51:13,900
Or the much beloved Ham Radio, where Frasier stages a radio play.

708
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,020
But the most fondly remembered of these episodes, so much so that it's the favorite of many

709
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,100
fans, is the ski lodge.

710
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,980
After Roz wins a free trip to a ski lodge, Frasier convinces to sell it to him.

711
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,380
So he takes Niles, Martin, Daphne, and Daphne's friend Annie, played by Cynthia LaMontagne,

712
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:34,340
to enjoy a ski trip, complete with ski instructor Guy, played by James Patrick Stewart.

713
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,940
This episode featured an elaborate ski lodge set, one of only two that was so big it was

714
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,780
built in front of the main set of Frasier's apartment.

715
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,760
The basic idea of this episode is that everyone, aside from Martin, is attracted to another

716
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,360
person in that ski lodge, only no one seems to know who is into who.

717
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,720
Frasier is into Annie, Annie is into Niles, Niles is, of course, into Daphne, Daphne

718
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,800
is into Guy, and Guy is into Niles.

719
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,520
Some misunderstandings lead to a few memorable moments.

720
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:42,680
It's all absurdly convoluted, yet somehow still manages to work.

721
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,160
The writer for the episode, David Lee, explains why this episode worked so well.

722
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,120
The motivations always have to be absolutely real.

723
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,680
It helps if they come from the heart.

724
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,520
They can also come from lower on the anatomy, which they often do, but what really gets

725
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,160
the audience engaged is when they care about the characters.

726
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:04,440
In this case, it was Niles' feelings that you cared about.

727
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,040
Niles and Daphne are probably the most important relationship in the series, being the only

728
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,480
long-running story arc that lasts throughout the whole show, and one that was featured

729
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,680
in its most watched episode.

730
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,160
Niles and Daphne first meet in the third episode of the series, Dinner at Eight.

731
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,320
Although Daphne happily acknowledges him, Niles' reaction is a bit more extreme.

732
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:34,520
The

733
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:40,280
complication here is that Niles is very much a married man to the unseen Maris, which doesn't

734
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,440
stop him from making certain overtures.

735
00:53:42,440 --> 00:54:03,000
The Niles and Daphne relationship would continue like this in the early seasons of

736
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,920
the show, though at first it wasn't supposed to happen at all.

737
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,480
In interviews, David Hyde Pierce would tell the story of how, while doing press for the

738
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,880
show before production began, Jane Leves would mention the idea that perhaps Daphne

739
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,360
and Niles should get together.

740
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,000
This manifested on the writing side in its own way.

741
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,880
Writer-producer, N. Fletch Giordano, explains an encounter with series producer, Christopher

742
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,880
Lloyd.

743
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,280
Early in the first season, Niles comes to the apartment.

744
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,840
Chris, realizing that Niles would be meeting Daphne for the first time, said, what if he

745
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,920
had a crazy crush on her?

746
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,360
And it was here this multi-year crush began, with many delightful misunderstandings.

747
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,360
This is one of me psychic headaches.

748
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
There's some kind of negative force out there.

749
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,360
I only get these when there's a clawing at the cosmic continuum.

750
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Perhaps if someone robbed your temples, that's...

751
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,360
By goodness, Dr. Crane, shouldn't you be out there mixing?

752
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,360
Oh, don't mind me.

753
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
I'm just getting some ice.

754
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
Lovely party.

755
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Dr. Crane is always dropping by and bringing me little gifts, and he's not after anything.

756
00:54:43,360 --> 00:55:08,200
Although charming in their execution, there's something a bit strange about a married man

757
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,720
drooling over his father's physical therapist.

758
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,840
Though it might make Niles appear like a brute to his wife, David Hyde Pierce performed

759
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,720
the character in a way that made his love for Maris clear.

760
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,360
Writer Joe Keenan explains.

761
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,120
No matter how ludicrous our descriptions got, David made Niles' feelings about the marriage

762
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
very real.

763
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,840
He knew that if Niles didn't love Maris, there'd be no reason for us to care when she divorced

764
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,960
him, or for Niles to feel conflicted and hide his love for Daphne.

765
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,280
That can be seen in episodes such as, An Affair to Forget, where Niles confronts Maris'

766
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,360
fencing instructor, Gunnar, over an affair Niles suspects Gunnar is having with Maris.

767
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:53,960
Luckily for Niles, he finds out Maris has remained faithful.

768
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,240
The early flirtations between Niles and Daphne happen with the spectre of Maris around them.

769
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,840
In spite of that barrier to them being together, there's still an obvious chemistry between

770
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
them.

771
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,720
In the first seasons, a midwinter night's dream, a storm traps Daphne at Niles' mansion

772
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:26,080
while Maris is in Arizona.

773
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,960
As Niles comforts Daphne after a recent breakup, things get heated.

774
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:46,760
Dr. Crane, your glockenspielers sprung to life.

775
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh, the clock!

776
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,480
Maris.

777
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,840
You really loafer, don't you?

778
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,680
You know, I do.

779
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,020
Love is a funny thing, isn't it?

780
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:12,520
Sometimes it's exciting and passionate, and sometimes it's something else.

781
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,960
Something comfortable and familiar.

782
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,040
David Hyde Pierce describes Niles' attraction to Daphne, saying,

783
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,320
I think she's just an exotic flower to him, and she's so beautiful and it's so unusual

784
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,960
for him to be treated by a woman with such friendliness that he's overwhelmed by that

785
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,280
openness because Maris is so manipulative and difficult.

786
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,280
Niles and Maris' marriage over the years deteriorates, leading to separation and then

787
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
eventually divorce.

788
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,200
It never sounded particularly happy, but whatever it was, was enough for Niles.

789
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,160
That is, until the arrival of Daphne, which introduced something new and different to

790
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
him.

791
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,720
At first, it could simply be the echo of a wealthy man lusting after a woman of a lower

792
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,560
class, a very old trope, and seen in classic works of literature such as Pamela.

793
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,600
Class has a very strange place in this relationship though, as we never see Niles consider Daphne

794
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,600
beneath him.

795
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,560
Rather, he just seems her as different and enticing.

796
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,560
The timing of Niles and Maris' divorce, a few years after the arrival of Daphne, does

797
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,680
suggest that the idea of something more may have fueled its end at some level, though

798
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,600
the series never makes that explicit.

799
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,160
The closest sign we get is when, during his separation, Niles takes Daphne to a ball in

800
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,920
the episode Moon Dance.

801
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,600
What started off as an evening to show Niles' friends he wasn't sulking over Maris becomes

802
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
something more than that.

803
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Niles is on the cusp of getting swept away with Daphne until he learns the truth.

804
00:58:51,600 --> 00:59:12,240
A crucial part of this episode is that Niles brought Daphne to impress his snooty, high

805
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,480
society friends.

806
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,160
The idea that Niles would show up with someone of a lower class to impress a bunch of snobs

807
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,200
doesn't really make sense, though it does reveal that, when it comes to Daphne, Niles

808
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,200
sees her for more than who she is in her social standing.

809
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,920
To her being a beautiful woman, I'm sure helps as well.

810
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,480
Although Niles clearly has romantic feelings for Daphne, part of what keeps it from getting

811
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,020
too creepy is that, ultimately, he cares about her as a person.

812
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,200
He may want to be with her, but he also wants her to be happy.

813
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,640
Before his divorce with Maris, we see this in the episode Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.

814
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,680
This reluctantly helps Daphne connect with his handyman, Joe.

815
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:19,360
Next season, when Daphne breaks up with Joe for good, the separated Niles and Daphne have

816
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,360
a nice talk.

817
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:50,240
Unrequited love is

818
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,040
one of the oldest tropes in English literature.

819
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,760
It can be traced back to the medieval concept of courtly love, which would often entail

820
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,400
a man's desire for an unavailable woman, although when it comes to women of a lower

821
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,800
class, whether or not she's unavailable never quite enters into the equation.

822
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,920
In this instance, it actually subverts that expectation.

823
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,480
Niles doesn't see Daphne as a lower class woman he can take advantage of, but as an

824
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,520
equal, or someone even greater than himself.

825
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,040
It's a bit strange to square the idea that Daphne, who clearly understands and cares

826
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,880
for Niles as a friend, is still somehow oblivious to his attraction towards her.

827
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:35,640
Jane Leaves explains why from her own perspective.

828
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,160
This old trope of pining for an oblivious woman can create many great episodes and moments,

829
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,800
as the series so easily demonstrates, but it does also carry with it a more pernicious

830
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,640
element, and that's the objectification of Daphne.

831
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,080
By objectification, I don't mean in the more commonly understood sense of highlighting

832
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,440
a woman's physical form over her character.

833
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,000
Daphne wasn't really objectified in that way.

834
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,880
At least, not that often.

835
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,880
What I mean is all those delightful moments where Niles fawns over an oblivious Daphne

836
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:29,640
are effectively removing her from the scene as a full character.

837
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,920
When Niles and Daphne have one of these cute little moments, there are two conversations

838
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,920
happening.

839
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,800
The obvious one, in which Daphne is showing Niles how to blow a smoke ring, and the subtextual

840
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,400
one of Niles getting turned on by Daphne.

841
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,920
In many of these moments, these scenes don't just include Daphne and Niles, but also have

842
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,260
Fraser Martin present to underscore what's going on.

843
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:51,160
It isn't just Niles drifting off into a world of fantasy, it's a secret conversation

844
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,120
happening between the Crane men.

845
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,040
Even a conversation that's little more than a few weighted glances.

846
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,800
Even at the two layers of these moments, Niles and the other men operate on both, while

847
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,960
Daphne only operates on one.

848
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,120
In that second later, she is present, but not as an active participant, but rather an

849
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,680
unthinking element to be played against, like a prop, or an object.

850
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,640
The show itself acknowledges this dynamic in the episode, Perspectives on Christmas, where

851
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,640
each of the characters describe a disastrous Christmas from their own points of view.

852
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:31,360
Here's how Martin observed one of those moments.

853
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:44,520
And here's how that same moment played out from Daphne's perspective.

854
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,080
And the show certainly doesn't shy away from making fun of her with moments like this.

855
01:03:48,080 --> 01:04:09,760
In the early seasons, this was a common trend for Daphne, unfortunately.

856
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,600
She was such a charmingly offbeat character that existed purely as you saw her, without

857
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,280
much of an interior life.

858
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,360
Even stories that focused on her, such as her having her boyfriend spend the night at

859
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,580
Frasier's apartment with her, ended up becoming stories more focused on other characters,

860
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:26,360
in this case Frasier and his anxiety about Daphne having a man over.

861
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,320
This can be seen in a comment from Christopher Lloyd.

862
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,160
He's describing why Niles and Daphne work as a couple.

863
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,200
I thought, could it be because she's so different than he is?

864
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,560
He's upper class, and she's working class.

865
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,560
She says what's on her mind, and he's restrained and thoughtful.

866
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,280
Jane Lees did have some say in making Daphne a more interesting character over the years,

867
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,960
even filling in some of her backstory.

868
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,240
She explained in an interview,

869
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,340
Daphne was like a pair of comfy shoes.

870
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,200
She had a sort of earthiness and honesty that definitely came from me.

871
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,320
I told the writers that a girl who's comfortable around these men, who doesn't take any of

872
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,280
their crap, must come from a household filled with men.

873
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,520
In one of the more ironic twists of the series, by being actively pursued by Niles, instead

874
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,760
of him just loving her from afar, Daphne started to become a more well-rounded character.

875
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,740
As Niles' divorce with Maris starts to get messy, he decides to change his legal representation

876
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:14,560
from a high-priced law firm to one of Roz's ex-boyfriends, Donnie Douglas, played by Sol

877
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Rubinec.

878
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,200
And while he offers an immediate reversal of fortune for Niles' finances, netting

879
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,440
him a nice settlement, Donnie's presence also has another unexpected consequence.

880
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,040
Who understands why anything happens?

881
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:32,960
I mean, it's remarkable how completely one's life can change in an instant.

882
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,960
Poor Niles.

883
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,740
It's over the next season and a half, things start getting messy, with Donnie and Daphne

884
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:42,680
getting engaged, and Niles starting to date Mel, played by Jane Addams, a plastic surgeon

885
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:49,400
who had worked extensively on Maris.

886
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:59,200
One day though, a pulled muscle in Frasier's back changes everything.

887
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,080
While he's sitting in, and of all places, Martin's chair, Frasier ruminates about

888
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,160
his life.

889
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:34,920
A terrified Daphne tries to confirm the issue with Martin.

890
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,980
After taking some medication, Frasier asks Daphne for a massage, which gets pretty awkward,

891
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:59,240
but eventually the misunderstanding is partially revealed.

892
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:25,240
And everything is fine, until the meds Frasier took start to kick in.

893
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,080
Frasier doesn't remember spilling the beans, and it appears Daphne has learned the truth

894
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,400
with everyone else, none the wiser.

895
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:48,360
But Niles is a little more astute than everyone else.

896
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,560
While dating Donnie, Daphne had gradually been revealing more of herself.

897
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:55,340
We learned more about her life in Manchester, and about the things that made her happy.

898
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,740
But this is the moment that really made her come to life as a character.

899
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:02,260
Maybe it's the simple fact that having a secret reveals an interior of her life, and

900
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,860
one that puts her on par with the other characters around her.

901
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,620
In some ways, it even gives her an edge, since they don't know that she knows the truth

902
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,220
about Niles' feelings for her.

903
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,300
We can see that inversion very clearly in moments where Daphne and Niles have their

904
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:39,900
roles reversed in those little moments of subtext.

905
01:08:39,900 --> 01:09:06,780
It's fitting that Niles, being an old-handed this, can sense something is a mess.

906
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,540
Things finally reach a boiling point with the Season 7 finale and two-parter, something

907
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,700
borrowed, someone blue.

908
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:22,660
Daphne's wedding is fast approaching, and she needs to get some things off her chest.

909
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:42,100
She needs to get some things off her chest, and she needs to get some things off her

910
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,100
chest.

911
01:09:43,100 --> 01:10:11,740
Unfortunately for Daphne, Niles and Mel have some news of their own.

912
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,820
Before the wedding, Fraser notices how Niles and Daphne look at one another, and he decides

913
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:36,460
to confront Niles.

914
01:10:36,460 --> 01:11:00,780
This gives Niles the courage to finally tell Daphne the truth.

915
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:17,900
10 minutes later, she finally responds.

916
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:42,340
Although the episodes seem to end with Daphne deciding she can't leave Donnie, luckily

917
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:57,820
for all of us, we still got a happy ending.

918
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,620
After seven long years of seeing Niles and Daphne go from awkward flirtation to a romantic

919
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:06,420
escape, it felt as though this story was reaching its climax, and that was reflected in the

920
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:11,180
ratings as this was the most watched episode of Fraser, seen by nearly 34 million people

921
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,620
in the United States.

922
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,620
When Niles kisses Daphne for the first time, it gave me goosebumps.

923
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:21,140
I had lived with these characters for so long, as did the audience, and wanted that moment

924
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,260
for them.

925
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:33,020
And David Hyde Pierce shares this experience of the moment, saying,

926
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,180
Love stories often don't extend beyond the moment when two people finally get together,

927
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,720
and we simply expect them to live happily ever after.

928
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,680
But love isn't so simple in real life, and sometimes the hardest stories to tell aren't

929
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,040
about how a couple gets together, but rather how that couple stays together.

930
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,680
The moment when Daphne and Niles get together is often cited as where Fraser starts going

931
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,560
downhill, and while ratings did begin to decline, I would argue the quality was still certainly

932
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,080
there, only we weren't getting any more of those moments of hidden desire leading to

933
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,960
a comedic misunderstanding.

934
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,640
We were going to see how this couple dealt with the idea of changing their lives on the

935
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,680
spot for a chance at a love that might only come once in a lifetime.

936
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,160
When Niles and Daphne finally got together, there was a certain tension gone that had

937
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,080
been sustaining the series in ways we didn't understand.

938
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,600
When the eighth season began, it picked up right where the finale left off, with Niles

939
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,720
and Daphne figuring out how to navigate lives they had just destroyed.

940
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,880
Leaving your fiancé on your wedding day, and divorcing your wife on the fourth day

941
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,880
of marriage, does create some feelings of resentment.

942
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,280
These obstacles would be dealt with over the next couple of episodes, but I want to highlight

943
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,520
another important moment.

944
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:52,760
Although Daphne had been close with the Cranes, it's only now we see her being treated more

945
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,760
like family.

946
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,760
It's also a clear indicator that Fraser sees her as an equal.

947
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,120
She effectively marries into a higher class.

948
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,160
The episode even ends with Martin and Fraser putting together a special dinner for the

949
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,160
new couple.

950
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,040
The biggest challenge to the Niles and Daphne relationship is how devoid it is of any real

951
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,020
tension that it might end.

952
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,560
No one can doubt for a second that Niles is hopelessly devoted to her, and Daphne seems

953
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,400
to be quite taken with him as well.

954
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,440
The show plays a little with this idea when the stress of looking up to Niles' expectations

955
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,520
leads Daphne to gain a significant amount of weight.

956
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,600
Behind the scenes this was done to accommodate Jane Leaves' pregnancy, but it did raise

957
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,000
some interesting questions about how two people can date when so much of it is based on a

958
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,560
love that was built on years of pining.

959
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:50,280
How can reality ever live up to that?

960
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,840
Although Niles takes this revelation personally and the two have their first fight, they reconcile

961
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,280
before the end of the episode, and the two manage to stay together for the rest of the

962
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,280
series.

963
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,240
The episodes for Niles and Daphne that stand out the most are like this one though.

964
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,280
Ones where tension arises and the relationship is threatened, but at this point in the series

965
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,680
it's unthinkable that these two would ever break up, and what tension is created is undercut

966
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,680
because of that.

967
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,740
There's no will they or won't they, it's very clear that they will, and have.

968
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:21,000
In the same way Niles is utterly committed to Daphne, the show is utterly committed to

969
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,080
making this relationship work, spending years showing how Niles longs for her, using moments

970
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,600
to reveal how good the two of them are together, and revealing how much they've always cared

971
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
for one another.

972
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,520
Although it's certainly possible to tell interesting stories about how a couple stays

973
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,080
together, the series had the added pressure of years of buildup that might have felt like

974
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,080
a cruel tease had Niles and Daphne broken up a year or two after getting together.

975
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:53,320
By season 9 in the episode, The Proposal, we get exactly that.

976
01:15:53,320 --> 01:16:06,720
Instead of a big lavish wedding, Niles and Daphne end up eloping in Las Vegas.

977
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,600
The threats to Niles and Daphne are often external to the relationship, such as when

978
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:31,000
Niles faces a medical emergency and is rushed to the hospital for an operation.

979
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,040
There's also the return of Maris, who re-enters Niles' life after she accidentally murders

980
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:43,960
her two boyfriend with a crossbow.

981
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,560
The Niles and Daphne relationship is one that was defined by tension, and once that inner

982
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:52,200
tension was resolved, went on to face a series of tensions from outside the relationship,

983
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,960
always chasing that earlier feeling.

984
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,640
Although Niles and Daphne are lovely together, their on-screen dynamic only occasionally

985
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,200
explored that relationship.

986
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,800
Instead, we had exes, near-death experiences, and murderers threatening to tear these two

987
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
apart.

988
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,320
When Daphne and Niles had grown so much to be together, their relationship never quite

989
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,980
managed to do the same.

990
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,800
When people say Fraser changed after Niles and Daphne got together, they're right,

991
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,800
and change doesn't have to be a bad thing.

992
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:21,060
But when you go to a show, in part, for the exciting romantic tension, and it's all gone,

993
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,720
you can't help but feel as though something has been lost.

994
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,280
And the new thing might appear hollow if it seems to be an imitation of the old thing.

995
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:33,600
There is something to be said for seeing a happy couple together instead of one in constant

996
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
conflict.

997
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,380
It just wasn't as enthralling as the pursuit.

998
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,920
It also highlights another way in which class manifests itself in the series.

999
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,160
Daphne and Niles, on paper, shouldn't work.

1000
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,640
He's a rich psychiatrist, and she's a kooky physical therapist.

1001
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,000
But it does work, in spite of this class divide.

1002
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,960
And it serves as a reminder that true love is possible when you're willing to ignore

1003
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,260
the things that don't matter, in this case, social class.

1004
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,200
Because doing so opens a door to meeting someone who represents a whole new world of possibilities.

1005
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,800
Jane Lees describes it.

1006
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,760
She is the complete opposite of anything he's ever known.

1007
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,320
She's grounded and down to earth, and that's just not the sort of person he's used to.

1008
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,480
She's not out for herself like everybody else.

1009
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,080
She's there to help others.

1010
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,480
And it turns him on to see her rooting around under the sink and fixing things.

1011
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,920
The only real journey left for them to take together is the one to parenthood.

1012
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:32,320
Although this is Daphne's first child, in a way this is Niles' second.

1013
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:45,920
Though the show never did answer what happened to that little bag of flour.

1014
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,920
Or maybe we do now.

1015
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,680
Frasier was rightfully lauded as having a very strong record on depicting gay characters,

1016
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,600
often tackling stereotypes head-on.

1017
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,240
David Hyde Pierce explains.

1018
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,520
It was never jokes at the expense of gay people.

1019
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,360
We had gay people on staff.

1020
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,240
David Lee, one of the creators on the show, is gay, and so, to me, it was always acknowledging

1021
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,000
the preposterousness of stereotypes.

1022
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
This dynamic was, while explained in Matt Baum's excellent video, Frasier and sitcoms

1023
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,040
of the gay 90s, so give it a watch if you'd like to learn more about that.

1024
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,520
Instead, I'd like to talk about some other forms of representation on the series.

1025
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,520
NBC's lineup of sitcoms throughout much of the 90s, which Frasier was a part of on

1026
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,920
Thursday's nights, was overwhelmingly white, and this wasn't an accident.

1027
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,840
One of the executive producers of The Fresh Prince of the Balair, Andy Burrowitz, described

1028
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,520
what it was like to be producing one of the few sitcoms for NBC on primetime that had a

1029
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,000
black cast.

1030
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,880
The knee-jerk response in the network was, maybe we need more cast members on the show.

1031
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,840
They never said white, but curiously, all the characters they proposed were white.

1032
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,920
They believed a white audience wouldn't watch a black show.

1033
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,680
This came after programs including The Cosby Show and The Jeffersons demonstrated the opposite,

1034
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,560
but with cable channels attracting more of that TV audience, big networks such as NBC

1035
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,320
started trying to appeal more to that white audience the only way they knew how, making

1036
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,760
shows predominantly featuring white people.

1037
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,000
None of this is to say that Frasier was a show built specifically to appeal to white

1038
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,600
people, but it's certainly a fact that its makeup was a perfect fit for NBC, reflected

1039
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,900
in as simple a change as suggesting the Latina housekeeper on the show's original pitch

1040
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,720
instead be an Englishwoman.

1041
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,280
Frasier had a strange relationship with race, in that it says very little about it, and

1042
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:28,100
the one time it does, we get the episode, Something About Dr. Mary.

1043
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,800
In this episode, Frasier's temporary replacement for Roz, Mary, played by Kim Coles, starts

1044
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,640
getting too comfortable participating in the show, and Frasier feels too awkward to tell

1045
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:51,400
her to ease up a little.

1046
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,000
Interestingly enough, in this season 7 episode, the first one to ever mention race, we get

1047
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,200
this line.

1048
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:04,800
A scene with three white men talking about how, perhaps, white people are being too sensitive

1049
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,900
about racial issues, is a very 90s moment.

1050
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,640
We also have Frasier acting out a paranoid white guy fantasy of what it's like to disagree

1051
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:39,880
with a black woman.

1052
01:21:40,080 --> 01:22:05,280
Frasier comes clean and confesses the truth to Mary, who, of course, takes it all in stride.

1053
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:09,320
All ends well as Mary's interjections made her so popular she's offered her own show.

1054
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:13,240
A show with a white cast talking about race isn't impossible to do well.

1055
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,560
A few years prior, Roseanne did a masterful job with White Men Can't Kiss.

1056
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:21,120
Frasier is a sad reminder, though, that these topics can be clumsily handled in the hands

1057
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,880
of a creative team, completely divorced from the experiences they're speaking to.

1058
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,980
Though it does reflect quite nicely the misplaced anxieties certain white people might feel

1059
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,340
when discussing race.

1060
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:33,400
The show did fare slightly better over the years, introducing the less stereotypical

1061
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:38,280
character of Cam Winston, and having his mother Cora have a brief relationship with Martin.

1062
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,560
But these are characters for whom race is incidental, and they neatly fit into Frasier's

1063
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,900
upper class world.

1064
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:48,040
Another uncomfortable blind slot is the character of Maris, which only makes sense because we

1065
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,040
never see her.

1066
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:53,160
The show goes out of its way to describe how odd she is, being an heiress who is constantly

1067
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:57,320
engaging in surgeries and beauty treatments to keep herself looking young and beautiful.

1068
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,800
In the episode, To Thine Old's Self Be True, we find out Maris has been struggling with

1069
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,280
an eating disorder.

1070
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,920
The episode includes much discussion about how Maris has gained so much weight that she's

1071
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,880
gone from dangerously thin to dangerously overweight.

1072
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:22,920
In both cases, it's played for a laugh.

1073
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,000
Not being able to see Maris has always made it easy to create this bizarre entity to drive

1074
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
comedy.

1075
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,560
But if we could see her in this moment, eating away her misery that Niles has moved on without

1076
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,960
her, I imagine we'd probably feel more pity than anything else.

1077
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,960
It puts in stark relief all the other times Maris was described as being too light to

1078
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,640
leave footprints in the snow, or her weight being so smaller in her youth that Frasier

1079
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,320
was amazed she was even alive.

1080
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,680
A person that small and frail probably wouldn't be nearly as funny if you saw her in the flesh.

1081
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,520
And you could see what her eating disorder is doing to her.

1082
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,520
This, along with Frasier's record on race, underscores one of the sad truths about the

1083
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,520
series.

1084
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,120
It's a show about white men that struggles to see anything outside that perspective,

1085
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,880
and by not acknowledging those other perspectives makes Hei out of struggles that feel like

1086
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,160
laughing down.

1087
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,760
What keeps these episodes from getting too uncomfortable is how class acts as something

1088
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,000
of a barrier to disguise what's happening.

1089
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,800
In something about Dr. Mary, it can be argued that the comedy comes from Frasier's lack

1090
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,360
of perspective outside of his upper class world, even if the Mary character reads like

1091
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,360
a stereotype.

1092
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,640
In the case of Maris, her obscene wealth makes her far less empathetic a character, even

1093
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,840
though her disorder is incredibly tragic.

1094
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,800
In both cases, it's the status of the characters that informs the audience that it's okay

1095
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,480
to laugh at what's happening.

1096
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,600
It's another way in which class is a barrier to feeling empathy, something core to the

1097
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,600
character of Frasier.

1098
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,800
I'm certainly not saying we shouldn't laugh at the rich and powerful.

1099
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,520
In fact, I'd say we should err on the side of laughing at them more.

1100
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,120
But it is worth considering why we're laughing, whether it's for the silly excesses of the

1101
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:58,760
wealthy or the problems that impact people across class lines.

1102
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,600
Roz Doyle is a tough character to pin down, particularly in the beginning of the series.

1103
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,160
Frasier needed someone to interact with as part of his radio show, but only a few small

1104
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,360
details about the character really existed.

1105
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,600
When Perry Gilpin got the role, she was told by the creative team that they weren't really

1106
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,160
sure who Roz was as a character, leaving her wide open to the actress' interpretation.

1107
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,840
Gilpin once said in an interview,

1108
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,080
I imagined Roz constantly trying to live up to a forceful mother.

1109
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,800
I actually based a lot of her on a really good friend of mine.

1110
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,040
She's super smart, self-dependent, sexually adventurous, and honest about it.

1111
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Although this might have led her to evolve into a cliche, she managed to be a sexually

1112
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,200
active career woman without becoming a negative stereotype.

1113
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,680
In the episode, Roz and the Dog House, we see Bulldog, the perpetual sexual harasser

1114
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,760
at the station, appeal to Roz for her producing talents.

1115
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,680
I did not sleep with Bulldog, he didn't even hit on me.

1116
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:51,640
He didn't want something though, wanted me to leave you and come be his new producer.

1117
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:56,560
Well, I wonder why he said that.

1118
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,160
Eventually we find out Roz's suspicions to be true, and Roz is quick to stand up to

1119
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,160
Bulldog.

1120
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,160
Get out!

1121
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:05,160
I'll show you how to work, you disgusting farmer!

1122
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Hey, hey, hey!

1123
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,160
You're gonna have to slow down!

1124
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,480
I'm getting some mixed signals here.

1125
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,800
The lesson, almost learned here, was for Roz to respect the talent of his producer, as

1126
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,200
we did see how talented Roz was in helping improve Bulldog's show.

1127
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:20,960
But it's undercut by the reality that, in spite of her skills, Roz was still reduced

1128
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,540
to her sexual appeal by both of her bosses.

1129
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,640
This is something of a running theme for the character in the early seasons, and while

1130
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:30,480
it puts her on par with Frasier and Niles, who often end up being humiliated by people

1131
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,920
who know better, it hits a bit different when it's someone who doesn't have the same

1132
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,920
degree of power or status.

1133
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,240
Of all the characters on the show, it's Roz who is the most detached from the rest of

1134
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
the cast.

1135
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,760
Much like Daphne in the earlier seasons, Roz isn't highlighted the way many of the crane

1136
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,560
men are, sometimes reduced to only having one or two scenes in an episode.

1137
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,720
Unlike Daphne, she doesn't get the same opportunity of character growth when she

1138
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,560
becomes involved with Niles, often leaving Roz as the odd one out.

1139
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,560
The most meaningful connection Roz has to the rest of the cast is her friendship with

1140
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:15,280
Frasier, although this does get teased as them being more than friends multiple times.

1141
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,120
Aside from one night where they hook up, the two of them never come close to anything

1142
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,120
romantic.

1143
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,800
The relationship simply works best with them being friends.

1144
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,940
The friendship between Roz and Frasier is a bit different.

1145
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,520
Not just because of the class divide, but because Frasier is Roz's boss.

1146
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,640
It leads to some strange moments, such as the episode Roz alone, where Frasier loans

1147
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:42,240
Roz some money, and then becomes very judgmental when he sees how she spends it.

1148
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:58,600
Daphne is luckily there to point out how Frasier's loan of $1500 contrasts his usual

1149
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:20,360
spending habits.

1150
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,200
It's also worth mentioning that Roz being on hard times is because Frasier got her,

1151
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:29,000
and everyone else at KACL, fired when he made his stand against the station manager.

1152
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:40,640
Frasier eventually confronts Roz about her spending habits.

1153
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:45,200
Even their reconciliation is kind of weird, as Roz is forced to listen to Frasier's apology

1154
01:28:45,200 --> 01:29:13,120
because she's his producer and he's doing it on the air.

1155
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,680
These power dynamics come up several times throughout the series.

1156
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,840
Frasier and Roz are absolutely friends, but they aren't quite on the same level.

1157
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,360
The tension in this relationship always seems to come from the fact that Frasier has power

1158
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:27,080
over Roz, and reveals the perils of friendships within hierarchies.

1159
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:30,640
It's not as simple as saying, no one can ever be friends with their boss, that's obviously

1160
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,640
not true.

1161
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:35,560
Rather, what the series suggests is that this dynamic presents a barrier or obstacle in

1162
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:36,640
that friendship.

1163
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,720
In season 9, Roz meets Roger, a man who would be one of her longest romantic partners on

1164
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,720
the show.

1165
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,640
There are some echoes of class in that relationship as Roger is a garbage man, something that

1166
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:49,640
at first embarrasses Roz, but over time she learns to accept it.

1167
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,320
By the end of the season, sadly they've broken up.

1168
01:29:52,320 --> 01:30:11,360
Although Frasier tries to reach out to her, she insists she's fine.

1169
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,720
The rest of this episode, titled Frasier has Spokane, focuses on Frasier's expanding

1170
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:19,560
to the Spokane market, and him struggling to be accepted by the listeners there.

1171
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,040
Roz is enlisted to help out, posing as a caller looking for help.

1172
01:30:53,040 --> 01:31:14,880
Frasier and Roz have a very real connection, and it reveals the workplace friendships are

1173
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,640
just as valid as any other.

1174
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,000
Working together was never the problem for Frasier and Roz.

1175
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,520
Roz having to answer to Frasier as her boss was what introduced a power dynamic that undercut

1176
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,080
what is otherwise a very meaningful friendship.

1177
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,560
This is a reflection of what I was saying earlier about Frasier and how class creates

1178
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,000
barriers between him and the people he cares about.

1179
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,200
Roz is clearly no exception, and while it does provide an interesting reading for her

1180
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,200
character, it does frame the Frasier and Roz friendship as less about her story and more

1181
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,580
about his.

1182
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,280
There was one storyline for Roz that was all her own, and that was the birth of her daughter

1183
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,280
Alice.

1184
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,440
The birth of Alice was not planned by Roz, or even the show's producers.

1185
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,160
Christopher Lloyd in an interview said,

1186
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,680
It was the network's idea.

1187
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,880
It's one of those things because they like doing event shows.

1188
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,920
And so in the season 5 episode Halloween, we find out Roz is expecting.

1189
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,560
And as is tradition for the show, it's revealed in the most embarrassing way possible.

1190
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,160
If anybody's going to propose to Roz as Frasier, how could you do that?

1191
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,160
Get her pregnant?

1192
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,160
It was Frasier.

1193
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,160
Listen, everybody, I am not the father of Roz's baby.

1194
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,040
In fact, we don't even know for sure if there is a baby.

1195
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,880
We do now.

1196
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:23,760
The father is a young barista working at Cafe Nervosa, who Roz encourages to go live his

1197
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,320
life as she intends to raise the baby on her own.

1198
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:31,080
I hope that you can understand why I can't possibly marry you.

1199
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,160
When I get married, it's going to be to someone I love.

1200
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,700
And someone who loves me.

1201
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:41,040
And someone who can legally drink champagne at my wedding.

1202
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,040
Okay.

1203
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,040
I understand.

1204
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:50,040
Although Roz doesn't think this is going to be as easy to handle as she lets on.

1205
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,040
I can't take this.

1206
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,040
Damn it.

1207
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,040
I've let this happen.

1208
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:00,040
Are we still talking about the milk?

1209
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,040
Don't you see?

1210
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,040
Milk is a staple.

1211
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,040
I let a staple go bad.

1212
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,040
Good mothers don't let stables go bad.

1213
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,040
How can I be responsible for a child when I can't even keep fresh milk in the house?

1214
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
Kids need milk.

1215
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,040
I have to know everything.

1216
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,040
You can know half of everything.

1217
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,040
You can know about the milk and Lilith can know about the booties and the snugglies.

1218
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,040
You never met Lilith, did you?

1219
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,040
What seemed to be the beginning of Roz's character moving in a new direction never quite gets off the ground,

1220
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:36,040
as even the delivery of the baby is almost smuggled into an episode about Frasier and Niles competing over the same woman at a party.

1221
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,040
What is wrong with me?

1222
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,040
What is wrong with me?

1223
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,040
Why can't I find a single woman who's interested in me?

1224
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,040
Those are two different questions, really.

1225
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,040
So we should just sit down and talk them both over.

1226
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,040
Oh wait, I can't.

1227
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,040
Because I'm in labor!

1228
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,040
Still, we do get a cute moment with baby Alice.

1229
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,040
Oh, look at her.

1230
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,040
Oh, she's beautiful.

1231
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,040
Mazel tov.

1232
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,040
It's a long story.

1233
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,040
And that was about it.

1234
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:08,040
On the odd occasion, we would see Alice appear in an episode or Roz would make a reference to having to stay home because she couldn't find a babysitter.

1235
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:14,040
But otherwise, we don't get too much of a change in Roz's life, aside from maybe her dating habits slowing down a bit.

1236
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:18,040
One interesting bit of trivia about Roz Doyle is that she gets her name from one of the producers on Wings,

1237
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:21,040
the show David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee created before Frasier.

1238
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,040
The real-life Roz Doyle passed away in 1991 from breast cancer.

1239
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:31,040
Towards the end of the series, we see some development in sight for Roz as she's offered a job as station manager at a rival radio station.

1240
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,040
I must say, I've got sort of mixed feelings about this.

1241
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,040
I mean, I couldn't be happier.

1242
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:39,040
They're finally getting the recognition you deserve, but I'm going to miss you.

1243
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:44,040
Well, let's wait till there's a real offer before we break out the Kleenex and Champagne.

1244
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,040
Roz, being so capable, gets the job.

1245
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,040
Well, I got the job!

1246
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,040
Oh, congratulations, Roz.

1247
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,040
I'm so proud of you.

1248
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,040
Now, can I tell you how much I'm going to miss you?

1249
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,040
Yes.

1250
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,040
This two-parter is a strange dynamic where Roz inserts herself into Frasier's new relationship with co-worker Julia,

1251
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,040
played by Felicity Huffman.

1252
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,040
Though, ultimately, none of this goes anywhere.

1253
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:07,040
Frasier breaks things off with Julia, and Roz exits the new job to go back to her old one at KACL.

1254
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:13,040
While a bit of an odd part of the show, it does reveal to us that Roz aspires to be something more than a producer for Frasier's show.

1255
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,040
And that's something we learn a little more about in the finale of the series.

1256
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:27,040
One major part of the series I haven't really touched on is Frasier's long-standing problems with dating.

1257
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,040
Throughout the over 250 episodes of the show, we see Frasier go on countless dates,

1258
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:36,040
struggling to find happiness with women that are a bad fit for him, a great fit for him,

1259
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:39,040
and ones who don't stick around long enough for us to find out.

1260
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,040
Frasier's struggle to find a relationship is one of the core conflicts of the series.

1261
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:49,040
Season 9 opens with the two-parter Don Juan in Hell, where Frasier dives deep into his own mind to figure out what he wants,

1262
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:52,040
imagining the many women who he's had relationships with.

1263
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:58,040
I have carried you with me throughout every relationship, on every date.

1264
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:03,040
You pick apart the women I care about and you remind me how much it'll hurt if I open myself up.

1265
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,040
You don't help me.

1266
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,040
You hold me back.

1267
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:14,040
How will I ever move forward if I don't put you behind me?

1268
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:20,040
Although this two-parter led Frasier to a place of emotional strength, ready to enter into a meaningful relationship,

1269
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:24,040
it would be two more seasons until he found the last of the women he would earnestly pursue on the series.

1270
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,040
Charlotte, played by Laura Linney.

1271
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,040
We only meet Charlotte seven episodes before the series finale,

1272
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,040
but Linney spoke about the experience of joining the cast so late in its run.

1273
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,040
I was a Frasier fan for so long.

1274
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,040
I think Charlotte's a good-hearted fumbling person trying her best, but things weren't working,

1275
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,040
and she was beginning to lose heart a little bit.

1276
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:45,040
In a fitting turn, Charlotte met Frasier while trying to help him make a meaningful connection as a matchmaker.

1277
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,040
After setting up a series of disastrous dates, Frasier realizes he's attracted to Charlotte.

1278
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:03,040
After some brief maneuvering around Charlotte's less-than-ideal boyfriend Frank, played by Aaron Eckhart,

1279
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:07,040
Frasier manages to get closer to Charlotte, until finding out something crucial.

1280
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:19,040
I know I should have told you sooner, but it was never the right time.

1281
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,040
Frasier and Charlotte decide to spend the last three weeks she has together,

1282
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:27,040
and that time is drawing to a close in the final episode, two-parter, Goodnight Seattle.

1283
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:32,040
As the episode begins, we can see the cast all reaching pivotal turning points in their lives.

1284
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,040
Martin and Ronnie, having gotten engaged a few episodes earlier, are planning their wedding.

1285
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:40,040
A very pregnant Daphne could give birth at any moment, and unbeknownst to Roz,

1286
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,040
she has an exciting career opportunity ahead of her,

1287
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,040
and Frasier is preparing to say goodbye to Charlotte.

1288
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,040
The episode opens with Frasier on a plane,

1289
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,040
recounting the strange turn of events that got him aboard that flight,

1290
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:55,040
and it began with Frasier's agent, Bebe, letting Frasier know he has an exciting new job offer.

1291
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:19,040
As Frasier weighs his options, he has to say goodbye to Charlotte as she leaves for Chicago.

1292
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:24,040
At Martin and Ronnie's wedding, disaster hits when Eddie, the ring bearer, eats the wedding ring.

1293
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,040
Daphne and Niles take Eddie to the vet, and then her water breaks.

1294
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:49,040
And just like that, she has a brand new baby boy.

1295
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:53,040
He's named David, which is possibly a tribute to series co-creator David Angel,

1296
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,040
who had passed away with his wife a few years prior.

1297
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,040
Martin and Ronnie arrive and get married at the vet's office.

1298
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,040
And for good measure, it's also Eddie's birthday.

1299
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,040
It only loosely enters into the plot, but I felt like it needed to be mentioned.

1300
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,040
After the wedding, Martin and Ronnie plan on moving in together,

1301
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,040
and with Daphne already moved in with Niles, it leaves Frasier finally alone in his apartment.

1302
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:17,040
As he poses for a meme, we see the end of an era as Martin's chair is moved out of the apartment.

1303
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,040
In a cute nod to the first episode, the same actor who moved in Martin's chair is also the one who takes it away.

1304
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:38,040
With Martin moved out, and Daphne and Niles now busy with their new son,

1305
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,040
a lonely Frasier decides to take that job in San Francisco.

1306
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:52,040
Roz is also moving on as she's promoted to station manner at KACL.

1307
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Everyone gathers in Frasier's apartment to say goodbye before he moves to San Francisco.

1308
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:26,040
Martin's goodbye is particularly sweet, hearkening back to the first episode as he finally thanks Frasier.

1309
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,040
And Niles, simply as Niles?

1310
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:58,040
The episode is capped off with Frasier reading Tennyson's poem Ulysses and braving one more change in his life, which brings us back to that flight.

1311
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:16,040
Frasier taking a chance on love is a nice way to bookend the series.

1312
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:22,040
What is life without taking those chances, making those gestures, striving for something to live for?

1313
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:27,040
Frasier's life has consistently been one about the barriers that prevent him from connecting to others.

1314
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:31,040
Some a product of his class, others of his own making.

1315
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:35,040
It's a great irony that runs through a series about a man who makes his living helping others.

1316
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:43,040
His abysmal dating record is perhaps the greatest symbol of his lack of ability to connect to anything, with bad luck explaining some of his troubles and circumstance affecting the rest.

1317
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:51,040
Frasier deciding to take one more leap in his life and heading towards the great unknown of Chicago to be with Charlotte is him finally jumping over one of those barriers.

1318
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,040
Finally closing one of those distances.

1319
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:59,040
And he's also turning down a great job offer as part of it, effectively sacrificing fame and fortune for a chance at love.

1320
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:09,040
If Frasier began this series as a silly rich man to absorb with vanity to find real happiness in his life, the finale is him choosing not to venture deeper into that world so he might find something more meaningful.

1321
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,040
When asked his thoughts on what fate awaited Frasier, Kelsey Grammer said,

1322
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,040
I sometimes think Frasier went to Chicago and Charlotte told him to get the hell out.

1323
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,040
That seems to be his luck.

1324
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,040
Maybe they ended up with a wonderful life together.

1325
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,040
And maybe we'll find out someday.

1326
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,040
Goodnight Seattle, we love you!

1327
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:33,040
Kelsey Grammer had been mentioning the possibility of a reboot as far back as 2018, with plans originally being a third act for Frasier in a whole new setting.

1328
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:38,040
The plan was, at first, to have it air in 2020, though that never materialized.

1329
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:46,040
On February 24th, 2021, it was revealed that the series would be streaming exclusively on Paramount+, with hopes of it premiering sometimes in 2022.

1330
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,040
So far, there's no concrete news of a date or even cast.

1331
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,040
The only thing we know for certain is that Kelsey Grammer will once again be reprising the role of Frasier.

1332
01:42:53,040 --> 01:43:02,040
Several cast members of Frasier have been asked if they're participating, but so far no one has conferred much of anything, aside from them being aware that it will be happening.

1333
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,040
The cultural impact and lasting legacy of Frasier extends well into the future.

1334
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:09,040
It's a bit difficult to describe, so I got some help to explain that.

1335
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:13,040
Hey, this is Hootz from the YouTube channel Little Hoot.

1336
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:20,040
I'm creating a companion video to Jose's on Frasier that's a collaboration with Neil from The Liberal Cook.

1337
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:34,040
In it, Neil and I attempt to suss out Frasier's legacy, and in doing so, we touch on a broad range of topics, including the misogyny of 90s comedy, philosopher Ahana Arendt, TV tropes, and Anita Hill.

1338
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:38,040
It's kind of a wild one, and I hope you enjoy.

1339
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:41,040
It's hard to overstate how well-received Frasier was.

1340
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:53,040
In addition to being a hit with strong ratings throughout its run, Frasier also managed to win 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most ever for a completed TV series, until that record was broken by Game of Thrones in 2016.

1341
01:43:53,040 --> 01:44:04,040
Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce both won four Emmys for their respective portrayals of Frasier and Niles, and Frasier won Outstanding Comedy Series five years in a row, a feat only matched by Modern Family.

1342
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:09,040
The series has also spawned a number of home releases, books, and other forms of merchandise over the years.

1343
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:17,040
It's also been playing in heavy syndication as well, letting whole new generations of people discover Frasier, joking and describing how new viewers react to the show, saying,

1344
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:21,040
I think new viewers like the show because, apart from its quality, it doesn't remind them of anything.

1345
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:27,040
No one says, oh, yet another show about two relentlessly highbrow romantically thwarted psychiatrists.

1346
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:37,040
Following the end of Frasier, Kelsey Grammer would go on to be involved in countless TV and film projects over the years, from appearing as beasts in the X-Men movies to being the executive producer of the TV series Girlfriends.

1347
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:45,040
He is still likely best remembered for the 20 years he spent playing Frasier, though he spent even more time, 29 years in fact, playing sideshow Bob on The Simpsons.

1348
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:54,040
And I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that The Simpsons had a number of Frasier references in those episodes, including guest appearances by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney.

1349
01:44:54,040 --> 01:45:03,040
David Hyde Pierce continued to have a number of TV and film roles, though he tended more towards working on stage, including winning a Tony for his role in the 2007 production of Curtains.

1350
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:10,040
His performances on Frasier were typically noted for how keenly they reacted to the audience, so a career on stage makes perfect sense for Pierce.

1351
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:15,040
John Mahoney appeared in several roles after Frasier, though Martin Crane would always be his signature performance.

1352
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:21,040
Sadly, on February 4th, 2018, Mahoney passed away due to complications from throat cancer.

1353
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,040
In an interview, Perry Gilpin told a sweet story about Mahoney.

1354
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,040
A few years ago, John took me and my family to dinner in Chicago.

1355
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:32,040
While we were driving back, my husband was texting with Chris Lloyd and read Chris's text out loud.

1356
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:37,040
Please tell the great John Mahoney it was one of the honors of my life to work with him.

1357
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,040
I could see a little tear for him in John's eye.

1358
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,040
Then my daughter says, Who's John Mahoney?

1359
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,040
John almost fell out of the car laughing.

1360
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,040
He never took himself too seriously.

1361
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:54,040
Jane Leves continued her career throughout the 2000s after the end of Frasier, eventually finding herself on Hot in Cleveland, which ran for six seasons.

1362
01:45:54,040 --> 01:46:00,040
She took some time off of television after that, though eventually returned to the drama series The Resident, which is currently in its fifth season.

1363
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:06,040
Perry Gilpin has been working in film and TV since the end of Frasier and has also built a fairly extensive list of credits doing voiceover work.

1364
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:12,040
She even has the unique distinction of being part of the ill-fated Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.

1365
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:18,040
In addition to Frasier, Moose also appeared in the feature film My Dog Skip once again alongside his son Enzo.

1366
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,040
Sadly, on June 22, 2006, Moose passed of natural causes at the age of 15.

1367
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:29,040
Enzo would pass not long after on June 23, 2010, at the age of 14, due to cancer.

1368
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,040
Both will be remembered as two of the very best boys.

1369
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:38,040
Class looms heavily in Frasier, often as a barrier from preventing people from making genuine connections.

1370
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:47,040
The very idea of people in the upper class is consistently a source of mockery, but more importantly, it's also demonstrated to be a driver of division and a barrier for loving compassion.

1371
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:54,040
Frasier does a wonderful service by showing us that this excess doesn't make anyone better. It's a social structure that moves us away from one another.

1372
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:58,040
Reflected on the show, David I. Pierce describes how it connects people, saying,

1373
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,040
that I no longer think of it as a coincidence, but as part of the show's legacy.

1374
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:20,040
Frasier was a show about connecting through unlikely circumstances, but the circumstances weren't the living arrangements, but the way their social spheres shaped them.

1375
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:24,040
The idea that these barriers can be torn down makes it much easier to laugh together.

1376
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:28,040
No matter how hard the times might get, that's what makes Frasier such an excellent show.

1377
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:36,040
When I made that Cheers retrospective a while ago, I knew it had to be a two-parter, and I knew I would eventually have to speak about Frasier.

1378
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:46,040
Growing up, I didn't really watch Cheers, but I definitely watched Frasier, so revisiting it all these years later was a treat and a reminder of why this show was such a joy to watch in my youth.

1379
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:51,040
It held up surprisingly well, and I think that's a tribute to the writing and performances throughout it.

1380
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:57,040
If you enjoyed this lengthy look back at the show Frasier, do consider becoming a patron or member for this channel.

1381
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:04,040
You'll join all the lovely names you see scrolling up on the screen now, plus you'll get early access to videos in the future.

1382
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:10,040
Patrons also get a little extra say on which series comes next, though I can't make any promises as to which you'll be covering.

1383
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,040
Thank you all so much for watching!
