WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
Where do people get their ideas?

00:02.760 --> 00:06.920
In the case of this video, I took my general distaste for the work of noted conspiracy

00:06.920 --> 00:11.840
theorist and soy hater Paul Joseph Watson, and decided to follow his work for a week

00:11.840 --> 00:17.800
and tabulate the many omissions, poor framings, and outright lies that shape his work.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.280
But something weird happened along the way.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.760
I had decided upon the week of January 14th, 2019 as my starting point.

00:25.760 --> 00:31.280
With the very first article, my whole idea fell apart, and I fell into a weird rabbit

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
hole.

00:32.280 --> 00:37.800
The article in question is titled, Leftist French Website Calls for Heterosexuality

00:37.800 --> 00:44.160
to be Banned, published on January 14th on Infowars, the home of conspiracy theories

00:44.160 --> 00:46.880
and pending litigation for slander.

00:46.880 --> 00:54.800
Watson's article is a less than favorable framing of a piece by Mérôme Jardin, titled,

00:54.800 --> 00:59.760
Interdire le Artreu Sexuality, for the French outlet media part.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.600
And I apologize for that terrible French pronunciation there.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.480
Watson's article describes the content of the Jardin piece, and includes some generally

01:09.480 --> 01:13.200
negative remarks, but doesn't go into it too deeply.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.200
The first question I had was, does Paul Joseph Watson speak French?

01:18.200 --> 01:22.440
He has a lot of translated sections of the original French article, but he doesn't really

01:22.440 --> 01:24.280
attribute it to anyone.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.560
So where did these translations come from?

01:26.560 --> 01:28.680
Did he just come up with them on his own?

01:28.680 --> 01:30.880
So I decided to look this up.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.840
It led me to, as far as I can tell, one of the few English language articles about the

01:35.840 --> 01:41.320
Jardin piece that wasn't just a reposting of the Watson article from Infowars.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.840
It was posted on a blog called, Diversity Machte Frei, which Google Translate tells

01:46.840 --> 01:51.160
me is German for diversity power free.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.880
But more about the blog in a bit.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.040
The article, Call for Heterosexuality to be Banned in France, was published on January

01:58.040 --> 02:02.120
12th, 2019, two days before the Watson article.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.920
I know you're all probably thinking, ooh, a plagiarism case.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
Sort of.

02:06.920 --> 02:13.000
There's actually something much more interesting going on here, so just hang in there for a

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
moment.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.760
The first thing I noticed about the blog post is that it's strikingly similar to the Watson

02:17.760 --> 02:22.800
article, so much so that every quoted section from the Watson article is an exact match

02:22.800 --> 02:25.360
for the blog article.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.320
Translation is not an exact science.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.360
Translations may contain subtle differences, depending on the translator.

02:32.360 --> 02:37.120
Take, for example, these translations of the first paragraph of the French article.

02:37.120 --> 02:41.240
I sourced both of these individually, and even when you take into consideration that

02:41.240 --> 02:47.880
words such as sexism and biphobia are typically only translated in one way, you can still

02:47.880 --> 02:53.120
see the subtle differences in the translation that show different people worked on them.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.880
The first paragraph is included in both the Watson and the Diversity Machte Frei blog

02:57.880 --> 03:01.080
article, and they are identical.

03:01.080 --> 03:06.760
There is no difference between them whatsoever, aside from a few opening words that the Watson

03:06.760 --> 03:08.560
quote cut off.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.320
In fact, every quoted section is identical aside from the word femicide, which was spelled

03:14.320 --> 03:19.160
incorrectly as feminicides in the Diversity blog.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.800
I suppose it was nice of Watson to correct the spelling there.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.640
But going further than the quotations, take a look at all these additional claims in the

03:27.640 --> 03:31.860
Watson article that aren't just quotes from the original Jardine article.

03:31.860 --> 03:36.280
Every single one of them can be found in the translated sections originally posted in the

03:36.280 --> 03:38.320
Diversity blog.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.600
That may not sound like a big deal, since they're talking about the same French article,

03:42.600 --> 03:45.080
why wouldn't they make the same claims?

03:45.080 --> 03:49.920
Except the translation on the Diversity blog only includes four paragraphs from the original

03:49.920 --> 03:54.760
French article 17, not counting the concluding sentence.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.580
Now what are the odds that the Watson article, supposedly based on having read the original

03:59.580 --> 04:05.080
French article in its entirety, would have happened to hit the exact same points as this

04:05.080 --> 04:10.360
blog post that translated less than a quarter of the article's content?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.660
But we're not done yet.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.800
The final few paragraphs of the Diversity blog read,

04:14.800 --> 04:22.440
The bio of the author, Mérôme Jardine, says he was a member of ACTA Paris, 1998-2013,

04:22.440 --> 04:28.700
a gay campaigning group, and is a member of CCIF, Collective Against Islamophobia.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.620
Which is hilarious, since I don't think this guy will last long after the Muslim takeover

04:32.620 --> 04:34.320
of France.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.560
Watson's article ends,

04:37.560 --> 04:42.900
The irony behind the piece is that Jardine is also a member of the CCIF, Collective Against

04:42.900 --> 04:44.880
Islamophobia.

04:44.880 --> 04:49.520
One wonders how his opinion will be received amongst France's Muslim population, which

04:49.520 --> 04:52.760
currently stands at almost 9%.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.040
Kind of strange how they ended on the exact same point, isn't it?

04:57.040 --> 05:02.500
Although Watson, I suppose, gets some tiny bit of credit for adding the factoid about

05:02.500 --> 05:07.220
the Muslim population of France, in an article that has nothing to do with Islam.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.820
Funny how that worked out.

05:08.820 --> 05:14.100
Countless writers have taken the work of others, synthesized or built upon it in some way.

05:14.100 --> 05:18.420
Typically though, they add more than just a random stat at the end.

05:18.420 --> 05:22.260
And even more typically, they actually credit their source.

05:22.260 --> 05:26.900
At the very least, Watson should credit the Diversity blog for the translation.

05:26.900 --> 05:30.560
Although that might expose how little work he did for this article.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.600
And it might expose something else as well.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.880
Diversity Macht Preu, you can get a sense of what this blog is about by checking out

05:37.880 --> 05:39.880
some of their articles.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.900
There are a few overlaps with Watson's InfoWars work.

05:42.900 --> 05:47.660
We have these two articles about a woman in Germany being pulled over for wearing braids.

05:47.660 --> 05:52.640
The Diversity blog's article was dated January 8th, the Watson article January 9th.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.520
There's an article here about the French Green Party founder saying Europeans should

05:56.520 --> 05:59.160
have less children to make room for migrants.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.760
Diversity blog's article is dated January 4th, Watson's is dated January 11th.

06:03.760 --> 06:09.840
And an article about Germany issuing a manual to schools warning about signs of, according

06:09.840 --> 06:13.080
to Watson's article, right-wing parents.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.840
And according to Diversity blog's article, Nazi parents.

06:16.840 --> 06:22.640
The Diversity blog's article is dated December 4th, the Watson article December 5th.

06:22.640 --> 06:27.680
In many of these cases, Watson, to his credit, does more to build on the story than the Diversity

06:27.680 --> 06:32.160
blog does, enough to make it seem as if he got these stories from somewhere else.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.720
And heck, maybe he did.

06:33.720 --> 06:38.160
It's entirely possible that the Diversity blog and Watson just run in the same circles

06:38.160 --> 06:42.560
and cover a lot of the same stories using similar themes such as the left trying to

06:42.560 --> 06:45.360
destroy Europe via immigration.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.800
Although when it comes to that first article, responding to the Jardin piece, I can't assume

06:50.800 --> 06:52.440
that's just a coincidence.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.640
The articles are way too similar.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.480
One is clearly lifted from the other.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.160
But this isn't just a case of plagiarism.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.680
There's a bit more to that Diversity blog than I've told you so far.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.160
And it's pretty ugly.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.280
While Watson is happy to cover the same stories as the blog when it applies to conservatives

07:11.280 --> 07:15.900
supposedly being under attack in Europe, he doesn't really touch the other stories the

07:15.900 --> 07:18.800
blog pushes out on a regular basis.

07:18.800 --> 07:25.520
Titles with titles such as A Very Jewish Coup, the Plot to Stop Brexit, Rich Muslim

07:25.520 --> 07:32.240
States are hiring Jews to sell Islam to Christians via interfaith institutes.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.080
As Christians celebrate Christmas with their families, Jews fantasize about their saviour

07:37.080 --> 07:39.840
crawling through excrement.

07:39.840 --> 07:44.680
So yeah, this blog is probably run by a Nazi.

07:44.680 --> 07:49.020
And if you need a little more evidence than that, one of the few places that loves to

07:49.020 --> 07:54.960
repost this blog's content happens to be the home for neo-Nazi scum on the internet,

07:54.960 --> 07:57.040
the Daily Stormer.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.400
This is definitely a Nazi's blog.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.400
And the Daily Stormer has had an interesting relationship with Paul Joseph Watson over

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
the years.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.640
In short, they don't like him.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
At all.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.780
Not because they disagree with the vast majority of his talking points, though.

08:11.780 --> 08:17.260
As one 2015 article describes it, Watson is known for ripping off the Daily Stormer

08:17.260 --> 08:21.940
and other pro-white sites and removing Jews from the discussion.

08:21.940 --> 08:26.900
Now if the Daily Stormer said the sky was blue, I'd look out the window to check,

08:26.900 --> 08:30.940
but there's clearly a kinship between Watson and his site.

08:30.940 --> 08:34.320
Watson portrays the Daily Stormer as being hostile towards him.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.940
But this doesn't result from some kind of profound ideological divide.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.980
He says in this tweet they attack him, and that's true.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.540
But only insofar that Watson doesn't quite go far enough to call out their imaginary

08:46.540 --> 08:50.500
menace that's supposedly the source of all the evils in the world.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.020
In this case, it would be the Jewish people.

08:53.020 --> 08:54.660
Which they're obviously wrong about.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.060
Do I have to say that?

08:56.060 --> 08:57.060
Do I have to say they're wrong?

08:57.060 --> 08:58.420
I'm gonna say it anyway.

08:58.420 --> 09:01.220
They're totally wrong about the Jews being fined everything.

09:01.220 --> 09:03.740
That's a hideous conspiracy theory.

09:03.740 --> 09:08.500
Watson's career has largely been spent working for Alex Jones and Infowars.

09:08.500 --> 09:13.740
Infowars' single biggest work is a 2005 book titled Order Out of Chaos, a diatribe

09:13.740 --> 09:17.620
about how the US government was responsible for 9-11.

09:17.620 --> 09:22.940
One telling line within describes briefly how Watson believes the world works, particularly

09:22.940 --> 09:25.900
in how it relates to the Jewish people.

09:25.900 --> 09:31.020
Many people identify Zionism and the expansion of Israel as the head of the New World Order

09:31.020 --> 09:32.060
Hydra.

09:32.060 --> 09:35.740
In reality, Israel is just another tentacle of the beast.

09:35.740 --> 09:39.820
The globalists do not owe allegiance to any particular country.

09:39.820 --> 09:44.380
They will use any nation or movement as muscle to rhyme through their agenda.

09:44.380 --> 09:48.340
So the point of contention between the likes of Watson and Stormfront is simple.

09:48.340 --> 09:53.220
They both believe in the same theory of a group of global elites controlling the world.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.260
Only Watson will claim that the group is exclusively Jewish.

09:56.260 --> 10:02.980
Instead, he sees it as some sort of sinister left-wing cabal that is using identity politics

10:02.980 --> 10:06.260
to, I don't know, make everyone gay, I guess.

10:06.260 --> 10:10.820
What's so frustrating about these commentaries is that they're not completely wrong about

10:10.820 --> 10:15.900
the world being organized in a way that favors a ruling class over all others, but instead

10:15.900 --> 10:20.020
of trying to create a broad international coalition of the people against those who

10:20.020 --> 10:25.100
would oppress them, they either scapegoat a religious minority or pretend that fascism

10:25.100 --> 10:26.660
is going to save us.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.340
These obviously aren't real solutions.

10:29.340 --> 10:34.220
In an article by Nico Hines of The Daily Beast, we got a deep look into Watson's history,

10:34.220 --> 10:37.420
particularly how he got his story ideas in the past.

10:37.420 --> 10:42.200
He's a talented guy in that way, able to spit out these fake news stories very quickly.

10:42.200 --> 10:48.060
This comment comes from Kelly Jones, Alex Jones's ex-wife who previously had a fairly

10:48.060 --> 10:51.380
heavy hand in running the operations of InfoWars.

10:51.380 --> 10:55.920
According to Kelly Jones, much of Watson's prolific career writing for InfoWars would

10:55.920 --> 11:01.440
involve Jones reciting ideas to Watson over the phone, who would then turn them into articles.

11:01.440 --> 11:07.160
If anything, this demonstrates Watson has a history of repackaging the ideas of, well,

11:07.160 --> 11:09.040
unbalanced individuals.

11:09.040 --> 11:13.040
If we want to know what motivates Watson, Kelly Jones can actually offer us a possible

11:13.040 --> 11:19.160
explanation describing her time managing the prison planet, eventually InfoWars, payroll.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.640
Early early on, Paul Watson was making monthly what people make in a year.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.000
We're talking about the kind of money that would drop jaws.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.920
Before I go further, I should mention Watson called this article a hit piece.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.780
Although throughout the article they cite government records and interviews with many

11:34.780 --> 11:39.080
of his former friends and colleagues, that seems quite credible.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.400
Watson's only critique after the article came out was the tweet below.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.840
None of the information Kelly Jones provides has anything to do with knowing Watson personally

11:47.840 --> 11:51.960
and is used to provide context of his working relationship with her husband.

11:51.960 --> 11:57.200
The Daily Beast article suggests, quite strongly, that Watson's intense suspicion about the

11:57.200 --> 12:02.080
government, as seen in his earlier writings, where he pivots to conspiracy theories in

12:02.080 --> 12:08.520
the face of any and all public tragedies, has slowly moved towards a more xenophobic variation.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.200
We can see a great example of Watson's race to a conspiracy theory answer in one of his

12:13.200 --> 12:17.640
early 2015 videos, where he actually came out against Donald Trump.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.480
Donald Trump is a stooge for Hillary Clinton.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.480
He's a plan.

12:21.480 --> 12:26.800
He's a ringer to sink the chances of Republican candidates who actually have a chance of

12:26.800 --> 12:28.360
defeating Hillary.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.720
Watson claimed to have evolved on this issue.

12:31.720 --> 12:36.640
Just how he evolved I think can be more easily summed up in these three tweets.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.800
In the context of Donald Trump threatening military action in Syria off the heels of

12:41.800 --> 12:47.920
a chemical weapon attack, Watson posted these three tweets within a 14 hour period.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.940
I guess Trump wasn't Putin's puppet after all.

12:50.940 --> 12:54.020
He was just another deep state neocon puppet.

12:54.020 --> 12:58.060
I'm officially off the Trump train.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.900
First time I've ever lost Twitter followers.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.780
Interesting.

13:02.780 --> 13:06.700
I am off the Trump train in terms of Syria, which I will criticize.

13:06.700 --> 13:10.180
But I have not turned on Trump, as the media claims.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.380
Fake news.

13:11.380 --> 13:17.340
I suspect the truth of Watson's motivations lie in the second tweet in that little three

13:17.340 --> 13:19.100
act Twitter play.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.700
Watson has an audience, an audience that makes him a lot of money.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.980
He'll say what he needs to, to keep getting paid.

13:25.980 --> 13:30.860
It's difficult to say whether or not Watson is entirely disingenuous, though.

13:30.860 --> 13:34.740
Maybe he flirts with more extreme viewpoints for the financial benefits, but he's certainly

13:34.740 --> 13:39.860
built a career being a conspiracy theorist who doggedly challenges the government, often

13:39.860 --> 13:43.620
with dreadful completely wrongheaded conclusions.

13:43.620 --> 13:48.420
Although Watson may make himself presentable and make a concentrated effort to appear reasonable,

13:48.420 --> 13:52.580
he's still repackaging crackpot commentary as his own.

13:52.580 --> 13:56.900
Whether it's in service to genuinely agreeing with it or to make a quick buck, it doesn't

13:56.900 --> 13:57.900
really matter.
