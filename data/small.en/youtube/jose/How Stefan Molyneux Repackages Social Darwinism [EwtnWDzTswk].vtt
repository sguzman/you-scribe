00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I nearly died watching this video.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.360
Stefan Molyneux promised he would tell me why I hated Trump.

00:08.360 --> 00:15.520
He promised me I had to wait for over 50 minutes before his tedious lecture finally got to

00:15.520 --> 00:16.880
the goddamn point.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.440
So for anyone who wants the spoiler, here it is.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.040
People hate Trump because he's threatening to take away government assistance programs.

00:24.040 --> 00:29.080
There, just saved you an hour and five minutes.

00:29.080 --> 00:33.160
Although when you think about it, that sounds like a leftist critique, doesn't it?

00:33.160 --> 00:37.320
Why did it take Stefan 50 minutes just to get there?

00:37.320 --> 00:40.960
Well that's because leading up to you, he takes you through a reading of history that

00:40.960 --> 00:45.680
mixes up bad science, a love of capitalism, and a touch of racism.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.560
Uh, I mean, race realism?

00:48.560 --> 00:50.600
I think that's what he calls it.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.520
But of course we all know that's just repackaged racism, and if you don't know that, I have

00:54.520 --> 00:58.440
a video of mine you can watch, and that explains the whole thing.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.080
A lot of what Stefan says in his video isn't really new.

01:03.080 --> 01:07.600
Stefan has this shtick where he drones on and on about a variety of topics hitting the

01:07.600 --> 01:09.720
same talking points and tropes.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.960
I once heard advice that if you really believe passionately about something, prepare to be

01:14.960 --> 01:17.120
boring about it.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.160
Stefan has really taken that to heart.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.760
I'm gonna try and not do that with this video though.

01:22.760 --> 01:28.160
I need to mention something that Stefan didn't really bring up in his video, and that's social

01:28.160 --> 01:29.800
Darwinism.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.560
Here's a definition of social Darwinism to get us started.

01:32.560 --> 01:38.040
A 19th century theory, inspired by Darwinism, by which the social order is accounted as

01:38.040 --> 01:43.640
the product of natural selection of those persons best suited to existing living conditions

01:43.640 --> 01:48.400
and in accord with which a position of laissez-faire is advocated.

01:48.400 --> 01:54.480
This theory was used to rationalize the oppression found through imperialism and capitalism prevalent

01:54.480 --> 01:56.160
throughout the last few centuries.

01:56.160 --> 02:01.080
The basic idea behind it is that the British Empire was able to flourish because of their

02:01.080 --> 02:03.400
essential superiority.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.940
That is, they were born to rule, while other races were born to serve.

02:08.940 --> 02:16.480
Or as Stefan would put it, some people are naturally more capable and others less capable.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.920
The origins of social Darwinism can be traced back to English philosopher Herbert Spencer

02:20.920 --> 02:24.040
and his conception of society as a social organism.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.880
In Spencer's estimation, society, like an organism, needs to change and evolve on

02:28.880 --> 02:32.520
its own without the onerous hand of a government.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.040
Although often attributed to Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection, the term

02:37.040 --> 02:43.080
survival of the fittest was actually coined by Spencer, writing in his 1864 work Principles

02:43.080 --> 02:48.360
of Biology, where he adapted Darwin's recently published theory into his own framework.

02:48.360 --> 02:53.240
You may have noticed I said adapted because, even though Spencer's work was called social

02:53.240 --> 02:58.520
Darwinism, his theory of the social organism predates Darwin's theory by nearly a decade.

02:58.520 --> 03:04.000
Back then, Lamarckian evolution was the leading theory on why different species exist.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.520
As a quick sidebar, Lamarckian evolution is the idea that our offspring inherit the traits

03:08.520 --> 03:10.240
we acquire throughout our lives.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.640
So, for example, a physically fit couple who got in shape through exercise will pass on

03:15.640 --> 03:18.560
that physical fitness to their baby.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.240
You can see this idea of evolution manifest itself in the anime Dragon Ball, where Goku's

03:23.240 --> 03:28.560
sons Gohan and Goten have different power levels at age 6 because Goku had gotten stronger

03:28.560 --> 03:30.640
in between the time of their conceptions.

03:30.640 --> 03:35.680
And if this sounds completely idiotic to you, that's because it should.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.760
It doesn't make any sense, because that's not how genes work.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.080
Back to Spencer.

03:41.080 --> 03:46.480
An earlier version of his social organism theory can be read in his 1851 work Social

03:46.480 --> 03:51.400
Statics, published 8 years before Darwin's On the Origin of Species.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.520
And it shows the Lamarckian roots of Spencer's theory.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.280
Here he's basically talking about how society can evolve by shedding some of its weaker

04:00.280 --> 04:07.600
members and instead focusing on more of its, as Stefan might put it, capable people.

04:07.600 --> 04:13.360
It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death.

04:13.360 --> 04:19.800
Nevertheless, when regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal

04:19.800 --> 04:25.160
humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence, the

04:25.160 --> 04:30.720
same beneficence that brings to early graves the children of diseased parents and singles

04:30.720 --> 04:39.200
out the low-spirited, the intemperate, and the debilitated as the victims of an epidemic.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.360
I wouldn't take this guy as a moral instructor, basically.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.840
I would see him as a fucking maniac, Jesus.

04:44.840 --> 04:49.320
If we look further in history, we can actually see Social Darwinism's roots go back even

04:49.320 --> 04:54.960
further than the disturbing psychopathic rants of Spencer.

04:54.960 --> 05:00.000
Here's a rather telling quote from slightly before his time.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.720
One writer compared the extermination of these races by white settlers as being like the

05:06.720 --> 05:11.960
melting of snow before the advancing rays of the sun.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.440
Oh yeah, that was pretty rough.

05:15.440 --> 05:23.080
As best I can tell, that quote is slightly paraphrased from the writings of Alexis de

05:23.080 --> 05:26.240
Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont.

05:26.240 --> 05:31.280
These are taken from writings about their travels through America in the very early

05:31.280 --> 05:35.680
19th century, where they witnessed the effects of colonialism first hand.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.440
We can probably travel back even further and find more examples of people being assholes

05:40.440 --> 05:43.320
to the poor and to different races.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.960
But Social Darwinism's origins have less to do with Darwin's theory and more to do

05:47.960 --> 05:52.960
with assholes who believed in the superiority of their race or class.

05:52.960 --> 05:59.440
Their misappropriation of science was an effort to give that form of discrimination some legitimacy.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.600
The marriage of this hatred with Darwin's new theory via Spencer and other Social Darwinists

06:04.600 --> 06:06.560
was fashionable in the 19th century.

06:06.560 --> 06:11.400
I'm going to go back to that BBC doc I showed you a few moments ago to explain it more succinctly

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
than I can.

06:13.400 --> 06:21.480
But evolution also suggested that there had to be losers in this great cosmic process

06:21.480 --> 06:27.600
and the losers were those peoples who could not compete.

06:27.600 --> 06:33.760
And once put into competition with superior races were doomed to disappear.

06:33.760 --> 06:39.240
And this was likely to happen to all the native peoples in North America and the Pacific

06:39.240 --> 06:41.920
and in Africa.

06:41.920 --> 06:47.080
Across the world, the crimes of imperialism now came to be taken as proof that the Social

06:47.080 --> 06:51.720
Darwinists were right.

06:51.720 --> 06:56.760
Social Darwinism went on to be a strong rationalization for the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism,

06:56.760 --> 07:01.760
a form of capitalism that insists the system works best when the government does as little

07:01.760 --> 07:03.960
as possible to intervene.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.520
If workers were exploited and owners were getting fat off profits, this was explained

07:08.520 --> 07:12.120
through the lens of Social Darwinism as the natural order.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.480
Stefan, as most other Social Darwinists, take the position that the inferior people, or

07:18.480 --> 07:23.220
less capable people, will be less successful at passing on their genes.

07:23.220 --> 07:28.160
That is, at least according to Stefan, until communism showed up and started demanding

07:28.160 --> 07:33.720
that the damn government step in with its social programs like education and healthcare

07:33.720 --> 07:39.440
just to make sure these damn poor people who are less capable would survive and have a

07:39.440 --> 07:41.960
higher quality of life, I guess.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.480
Makes one wonder why these inferior people are still with us if they should have been

07:45.480 --> 07:48.560
bred out of the population so long ago.

07:48.560 --> 07:53.640
Stefan's logic goes, people who hate Trump are afraid that their social programs will

07:53.640 --> 07:59.580
go away, and the reason they need those social programs is because they are genetically inferior.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.980
In other words, he's repackaged Social Darwinism and doesn't have the courtesy to tip his

08:03.980 --> 08:09.900
hat to Herbert Spencer, Thomas Huxley, William Grant Sumner, and all the other Social Darwinists

08:09.900 --> 08:10.900
of the past.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.900
What a dick.

08:11.900 --> 08:17.680
Although I guess if he's a dick, he really is living up to their legacy.

08:17.680 --> 08:22.000
And to clarify one thing here, not all visions of Social Darwinism are the same, I'm giving

08:22.000 --> 08:23.800
you a very brief overview here.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.860
Some Social Darwinists were believers in imperialism, others not so much.

08:28.860 --> 08:32.600
If you're curious though, one book that's been recommended by more well-read people

08:32.600 --> 08:38.080
on the subject than me is Richard Hofstetter's Social Darwinism in American Thought.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.240
It was published in the 1950s, but considering this is a 19th century ideology, it's still

08:43.240 --> 08:44.960
pretty applicable.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.800
So why is Social Darwinism wrong?

08:47.800 --> 08:52.320
Social Darwinists will use the mantra of survival of the fittest, but evolution is

08:52.320 --> 08:59.080
actually more accurately survival of the most adaptable, which is not nearly as catchy unfortunately.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.960
Let's use cats as an example, because eh, the internet loves cats, right?

09:02.960 --> 09:08.240
So when we think of the most evolved, so to speak, of cats, you might think of the biggest

09:08.240 --> 09:13.580
and baddest one out there, the tiger, and yes it's the tiger, shut the fuck up lion people.

09:13.580 --> 09:18.780
But interestingly, a far more successful hunter is this little guy, the black-footed

09:18.780 --> 09:19.780
cat.

09:19.780 --> 09:25.300
See here on video it's so cute, oh god it's so fucking cute, oh I can't, oh my god I

09:25.300 --> 09:31.200
want one of these so much, they're wild animals, they deserve to be free and ugh.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.660
It's one of the smallest cats in the wild, and while there is some slight concern to

09:34.660 --> 09:38.660
its welfare as a species, it's generally thought to be in pretty good shape, or at

09:38.660 --> 09:42.520
the very least, it's in far better shape than the tiger.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.520
This adorable cat survives not because it's the biggest, strongest one out there, but

09:47.520 --> 09:50.600
because it's adapted to its environment successfully.

09:50.600 --> 09:55.640
As a small side note though, while tigers may be less successful hunters than the black-footed

09:55.640 --> 09:59.920
cat, I need to stress that the only reason they're threatened as a species is because

09:59.920 --> 10:05.360
of the invasive homo sapiens who are taking up its space and in some cases killing them?

10:05.360 --> 10:09.840
No shade to the tigers, you guys are, you guys are the fucking best.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.720
Nothing comes in all shapes and sizes, and there is no hierarchy in evolution.

10:13.720 --> 10:19.440
Nothing is more or less evolved than the other, things only need to be able to reproduce,

10:19.440 --> 10:23.360
and from an evolutionary standpoint, that's really all that matters.

10:23.360 --> 10:29.240
Now when you think about it, we've all, and I say we as in all organisms living on this

10:29.240 --> 10:34.160
planet, have been evolving for the same amount of time, so a single-celled organism isn't

10:34.160 --> 10:40.080
any more or less evolved than a human because single-celled organisms are still reproducing,

10:40.080 --> 10:43.400
they're still pretty successful, they're all over the place.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.860
Here's the real kicker though, unlike that example I used above of the two cats, it turns

10:47.860 --> 10:52.440
out human beings are all part of a single species.

10:52.440 --> 10:57.000
Implicit in the idea of social Darwinism is that human beings can be divided into different

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
groups.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.200
In this particular case, it would be different races and classes.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.960
I've already talked about the arbitrary nature of race, but can class be explained by genetic

11:05.960 --> 11:07.440
differences?

11:07.440 --> 11:08.440
Turns out, no.

11:08.440 --> 11:14.320
In a paper titled, Genetics in Social Class by Dr. N. A. Holtzman from Genetics and Public

11:14.320 --> 11:19.680
Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins Medical, he concludes that the roots of social class differences

11:19.680 --> 11:22.080
do not lie in our genes.

11:22.080 --> 11:27.120
Consequently, genetics cannot be used as a justification for maintaining a ruling class,

11:27.120 --> 11:32.600
limiting procreation among the poor, or minimizing social support programs.

11:32.600 --> 11:36.880
The difficulty of class mobility being reduced to genetic weakness is a way of rationalizing

11:36.880 --> 11:41.720
the inequalities that are created and reinforced by a system that keeps the rich rich and the

11:41.720 --> 11:43.240
poor poor.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.560
Reading between the lines of Stefan's argument of more capable and less capable humans, we

11:48.560 --> 11:52.520
can see that this is just a way for him to pretend that the differences in social standings

11:52.520 --> 11:56.280
between races and classes are part of the natural order.

11:56.280 --> 12:00.800
Stefan has made the mistake of assuming that the way something is is the way it ought to

12:00.800 --> 12:02.320
be.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.920
That's conservatism in a nutshell, really.

12:05.920 --> 12:11.880
Imagine if someone had said that about, I don't know, slavery or women having the right

12:11.880 --> 12:14.260
to vote.

12:14.260 --> 12:19.240
Another problem for Stefan is that he's looking at the present without thinking of the history

12:19.240 --> 12:23.320
as also a series of present moments.

12:23.360 --> 12:28.040
If we chose a different point of history and used his perspective, you could actually come

12:28.040 --> 12:30.440
up with a completely different conclusion.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.680
Imagine if you were in the 13th or 14th century.

12:33.680 --> 12:39.040
You could argue that the Mongolians were the superior race because the Mongol Empire controlled

12:39.040 --> 12:43.560
most of Asia and was one of the largest empires in human history.

12:43.560 --> 12:49.540
In the 7th and 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate was enormous and was the largest single entity

12:49.540 --> 12:54.100
controlling the highly coveted Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.620
Were the people of the Umayyad Caliphate the superior race?

12:57.620 --> 13:03.780
The Han Dynasty of the, uh, Otts, I guess, were at the helm of a massive and powerful

13:03.780 --> 13:05.060
Chinese empire.

13:05.060 --> 13:10.220
If we were in that point of history, were the Han Chinese the superior race?

13:10.220 --> 13:15.900
You can say that all those empires faded away and were displaced by others later on, but

13:15.900 --> 13:19.780
how can you possibly say that that would never happen again?

13:19.780 --> 13:24.500
What makes white people so special that their empire will be the last one?

13:24.500 --> 13:29.180
The British might have thought that their empire was the greatest of all time, and now

13:29.180 --> 13:35.060
it pales in comparison to what the United States is capable of doing with its pseudo-empire.

13:35.060 --> 13:40.260
And for the record, I would certainly agree that the rise of an empire is influenced in

13:40.260 --> 13:46.900
a small way by the genes of the empire builders, because all people are products of their genes

13:46.900 --> 13:53.100
in society, but you can extrapolate the personalities and characteristics of imperialists to anyone

13:53.100 --> 13:55.180
with the same skin color.

13:55.180 --> 14:00.500
History teaches us quite clearly that all peoples are capable of creating empires.

14:00.500 --> 14:06.040
That doesn't mean it's natural for one race to supplant another, it just means sometimes

14:06.040 --> 14:10.680
assholes can exploit broken systems to attain power and abuse it.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.760
Which brings us back to Donald Trump.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.680
You don't need Stephon Molyneux's half-assed babble to tell you why you hate Trump.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.560
Anyone who hates him can probably tell you why themselves.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.560
Personally, I hate Trump's misogyny.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.560
I don't even know what.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.560
And when you're a star, they let you do it.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
You can do anything.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
Whatever you want.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
Grab them by the pussy.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
I can do anything.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.600
Racism, xenophobia.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.120
Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here, referring to African

14:39.120 --> 14:42.820
countries and Haiti, the president then went on to talk about how they needed to bring

14:42.820 --> 14:45.240
in more people from places like Norway.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
