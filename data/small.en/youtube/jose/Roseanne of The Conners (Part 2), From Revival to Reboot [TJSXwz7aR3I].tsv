0	4480	In my first video, I went into detail about the leftist politics that are often on display
4480	9280	throughout much of the first nine seasons of Roseanne. If you haven't watched my video,
9280	14480	maybe give it a shot. Much like the series itself, it ended on an unsatisfying note with no meaningful
14480	19520	conclusion. Aside from that, working class people are constantly getting crushed in a system that
19520	24320	isn't designed to help them. This important message was brought to us by a woman who acted
24320	29120	like the dictator of her show. It's one of the many contradictions of Roseanne Barr and her TV
29120	33840	series, and one that a viewer such as myself struggles with. Can we salvage something of the
33840	38880	Roseanne show in the face of Roseanne Barr's general awfulness, and truly have a show about
38880	45680	the working class made by people who, as far as we know, aren't shitty? Can the TV sensibilities
45680	50560	of the past still have something to say in the modern day? We add an indirect answer to that
50560	56640	question when ABC brought back Roseanne for its 10th season in 2018. But before we get to that,
56640	60480	let's have a quick catch-up with the cast of Roseanne before that 10th season revival.
63760	68640	One of the true tragedies following the ending of season 9 of the series was the death of actor
68640	75280	Glenn Quinn, who played Mark Healy. He passed away in 2002 of a drug overdose at the age of 32.
75280	79920	Although he wouldn't be a part of the show's revival in 2018, the character was not recast,
79920	85680	and the character of Mark died between seasons 9 and 10. Darlene's son was given the name Mark
85680	90800	in honor of him. In that 20-year gap, Roseanne Barr became increasingly well-known for her
90800	96480	political commentary, even running for president under the Green Party banner in 2012. In 2011,
96480	101520	Barr reflected on her time in television in an article for Vulture, commenting briefly on the
101520	107360	possibility of a Roseanne reboot. Hollywood hates labor, and hates shows about labor worse than any
107360	113200	other thing, and that's why you won't be seeing another Roseanne anytime soon. Instead, all over
113200	119680	the tube, you'll find enterprising, over-medicated, painted-up capitalist whores claiming to be housewives.
119680	125520	But I'm not bitter. While that might make her sound like a darling Anne Cap, she isn't quite the ally
125520	130240	most on the left would be looking for. Here's some comments she had about the trans community.
130240	135120	She also spoke to a number of right-wing conspiracy theories, from Pizzagate to the supposedly
135120	141280	suspicious murder of Seth Rich. And of course, her support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election
141280	147200	is well-documented. Many of these noxious tweets have since been deleted. Sarah Gilbert, who played
147200	152880	Darlene, had some success of her own by creating the TV daytime talk show The Talk for CBS.
152880	156320	It was on that show she had a brief reunion with John Goodman.
156320	162720	Um, god, I don't know how to say this. I'm a talk show host.
164000	168480	It was this short clip that would eventually lead to the series being revived on ABC for a 10th
168480	174640	season, 20 years later. The cast was reunited, and it seemed like all of America was ready to
174640	181920	forgive, forget, or in some cases celebrate Roseanne's rather curious political leanings,
181920	187440	all in an effort to warmly welcome the return of one of the biggest sitcoms of the 90s.
187440	192320	For the previous nine seasons, I've been trying to find some sort of value or meaning that a viewer
192320	198080	can discover within them. Season 10 takes the characters and context of those seasons and brings
198080	202800	them all the way into the present. But does this show exist carrying the baggage of the past,
202800	206960	or does that baggage make it something more than a show starting from scratch,
206960	210320	and can it escape the shadow of its titular star, Roseanne?
210320	228400	In the first episode of season 10, 20 years to life, we are reintroduced to most of the familiar
228400	233600	faces from the show. Dan and Roseanne are in old age, still struggling to get by, Becky works as
233600	238560	a waitress for a Mexican restaurant, Darlene, after losing her job in Chicago, is forced to
238560	243360	move back in with her parents, now a single mother with two kids, Harris and Mark. DJ,
243360	247520	a veteran home from fighting in the Middle East, struggles to pay his bills and raise his daughter
247520	253920	Mary. His wife, Gina, is still deployed in Syria. And Jackie is still single, trying to find someone
253920	258560	to love her. A few serious regulars have cameos throughout the season, updating us all on their
258560	262560	whereabouts, but in most cases they seem to be right where we left them 20 years ago, struggling
262560	267440	to survive in a town where the rules seem written for people who aren't them, likely informed by
267440	271440	Roseanne Barr's political profile. The first episode runs into the political commentaries
271440	276720	whether Jackie and Roseanne haven't been speaking since the 2016 election that put Donald Trump into
276720	282320	the White House. As you may have noticed, in that nearly one hour and 20 minutes I spent rambling
282320	286880	about the first nine seasons, I never mentioned the characters delving into partisan politics,
286880	292480	largely because they didn't. Taken from an interview in 1992, Barr told the LA Times that
292480	296720	when it comes to the politics of the Conner family, they're somewhere in the middle of it all,
296720	301600	not knowing what anything stands for anymore. So really, what they do is go to work and come
301600	306720	to be with their family and try to make do. Even the Conners aren't spared the burden of partisanship
306720	311920	in 2018, and this partisanship was what brought the show a lot of attention. Its first episode was
311920	316720	a breakout success, and it seemed like Roseanne was set for another run at the top of primetime,
316720	323440	or might have been if 2018 was as tolerant of those stars' eccentricities as the 1990s have been.
323440	328960	The first thing I noticed in this first episode of Roseanne's tenth season is the passage of time,
328960	334000	not just the faces of the actors, but the very production of the show. Multi-camera sitcoms
334000	339280	filmed in front of a live studio audience are increasingly rare, most opt for the single-camera
339280	343520	style you would see on a drama series. Roseanne stays true to its roots, though, with a loving
343520	347920	recreation of all the sights of the old Conner home. It's as though these characters have been
347920	353280	living this endless loop of their hopeless sitcom lives for the past 20 years. But the subtext
353280	357920	here isn't that the Conners' lives are still sorted, but rather the lives of the working class
357920	362320	are still desperate. We can smile nostalgically at how nothing has changed for the Conners,
362320	366080	but applying the same truth to the people they represent is heartbreaking.
366800	371840	Although now in old age, a new host of problems present themselves, like a lack of healthcare.
383280	393120	There are also strange new problems that aren't really problems, such as not really
393120	411760	understanding a non-gender conforming grandson. The generational split from the earlier seasons
411760	415600	is even more pronounced, and with a third generation in the mix, more than ever we get
415600	438800	a sense of how old and out of date Roseanne and Dan are. Things are brought into sharper focus when
438800	444880	we find out Becky, desperate for cash, is going to be a surrogate for, well, the other Becky,
444880	451360	although she's playing a new character, Andrea, in this season. The payment of $50,000 is too much
451360	456000	for Becky to ignore, and we get an interesting callback to an earlier episode, where a woman's
456000	460240	body is her choice, regardless of, in this case, what her father may think.
468800	489440	It's a reminder of how, even though the Conners are older and less in step with modern discourse,
489440	494880	they aren't completely hopeless. That said, the show genuinely seems to be asking the question
494880	500400	if there's anything they can still say that's of value. Dan's frustration is symbolic of that,
500400	505760	that the old relic he is no longer has a say in how the world works. To be honest, he never had
505760	510320	much of a say in the old show, but he did carry weight and authority, as father typically does.
511040	516960	Roseanne's acquiescence was also huge, letting Becky decide for herself, even if later on she
516960	521520	admitted she really didn't want her to be a surrogate. Just watching the show feels like
521520	526160	slipping back in time, but what part do we want to go back to? And more importantly, how can
526160	531200	revisiting the past help us in the present? Let's do a quick comparison between season 10 and an
531200	536400	episode from the original run of the series. Back in season 3, the episode Trick or Treat includes
536400	541680	some interesting gender bedding, as DJ wants to dress as a witch for Halloween, and Roseanne
541680	545360	dresses up as a man. We do get her a few revealing lines from Dan.
551520	577280	And this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Dan's anxiety about his son's
577280	584480	masculinity. He's worried about it. That said, they do resolve it nicely by the end of the show.
591520	596240	But overall, particularly the scenes with Roseanne, this episode feels like a missed
596240	601120	opportunity. We get a sampling of the violence and toxic masculinity, but it's hidden behind
601120	606560	far too many cheap jokes about men's bathroom habits. Season 10's take on the issue of not
606560	612800	being gender conforming is different. In Dress to Impress, Mark's dressing up in traditionally
612800	618560	female clothing makes Dan and Roseanne concerned. We have a surprisingly sweet scene between
618560	625280	grandmother and grandson. Okay, I'm gonna ask you something kind of adult, but you're growing up and
625280	634560	I think you can handle it. Do you feel like you're a boy or a girl? A boy? Well, you answered that
634560	642560	pretty quick. I thought it was going to be more complicated. So what's up with the girl's clothes?
643200	647120	This just feels like me. I like colors that pop. It's more creative.
649760	656320	Well, your mom's creative, so I get that, but here's the thing. You've got to pick your fights
656320	665120	in life. How important is this to you? It's important. Okay. Well, you know it's going to
665120	675520	be rough on you at school, right? But we'll back you up. Dan's advice of giving Mark a knife does
675520	680960	less good. So you admit it. You were trying to make it more masculine. When did masculine become
680960	687680	a dirty word? And no, I'm not. I'm scared for him. If I don't get what's going on, what do you
687680	692240	think a classroom full of 10 year olds from Lanford is going to do? But Mark proves surprisingly
692240	698160	resilient. But if things get rough, I put pants and a t-shirt in your backpack and you know what?
698160	706160	You're still going to be you. No, I won't. I'm fine, Mom. Well, what if that kid teases you again or
706160	712320	pushes you down or something? He'll get tired of it eventually. I like my clothes. In some ways,
712320	717200	it's refreshing to see a kid who can so effectively stand up for himself. That said,
717920	723600	what precisely does Mark need from his grandparents? He has support from his mother and proves how
723600	727840	strong he already is. Note that some of that toughness is a Connor trait inherited from his
727840	732160	grandparents, but a trait that doesn't need shaping the way it needed shaping in Becky,
732160	736400	Darlene, and DJ. If anything, the show is addressing the older people in the audience,
736400	741680	telling them that non-gender conformity is okay and the real problem is the kids who tease Mark.
741680	746480	In other words, the social pressure. The original series never escaped the gender binary,
746480	751040	and season 10 doesn't quite get away from that either. That said, it does at least delve into
751040	755440	the idea that gender norms are performative and lets a child explore those boundaries in a way
755440	760240	where it isn't him learning his place in the world, but his world learning how to accept him.
760240	764320	In the original run of the series, though, being non-gender conforming is a part of a holiday
764320	768560	tradition. When it comes to wearing those non-gender conforming clothes every day,
768560	773120	that's a tougher bridge to cross for Roseanne and Dan. I think the progression seen in these
773120	778080	episodes is pretty neat. It shows how society can take steps forward quicker than people,
778080	782080	and that isn't always the bad thing. While it doesn't make Roseanne and Dan monsters for
782080	786000	falling behind the times, it definitely shows us that they're out of touch with what their
786000	790720	grandchildren need to be happy. It also doesn't completely discard their experiences as old
790720	795120	fogeys. They knew Mark would be teased, and they wanted to help. They just didn't know how to do
795120	800720	it. In Roseanne Gets the Chair, we get even more extreme parenting advice from Roseanne when Harris
800720	805680	is shown to be completely walking all over Darlene. And this time, it's kinda messed up.
816000	844720	Let's go back to the original run of the series for a moment. In the Season 6 episode,
844720	850400	The Driver's Seat, this episode includes a plotline where DJ steals Roseanne's car
850400	855600	and gets caught by the cops. Roseanne's reaction is pretty dark.
904720	913440	I'm really sorry that I hit you, DJ. I was totally wrong. I never should have done that.
913440	915680	I'm so mad at myself for doing it.
934720	941440	Mad and, you know, kind of embarrassed. Wrong.
944160	951120	Lots of way that I used to feel when I got hit. Who hit you?
953600	960640	Your grandpa hit me. A lot. What'd you do wrong?
960640	966720	I mean, I breathed or something. Do you hate him?
971520	979360	Yes, sometimes. You know, because the worst thing was that, you know, he never,
979360	985840	ever said he was sorry for any of it, you know. I don't want you to hit me,
985840	992320	DJ. I'm really sorry that I hit you. No matter what, I'm never gonna hit you again, ever.
993280	995760	No matter what I do? No matter what you do, ever.
997840	1005440	I'm sorry you got hit. I'm sorry you got hit, too. I mean, big sorry.
1007440	1012000	Right now would be a great time to ask me for a new puppy's kind of sorry.
1012480	1018720	This episode really demonstrated the cycle of abuse and how victims can still be capable of abuse
1018720	1023760	themselves. There were several episodes that documented Roseanne Connor's abuse at the hands
1023760	1028400	of her father that I didn't get to touch on in my first video, but it's an important bit of context
1028400	1034080	that sadly gets lost in season 10. This season 10 revival of Roseanne supposedly has the old
1034080	1039360	working-class ethics revived in it, but in this episode we see some real abuse of her granddaughter.
1039360	1043840	Is this really the Roseanne Connor from earlier seasons, or is this the Trump supporting
1043840	1049280	reimagining of what she was? This moment reminds me of the strange rebranding of Roseanne as a
1049280	1054160	conservative hero. Sure, she was a dreadful person in the 90s, but unless she was full of shit with
1054160	1058880	her critiques of how the government and society left the working class behind, she obviously
1058880	1063760	wasn't a member of the right. The character of Roseanne was heartbroken when she hit DJ, but
1063760	1068160	now she's willing to hold her granddaughter's head underwater, have the perceptions of the
1068160	1072160	writers of Roseanne Barr being on the right colored their perspective of the character of
1072160	1076560	Roseanne Connor. Well, people parent differently than they did in your day. Turns out a lot of
1076560	1082720	what you did did not work, and some of it was against the law. Yeah, it's against the law
1082720	1088560	because your generation made everything so PC. Instead of spanking them, you tell them to go
1088560	1094240	over there and think about what they did wrong. You know what they're thinking? I can't believe
1094240	1100480	this loser isn't spanking me. We get a conclusion to the Becky surrogate storyline when we tragically
1100480	1107840	learn that Becky is too old to have children in Eggs Over Not Easy, which is just a cruel title
1107840	1113520	to be honest. Even with interventions, I'd say you have less than a five percent chance of ever
1113520	1120960	getting pregnant. I know you've both been looking forward to this, I'm sorry. It coalesces into a
1120960	1126880	hard truth about Becky's life these past 20 years. I don't know if you can see yourself frozen in
1126880	1132720	the same place since Mark died, but everybody else can. I wouldn't have changed anything.
1134320	1143040	I can't have kids. You said you didn't want kids. I thought I had more time. Was 50 grand really
1143040	1147200	going to change Becky's life forever? Probably would have gotten her a few years if she were
1147200	1152080	lucky. Things don't magically get better when someone gives you a bit of extra money. What Becky
1152080	1157360	really needs is a change to her life, a change to the world she lives in where she can find a way
1157360	1162960	of surviving without having to be some sort of baby machine, a subtle bit of commentary about
1162960	1167120	the role of women in our society and how their worth is determined based on whether or not they
1167120	1172560	can squeeze out a baby. On the lighter side for a moment, this episode also reminds us that John
1172560	1177600	Goodman is fantastic with physical comedy. Look at the expression on his face here.
1202560	1216640	In Go Cubs, the Conners, Roseanne in particular, are confronted with Muslim neighbors,
1216640	1221120	Samir and Fatima. It's here we get one of those episodes where the Conners are faced with their
1221120	1228080	own bigotry, but in a way that's less subtle than previous episode. Roseanne seems especially racist.
1228080	1232080	What if this is a sleeper cell full of terrorists getting ready to blow up our neighborhood?
1232160	1236960	This is what people from Iraq and Taliban just stand do.
1238880	1243040	They hide out in neighborhoods like Lanford. Don't you watch the news?
1244400	1248480	Her opinion changes when she encounters her neighbor at a grocery store.
1248480	1256880	It says insufficient funds. You're $30 short. Um, I didn't know. Sorry, maybe the American
1256880	1265040	taxpayers forgot to fill it up last week. Excuse me? I'm an American taxpayer sometimes.
1266400	1273280	Put it on my EBT card. You don't need to do that. Well, we're stealing your cable,
1273280	1279120	so this probably makes us even. Maybe you can help her carry the groceries out to her camel too.
1279120	1292400	Roseanne's growth happens less in a moment of self-reflection and more in a moment of empathy
1292400	1297040	when she sees what bigotry looks like. Unlike the complicated and messy bigotry of the earlier
1297040	1303120	seasons, in episodes like White Man Can't Kiss, this story is straightforward. Bigotry like this
1303120	1307120	certainly exists, and there's certainly no harm in showing Roseanne changing her way when she
1307120	1312000	observes it, but in some ways this feels more old-fashioned than the Roseanne episodes of 20
1312000	1316400	years earlier, the few that dared to tackle the issue to begin with. Some interesting behind the
1316400	1321040	scenes commentary for this episode is that the idea of giving Roseanne Connor Muslim neighbors
1321040	1325920	apparently came from Barr herself. On the other hand, one of the former writers of the Roseanne
1325920	1332800	series speaking anonymously to Buzzfeed said, I don't recognize that character. I believe the
1332800	1338560	original character would have said, who cares about having Muslim neighbors? And now she's
1338560	1343920	saying she does care. This might be another case of Roseanne Barr's Trump support being projected
1343920	1349200	onto the character of Roseanne Connor. As a sharper point of comparison, the third season
1349200	1353600	brought us the Bowman's wealthy neighbors who also moved in across the street from the Connors.
1353840	1356320	Your living room reminds me of ours.
1358720	1363200	Well, I'm not quite finished with it yet. The tension between Roseanne and Kathy Bowman is
1363200	1368640	immediate, as Kathy is incapable of accepting the living conditions of her working-class neighborhood.
1368640	1373840	This episode, like other episodes that include the Bowman's, highlight the class differences that
1373840	1378720	animate what the series was about. It's no coincidence that the hostility to the Connors
1378720	1383680	come from right outside their home, as if the society right outside their doors against them,
1383680	1389200	and the only comfort they can have is within their happy little home. Well, happy being a relative
1389200	1394560	term. In season 10, the roles have been reversed. The Connor household is where the hostility is
1394560	1399200	coming from, and it takes the shape of prejudice towards their neighbors based on their ethnicity.
1400400	1405280	In some ways, this feels like a microcosm of what the original nine seasons of the series missed.
1405280	1410320	It was very good at pointing out the snobbery of the upper class, a la Kathy Bowman, but when it
1410320	1415360	came to the racial bigotry of the Connors, it was relegated to a handful of episodes, and often
1415360	1419920	struggled to really grasp where the other side was coming from. In many ways, it highlights how
1419920	1424720	a white working-class family is a great setting for discussions about class, but less so for ones
1424720	1439520	about race. So, actually, Roseanne. I'm going to have to disagree on that one. The eighth episode,
1439520	1444320	Netflix and Pill, delves into Roseanne's pain pill addiction. She had been suffering a bad
1444320	1448400	knee all season, and this episode reveals she had been hiding pills all over the house.
1454800	1459040	The champagne on the Vicodin should say, do not take it with label.
1461920	1464320	But the good news is, my knees are gone.
1466640	1470960	How did you possibly have taken more Vicodin? I didn't even get the prescription yet.
1470960	1476160	Well, you better get on it, because my secret bottles are running low.
1478240	1482400	You don't have any idea how bad it hurts. Yeah, I do. I get a bad back.
1482400	1486880	And when your back goes out, you lay on the couch for two weeks, and I wait on you hand and foot.
1486880	1491760	You know what happens when my knee hurts? I do the cleaning, the shopping, the cooking.
1491760	1496320	Fine, I'll do all that. Just show me where the water bucket is and the sponge on the stick thingy.
1497280	1501680	Roseanne's addiction is a product of their poverty, not being able to afford knee surgery.
1501680	1505920	It's a portrait of addiction that also doesn't blame the addict, and shows how people are driven
1505920	1510480	into it not because of loose morals, but desperation. It sums up what the show has
1510480	1514640	always tried to be about, whether we relate to the Conners directly or we're getting a glimpse
1514640	1519360	of the people we may have looked down on. Either way, we're confronted with people in shitty
1519360	1524400	situations that aren't of their own making. They're people making do as best they can with what
1524400	1530160	they've got. In the final episode of season 10, and consequently of Roseanne, knee deep,
1530160	1535360	a flood hits Lanford and the cost of repairing the foundation drove Dan to hire illegal immigrants
1535360	1540800	in an effort to win a bid on a drywall job, leaving his longtime friend Chuck out in the cold.
1565600	1571200	What do you want me to do? I got three extra mouths to feed since Darlene moved back in.
1572240	1576320	Roseanne started popping pills because we didn't have the money to fix her knee,
1576320	1583840	and now I got 20 grand of water damage. I spent my whole life hanging on by my fingertips telling
1583840	1589520	everybody not to worry that I was going to make it okay because that's my job. Well, now I can't
1589520	1596160	promise that anymore. So yeah, it makes me sick, but I'm going to do whatever I have to do to take
1596160	1603040	care of my family because I'm old, I'm tired, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on.
1605680	1613840	Well, I'm old too, and I'm tired, and now I'm unemployed. I always told you, if I'm eating,
1613840	1620160	you're eating. I'm not eating. As the family is pushed closer to financial ruin, they're saved
1620160	1625200	when the president declares a state of emergency, which means a FEMA program that will help cover
1625200	1632000	the damages. You have young children rooting for other people's misery. He just declared it!
1638240	1642560	With that problem mostly solved, Roseanne can finally go under the knife for knee surgery,
1642560	1647360	and the Connors get the chance to enjoy a meal together, their last meal, at least under the
1647360	1653600	banner of Roseanne. The series ends in a low-key way, almost as if they were expected another
1653600	1658480	season. A broken-off series can feel incomplete, but does Roseanne's story really feel like it's
1658480	1664880	missing pages? She had 10 seasons of stories, even with an abbreviated tenth. Old problems are joined
1664880	1670560	by new ones, and anything that's solved never lasts. The Connors are in some ways the victims
1670560	1676240	of the TV culture Roseanne parodied in its original run. They can never change, or else
1676240	1681520	we'd stop caring about them. It's also what makes them feel real, the same way we rarely ascend from
1681520	1686880	our own circumstances. Working class stays working class, and the series shows that it's not because
1686880	1691200	they're shitty people, but they're in a society that doesn't really give a shit about them.
1691920	1696560	The sudden end of the series came on May 29th when Roseanne Barr made a racist comment about
1696640	1702320	one of President Obama's senior advisors, Valerie Jarrett. The Roseanne show was cancelled hours
1702320	1722960	later. Her defense for her actions was… well… Following this video, the next day she released
1722960	1727680	an official statement, filmed in the same setting with a more tranquil Roseanne. In longer
1727680	1732080	interviews she would place the blame more squarely on her ambient usage influencing her.
1732080	1754080	I'm not sure if she said the same for the many other incendiary tweets she's made over the years.
1754080	1759600	Barr's castmates immediately turned on her as one would if someone tweeted out a racist insult.
1759600	1764000	With that tweet, Roseanne was able to do something very special for one of the questions I asked at
1764000	1769200	the beginning of this video. Can we have a socially conscious show like Roseanne, but without
1769200	1776320	Roseanne Barr herself? The answer so far is… kind of. And it comes in the form of The Conners.
1776320	1789760	In the months that followed Barr's exit, rumors swirled about a new show focusing on Darlene
1789760	1794560	Connor. Darlene's importance in higher profile in season 10 seemed to set the stage quite nicely,
1794560	1800240	but ultimately what we got was the more neutral title of The Conners, and a shared focus on Darlene
1800240	1805920	and Dan. In the first episode, Keep on Trucking premiered on October 16th. It picked up right
1805920	1810720	where last season left off, only this time following the sudden death of Roseanne Connor.
1835920	1846480	Roseanne's death is used to immediately spring towards the social issue that had been in the
1846480	1851680	background of season 10, and that was covered briefly in episode 8 of that season, Roseanne's
1851680	1857280	addiction to pain pills. If you'll remember that episode, Roseanne's problem wasn't brought about
1857280	1864320	by her moral degeneracy or any sort of personal issue, but rather her character's lack of access
1864320	1869600	to proper medical care that she couldn't afford knee surgery when she desperately needed it.
1869600	1874880	That addiction was created in an effort to cope with a real physical problem that could have been
1874880	1880000	addressed with proper medical care. In this episode of The Conners, it highlights the underground pill
1880000	1885120	community in Lanford, and most strikingly how these people aren't horrible drug dealers, but
1885120	1891040	people trying to help each other survive. Nobody can afford their meds. We all help each other. When
1892240	1898480	Sally Benson needed Lipitor for her husband's cholesterol, they got some from Maria Ramirez,
1898480	1903360	and they gave her the anxiety meds. She needed for some because they dropped her insurance.
1904480	1913120	Rosie needed painkillers. I had some, so I gave them to her. So you're part of a neighborhood
1913120	1919360	drug ring. Congratulations to you. You know what, Dan? You can judge, but Roseanne called me.
1920800	1925040	She told me that her knee wasn't healing up fast enough, and I was the only person she could turn
1925040	1929840	to. She said that she needed those pain pills to get back to work because you guys were running
1929840	1934640	out of money. It's important to acknowledge that access to care isn't a perfect safeguard against
1934640	1939680	addiction, as it is possible for doctors to overprescribe, but a doctor is still a better source
1939680	1944080	of medication than some nice lady who lives down the street. More broadly for this show, it
1944080	1949440	demonstrates what the Connors can be without Roseanne by underscoring what the original show was at its
1949440	1954560	best. The character of Roseanne is the premise upon which real issues affecting working-class
1954560	1959120	people can be discussed. Whether she's alive or dead matters less than the fact that she's a
1959120	1964320	catalyst for this discussion to begin. A dead character can't direct conversations in a show,
1964320	1968640	so her dying kind of ends that. It does open the door for the rest of the family to center
1968640	1973520	those discussions around themselves and the problems that they face, all while keeping their
1973520	1997200	trademark sense of humor. One thing season 10 of Roseanne made a nominal attempt to do was
1997200	2002640	offer a fig leaf to right-wing audience members, and the first season of The Connors does something
2002640	2008000	similar. In the third episode, There Won't Be Blood, Halloween, a favorite holiday in the
2008000	2012720	Connor household, sets the stage for a small controversy about Halloween costumes.
2027200	2038720	Darlene's son Mark is soon refused entry into a school carnival where he dresses as Frida Kahlo.
2057200	2084880	This is the red meat episode, a tip of the hat to an argument you more often hear from the right
2084880	2090400	that isn't completely without merit, and an example of a show trying to be balanced. From
2090400	2095440	a leftist perspective, there is still value in this episode. Much like in the second episode of
2095440	2100720	season 10 of Roseanne, the Mark-centric episode focuses on his wardrobe, something you certainly
2100720	2105520	don't see reflected in stories about young boys on TV. Although this could be framed as strictly
2105520	2110320	an episode for conservatives to reel about political correctness affecting Halloween costumes,
2110320	2113840	I would rather look at how it's framing the discussion in a way that would support a young
2113840	2117840	boy's decision to dress in something non-traditional male. This is the sort of
2117840	2123680	compromise that I think can leave both sides happy. Fancy that. This episode also introduces
2123680	2126960	us to Jackie's new boyfriend, Peter, played by Matthew Broderick.
2126960	2148640	One big change for this series is Dan's new role as the voice of reason. In the Roseanne show,
2148640	2153040	his voice was paired with Roseanne's, so he didn't have quite the patriarchal role that has fallen
2153040	2158240	so heavily on him in this series. In the fifth episode, Miracles, we can see that new role after
2158240	2181920	Becky announces she's pregnant and plans on raising the child alone. This episode also introduces love
2181920	2187280	interests for both Becky and Darlene. Respectively, they are Emilio, played by René Rosado,
2191760	2203200	and Ben, played by J.R. Ferguson. This episode highlights growing diversity within the series.
2203200	2207120	Emilio is going to be a bigger force than you might expect, and his role has a political
2207200	2211760	dimension that makes perfect sense. Previous incarnation of the show often did shy away from
2211760	2217040	racial issues, but this one isn't. That seems like an improvement to me. An important realization that
2217040	2220800	when talking about the working class in the United States, you shouldn't leave out the Hispanic
2220800	2226000	population and the unique problems they face. The romance between Ben and Darlene is cute,
2226000	2230480	and it shows that what appeals to the bulldozer personality of a strong female character like
2230480	2236240	Darlene isn't a pushover like David or a strong man to dominate her, but a man that's her match.
2237120	2242320	I would love the three shrimp tacos. Pick something else. A lot of shrimp is peeled
2242320	2246400	by Thai kids forced into slave labor, so you think you're eating scampi, but really you're
2246400	2252560	exploiting children. I got an idea. What if I just had one small shrimp taco and I feel bad about it?
2254640	2260640	Have the chile relleno. They're really good here. They're vegan. Yeah, I really like those. No, you will.
2262800	2267040	Well, I think I speak for everyone in the internet department when I say I think we can go out
2267040	2272480	for dinner. What do you like? Uh, Chinese. I could go for some shrimp fried rice.
2279600	2284480	You probably, you probably don't know this. Uh, most of the shrimp we eat isn't processed
2284480	2292480	ethically, so you don't want to get that. Oh, you're confused. You thought I was a child when
2292480	2302000	I'm actually a grown-ass adult. Yeah, I didn't mean to push. That's not who I am. Oh, great.
2303440	2308320	Ben is her boss, though she does get a promotion within the first episode and is clearly on her
2308320	2312560	way up to being his equal, but the fact that he's still her boss says something about economic
2312560	2318080	disparity. Ben obviously isn't rich, but he seems to be a step ahead of Darlene in the world. The
2318160	2323520	wage gap exists in all classes, even the working class. This can be viewed through that lens,
2323520	2328560	rather than the gender dynamics of a man having power over a woman. It isn't trying to reinforce
2328560	2334320	the patriarchy. It's about how capitalism uses the patriarchy to present supposedly natural power
2334320	2338800	dynamics between men and women. Women's work is less valuable, and look at that, the man is the
2338800	2343440	boss. Continuing on that theme of working class issues that don't just affect white people,
2343440	2348880	in episode 10, Don't Shoot the Piano Teacher, we learn specifically that Emilio is an illegal
2348880	2354160	immigrant. Is he here illegally? Well, who cares if he's illegal? Who cares if he's a busboy?
2354160	2357920	A lot of people with difficult beginnings have risen above their station in life,
2357920	2362800	Dan. I mean, nobody in our family, but I've read about it. It's pretty inspirational when it
2362800	2371440	happens. And we see Dan evolve on the subject. Look, I gotta be honest with you. I don't like
2371440	2376960	the way you got here. You broke the law and you could be putting me in a bad situation,
2376960	2384320	but I want to help my daughter, so I have to help you. I understand. Dan's position on hiring
2384320	2388800	undocumented immigrants is less of a difficult question when it comes to helping his daughter.
2388800	2394000	Dan also realizes something. Rather than the hideous drug dealer caricature presented by,
2394000	2399040	say, the president of the United States, Emilio is a hardworking guy who's come to the United States
2399040	2404160	to make a better life for himself. Dan doesn't have to like the way Emilio entered the country,
2404160	2407600	but he also can't deny that his family's lives would be better if he was there.
2408640	2413040	Becky's fear of Emilio being deported is a callback to her fear of being left behind again,
2413040	2418000	the same way Mark left her behind when he died. While the deportation angle doesn't enter into
2418000	2422400	her mind in a racist context, it does color her relationship with him. How can she think of
2422400	2426800	building a life with him, even if he says he'll be around, when he might be gone the next day?
2426800	2431200	Why are you pushing him into my life? Because you're being stubborn and stupid. I'm sorry. I'm
2431200	2438880	a life coach. You're being overly rooted and intelligent adjacent. What is your problem?
2438880	2444320	You know what my problem is? I've been doing fine. So why should I start depending on somebody who
2444320	2449040	might not be here when I need him? Living in fear prevents undocumented immigrants from reaching a
2449040	2454720	greater potential. The season finale, we continue to truck ends with a few major bombshells. Jackie
2454720	2459120	breaks up with her boyfriend, Peter, after she finds out he's been cheating on her.
2459120	2464240	I'm with you and not her. A stupid affair doesn't mean I love you any less.
2464800	2469040	Don't throw what we have away by being so narrow-minded and provincial.
2469040	2472640	Don't play your mind games with me. This isn't my fault.
2473280	2474160	Isn't it Jackie?
2476800	2479760	Don't let your insecurity drive away another man.
2480720	2486880	Oh my god. Dan told me you were taking advantage of me and I didn't listen because I was weak.
2486880	2487600	You're not weak.
2488640	2491040	Well, not anymore. I'm not.
2491520	2493840	Oh, ow. Ow, ow. That hurt.
2493840	2496080	Good. Well, then that means I'm doing it right.
2496080	2500560	This leads Jackie to a bit of a breakdown, and it really highlights what the first season has been
2500560	2505920	about, and that's loss. Dealing with the loss of Roseanne and trying to organize their lives
2506080	2511360	around the gaping hole her absence has created. In many ways, the show itself is still struggling
2511360	2515680	to fill that missing role of Roseanne Connor. To get those characters back to a place where they
2515680	2520880	could be happy, Jackie's breakdown at the end is the sad realization that they can never go back.
2520880	2522640	They'll never be happy the way they used to be.
2523120	2532080	Me and my sister. We owned the place. We called it the lunchbox, and it was the last place I was
2532080	2537600	happy. It's entirely possible things will change in future seasons, and it seems to be building in
2537600	2542560	that direction, but it really demonstrates how families just don't bounce back from a trauma.
2542560	2546800	The working class vibe is present, but it's understated compared to the earlier incarnation
2546800	2551360	of the show, and its plays are more personal intersectional stories, touching on the Hispanic
2551360	2553360	working class experience in Emilio.
2581600	2582800	It's Emilio, right?
2586080	2590160	Taking me to Tejas, and then turning me over to authorities in Juarez,
2591120	2595520	I will find a way back to you and our baby after a short time in Chihuahua.
2597440	2599360	In the city, no big dog.
2600800	2605120	Characters of color are a welcome addition, and generally add new dimensions to the show,
2605120	2609440	though there hasn't been much racial commentary with Gina and Mary. It also would have been nice
2609440	2613360	to see something more of Gina outside of her intense religiosity.
2613360	2617280	Well, you can gamble with your souls if you want, but my family's going to church.
2617280	2621120	Aunt Darlene doesn't make Mark and Harris go, so why do I have to?
2621120	2622240	Because I say so.
2623280	2624800	These may be for future seasons.
2625440	2628160	Gina Connor, would you stand and be recognized?
2631760	2634000	Baby, people stop raising the roof in 2005.
2634160	2637360	Can we have Roseanne without Roseanne?
2638160	2639280	The answer is yes.
2640080	2640960	Sort of.
2640960	2646400	But it's not like so many of these stories couldn't or wouldn't be done in an 11th season of Roseanne.
2646400	2649120	It feels more like the show is picking up where it left off,
2649120	2654640	trying to cut off the toxic elements of the previous series, including Roseanne Barr herself.
2654640	2658480	In some ways, the series didn't really need her to begin with,
2658480	2663440	although in other ways it absolutely did because it was named for her and was a vehicle for her.
2664160	2669840	One joke Roseanne Barr demanded to be put in the first episode of season 10 was about Hillary Clinton,
2669840	2673280	to at least try to balance all the jokes about Donald Trump.
2673280	2676720	Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should grow up and be president,
2676720	2679200	even if they're a liar liar pantsuit on fire.
2681520	2686400	And it makes me wonder what other things Roseanne would have demanded be included in future seasons.
2686400	2689200	In many ways, she was a passenger in season 10.
2689200	2690480	But season 11?
2690480	2691200	Season 12?
2691760	2695200	Considering how her influence grew throughout the first nine seasons,
2695200	2699920	I think it's a decent assumption that her controlling personality would have bled to the fore
2699920	2703040	and had a heavier influence on the direction of the show.
2703040	2707040	It'll be interesting to see how the Conners grow in the future, without Roseanne's influence.
2707840	2712560	That'll give it a freer hand to be what it wants, but what does it want to be?
2712560	2715760	A show about the working class, in all its many shapes and forms,
2715760	2718000	and how it struggles to get by in America today?
2718560	2723360	That's possible, but not without more work to deliver on some of the early promises of its first season.
2723360	2727280	It's a show that has a lot of baggage, but maybe that's what makes it feel all the more real,
2727280	2728880	and maybe that's how it connects to people.
2729520	2734800	In an interview she gave, Sarah Gilbert reflected on what the first season of The Conners accomplished.
2734800	2738240	In this context, she's discussing the final episode of the first season.
2738240	2741440	Some of the emotions of the premiere come up again in this episode.
2741440	2743520	That's something that was really important to me.
2743520	2748080	I didn't want to do a sitcom version of Lost where there's one very special episode,
2748080	2750400	and then it's done and everybody moves on.
2750400	2754560	This episode shows that emotional themes run through people's lives, and not just through a week.
2755120	2759120	Perhaps most importantly, The Conners gave us a chance to enjoy a show that dramatized
2759120	2762000	in the struggles of the working class in an entertaining way,
2762000	2765920	just as the first nine seasons of Roseanne did, and just as the tenth season did.
2766560	2769440	Though The Conners may never shake the ghost of its upbringing,
2769440	2771840	it does point to a better future we can work towards,
2771840	2776240	one that builds off the strengths of its past and hopefully leaves its weaknesses behind.
2776800	2781120	One of its best strengths was highlighting the humor and joy that sustains people,
2781120	2783360	even when the world seems to be forgetting them.
2783360	2786720	While some may feel affinity in the hollow words of a conman,
2786720	2791040	we can still learn about the struggles of these characters and perhaps even more from their
2791040	2796480	failings, and hopefully it can create an awareness that this is a society not working for the working
2796480	2801040	class, and from there, maybe the realization that it can be changed for the better.
2801040	2804800	If Roseanne can get rid of its toxicity to become The Conners,
2804800	2808160	why can't we be better and remove the toxicity from our own world?
