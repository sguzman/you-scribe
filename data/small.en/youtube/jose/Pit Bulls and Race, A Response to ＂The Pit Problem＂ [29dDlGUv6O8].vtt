00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
What do you think of when someone mentions a pitbull?

00:03.840 --> 00:08.280
Do vaguely suspicious images like these come into your mind?

00:08.280 --> 00:13.680
If you're like me, and most other people, someone put those images in there.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.240
In recent weeks, certain folks on Twitter have been pushing an anti-pitbull narrative

00:18.240 --> 00:22.680
that's filled with half-truths, bad research, and lots of other fear-mongering.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.080
If you've been following the news about pitbulls over the last few decades, you might

00:27.080 --> 00:31.240
think they've co-opted a legitimate controversy around the pitbull.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.840
But the stigma attached to pitbulls go deeper than that.

00:34.840 --> 00:40.520
This new wave of anti-pitbull rhetoric is tired garbage, cosmetically altered with minimal

00:40.520 --> 00:41.760
effort.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.120
Which brings me to this video by Brittany Venti, The Pit Problem.

00:46.120 --> 00:51.160
While going through this video, I'll spare you any and all images of animals or children

00:51.160 --> 00:52.600
being mauled.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.240
If you're interested in checking out Venti's video, be warned, it has a lot of that in

00:57.240 --> 01:00.320
there and it literally just goes right into it, no warning.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.480
So here's that warning for you.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.060
Like all great thought leaders, Brittany Venti was motivated to make this video after she

01:06.060 --> 01:09.240
saw a sign on a truck and some memes posted on the internet.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.520
I never really thought about doing a video until now, and I think now is the perfect

01:14.520 --> 01:16.040
time to do so.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.040
There's trucks driving around New York with LCD screens saying to ban pitbulls, and Petco

01:21.080 --> 01:24.920
just banned pitbulls from playing with other pets at their stores.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.920
And I've seen a lot of anti-pitbull memes in the past few months.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.800
Pitbulls, like she sort of mentions in her video, were bred from bulldogs.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.180
Bulldogs were originally bred in England for the hideous sport of bullbaiting.

01:49.180 --> 01:54.100
This involved tying a bull, or sometimes a bear, to a post and having several dogs

01:54.100 --> 01:57.820
maul it to death, or die in the attempt.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.700
The sport was banned in 1835.

02:00.700 --> 02:06.060
With bullbaiting banned, these dogs were sadly conscripted into another blood sport, that

02:06.060 --> 02:07.260
of dogfighting.

02:07.260 --> 02:11.340
The breeding pressure now shifted over to producing dogs that would be aggressive towards

02:11.340 --> 02:12.340
other dogs.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.540
So, the pitbull was born.

02:14.540 --> 02:19.140
A little known fact is that the majority of dog breeds were created in the 19th century,

02:19.140 --> 02:24.180
and often represented the interests or desire of the upper classes of a given society.

02:24.180 --> 02:28.740
Particularly wealthy individuals would breed dogs, because they could easily afford it,

02:28.740 --> 02:33.820
to generate specific characteristics or traits, or even just physical appearances that they

02:33.820 --> 02:34.660
liked.

02:34.660 --> 02:40.300
Once a dog no longer had any purpose to the upper class, or just was no longer popular,

02:40.300 --> 02:44.840
it would often be discarded and fall in with the less discriminating lower classes.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.420
This is what happened to the pitbull.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.620
Although the pitbull was still used for dogfighting, the vast majority of pitbulls tended to be

02:51.620 --> 02:55.420
family pets and were no longer being bred for blood sports.

02:55.420 --> 03:00.140
Its formerly purebred genes have had well over a century of mixing to dilute the breeding

03:00.140 --> 03:01.700
done to it in the 19th century.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.740
It's also important to know that when people refer to pitbulls, that term includes at least

03:05.740 --> 03:08.380
four distinct breeds and several mixes.

03:08.380 --> 03:13.420
Also, boxers, aquitas, and sharpes were all historically bred for fighting too, but they

03:13.420 --> 03:16.620
don't get portrayed as dangerous the way pitbulls are.

03:16.620 --> 03:20.740
So when people like Brittany Venti talk about their breeding history to paint pitbulls as

03:20.740 --> 03:24.740
inherently dangerous, it's fear mongering, plain and simple.

03:24.740 --> 03:28.780
And the pitbull's story doesn't end in the 19th century, but let's return to the video

03:28.780 --> 03:36.620
before talking about the pitbull in 20th century America.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.980
Venti tries to explain dog breeding by saying,

03:38.980 --> 03:43.900
It's just a natural instinct that has been selectively bred by breeders.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.900
Dogs are going to do what they were bred to do.

03:45.900 --> 03:49.900
Some dogs are meant for herding, some dogs are meant for hunting, and then some dogs

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
are meant for herding.

03:50.900 --> 03:55.660
What I think she's trying to get across here, the English language be damned, is that she

03:55.660 --> 04:00.620
is a big believer in genetics driving behaviour, and that a dog bred for a purpose is tied

04:00.620 --> 04:05.180
to that purpose, as its genes will only allow for that limited range of behaviour selected

04:05.180 --> 04:07.060
by a breeder.

04:07.060 --> 04:11.020
While traits can definitely be passed on to other dogs through breeding, without that

04:11.020 --> 04:14.940
continued selection pressure, traits can often fall out of favour.

04:14.940 --> 04:20.180
Evolution doesn't stamp a finished label on any species, and some breeders have found

04:20.180 --> 04:24.620
pitbulls can lose their aggression within two to three generations, a milestone that the

04:24.620 --> 04:27.300
vast majority of pitbulls have lived past as.

04:27.300 --> 04:32.460
And this may come as a surprise to Brittany, very few pitbulls are bred to be fighting dogs.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.980
But Brittany Venti isn't interested in that, and this video isn't about representing

04:35.980 --> 04:41.180
science, it's about getting you to believe that genes are what dictate behaviour.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.700
Pitbulls are the most dangerous dog, I'm referring to not only pitbulls, but their

04:44.700 --> 04:47.820
variations and any mixtures of them.

04:47.820 --> 04:52.140
The mixtures are even more dangerous because sometimes you won't even know it's a pitbull.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.820
Okay, let's think this through.

04:54.820 --> 05:01.660
If pitbull genes make a dog violent, why would mixing those genes make a dog less violent?

05:01.660 --> 05:06.340
It's almost as if she's saying pitbulls will taint any other breed they're allowed to mix

05:06.340 --> 05:07.640
with.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.400
I wonder what that would sound like if she were talking about human beings for a moment.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.360
But right now I'm just reading subtext, Venti clearly said the danger was because people

05:15.360 --> 05:19.840
wouldn't know the dog is half pitbull, it's almost as if she's saying the onus is on people

05:19.840 --> 05:24.720
and how they treat dogs, but hey hey, I'm just picking on her poor presentation skills

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
now.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.000
There are actual bits of research that are shown throughout this video, all found on

05:29.000 --> 05:31.440
that noted academic journal, Twitter.

05:31.440 --> 05:38.320
The highlighted captions all come from Twitter user wildgoose999, some Twitter person who

05:38.320 --> 05:40.840
hides behind a bird avatar.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.640
What kind of jerk does that, right?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.400
Let's drill down on a few of the specific claims made by this guy.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.440
To keep this video reasonable in its length, I'm going to pass over some of the irrelevant

05:49.440 --> 05:54.120
ones, such as groups trying to change the name of pitbulls, thinly sourced claims about

05:54.120 --> 06:00.160
pitbull advocates being cigarette shills, or that pro-pitbull groups are secret satanists.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.080
Because none of those have anything to do with the supposed threat of pitbulls, and

06:04.080 --> 06:09.040
I don't want to waste time on them in the video, although the satanism one was hilariously

06:09.040 --> 06:10.040
not true.

06:10.040 --> 06:14.380
First, there's this little graph that points out that Michael Vick's conviction is some

06:14.380 --> 06:16.880
kind of catalyst for pitbull attacks.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.700
For those who may not remember, Michael Vick is a former pro-football player who operated

06:20.700 --> 06:23.400
a dog fighting ring that killed a number of pitbulls.

06:23.400 --> 06:29.240
What the graph is suggesting is that pro-pitbull sentiment that came as a reaction to the story

06:29.240 --> 06:35.200
has made the public friendlier to pitbulls, and therefore more vulnerable to attacks.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.120
The numbers on this graph are compiled from this dataset.

06:38.120 --> 06:43.920
Now, the big problem with this dataset is that it is made up entirely from media reports.

06:43.920 --> 06:49.160
It's not an actual measure of dog bites across the US, but rather the ones reported by the

06:49.160 --> 06:50.160
media.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.800
The growth in anti-pitbull sentiment was heavily fueled by media coverage in the 1980s about

06:54.800 --> 06:58.680
pitbulls being out of control, and this has more or less been an old standard for local

06:58.680 --> 07:00.760
news reports across the US.

07:00.760 --> 07:11.120
The dataset also suggests dog bites are exploding, going from 731 in 2002 to 2975 in 2013.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.040
What if we compare this to a neutral data source for a better measure, though?

07:15.040 --> 07:24.360
According to the CDC, using data from hospitals across the United States, in 2001, 368,245

07:24.360 --> 07:27.080
people were admitted to a hospital for dog bites.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.560
So if we assume the total number of dog bites stayed the same in 2002, or let's even round

07:32.560 --> 07:39.120
it down to 360,000, the total number of bites reported in the media represent 0.2% of all

07:39.120 --> 07:40.120
dog bites.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.040
I should also point out that this bit of research wasn't peer-reviewed or published anywhere,

07:44.040 --> 07:50.200
but on the website animals247.org, created by the paper's author Merritt Clifton, a

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
long-time anti-pitbull advocate.

07:52.200 --> 07:57.880
He has no serious academic history or credentials, and his research has largely been popularized

07:57.880 --> 08:03.920
by the very slick-looking dogsbite.org sitting along blog posts like this one.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.480
And that's not exactly what I would call a constructive criticism of the scientific

08:08.480 --> 08:09.480
literature.

08:09.480 --> 08:13.400
There's a great blog post that drills into the numbers of Clifton's pitbull attack stats

08:13.400 --> 08:18.320
and how they often count ridiculous stories such as a horse kicking a woman after it was

08:18.320 --> 08:22.440
startled by a pitbull or an animal control officer slipping and falling while chasing

08:22.440 --> 08:25.640
a dog as pitbull attacks.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.920
Give it a read if you want to hear some of the more ridiculous claims.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.640
These slides throw out some damning numbers, but here are two things to keep in mind.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.520
These all relate to specific communities and not national averages, and they compare singular

08:39.520 --> 08:44.320
breeds with a number of different pitbull breeds blended into a single stat.

08:44.320 --> 08:48.960
The last of the tweets Brittany Venti cites for her video is a thread where Wildgoose999

08:48.960 --> 08:52.940
discusses how it's the genetics of the pitbull that create aggressive behavior and that owners

08:52.940 --> 08:54.580
have nothing to do with it.

08:54.580 --> 09:00.280
The first slide is from Dogbites and Urban Children, published in Pediatrics in 1991.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.660
The first limitation of this paper is that it looks at dogbites reported in a single

09:03.660 --> 09:08.760
Philadelphia hospital in 1989, so again, you can't always generalize one community to

09:08.760 --> 09:10.040
an entire country.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.840
The next problem we run into is the actual data in the research.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.640
This table here breaks down the number of bites by breed, and we can see that pitbulls

09:17.640 --> 09:19.400
actually weren't the most common.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.200
It was the German Shepherd.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.440
The paper's discussion section where the excerpt is taken from does go into detail

09:25.440 --> 09:30.400
about pitbulls, but the two paragraphs shown by Wildgoose999 are less connected than he

09:30.400 --> 09:31.640
might have you think.

09:31.640 --> 09:36.400
The second paragraph isn't really about pitbulls specifically, but dogs in general.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.960
The idea that genetic differences influence behavior is a controversial one, but a tie

09:40.960 --> 09:44.520
that influenced to breed is the shell game that's being played here.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.840
Why is the only term highlighted?

09:46.840 --> 09:48.720
Genetic predisposition.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.160
The other factors of early socialization to people, training or maltreatment, quality

09:53.160 --> 09:57.520
of care and supervision, and behavior of the victim are also factors.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.840
Wildgoose999 is arguing that a pitbull's behavior isn't relevant to the actions of its owner,

10:02.840 --> 10:07.240
but the non-highlighted variables would be influenced by a dog's upbringing and environment.

10:07.240 --> 10:12.440
The paper is clear that the other variables are at least as important, so why emphasize

10:12.440 --> 10:14.240
genes?

10:14.240 --> 10:19.240
Possibly because Wildgoose999 has an agenda here, and he's willing to twist the research

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
to get that across.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.680
Let's move on to the next one.

10:22.680 --> 10:29.440
Mortality, mauling, and maiming by vicious dogs, published in 2011 in Annals of Surgery.

10:29.440 --> 10:35.640
Now the quote Wildgoose999 uses is actually not from the paper he's citing.

10:35.640 --> 10:40.520
The Annals of Surgery paper is actually quoting someone from a different paper here, so let's

10:40.520 --> 10:42.160
go to that one.

10:42.160 --> 10:50.720
Dog attacks, deaths, and maimings, U.S. and Canada, September 1982 to December 31st, 2013

10:50.720 --> 10:51.720
by...

10:51.720 --> 10:54.960
Oh, it's our old friend Merritt Clifton.

10:54.960 --> 11:00.440
In fact, this paper is the same dataset I debunked earlier.

11:00.440 --> 11:05.120
And if you look through the Annals of Surgery paper, it actually cites all kinds of research

11:05.120 --> 11:11.080
from dogbites.org and other bits of spurious research from Clifton that hasn't been peer

11:11.080 --> 11:12.080
reviewed.

11:12.080 --> 11:17.160
It even includes a YouTube video as one of its sources, so technically I guess my video

11:17.160 --> 11:19.900
here has just as much academic weight.

11:19.900 --> 11:23.920
This makes me question how careful these researchers were in putting together this paper, but I'll

11:23.920 --> 11:28.280
be as charitable as possible here and say, perhaps they're seeing something in Clifton's

11:28.280 --> 11:30.160
work that I'm not.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.720
Their paper closes with this passage.

11:32.720 --> 11:37.120
These breeds should be regulated in the same way in which other dangerous species such

11:37.120 --> 11:39.360
as leopards are regulated.

11:39.360 --> 11:44.440
I'm not sure pit bulls should be considered as dangerous as leopards, but they're the

11:44.440 --> 11:46.920
scientists I guess.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.960
Slides 3 through 8 all come from a paper titled, Are Pit Bulls Different?, an analysis

11:51.960 --> 11:58.720
of the Pit Bull Terrier controversy published in 1987 in Anthrozoos, a multidisciplinary

11:58.720 --> 12:02.960
journal of the interactions of people and animals.

12:02.960 --> 12:09.040
All these points come from the same section of the paper, but even in these selected sections,

12:09.040 --> 12:12.240
Wild Goose 999's intentions are betrayed.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.840
The first slide reads, A long history of breeding for bullbaiting and fighting has had a profound

12:16.840 --> 12:20.440
effect on the genetic predisposition of many of the fighting breeds.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.320
In many cases, a shorter history of selection for qualities that might make these animals

12:24.320 --> 12:28.400
suitable as household companions has counteracted this effect.

12:28.400 --> 12:34.000
Why highlight the genetic predisposition and ignore the rest of that passage?

12:34.000 --> 12:39.120
Aside from the fact that it basically contradicts everything you're trying to say in your little

12:39.120 --> 12:40.400
Twitter thread.

12:40.400 --> 12:45.000
The other slides are similarly irresponsible and do little to represent the actual findings

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
of the paper.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.760
If I wanted to cherry pick something that showed fighting dogs were no risk to humans,

12:49.760 --> 12:52.880
I could just post this from the next page.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.440
Aggression towards people.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.400
The fighting dogs of the 19th century generally posed little or no threat to people.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.320
These animals were disqualified in the pit if they exhibited aggression to their handlers

13:03.320 --> 13:05.360
or other people.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.320
Early in this century, several former fighting breeds such as the Bull Terrier and the English

13:09.320 --> 13:14.160
Bulldog were specifically selected for their good dispositions around people.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.160
But what is this paper really about, and what argument is it truly making?

13:18.160 --> 13:22.800
We can find that easily enough at the end of the paper where it says, problems of irresponsible

13:22.800 --> 13:26.920
ownership are not unique to pit bulls, nor will they be in the future.

13:26.920 --> 13:31.800
For this reason, we feel that effective animal control legislation must emphasize responsible

13:31.800 --> 13:36.760
and humane ownership of sound animals, as well as responsible supervision of children

13:36.760 --> 13:39.080
and animals when they interact.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.900
So this paper isn't about the evils of pit bulls, but instead advocating for owners

13:43.900 --> 13:47.420
to be held to a higher level of responsibility.

13:47.420 --> 13:53.300
It doesn't seem like a good paper to use in a thread about how owners don't matter

13:53.300 --> 13:55.420
when it comes to pit bull aggression.

13:55.420 --> 14:02.140
The last three slides all come from Dog Bites to Humans, Demography, Epidemiology, Injury

14:02.140 --> 14:07.100
and Risk, published in 2001 in Vet Med Today.

14:07.100 --> 14:11.820
This paper isn't really about pit bulls specifically, but dog bites in general.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.900
Less favorable traits could mean anything when talking about all dogs.

14:15.900 --> 14:21.460
To get more specific, a few paragraphs later the paper says, investigations of unpredictable

14:21.460 --> 14:26.260
aggression have produced no firm results regarding heritability.

14:26.260 --> 14:30.060
The next slide is a bit vague, but you might be interested to know that this comes from

14:30.060 --> 14:35.740
a section titled, Issues of Fact and Myth, and the spot he cut off goes on to read, A

14:35.740 --> 14:40.100
Careful Reading of the Literature supports three conclusions regarding breed.

14:40.100 --> 14:44.400
The breeds most represented in dog bite data vary over time.

14:44.400 --> 14:49.160
Breeds most often represented in published data are popular ones, and no one breed may

14:49.160 --> 14:53.920
be represented in bite data in proportion to its actual population.

14:53.920 --> 14:59.080
And pit bull is often applied without biological basis to a range of dog types, regardless

14:59.080 --> 15:01.880
of the underlying genetic stock.

15:01.880 --> 15:06.680
So the paper is pretty clear in stating that the pit bull stigma isn't because they're

15:06.680 --> 15:08.680
genetically bad dogs.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.720
And the last slide is, surprise surprise, also misleading.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.240
Being just a few lines above it, we can see a fuller use of the text reads, caution is

15:17.240 --> 15:23.560
urged regarding any generalization about inappropriate breed-specific behaviors.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.360
Selection for specific behaviors should be viewed as a risk assessment analysis.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.920
Breeds that have been selected for one or few specific behaviors may be more at risk

15:31.920 --> 15:36.040
for developing undesirable variations on those behaviors.

15:36.040 --> 15:41.040
This excerpt comes from a much larger section that, again, isn't specifically about pit

15:41.040 --> 15:43.120
bulls, but dogs in general.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.240
At best, you can try to connect this to how pit bulls may have been bred to be more aggressive

15:47.240 --> 15:52.040
to other dogs, but this part of the paper is a discussion of where more research needs

15:52.040 --> 15:55.040
to be done to minimize future dog bites.

15:55.040 --> 16:00.040
It's not saying anything about the relative danger posed by pit bulls.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.180
Phew, so all the garbage in that thread has been dealt with.

16:05.180 --> 16:09.600
It's incredibly difficult to track which dogs are responsible for dog bites, as most people

16:09.600 --> 16:13.000
aren't typically trained to identify dog breeds.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.860
Even people who work at animal shelters often mistake dog breeds.

16:16.860 --> 16:22.040
Most reports of dog bites, particularly in the media, but even in scientific literature,

16:22.040 --> 16:25.240
can mistake what breed a dog might actually be.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.280
Here are some pictures to give you an example.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.800
Can you tell which one of these is the American Pit Bull Terrier?

16:31.800 --> 16:35.320
That's one of the four distinct breeds.

16:35.320 --> 16:40.500
And don't worry, none of the other pictures are of the other three distinct pit bull breeds.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.600
If you want to think this over a bit, you should hit pause on the video, because I'm

16:43.600 --> 16:45.880
going to give you exactly no seconds for that.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
It's this one right here.

16:46.880 --> 16:52.280
There's even a whole paper on pit bull owners lying by omission about their dog breeds to

16:52.280 --> 16:53.360
other people.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.200
They pretend that their dog isn't bull-blooded, so they're also pretending that their dog

16:57.200 --> 17:02.220
isn't more powerful than other dogs by a long stretch and are more likely to attack.

17:02.220 --> 17:05.200
That's a very dangerous scheme to play, pit owners.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.360
Brittany Venti brings up a paper titled Managing the Stigma of Outlaw Breeds, a case study

17:10.360 --> 17:15.280
of pit bull owners, published in Society and Animals in 2000.

17:15.280 --> 17:19.760
It discusses how pit bull owners often lie to others about their dog in order to avoid

17:19.760 --> 17:21.980
the stigma placed on pit bulls.

17:21.980 --> 17:26.780
The paper explicitly says owners do this not because their dogs are dangerous, but because

17:26.780 --> 17:29.880
of the social stigma attached to them.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.800
Here's a quick excerpt from the paper.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.820
Our work suggests that non-human animals also can be stigmatized, although they will

17:36.820 --> 17:39.820
not have a conscious awareness of this perception.

17:39.820 --> 17:45.020
However, as part of a human animal team, their owners can experience the taintedness that

17:45.020 --> 17:49.940
is commensurate with this stigmatization and resort to various techniques to mitigate,

17:49.940 --> 17:54.380
prevent, or improve such adverse perceptions.

17:54.380 --> 18:00.500
Another source Brittany uses is the what to expect if your community is discussing breed-specific

18:00.500 --> 18:03.580
legislation, BSL in brackets.

18:03.580 --> 18:08.640
Which isn't actually scientific research, but a set of instructions from an advocacy

18:08.640 --> 18:13.940
group to a municipal government thinking of passing breed-specific legislation.

18:13.940 --> 18:17.880
It's not peer-reviewed, there is no record of where it was published, or even who the

18:17.880 --> 18:19.580
author is.

18:19.580 --> 18:24.020
That's the bare minimum of what you need for something to even look like a proper scientific

18:24.020 --> 18:25.020
source.

18:25.020 --> 18:29.300
You may as well just use some asshole's random Twitter account as a source.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.580
The video ends with Venti reading some shitty memes, selling merch, and then advocating

18:33.580 --> 18:35.060
for breed-specific legislation.

18:35.060 --> 18:38.860
So you guys might be asking, what's the solution to the pit problem?

18:38.860 --> 18:42.020
The first solution is to just ban pit bulls.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.620
Some places have already done this and it is an effective way to prevent a lot of the

18:45.620 --> 18:47.500
dog maulings that happen.

18:47.500 --> 18:51.100
There's actually a GoFundMe for that if you guys wish to support it.

18:51.100 --> 18:56.140
The CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association are both against breed-specific

18:56.140 --> 19:00.420
legislation, citing there is no scientific evidence to support it.

19:00.420 --> 19:04.620
BSL laws in the UK were shown to have no real effect on the number of dog bites that led

19:04.620 --> 19:10.740
to hospital admissions, and in my hometown of Toronto, dog bites actually went up after

19:10.740 --> 19:12.820
pit bulls were banned.

19:12.820 --> 19:16.900
Results vary by community, but it does show how this legislation is often misguided, and

19:16.900 --> 19:20.700
the money put towards its enforcement might be more effectively used in teaching owners

19:20.700 --> 19:22.780
how to take care of their dogs.

19:22.780 --> 19:27.940
And darker still, dogs that are seized as part of BSL laws are impounded, and many of

19:27.940 --> 19:30.060
them are eventually euthanized.

19:30.060 --> 19:36.140
But you might be wondering, why is some low-grade conservative making a video about pit bulls?

19:36.140 --> 19:43.740
I hinted at elements of racism early on, and please no one hate me for this pun, but this

19:43.740 --> 19:45.660
video is a dog whistle.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.100
This guy in the comments heard it.

19:47.100 --> 19:53.380
This dog whistle is being employed by race realists, also known as racists, to propagate

19:53.380 --> 19:58.260
the idea that genetics are what drive behavior, and that if we can measure bad behavior in

19:58.260 --> 20:02.740
a specific group, it must be a product of their genes.

20:02.740 --> 20:07.420
In other words, they want you to believe that pit bulls are naturally cruel and dangerous,

20:07.420 --> 20:11.340
so you'll believe that black people, or any people of color overrepresented in crime

20:11.340 --> 20:15.020
statistics are naturally cruel and dangerous too.

20:15.020 --> 20:19.700
The connection between pit bulls and peoples of color is just a nice way to synergize those

20:19.700 --> 20:27.620
two things.

20:27.620 --> 20:31.100
Here's the rest of the pit bulls story I brought up in the beginning of the video.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.700
In the first half of the 20th century, there was a surge in love for the pit bull in the

20:34.700 --> 20:35.820
United States.

20:35.820 --> 20:40.100
The working class of the country took very fondly to pit bulls, not having the high price

20:40.100 --> 20:45.180
tag of purebreds and fitting in nicely with the idea of the tough working class.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.860
Pit bulls were beloved family pets and minor celebrities across the country.

20:48.860 --> 20:54.940
A notable example is the pit bull terrier, Sergeant Stubby, who served in World War I.

20:54.940 --> 20:58.540
Things were growing great for pit bulls for a few decades, but something changed in the

20:58.540 --> 21:00.500
1970s and 80s.

21:00.500 --> 21:05.420
Guard dogs and dog fighting had become increasingly common, and so, increasingly common in the

21:05.420 --> 21:10.340
media were reports of dog bites and stories of dog fighting rings.

21:10.340 --> 21:14.500
Guard dogs were popular with Americans who felt they needed protection local law enforcement

21:14.500 --> 21:17.140
couldn't, or wouldn't, offer.

21:17.140 --> 21:21.700
This often included the urban poor as pit bulls were relatively common and far less

21:21.700 --> 21:25.660
expensive than purebreds that cost hundreds of dollars.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.580
Pit bulls became popular with dog fighters for similar reasons.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.740
While the vast majority of pit bulls weren't tossed into fighting pits, the ones that were

21:33.740 --> 21:38.100
became prominent fixtures in press coverage, and this is where the myth of the vicious

21:38.100 --> 21:40.500
pit bull really begins.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.700
Stories of pit bull attacks, while not necessarily statistically higher than other breeds of

21:44.700 --> 21:50.380
dogs, were frequently seen in newspapers, and once this reputation was created, anyone

21:50.380 --> 21:54.220
who might need a vicious dog would be more inclined to get a pit bull and to raise it

21:54.220 --> 21:55.540
up as such.

21:55.540 --> 22:00.380
This created a cycle that got worse in the 1980s when the war on drugs began.

22:00.380 --> 22:04.180
Pit bulls were increasingly associated in media narratives with drug dealers, using

22:04.180 --> 22:10.580
them as vicious protectors and drug dealers in the 1980s in the minds of a white suburban

22:10.580 --> 22:14.500
readership or black or hispanic.

22:14.500 --> 22:19.460
Pit bulls, by proxy, got saddled with the racism that was targeted at their owners,

22:19.460 --> 22:25.300
and while some dog breeds, such as Dobermans and St. Bernards, have weathered negative

22:25.300 --> 22:30.660
public opinions after a few stories about bites, the association with drugs and some

22:30.660 --> 22:43.020
good old-fashioned racism gave pit bulls a stigma that wouldn't fade so easily.

22:43.020 --> 22:47.660
A recent news article uncovered some examples of how alt-right posters on 4chan are trying

22:47.660 --> 22:53.020
to push the pit bull meme to advance their usual racist narrative, and certain enablers,

22:53.020 --> 22:56.260
like Brittany Venti, are all too happy to help them along.

22:56.260 --> 23:01.720
Now I don't know for sure if Brittany Venti herself is a racist, I'm not really that

23:01.720 --> 23:06.660
familiar with her work to be honest, but she certainly is being used by them to advance

23:06.660 --> 23:08.140
a narrative.

23:08.140 --> 23:13.300
That makes this video deeply irresponsible and dangerously misleading.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.420
The story of the pit bull does have an important lesson.

23:16.420 --> 23:21.100
Genes are undoubtedly a part of our behavior, but social influences like breeding pressure

23:21.100 --> 23:24.420
don't create meaningful lasting changes.

23:24.420 --> 23:28.580
All animals are a product of their environment and how their genes interact with it.

23:28.580 --> 23:33.540
So instead of treating a dog like a public menace, treat them with love and compassion.

23:33.540 --> 23:37.700
And don't let dog discrimination be your gateway into thinking that people who don't look like

23:37.700 --> 23:39.620
you are genetically inferior.
