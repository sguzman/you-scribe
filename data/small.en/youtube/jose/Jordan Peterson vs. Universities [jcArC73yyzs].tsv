0	4720	In June of 2018, Jordan Peterson launched a defamation lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier
4720	11600	University for $1.5 million. This lawsuit came on the heels of a suit from former Wilfrid Laurier
11600	16880	University student Lindsay Shepherd. In that suit she claims an encounter she had with her
16880	23680	supervisor left her unemployable in academia and left some lasting emotional distress. After she
23680	28320	was reprimanded for showing a Peterson-related video in one of the classes she was a teacher's
28320	33600	assistant for. We don't need to guess about the timing of these two lawsuits here. Peterson
33600	39280	actually describes his lawsuit like this. I decided that Wilfrid Laurier had learned very
39280	44080	little from its public embarrassment and that Shepherd's claims were valid, justifiable,
44080	49600	and necessary, including her statement that her future lack of employability in academia
49600	55040	was improbable to say the least. I also decided to launch a claim of my own against the same
55040	59840	defendants. I thought that two lawsuits might make the point better than one.
60960	65920	So Peterson's suit is being filed not strictly because he's an offended party,
65920	70960	but in support of the Shepherd suit. The message he's trying to deliver is quite clear that the
70960	76720	faculty of Wilfrid Laurier University and presumably all university faculties across Canada
76720	81920	better watch what they say about him in the future. Many commenters have noted the obvious
81920	88080	hypocrisy here. Peterson's claim to fame involved sounding the alarm about a shadowy group of social
88080	94560	Marxists trying to control his language with Canadian Bill C-16, which added trans people
94560	99840	to the list of groups who were protected by hate speech laws. But now Peterson is the one trying
99840	104720	to control the language of others, or more specifically, he's trying to control the ideas
104720	110400	they're allowed to express behind closed doors. The hypocrisy is a fair point, but there's a deeper
110480	115120	point here about how the legal system is being used as a tool by a wealthy individual to create
115120	120640	a chilling effect, more commonly known as libel chill, although obviously in this case it's
120640	125600	defamation not libel. First I want to just make sure we're looking at the Peterson suit and the
125600	129360	Shepherd suit differently. While I don't agree with either, I think there's a clear difference
129360	134320	between a student who believes her university's faculty mistreated her, wrong as she may be,
134320	138960	and a professor from a different school not liking the way he's being spoken about by the same
138960	145520	faculty in private. What we have here is a clear case of the law being used to silence criticism.
145520	149760	It uses the legal system as a weapon and creates a chilling effect that will make
149760	155680	any other person in a Canadian university faculty, perhaps more broadly even, think twice
155680	159760	before they criticize Peterson in private in front of one of his followers.
161280	165200	For a broader look at how libel chill works, I want to talk about an incident that happened
165200	171040	in March of 2016 when pro wrestler Hulk Hogan won a lawsuit against the media outlet Gawker
171040	178640	for a staggering $140 million in damages after the media outlet published a sex tape he was
178640	184080	featured in. For the sake of your eyes, I won't put the footage from the sex tape on screen
184080	189760	from what I've been told the Hulkster has sex the same way he wrestles. He has three moves and never
189760	195840	goes longer than five minutes. The $140 million won by Hogan was later reduced to $31 million in
195840	201680	a settlement in November of the same year, but the damage had been done and Gawker was no more.
201680	208240	While Gawker has traipsed in controversy in the past with a series of questionable articles to
208240	213920	say the least, it wasn't really the Hulk Hogan sex tape that brought them down. It was a different
213920	220720	article that outed PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel as being secretly gay. While Hulk Hogan is an
220720	226800	American hero for daring to headbutt the flag of the Soviet Union, he didn't bankroll his lawsuit
226800	231840	against Gawker. It was Thiel who paid roughly $10 million for the suit, all part of a large
231840	236880	operation he had been funding to find ways to take the media organization down. Publishing an
236880	243040	article about someone being secretly gay while obviously a dick move isn't actually illegal.
243040	247360	In fact, being a public figure like Thiel means it's much harder to sue someone for what they
247360	251920	print, either online or in print. It's part of the framework of what protects the press,
251920	258320	a vital aspect of free expression. What Thiel did was bypass Gawker's free expression and use the
258320	263600	legal system to silence them forever. The effect not only ends his vendetta, it also sends a clear
263600	269040	signal to other media outlets. If they find anything salacious about him, maybe this time
269040	273680	nothing to do with his sexual life, but perhaps some kind of shady business dealings, Thiel may
273680	279440	deploy his considerable means within the legal system to exact vengeance. This is obviously
279440	284400	an extreme example, as we're talking about much higher dollar amounts at play here than in the
284400	288960	Peterson case, but keep in mind Thiel is a much wealthier man than Peterson. The difference here
288960	295760	is in scale more so than intent. And Peterson is making a statement that he is willing to put up
295760	300800	his money to silence criticism of him done in private. What's perhaps more disturbing about the
300800	306320	Peterson case is that he's suing a university and not a media outlet. This isn't an article that
306320	310240	was published somewhere, it was a private conversation in which two of the participants
310240	315040	had no reason to believe would be made public. How could they have possibly known that Shepard
315040	319600	was secretly recording them? And would Shepard's account have been so widely disseminated had it
319600	324400	not been for that recording? It'll be interesting to see how this lawsuit is resolved.
324480	328880	Peterson has been badmouthing academia since the beginning of his rise to internet fame.
328880	331600	Here are a few comments he made in a 2016 interview.
332160	338720	It might be that the university is already dying. It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, I think huge swaths
338720	346400	of the university are irrevocably corrupted. Sociology, gone. Anthropology, gone. History,
346400	352000	big chunks of it are gone. The classics, literature, social work, political science
352000	357360	in many places, and that doesn't cover women's studies, ethnic studies. They probably started
357360	363040	lost, and it's gotten far worse. I believe now, with the exception of the science, technology,
363040	369920	engineering, mathematics branch, that universities do more harm than good. I think they produced
369920	374400	indentured servants in the United States because tuition fees have gone up so much and you can't
374400	379360	declare bankruptcy on your student loans, or teaching university students lies and pandering
379440	385200	to them. And I see that as counterproductive. That's a god-awful impression, sorry about that.
385920	390000	We also can't forget Peterson's project to catalog the courses he considered
390000	396880	indoctrination cult classes in 2017. He only pulled back on that initiative after he cited
396880	402240	some negative responses from his twitter followers. But it demonstrates how poorly Peterson thinks of
402240	407920	certain branches of academia, and how he sees himself, or rather his philosophy, if you can
407920	413600	call it that, as the antidote. Peterson has also circulated a petition to try and take tax funding
413600	420560	away from universities. As of recording, it's sitting at 1484 signatures, so I don't think
420560	426080	that'll work. There's also his recent video for Dennis Prager's fake university, which wasn't
426080	431680	too kind to the academics instructing young minds. They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the
431680	436880	west with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their life's mission to undermine
436880	442800	western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive, and patriarchal.
443520	448000	He presents the world of academia as some kind of Soviet nightmare where kids have cultural
448000	454080	Marxism drilled into their minds. Plenty of videos have drilled into this particular effluvia already,
454080	459680	so check those out for more information. Jordan Peterson is the academic who undermines academia,
459680	464480	much in the way Larry Elder is celebrated as a black man who undermines black activism,
464480	469280	Blair White as a trans woman who undermines trans activism, and Christina Hoff Sommers as
469280	474560	a woman who undermines modern feminism. None of these people are advancing anything particularly
474560	479840	new or interesting, but rather standing up for the status quo while denying any of the criticisms
479840	484640	of discrimination or bigotry faced by the groups they identify with. Many of the points they make
484640	489520	are often heard from conservative commentators who don't belong to their identity groups.
489520	494160	Now we have the totalitarian left in America, and if you don't see it their way,
494160	498960	you're attacked and demonized. And if you're a student, you can be punished through the
498960	506240	grading system. This cannot continue. Academic freedom is one thing. Harming students with insane
506240	512240	ideology is quite something else. That there is such a thing as indoctrination at the university.
512240	518880	You get in there and you're given courses, you're given seminars I should say, on how racist you
518880	526400	are or on how to avoid sexual harassment. The universities were largely infiltrated by a lot
526400	531360	of folks on the new left. The establishment at those universities decided not to challenge
531360	536960	the student body when the student body kind of rose up in the 1960s, and a lot of the
536960	541520	very bad ideas that had started earlier in the 1930s and 40s ended up taking over the universities
541520	546560	in the 1960s. In other words, it's a noxious corruption of identity politics where someone's
546560	551600	gender, race, or in Peterson's case career are used to give their claims more credibility,
551600	555680	when in fact all their claims are simple conservative talking points that we've been
555680	560400	hearing for years, but we're supposed to believe they're more credible because in this case the
560400	566080	person's identity makes them look like an insider. This all illustrates a man who is at war with the
566080	572000	very institution that he uses as currency for his credibility. He is the university professor who
572000	577360	was valued for his consistent criticism of the university system and used conservative talking
577360	583120	points that we've been hearing for years. This, I believe, is the key to his fame and why so many
583120	589520	conservative thinkers, talkers, and speakers have all latched on to him. This lawsuit Peterson filed
589520	595680	isn't about making money but instead about making a point, and it's a simple one. Faculty at
595680	600560	Canadian universities are on notice. They better watch what they say about Jordan Peterson.
601200	605520	As he gets wealthier, it makes me wonder what he's going to start using that money for
606080	608400	and what other voices he might try to silence.
609200	614160	Expression is never free when someone uses their wealth to make you pay a price.
