00:00.000 --> 00:12.160
When I first thought about responding to a PragerU video, I was going to fact check one

00:12.160 --> 00:17.160
of their convoluted distorted fact dump videos, like this one titled, Conservatives Are the

00:17.160 --> 00:19.280
Real Environmentalists.

00:19.280 --> 00:23.040
When President Trump announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate

00:23.040 --> 00:27.520
Accord, environmentalists warned of imminent disaster.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.080
But a year later, it turned out that the United States led the world in reducing carbon

00:33.080 --> 00:34.280
emissions.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.040
It did so without surrendering its national sovereignty.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.840
The claim here is that the U.S. brought down emissions, all while ignoring the Paris Climate

00:41.840 --> 00:42.840
Agreement.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.280
Considering the Paris Agreement has no means of enforcing its goals, we don't get an

00:46.280 --> 00:51.720
explanation for why leaving it helped, or why its policy would somehow stop the U.S.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.440
from lowering its emissions, but apparently international agreements are somehow surrendering

00:55.440 --> 00:57.040
national sovereignty.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.360
The video doesn't dwell on stuff like that on purpose.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.480
Let's take a closer look at the supposed hypocrisy here, though.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.200
The U.S. is apparently the leader in reducing emissions, while the EU and China all had

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
increases.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.880
Of course, if we actually look at the sources for these claims, we get a different picture.

01:10.880 --> 01:18.560
In 2019, emissions went down in the United States by 140 megatons, or 2.9% of total emissions,

01:18.560 --> 01:21.360
bringing the total to 4.8 gigatons.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.040
Here is what the PragerU vid said about the EU.

01:24.040 --> 01:29.880
The EU released an additional 40 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air that year.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.720
So we now have this very clear comparison.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.360
The U.S. is lowering emissions, while the EU is increasing them.

01:35.360 --> 01:41.140
Except when you look at the IEA numbers, that PragerU used to trumpet the U.S.'s accomplishments,

01:41.140 --> 01:45.360
we find out the EU has actually decreased its emissions, even more so than the U.S.,

01:45.360 --> 01:52.520
with a drop of 160 megatons, or 5% of its total emissions, to reach 2.9 gigatons.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.000
So in 2019, not only did the EU do a better job of lowering its emissions than the U.S.,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.840
it also seems to be decreasing at a much faster rate.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.240
So where did PragerU get its numbers that the EU's emissions have been going up?

02:03.240 --> 02:06.200
Well, turns out there was a little bit of rhetorical trickery here.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.240
The EU released an additional 40 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air that year.

02:12.240 --> 02:18.720
Yet a year later, it turned out that the United States led the world in reducing carbon emissions.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.680
We're not comparing the same years.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.800
The PragerU video is looking at numbers that come from 2017, also cited by the IEA.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.320
But if you look at their list of sources, they quote an article from Scientific American.

02:29.320 --> 02:34.760
I can only imagine the reason PragerU didn't use the primary IEA source in its lengthy

02:34.760 --> 02:38.280
list of sources, is they don't want the few people who actually read these sources

02:38.280 --> 02:42.320
to notice that they're cherry picking data, deliberately choosing one of the U.S.'s better

02:42.320 --> 02:46.120
years and comparing it to one of the EU's worst years, something that would be very

02:46.120 --> 02:49.880
obvious if you were citing two IEA reports from different years.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.520
And now I'm already exhausted.

02:51.520 --> 02:57.320
It took me, what, three minutes to contend with about 30 seconds of nonsense from a PragerU

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
video.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.680
That's why so many responses to PragerU videos, excellent as they may be, tend to stretch

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
on and on.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.400
I didn't even get to the part where it ignores the per capita pollution stats when comparing

03:07.400 --> 03:11.560
the U.S. to China, or even the supposedly extreme goals of the Paris Climate Agreement

03:11.560 --> 03:14.040
don't go nearly far enough to combat climate change.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.440
And if we're talking about reducing emissions, it shouldn't be seen as some sort of global

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
horse race.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.600
It has to be looked at from the context of reducing global emissions in a way that will

03:23.600 --> 03:28.080
positively impact the climate, and reduce the effects of climate change.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.680
So this comparison between the EU and the U.S. as to who's doing a better job when

03:31.680 --> 03:36.680
neither side is doing nearly as much as they should be, is pretty pointless.

03:36.680 --> 03:41.360
And what PragerU videos do so well is stake out a conservative position, present moderation

03:41.360 --> 03:45.840
as being on the extreme left, and then disguise their claims with half-truths and cherry pick

03:45.840 --> 03:46.840
data.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.560
Another result is a YouTube video that's the equivalent of conservative junk food,

03:50.560 --> 03:55.560
no real substance, and arguments that completely sidestep the real issues.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.500
So instead of a lengthy debunk, I want to talk about another PragerU video I found,

04:00.500 --> 04:03.800
one of the emptiest videos I've come across in a while.

04:03.800 --> 04:09.840
It's titled The Intolerance of Tolerance, presented by Greg Kochel.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.400
Before I begin, you might be wondering who Greg Kochel is.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.560
He's been banging on about tolerance meaning something different to the left for close

04:15.560 --> 04:16.960
to 15 years.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.720
He's a Christian apologist who affirms that evangelical Christianity is under direct

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
attack.

04:22.720 --> 04:28.760
In a 2013 speech, also titled The Intolerance of Tolerance, he drops observations like this.

04:28.760 --> 04:35.880
A sentiment, I think, began to change very rapidly regarding two religions.

04:35.880 --> 04:47.040
Suddenly, our culture became much more sympathetic to Islam, and much more hostile to Christianity.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.360
That's a statement so obviously not true, you barely even have to look at the spike

04:51.360 --> 04:56.740
in hate crimes post-9-11 that has consistently stayed above previous levels.

04:56.740 --> 05:00.160
And to look at the other half of his claim, we can look at the numbers against Christians,

05:00.160 --> 05:05.120
and FBI stats from 2013, the year Kochel gave this speech, doesn't get granular enough

05:05.120 --> 05:06.800
to look at evangelicals.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.840
But even if we assume that all Protestants are evangelicals, they represent 3.8% of all

05:11.840 --> 05:18.200
victims of hate crimes, a far cry from the 13.7% of victims being Muslim, especially

05:18.200 --> 05:22.320
when you consider the relative size difference in these two populations.

05:22.320 --> 05:27.260
And as for changes over time, if we compare to the pre-9-11 levels, Protestant Christians

05:27.260 --> 05:31.880
have been around 3.6% of the victims of hate crimes, while back then Muslims were at about

05:31.880 --> 05:33.640
2%.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.960
So while Christian levels have been pretty even, anti-Muslim sentiment is very clearly

05:37.960 --> 05:38.960
going up.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.680
So yeah, this guy isn't exactly one for facts.

05:41.680 --> 05:46.680
And this is a video that will absolutely prove that as he presents us a lot of rhetoric and

05:46.680 --> 05:48.880
almost no facts or evidence.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.040
What's exasperating about this video is how it uses imaginary positions that people

05:53.040 --> 05:54.760
on the left supposedly have.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.760
Here's one example.

05:55.760 --> 06:03.080
To be tolerant today simply means you agree with politically correct, that is, left-wing

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
positions.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.280
That's all it means.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.800
This is easy to show.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.840
Name one position that differs from the left that they don't label intolerant.

06:11.840 --> 06:18.240
The evidence he provides that tolerance is a common refrain among the left is nothing.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.240
Absolutely nothing.

06:19.240 --> 06:24.520
Not even an anecdote, just a vague feeling that this is how the left operates.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.320
It's a thing that could be true, I guess.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.280
But it's hard to really say without any actual evidence about how true it may be.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.280
Intolerance is then attached to a really cringy acronym.

06:35.280 --> 06:43.000
As Dennis Prager puts it, six herb, sexist, intolerant, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.280
racist, bigoted.

06:45.280 --> 06:51.120
So this is framing these labels as personal attacks, supposedly bypassing the actual arguments.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.080
I would sooner argue that these labels are applied as a direct result of the arguments

06:55.080 --> 06:56.080
being made.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.280
So if someone is using a racial stereotype or trying to trot out bogus race science

07:00.280 --> 07:04.520
as part of their argument, a type of rhetoric that has been shown to be damaging to certain

07:04.520 --> 07:08.280
racial groups, why is it wrong to call it racist?

07:08.280 --> 07:11.960
It's possible to use one of those labels incorrectly, of course, but they describe

07:11.960 --> 07:16.480
things that still exist in the real world to deny that they exist, in effect, provides

07:16.480 --> 07:20.080
better camouflage for racists to sneak in their arguments.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.920
Here's another example of how this video misunderstands rhetoric on the left.

07:23.920 --> 07:29.080
The left says all behaviors and ideas have equal value, that no behavior or idea is any

07:29.080 --> 07:30.600
better than any other.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.240
They don't act that way.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.540
I have no idea what he's talking about here.

07:34.540 --> 07:38.880
How can you agree that all ideas are equal when the left supposedly only favors ideas

07:38.880 --> 07:40.120
on the left?

07:40.120 --> 07:43.560
This is obviously being set up to pretend the left is being hypocritical and apply value

07:43.560 --> 07:45.560
judgments just like people on the right do.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.040
The only problem is, no one on the left believes or has ever claimed to believe that all ideas

07:50.560 --> 07:52.520
and behaviors are equal.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.400
Ascribing a belief to the left that isn't true and then calling him up for hypocrisy

07:57.400 --> 08:00.280
that doesn't exist is a complete waste of time.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.980
It's much more convenient for Coco's argument to pretend this is true, and once again we

08:03.980 --> 08:06.640
get no evidence that the left believes any of these things.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.600
We're just supposed to assume that it's true.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.960
Eventually, though, we do get some evidence of the left supposedly using those bad labels

08:13.960 --> 08:15.760
to silence discussion.

08:15.760 --> 08:21.400
Two news stories are cited, one of JK Rowling facing backlash for a comment considered transphobic

08:21.400 --> 08:25.480
and another news story of Martina Navratilova facing similar criticism.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.760
The problem is, when you look at the sources for these stories, you find the criticisms

08:28.760 --> 08:32.960
are pretty fair and make thoughtful responses, they don't just scream transphobe and move

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
on.

08:33.960 --> 08:39.040
The Fox article details why JK Rowling's tweet was transphobic, providing the backstory,

08:39.040 --> 08:43.040
context, and Rowling's own personal history with statements that have upset a segment

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
of her fanbase.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.840
I especially like the one that was directed towards Navratilova after she wrote transgender

08:48.840 --> 08:51.680
women could not fairly compete against cis women.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.560
This comes from Athlete Ally, an advocacy group for LGBTQ people in sports that expelled

08:57.560 --> 09:00.040
Navratilova from their advisory board.

09:00.040 --> 09:05.400
Athlete Ally unequivocally stands on the side of trans athletes and their right to access

09:05.400 --> 09:08.480
and compete in sport free from discrimination.

09:08.480 --> 09:13.400
Martina Navratilova's recent comments on trans athletes are transphobic.

09:13.440 --> 09:18.640
If you stopped reading at transphobic, yeah, I guess it would just seem like they're labeling

09:18.640 --> 09:23.200
her transphobic and calling it a day, but they go on to describe why they use that term

09:23.200 --> 09:25.800
and why it's very fitting to the statements she made.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.000
Based on a false understanding of science and data, and perpetuate dangerous myths that

09:31.000 --> 09:37.160
lead to the ongoing targeting of trans people through discriminatory laws, hateful stereotypes,

09:37.160 --> 09:39.960
and disproportionate violence.

09:39.960 --> 09:45.520
It seems respectful, thoughtful, and reframed for making any personal judgments about Navratilova.

09:45.520 --> 09:50.480
Just because someone says something transphobic doesn't necessarily make them a transphobe,

09:50.480 --> 09:54.760
although I would say it's strong evidence to support that claim, but I respect the restraint

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
here.

09:56.760 --> 10:02.080
Anytime comments can be labeled as hateful, folks like Kocal take it personally.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.720
It seems there is no way to adequately describe anything considering transphobic or bigoted

10:06.720 --> 10:08.760
without running into that problem.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.720
Here is Kocal describing what he hears when he's called intolerant.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.880
The conversation is about Mr. Kocal's personality.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.880
Right?

10:16.880 --> 10:20.920
Mr. Kocal's intolerant, Mr. Kocal's arrogant, Mr. Kocal's narrow-minded.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.520
I guess you're saying that I'm mean.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.200
Whoa, all right!

10:26.200 --> 10:28.880
Why don't I just agree to that?

10:28.880 --> 10:31.800
Why don't I agree with you that I'm really mean?

10:31.800 --> 10:35.600
And then we'll just settle that issue, and we can set it aside, and we can get back to

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
what we're supposed to be talking about here.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.200
Intolerant is often used as a more polite way of describing views that could be considered

10:41.200 --> 10:46.200
bigoted or hateful, not every time of course, but with regard to, say, the earlier examples

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
of J.K.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.200
Rowley and Martina Navratilova, yes, I would say that claiming trans people are not the

10:51.200 --> 10:55.120
gender they say they are, denying their existence and perpetuating a social order

10:55.120 --> 10:59.480
that increases their social isolation, leading to real mental and physical harm, is a form

10:59.480 --> 11:00.480
of intolerance.

11:00.480 --> 11:04.040
It's so much easier to call those statements what they are.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.040
Transphobic.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.800
It doesn't mean that the person saying them has to be thrown into a gulag.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.600
It does mean that they should rethink their comments.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.680
What this video is supposedly arguing for is treating all people as equally valuable,

11:14.680 --> 11:16.080
not their ideas.

11:16.080 --> 11:21.960
True tolerance means we treat all people as equally valuable, with kindness and with

11:21.960 --> 11:27.840
civility and with the freedom to express their ideas, even when we disagree with them.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.480
If we did not challenge J.K.

11:29.480 --> 11:34.000
Rowley or Martina Navratilova when they said things that could be considered transphobic,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.320
or at least didn't challenge them in the ways they used names they didn't like being

11:37.320 --> 11:41.920
called, are we perhaps ignoring the real harm created by transformative rhetoric?

11:41.920 --> 11:46.640
I think it's important to confront people's ideas and label them what they are when they

11:46.640 --> 11:48.800
clearly demonstrate those qualities.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.640
A fuller critique, yes, does go into detail why those things are bad, but to say that

11:53.640 --> 11:59.600
the label itself is shutting down conversation when it really is just a response to a statement,

11:59.600 --> 12:03.640
putting it into a context, and attaching to it an understanding that is being denied by

12:03.640 --> 12:06.240
people who'd rather not these words be applied.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.120
It's not the label that's the problem.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.080
It's what the label represents.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.200
A popular understanding in the culture that they are, in fact, wrong.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.000
And let's not pretend that only the left applies labels to people.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.240
This is obviously not tolerance.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.800
This is blatant intolerance.

12:23.800 --> 12:28.760
Your accusers are guilty of doing exactly the same thing they're accusing you of doing.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.520
If we're going to use this dopey argument that the left uses the word intolerant as

12:32.520 --> 12:37.100
a cudgel to stifle debate, as soon as he applies the label intolerant on me, I could just use

12:37.100 --> 12:41.500
the same tactic he does and say he's trying to hijack the debate, calling me a name, and

12:41.500 --> 12:44.100
I could easily ignore the substance of what he's saying.

12:44.100 --> 12:48.140
I hope you noticed I didn't actually do that, I responded to most of his video here.

12:48.140 --> 12:52.380
I'm not going to pretend my feelings are so badly hurt that being called intolerant

12:52.380 --> 12:57.060
has completely stopped me from making my arguments and countering his.

12:57.060 --> 13:00.820
What this entire discussion is about isn't about the labels, it's the feelings people

13:00.820 --> 13:01.820
have when they're applied.

13:01.820 --> 13:05.740
We're being asked to spare the feelings of people who want impunity to use rhetoric

13:05.740 --> 13:07.380
that harms others.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.040
Videos like this read to me like conservatives are waving the flag of defeat, they have no

13:11.040 --> 13:14.100
real arguments left and are instead trying to police our language.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.460
That's why this video is so devoid of any real substance.

13:16.460 --> 13:21.100
In fact, there's a PragerU video from July of 2018 starring Dave Rubin that says a lot

13:21.100 --> 13:23.340
of the same things already.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.980
It was titled, So You Think You're Tolerant.

13:25.980 --> 13:31.500
The left, sadly, has become utterly intolerant of anyone with whom they disagree.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.660
The videos are so similar that the sources cited are literally copied and pasted from

13:35.660 --> 13:37.020
one video to the next.

13:37.020 --> 13:41.220
The Kokol video also does this to another PragerU video starring Michael Moles.

13:41.220 --> 13:45.720
Technically, this isn't plagiarism because PragerU is just copying itself, but it does

13:45.720 --> 13:49.500
show us how these talking points get repeated with nothing of substance being added, and

13:49.500 --> 13:53.780
that this video is offering no facts or evidence of its own, just recycling the same complaints

13:53.780 --> 13:55.460
as seen in other videos.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.780
Looking at the list of sources for the Kokol video, we can see how much effort went into

13:58.780 --> 13:59.860
his thesis.

13:59.860 --> 14:03.740
Of the 24 sources cited, here are the unique ones.

14:03.740 --> 14:08.340
We have the Vox article on J.K. Rowling and the Nation article on Martina Navratilova.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.100
There are three other PragerU videos cited.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.940
There's a quotation from philosophy professor Peter Krieft.

14:14.940 --> 14:19.260
Kokol cites the YouTube speech I pulled clips from in this video, and he cites his own website

14:19.260 --> 14:20.740
five times.

14:20.740 --> 14:23.020
Of those five links, four of them are broken, by the way.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.420
You might want to get that fixed.

14:24.420 --> 14:29.340
I'd say something quick about citing yourself that's actually a completely legitimate move.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.900
If you're citing something published through a third party, like an academic journal or

14:32.900 --> 14:38.660
reputable media outlet, but citing your own website or your own speech, that adds nothing.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.260
That's just you saying the same thing twice.

14:41.260 --> 14:46.660
The other 11 sources are lifted directly from other pages, sometimes copied and pasted verbatim,

14:46.660 --> 14:50.020
often referring to news stories that aren't mentioned in the video at all.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.300
Not that anyone reads these sources, of course.

14:52.300 --> 14:56.140
One of the sources cited is a video by Michael Knowles, and when I clicked on it, I saw it

14:56.140 --> 14:57.780
had 46 views.

14:57.780 --> 15:01.620
To sum this up, this video is devoid of value and free of facts and effort.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.680
It is conservative junk food.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.980
As a small code up to my people on the left, sometimes we can be a little mean and could

15:08.980 --> 15:13.620
be a little bit nicer, but don't fall for these sort of crocodile tears from people

15:13.620 --> 15:17.820
on the right who say they simply cannot engage with debate on the left because we use these

15:17.820 --> 15:18.820
mean names.

15:18.820 --> 15:24.120
It's just a trick to get us to stop using terms that have real value and impact.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.140
The statement from Athlete Ally summed it up so beautifully.

15:27.140 --> 15:31.200
When we use the word transphobic, we're describing something that's presenting a false understanding

15:31.200 --> 15:35.320
of science and data that perpetuates dangerous myths that leads to the ongoing targeting

15:35.320 --> 15:39.560
of trans people through discriminatory laws, hateful stereotypes, and disproportionate

15:39.560 --> 15:40.640
violence.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.360
That's what the word transphobic means.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.220
When people say we use it to shut down arguments, that's not true.

15:46.220 --> 15:50.820
We're responding to their statements by describing them for what they actually are.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.500
They want to pretend transphobic means nothing.

15:53.500 --> 15:58.280
That seems more like them shutting down the argument because we used a word that they

15:58.280 --> 15:59.560
simply don't like.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.240
Yeah, another short video.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.360
I don't know if I'm going to make this a habit or not, but this was fun to make.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.840
And this one was a little rough around the edges.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.000
I hope not too rough.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.400
The big video is still coming.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.560
I don't know when, sadly, maybe in the next three weeks.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.360
I hope I genuinely don't know.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.720
It's another one of my sitcom retrospectives.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.320
It's literally the longest video I've ever done.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.040
And I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.920
I think it's one of my better videos, so I really hope people will see it soon.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.200
And for people wondering when the next conservative book review is coming, I am halfway through

16:34.200 --> 16:38.200
a book that is just the most racist thing I've ever read.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.200
It's...

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
It's...

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
Wow.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.200
It's going to be a wild one.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.720
Everyone should look forward to that.

16:43.720 --> 16:48.280
The lovely names you now see moving up the screen are my delightful patrons.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.440
If you would like to be one of these delightful people, you can head over to my Patreon and

16:52.440 --> 16:55.040
sign up for a monthly donation.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.600
Once again, please only do this if it's something you can financially do.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.600
These are trying times.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.720
So if this isn't a realistic option for you, don't do it.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.320
But if it is, I appreciate anything anyone can spare.

17:07.320 --> 17:11.360
If you would like to support this channel in some way that doesn't involve signing

17:11.360 --> 17:16.080
up to my Patreon, you can do the YouTube usual, as I've just decided I'm going to call it

17:16.080 --> 17:20.920
like, comment, and if you haven't already, subscribe, and hit the bell.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.840
If you'd like to leave a comment but don't know what to say, tell me what your favorite

17:23.840 --> 17:26.400
song is, and I will listen to it.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
That sounds fun.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.760
Thank you everyone for watching, and I hope you all have a lovely day.
