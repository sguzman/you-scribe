0	4600	In 1993, Boy Meets World debuted, telling the story of Corey Matthews as he navigated
4600	7200	the troubled waters of childhood into adulthood.
7200	11400	Though never a breakout hit, it was a fixture Friday nights, running for seven seasons following
11400	13960	Corey and his friends from middle school to college.
13960	17560	After the show ended, it surprisingly got even more popular through syndication, with
17560	21360	its blend of a classic coming-of-age story and nostalgia for a time when the world seemed
21360	22800	like a much kinder place.
22800	27360	To tell the story of Boy Meets World though, we need to start with the story of TGIF, the
27360	30640	programming block on ABC where Boy Meets World debuted.
30640	35000	ABC had long been a home for comedy on Friday nights, from The Adventures of Ozzy and Harriet
35000	36000	to The Brady Bunch.
36000	41400	In the late 1980s, ABC stood in contrast to rival networks NBC and CBS, which had more
41400	44880	dramatic programming on the evening, so they came up with a promotional hook that would
44880	48720	distinguish them from their rival networks, emphasizing the family-friendly nature of
48720	49880	their comedy lineup.
49880	53120	Bob Iger, president of ABC Entertainment at the time, explained,
53480	57760	A lot of families weren't watching TV together as much as when I was growing up, but I thought,
57760	61080	if we could program shows where parents and kids could watch together, we'd be better
61080	62960	off from a ratings perspective.
62960	68080	It would be named TGIF, which stood for Thank Goodness It's Funny, and more than just a
68080	71400	name, what would connect these shows would be a series of promotional spots where the
71400	75560	cast from each respective program would serve as hosts for the night, as if they were sitting
75560	78880	alongside the audience in their home watching the shows with them.
78880	84720	TGIF debuted in 1989, and its first lineup of shows included Full House, Family Matters,
84720	87040	Perfect Strangers, and Just the Ten of Us.
87040	91400	TGIF was a massive hit, particularly with younger audiences, and part of what made it
91400	95600	so successful is that once a family sat down to watch TGIF, they usually stuck around for
95600	96600	the whole night.
96600	98680	TGIF's lineup would change over the years.
98680	102640	Its earlier years would include shows such as Step by Step and Dinosaurs, and its later
102640	107520	years with Cianad, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Sister Sister, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
107520	112960	All of these shows had a distinct family-friendly feel, they also featured a number of fun crossovers.
112960	116200	Family Matters, for instance, was already a spin-off of Perfect Strangers, so it was
116200	118480	no surprise to see those characters crossover.
118480	122360	But we would also see Steve Urkel show up on Full House and Step by Step, and Michelle
122360	125440	from Full House would pop up on Hangin' with Mr. Cooper.
125440	129480	While all of these shows deserve their place in discussions about TGIF, there is one show
129480	134200	that embodied the spirit of TGIF, and that show is Boy Meets World.
134200	138360	Although Boy Meets World was not the breakout hit of this night, it was the only long-running
138360	143360	show that debuted and ended as part of the TGIF Friday night lineup.
143360	147560	Boy Meets World was destined to be a TGIF show before it was even an idea.
147560	152000	Series creator Michael Jacobs had been working on Dinosaurs for ABC's TGIF before it was
152000	156160	moved to Wednesday Nights, a move, by the way, Jacobs considers the reason that particular
156160	158560	series only ran for four seasons.
158560	162440	Dinosaurs' big numbers with families on Friday nights motivated Disney to task Jacobs
162440	165760	with developing a show for the 12-14-year-old demographic.
165760	169680	He thought of other family shows such as Family Ties and Growing Pains, which focused on the
169680	171240	oldest childhood of family.
171240	173040	Jacobs had another idea, though.
173040	174240	In an interview, he said,
174240	176080	What if we did a different structure?
176080	179680	What if we took a middle child and instead of focusing on the first date aspect of the
179680	182520	older child, he was looking at it as a betrayal?
182520	187080	Jacobs contacted ABC to find out who they had under contract, and the one kid they had available
187080	191800	was Ben Savage, who at the time was only thought of as the younger brother of Fred Savage,
191800	194480	the current star of the TV series The Wonder Years.
194480	198040	Jacobs and Savage immediately hit it off, and the series quickly took shape.
198040	200240	Jacobs describes the series at its beginning.
200240	204440	What if there's a kid who is an everyman who loses his touchstone, his older brother,
204440	206520	and he's lost and confused in the world?
206520	210600	With the premise established, Jacobs teamed with veteran writer April Kelly to pen the
210600	214480	first episode of the series, and it was soon time to cast the show.
214480	218320	Naturally, Ben Savage would play the lead, Corey Matthews, the middle child of the Matthews
218320	219320	family.
219320	220960	Corey starts the show in sixth grade.
220960	225160	He's an energetic kid who is less than committed to his schoolwork, and happily sits as the
225160	229560	every kid everyone watching was supposed to identify with as he started taking his first
229560	231480	steps into the big world around him.
231480	235520	Apparently, he'd rather listen to the baseball game on the radio than try to understand the
235520	238160	emotional content of Romeo and Juliet.
238160	239160	Mom, I'm a kid!
239160	243320	I don't understand the emotional content of Full House!
243320	247580	William Daniels played George Feeney, or more commonly, Mr. Feeney, and he was based
247580	250440	on a drama teacher Michael Jacobs had had in high school.
250440	254000	Although Daniels expressed reluctance when he was offered the role, he accepted once
254000	258120	he learned that, in spite of his name, the character of Mr. Feeney would not be mocking
258120	262160	teachers but rather demonstrating the profound impact they have on young minds.
262160	266040	Not only Corey's teacher, Mr. Feeney lived next door to the Matthews home, meaning that,
266040	270320	no matter where Corey went, he could never escape his watchful eye or sage advice.
270320	273920	You know, you're not doing your body any favors loading up on junk like that.
273920	278440	Oh, thanks Mr. Feeney, and please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink you're sucking down.
280520	285680	There's no gravity in space, Mr. Matthews, therefore astronauts suck up.
285680	287680	Learn from them.
287680	290520	Corey's older brother, Eric, was played by Will Friedel.
290520	293600	Although Friedel wasn't the first choice for the role, after the pilot was shot, the
293600	295720	role was recast and given to Friedel instead.
295720	298880	Friedel was given the role because he was taller than the first actor, and they didn't
298880	301400	want Corey growing up to be taller than his older brother.
301400	304920	Eric begins the series as the date-obsessed older brother, that over the years he would
304920	307400	become one of the goofier members of the cast.
307400	309720	Like I don't have anything else in my mind but girls.
309840	312960	Look, I got a lot of other things in my mind besides girls.
312960	313960	A lot of other things.
313960	317120	There's like, girl, girl, right there, right there!
317120	320120	Ryder Strong was cast to play Corey's best friend, Sean Hunter.
320120	324200	According to Michael Jacobs, Strong was the first and only boy he considered for the role.
324200	327920	Sean is the rebellious best friend with a troubled home life, in stark contrast to the
327920	329680	more wholesome Matthews household.
329680	332040	Stacey says you should have watched it up 45 minutes ago.
332040	333040	Ahhh!
333040	335720	Stacey says you shouldn't have left it in so long.
335720	338480	Stacey says why didn't you two idiots read the label?
338600	340120	Oh, thanks Stacey.
340120	345240	Lee Norris played class nerd Minkus, a foil and sometimes friend for Corey and Sean.
345240	349160	Minkus would only be around in the first season, though he would have a memorable cameo later
349160	350160	in the series.
350160	355200	You are gonna live in the lap of luxury because I am a provider, babe.
355200	358040	Lily Nixay played Morgan, Corey's younger sister.
358040	361440	The Morgan type character was a staple of the family sitcom, being the adorable little
361440	364080	kid who would come in to deliver a few cute one-liners.
364080	367240	Hey, go to the game with my sister and her doll!
367240	368240	Great!
368320	371880	Maybe during the seventh inning stretch, I could run through the stadium in my old Spider-Man
371880	372880	underwear.
372880	377280	Well, you don't have to dress up for me.
377280	379480	Betsy Randall played Amy, Corey's mother.
379480	383320	Randall at the time had appeared on a handful of other sitcoms, most notably with a recurring
383320	384600	role in Home Improvement.
384600	388160	Amy would provide guidance to all of her kids throughout the series' run.
388160	393480	Let's see, when you have your 20th high school reunion, I'll be...
393480	394480	44th.
394480	397600	Mom, how can that be possible?
397600	398600	You're already...
398600	399600	It's possible.
399600	403120	It's not only possible, it's the way it's going to be.
403120	405720	William Russ played Corey's father, Alan.
405720	409360	Much like the role of Eric, Alan was also recast after a test pilot.
409360	413920	And much like Amy, Alan would provide words of wisdom to his children, often being highlighted
413920	416560	as the male role model for young Corey.
416560	418560	Remember before the children?
418560	420120	Before we were married?
420120	421760	Before we knew each other?
421760	424760	Remember how happy we were?
424760	428840	Although she wasn't a part of the original principal cast, it would be impossible not
428840	433240	to mention the season 1 recurring character, Topanga Lawrence, played by Daniel Fischl.
433240	436760	Taking her name from a canyon in California that Michael Jacobs happened upon while on
436760	441460	a drive, Topanga is a free spirit who is in stark contrast to Corey and Sean.
441460	445080	She would be the love interest for Corey when she joined the principal cast in season 2.
445080	447120	Topanga's triple teamed at the timeline.
447120	451400	She breaks the trap, heads to the top of the key and leaps toward the basket, doing a spiraling
451400	452400	Tomahawk 360!
452400	453400	Slam dunk!
453400	463760	A number of other characters would be introduced throughout the show's run.
463760	470880	But for season 1, these were the characters Corey would be meeting the world alongside.
470880	476000	On September 24th, 1993, Boy Meets World debuted with its pilot episode, creatively titled
476000	477160	Pilot.
477160	480720	This episode's plot used the very example Michael Jacobs referenced when talking about
480720	484600	his idea for the series, with Corey feeling betrayed when Eric takes a date to a baseball
484600	493320	game instead of his younger brother.
493320	497360	Corey's feeling of betrayal manifests into a skepticism towards love in general.
497360	501080	And in a fitting lesson, his class happens to be learning about Romeo and Juliet.
501080	505200	When he accidentally sees Mr. Feeny was stood up for a date, Corey throws that in his teacher's
505200	515520	face as part of his stand against love.
515520	534080	Feeny gives us the first of many speeches where he tries to impart some wisdom to Corey.
534080	537720	When Eric reveals his date was a failure, Corey applies the lesson he learned from Mr.
537720	553200	Feeny and encourages his older brother not to give up on love.
553200	556120	Corey's understanding of the world around him is expanding, and the first lesson in
556120	558080	the pilot is about the power of love.
558080	561560	In other shows, this would be shown by Corey going on a date, but in this case, it's Corey
561560	566120	seeing his brother go on a date and getting a glimpse of Mr. Feeny having a romantic tryst,
566120	568960	even if the salad dinner was actually going to be with his sister.
568960	572560	Rather than experience the world directly, Corey is in the enviable position of getting
572560	574960	a lesson about the world before diving into it.
574960	577920	This is part of the reason Mr. Feeny has such a big role in the series.
577920	581920	Mr. Feeny is teaching these kids lessons about how the world works before they step into
581920	585520	it themselves, much like the kids who would be watching the series at home would be learning
585520	588980	lessons from seeing Corey learn them on TV.
588980	592820	The pilot episode has a heavy emphasis on Corey's home life, but as the series progressed,
592820	595220	the focus would switch more to school and his friends.
595220	598620	The series was still a few episodes from stepping on that path, but we could see how the theme
598620	601780	of learning about the world was still a core of its identity.
601780	605460	The original script for the pilot didn't impress William Daniels.
605460	608460	Speaking in an interview with People.com, Daniels explained,
608460	611120	"...Michael and I are very close.
611120	614700	He likes to tell the story that we had one read-through of the rehearsal and I went to
614700	618460	his office and I quit, and he said, Bill, that was just a read-through.
618460	623180	I said, yeah, but he said, listen to me, I'm going to rework this tonight and you tell
623180	624180	me tomorrow.
624180	627260	If you want to quit, okay, but wait until I revise it.
627260	630660	So the next day, the whole thing, it was different.
630660	632300	He rewrote the damn thing.
632300	633340	So I stayed."
633340	637380	That adaptability, along with a solid premise, gave Boy Meets World a flexibility that allowed
637380	640660	it to change over the years to adapt its theme to new dynamics.
640660	645100	And a few of those new dynamics were introduced very quickly in season one with the key episode,
645100	646600	Corey's Alternative Friends.
646600	648880	In this episode, we're introduced to Topanga.
648880	651880	"- Give me your hand.
651880	652960	Why?
652960	661240	I want to see if our energies converge.
661240	662920	He's vibrationally acceptable."
662920	667240	Whereas Sean is Corey's partner in crime as the average back row slacker, Topanga is
667240	669000	completely unlike Corey.
669000	671920	She's willing to stand out when Corey would rather blend in.
671920	675360	"- People make fun of you, Topanga.
675360	677600	No, I couldn't take it.
677600	678800	I just want to blend in.
678800	681800	Well, you're sure good at it.
681800	687360	You look like all the other plain-wrapped kids at school, except for your red hat.
687360	689200	Hey, I got that on cat night.
689200	692800	I had to wait an hour in line.
692800	700400	Well, if it's important to you, then it's beautiful."
700400	704280	After a hair styling accident, all part of an attempt by Corey to blend in with the other
704280	707480	kids, he learns the importance of being true to one's inner self.
707480	710960	And he also learns the value of his social conscience when he helps Topanga and her friends
710960	714720	create a blockade to keep the school librarian from being replaced.
714720	718640	Corey also finds out that there might be more to him in Topanga than a passing friendship.
718640	722480	"- Sometimes, the reluctant warrior is the bravest warrior.
722480	731200	You're not gonna, like, kiss me now, are you?
731200	732200	Would it be your first kiss?
732200	733200	Hey, don't come near me.
733200	741840	Because it would be interesting if all your life you remembered that your first kiss happened
741840	743520	when you thought you looked weird.
743520	747800	I would have to feel I really knew the person and that I liked him.
747800	748800	Good.
748800	749800	Good."
749800	763920	Although it would be some time before we saw how this romance would play out, it was
763920	768440	here we first got a glimpse of this key relationship, the Corey and Topanga romance.
768440	772040	And while the kiss at the end is probably most remembered by audiences, the small moment
772040	774840	they share at the end of the episode was also sweet.
774840	778120	What makes this relationship interesting is how the power dynamics are inverted.
778120	781920	It might be because of their age or Topanga just generally having a strong will, but it
781920	786000	is at odds with the more traditional stories where the boy makes the first move.
786000	789640	And the broader lesson for Corey here is how someone can enter his life and turn it completely
789640	790760	upside down.
790760	794520	The show may be titled Boy Meets World, but sometimes it's the world that's meeting
794520	795520	the boy.
795520	799160	And while Corey can't control someone such as Topanga, he can control his reaction to
799160	802560	her and use this chance to learn more about himself in the process.
802560	805840	The Topanga character wasn't intended to be a major part of the series, but would be
805840	809520	written into a number of episodes for the first season, one of the producers, Jeff
809520	810520	Manal explains.
810520	812520	When their hands touch, there's a spark.
812520	816600	They had chemistry, the two kids, the actors, so we just kept writing storylines and I think
816600	818400	it progressed as a natural thing.
818400	822480	The episode shifted Boy Meets World more towards school life for Corey and his friends, which
822480	825840	is only natural is that this is the setting where change happens in a young person's
825840	829500	life, a safe staging area for the big changes of the real world.
829500	832360	Another key change in this episode was the role of Sean.
832400	835560	In the first few episodes of this series, we see Corey and Sean with a rotating third
835560	836560	friend.
836560	839320	None of these third kids ever quite worked out, and though a third friend was written
839320	843000	for Corey's alternative friends, the actor who was supposed to play him was fired and
843000	844880	all of his lines were given to Sean.
844880	848660	This created space for what would be another of the show's most important relationships,
848660	850260	the Corey and Sean friendship.
850260	852680	There were still a few rough edges this early in the series.
852680	857000	Sean, for instance, makes reference to a sister we will never hear about again, apparently
857000	860840	an artifact from the lines of the third kid in the episode's original script.
860840	864680	We also get a sense of Sean having a similar middle-class life to Corey, only he's a
864680	866600	bit taller with better hair.
866600	870240	Over time we would learn a lot more about Sean and his unique circumstances, but this
870240	873400	episode was about establishing the close friendship that these two have.
873400	877920	There were a few key episodes in season one that would establish who Sean was as a character.
877920	881360	In Santa's Little Helper, we find out that Sean's father has lost his job.
881960	893520	In addition to the financial strain Sean faces at home, we also find out that Sean has his
893520	898000	tendency to be a bit more rebellious than Corey in the episode titled The Fugitive, where
898000	899480	he blows up a mailbox.
911360	924480	Both of these episodes would establish important parts of the Corey and Sean friendship.
924480	928520	They raise questions for Corey on how to best stand by his friend when he needs support
928520	931880	because of his difficult life, and how best to steer him on the right path when something
931880	932880	goes wrong.
932880	947880	The importance of this friendship reveals that lesson about how to navigate the world
947880	952280	aren't just imparted to kids from wise adults, such as Mr. Feeney, but also learned from
952280	956480	other kids, such as Corey being a positive influence to Sean, and in some ways, Sean
956480	959760	serving as a lesson on what type of behavior to avoid.
959760	963040	As the series is focusing on that journey to adulthood, it's important to ask how
963040	966440	it plots that route out for its characters, and with something as important as raising
966440	970680	the next generation of adults, in its first season, Boy Meets World plays it safe, and
970680	972720	it takes certain assumptions for granted.
972720	975760	The Matthews family lives in a suburban Philadelphia neighborhood.
975760	979960	The kids have their basics met, their school is well-equipped, and they embody typical
979960	982160	American TV sitcom values.
982160	986600	Their major influences in life are their friends, family, and teachers.
986600	990720	And those influences are all within a greater context of an idealized world for those kids
990720	994840	to grow in without facing any traumatic hardships, at least in the first season.
994840	1014720	In the episode Model Family, it opens with a clip from the 1950s sitcom Leave it to Beaver.
1014720	1019120	This episode offers the kids a chance to roleplay the parts of a model family.
1019120	1022720	The message of the episode is that family lives are complicated and not the tidy package
1022720	1023720	you see on TV.
1023720	1028040	Only it doesn't really work as the Matthews family, for all its modern faults, is still
1028040	1029040	ideal.
1029040	1032800	The parents are happily married, there's no sign of financial strain, and they generally
1032800	1035260	all have happy, positive lives.
1035260	1039520	This is the comfy white middle-class family that the America of the 90s treated pretty
1039520	1042280	well, at least compared to other families.
1042280	1045780	Leave it to Beaver and the first season of Boy Meets World are both operated in the same
1045780	1050200	kind of world, one where certain norms keep the Cleavers and the Matthews from facing
1050200	1069400	financial ruin or other traumas.
1069400	1072680	While the writing may have changed, the premise is still the same, asking the question of
1072680	1075200	how children become adults in the modern American world.
1075200	1079040	In its first season, the show does very little to question the modern American world, instead
1079040	1082520	taking its assumption of a comfortable middle-class suburbia for granted.
1082520	1087000	As an example, in the episode Risky Business, Cory and Sean are tasked with starting a business
1087000	1101400	and instead bet on a horse race.
1101400	1105140	Cory and Sean learn the positive impact of risks, though the lesson is turned on its
1105140	1115420	head when Cory risks leaving Morgan at home alone, and she breaks a window.
1115420	1133460	And they learn an important lesson about taking risks.
1133460	1137620	This episode reinforces the American cliché of being a self-starter, with Cory and Sean's
1137620	1140060	business strategy literally being a gamble.
1140060	1143420	And the reason it isn't necessarily a bad thing is because it was an amount of money
1143420	1144820	they could afford to lose.
1144820	1148880	The irreplaceable Morgan, on the other hand, was a very bad thing to risk.
1148880	1151340	This raises an interesting question, though.
1151340	1154160	What about people who can't afford to take risks?
1154160	1158220	This lesson at a larger scale would mean more than gambling on a horse, it would mean gambling
1158220	1162440	on yourself and risking personal finance chasing business success.
1162440	1165660	After all, that was the lesson for the kids, how they would turn a small investment into
1165660	1166980	a thriving business.
1166980	1171060	But anyone without the resources to start a business doesn't really have access to
1171060	1172100	this kind of risk.
1172100	1175820	Or rather, even if they have those resources, they may not be able to afford to lose them
1175820	1176820	at all.
1176820	1181300	It reveals this lesson, which seems universal, to rather be a reflection of the class dynamics
1181300	1185300	that afford some people that have the means to take risks while others don't.
1185300	1188820	In this way, the first season of Boy Meets World reveals itself to be a deeply conservative
1188820	1193660	show, taking the status quo of its world for granted to teach lessons that are less universal
1193660	1196060	when stepping outside of the bubble it creates.
1196060	1199260	This isn't to say the show didn't at least make some attempts at making contemporary
1199260	1200260	critiques.
1200260	1204140	In the episode, Teachers Bet, Mr. Feeny challenges Corey with teaching the rest of the class
1204140	1208060	ahead of an upcoming test, with the promise of a nude bike if he can get more kids to
1208060	1209220	pass the test.
1209220	1212820	As the class spirals out of control, Corey tries to regain some of it, and he's forced
1212820	1216180	to learn the material more deeply so he can teach it to his fellow students.
1216180	1220460	And the class's particular lesson for this week is on discrimination.
1220460	1224380	Corey struggles, as he's under the assumption that discrimination is a thing of the past,
1224380	1238420	until something happens to Eric's girlfriend Linda.
1238420	1242380	When Corey tries to teach the class about discrimination, he uses an unconventional
1242380	1243380	method.
1243380	1267620	He calls Sean an anti-Italian racial slur.
1267620	1286620	The number of kids who passed was the same as last time, so Corey doesn't win the bet,
1286620	1290380	but that's a pretty good result, considering Corey is just a kid and he apparently teaches
1290380	1293140	just as well as Mr. Feeny, for one test anyway.
1293140	1297500	Corey's methods are extreme, and the sort that would only work among kids, as a teacher
1297500	1301140	using a racial slur on a student would take a different tone.
1301140	1304860	But it does highlight how the show is willing to acknowledge an issue like prejudice, albeit
1304860	1309340	from the perspective of a group of characters who are largely only talking about it hypothetically
1309340	1310540	in a classroom setting.
1310540	1315620	It also at least introduces us to Linda putting a face to an actual victim of discrimination,
1315620	1318140	though her guest role wouldn't last more than this episode.
1318140	1321140	And it speaks volumes that the show had to bring in a whole new character to even have
1321140	1324980	the means of directly approaching the topic of racial discrimination.
1324980	1328700	In this way, Boy Meets World was able to tackle an important issue, though its work
1328700	1332900	is really just in uncovering that truth that discrimination still exists in the modern
1332900	1336060	day, which is, of course, very valuable to know.
1336060	1339020	But it doesn't take it much further than that, it doesn't explore where these ideas
1339020	1342540	come from, the systems that uphold them, or how to undermine them.
1342540	1347700	Though fair enough, perhaps it's worth stepping back and acknowledging that such a deep dive
1347700	1351420	in discrimination is a bit too much for an 11 year old.
1351420	1354620	Episodes such as these reveal the series wasn't afraid of varying away from the silly
1354620	1359060	or comedic associated with sitcoms that focus on kids, and in the future, the series would
1359060	1361300	more fully embrace weightier subjects.
1361300	1364940	The first season of Boy Meets World is a bit of an outlier, clearly geared toward a younger
1364940	1368720	audience and the only season before the teen years of Cory and his friends.
1368720	1372240	That may be why it played it so safe, taking a very conventional approach to depicting
1372240	1375260	the precarious journey from childhood to adulthood.
1375260	1380940	Later seasons would be far more daring.
1380940	1383440	Season 2 brought with it a number of major changes.
1383440	1386940	Most importantly, Cory and his friends would be going to high school, although we wouldn't
1386940	1389220	be watching all of their high school journeys.
1389220	1393900	The character Stuart Minkus exited the series after season 1, and he would be replaced by
1393900	1394900	Topanga.
1394900	1396840	This wasn't based on a competing spot, though.
1396840	1401460	At the same time, on Family Matters, the character of Steve Urkel was massively popular.
1401460	1405700	Minkus was considered too similar to Urkel, and so he was cut from the show.
1405700	1408540	Season 2 also brought a number of new faces as well.
1408620	1413500	Cory and Sean were confronted by their first bully, Harley Keiner, played by Danny McNulty,
1413500	1419260	flanked by his henchmen, Joey, played by Blake Soper, and Frankie, played by Ethan Suppley.
1419260	1423820	Anthony Tyler Quinn joined the principal cast as the high school English teacher, Jonathan
1423820	1428220	Turner, a young teacher who adopts a different approach from last year's Mr. Feeney.
1438540	1448620	This doesn't mean Mr. Feeney would be leaving us, though.
1448620	1452980	Not only was he transferred to the same school Cory and Sean went to, John Adams High School,
1452980	1461300	but he would be pulling double duty as both history teacher and school principal.
1461300	1463380	The cast weren't the only ones changing, though.
1463380	1465660	The audience was starting to change alongside them.
1465660	1467940	Michael Jacobs explained in an interview.
1467940	1472580	At the beginning of the series, Sean, Feeney, and Topango all tested higher than Cory Matthews,
1472580	1475020	because these were the characters that viewers understood.
1475020	1476820	You understood Sean immediately.
1476820	1480020	You understood Topanga as odd and lovely and wonderful.
1480020	1481580	Feeney was the authority figure.
1481580	1486780	He tested highest, even with kids, but by the second season, Cory eclipsed everybody.
1486780	1490460	What happened was, the kids wanted to be Sean and wanted to be Topanga.
1490460	1493060	They don't want to say they want to be what they are.
1493060	1497900	Cory became a hero for Beat himself, and everybody flocked to the fact that, wait, I have potential
1498260	1499740	in just being who I am.
1499740	1502860	And kids were finally honest enough to answer the question correctly.
1502860	1504460	Who do I associate with?
1504460	1506860	I am Cory Matthews.
1506860	1510380	As the audience found its footing, so did the series, and Boy Meets World began to grow
1510380	1514820	into a more sophisticated show, speaking to the real issues and concerns facing kids who
1514820	1518700	no longer saw the series as solely aspirational, but rather something that reflected their
1518700	1519700	own lives.
1519700	1524420	And the character of Sean Hunter would serve as a lesson in how things can go wrong.
1524420	1528300	Although he blew up a mailbox and faced some financial hardship in season one, it's
1528300	1532220	seasons two and three that really establish how Sean's life differs from Cory's.
1532220	1536020	Actor Ryder Strong explained his interpretation of Sean in an interview, saying,
1548020	1552820	Obviously, within the confines of a safe family sitcom, so it's not like Sean was shooting
1552820	1554260	up or killing people.
1554260	1557660	While Sean wasn't about to blow up a mailbox every week on the show, he did continue to
1557660	1562300	engage in some low-level hijinks, like changing the school paper's headline to a solid burn
1562300	1563380	on Mr. Feeny.
1569780	1573100	The headline is traced to Cory, who decides to cover for Sean, and the episode is about
1573100	1575780	not writing out your friend when they do something wrong.
1575780	1579380	And by something wrong, in this case, they mean something totally awesome.
1579380	1583060	While Cory is the positive influence keeping Sean from screwing up too badly, the limits
1583060	1587100	of that are tested as the bullies present an alternative in the episode, Wrong Side
1587100	1588100	of the Tracks.
1588100	1591060	Look, I just think you're gonna have a problem if you hang out with guys like that.
1591060	1593140	Yeah, well they happen to be my kind of guys, okay?
1593140	1594140	We're part of the same circle.
1594140	1595140	Look, Sean.
1595140	1596140	Cory.
1596140	1597540	Let go.
1597540	1601140	We find out that Sean believes his own future has already been decided.
1601140	1606140	Cory, you and I are different, and sooner or later we're gonna end up in different places.
1606140	1607140	Says who?
1607140	1610420	Why don't we both just do us a favor right now and call it quits, okay?
1610420	1611820	What has gotten into you?
1611820	1613700	You just don't get it, do you?
1613700	1614700	Get what?
1614700	1615700	Look at your house, Cory.
1615700	1616700	Look at where you live.
1616700	1617700	Look at where I live.
1617700	1618700	Look at your parents.
1618700	1619700	Look at my parents.
1619700	1620700	I know where I'm gonna end up.
1620700	1621700	Just let me get there now.
1621700	1622700	Sean!
1622700	1627820	Just let me get there now!
1627820	1631660	What's interesting about Sean's turn away from Cory is not that Cory is a bad friend,
1631660	1635060	as we just saw Cory willing to take the fall for Sean in an earlier episode.
1635060	1638900	This is about how Sean sees himself, and how he doesn't consider a guy like him good enough
1638900	1640940	to be friends with a guy like Cory.
1640980	1645100	Ironically, Sean wants to stop hanging around Cory because he cares enough to not want to
1645100	1647720	drag him down with the path he assumes he's on.
1647720	1650980	For all of Cory's work to help his friend, it's not quite enough to steer Sean in the
1650980	1653580	right direction, as the influence of the bullies increases.
1653580	1655500	If you're gonna do this, Sean, then I'm gonna do it.
1655500	1656500	This is not your place, okay?
1656500	1657500	What are you saying?
1657500	1658500	I don't belong here?
1658500	1659500	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
1659500	1661500	Look, if you belong here, then I belong here.
1661500	1664460	Hey, baboon, look, we got some business here, alright?
1664460	1667500	So I suggest that you walk away while your legs still bend only once.
1667500	1669860	Listen, Kyle, this is between me and Sean.
1669860	1682820	Luckily for Sean, and Cory's face, Mr. Turner shows up to talk some sense into Sean.
1700860	1703860	Can you drag the trailer park trash up the decent society?
1703860	1706860	Hey, if you don't know that deep down inside, you're alright.
1707860	1709860	And I haven't taught you anything at all.
1711860	1712860	You think I'm alright?
1712860	1714860	I think you need to think you're alright.
1715860	1717860	You think I'm alright?
1719860	1725860	I think, if you put your mind to it and get back inside that school, and never, never
1725860	1728860	go near this Harley, or that Harley.
1729860	1732860	Yeah, I think you'll be alright.
1732860	1736860	What was so great about this episode is that it reveals Sean's bad behaviour isn't a
1736860	1741860	product of some inner drive to be a bad kid, but rather a reflection of how Sean sees himself
1741860	1742860	through the world around him.
1742860	1746860	All the jokes and comments about being poor and not getting good grades reinforce the
1746860	1749860	idea that Sean's not someone who's going to succeed in life.
1749860	1753860	And as his performance worsens, those messages get louder and louder.
1753860	1756860	And the only way to break the cycle is for people in his life to show him that he's
1756860	1758860	worth more than what the world is telling him.
1758860	1763860	Implicit in this is a condemnation of a society that lets any kid feel lesser than some social
1763860	1767860	standard because they may not be excelling at school, or they come from a less privileged
1767860	1768860	background.
1768860	1771860	Although the series doesn't explore these topics directly in this episode, it does become
1771860	1773860	more explicit as the show progresses.
1773860	1777860	And the pensive expression on Mr. Turner's face at the end of the episode reveals that
1777860	1780860	this issue hasn't been entirely settled.
1780860	1784860	The two episodes at the end of season 2, Career Day and Home, further emphasize the unfolding
1784860	1788860	tragedy of Sean's life when his mother runs off with the family's mobile home,
1788860	1791860	and Chet's father chases after her, leaving Sean behind.
1791860	1794860	Chet Hunter is played by Blake Clark.
1794860	1814860	Sean ends up staying with the Matthews family, and we quickly find out that situation is not ideal.
1824860	1830860	With hospitality wearing thin at the Matthews home, Sean decides to take up Mr. Turner's
1830860	1834860	offer for a place to stay, and when Sean finds out that his father isn't coming back any
1834860	1837860	time soon, that offer becomes more permanent.
1855860	1862860	This episode completes the second season's arc for Mr. Turner and Sean, as the two branch
1862860	1864860	off into some of their own stories for the third season.
1864860	1868860	But what's worth highlighting here is how the characters of Mr. Turner and Sean are
1868860	1871860	wildly different in what they represent in the real world.
1871860	1875860	Sean's experience is common enough that we could expect to see it in the real world today.
1875860	1879860	A kid who's told he'll never amount to anything because he's poorer then goes on to
1879860	1881860	live down to those expectations.
1881860	1885860	Mr. Turner is a teacher who takes an interest in helping that kid, which does certainly
1885860	1889860	happen in the real world, though he goes a lot farther than you would normally see, going
1889860	1893860	so far as to open his home to this kid so he'll have a safe place to stay.
1893860	1897860	When Sean's circumstances start getting bad, it's this extraordinarily uncommon
1897860	1901860	step that keeps him from running away into the unknown, away even from his friend Cory
1901860	1904860	and what little security he might have with the Matthews.
1904860	1908860	The contrast here reveals that Sean's ordinary life, with the destiny of failure
1908860	1913860	impressed upon him by society, requires extraordinary effort from a teacher to fix.
1913860	1916860	And what about the kids who aren't as lucky as Sean to have a teacher like Mr. Turner,
1916860	1918860	or even a friend like Cory?
1918860	1922860	The relationship between Sean and Mr. Turner continues to be explored in the third season
1922860	1923860	as the two bond.
1923860	1927860	We even get sweet moments like these where Sean tries to run away for the third time in the series.
1938860	1953860	By the end of the third season, it appeared as though Mr. Turner was finally going to
1953860	1957860	adopt Sean, but Sean can't turn his back on his father, and the two of them run style
1957860	1959860	and move back to the trailer park.
1968860	1977860	And so, the Mr. Turner experiment, at least when it came to taking care of Sean, came
1977860	1978860	to an end.
1978860	1991860	But there was more to the Mr. Turner character than taking care of Sean.
1991860	1995860	When he was first introduced in season 2, he also asked it as a foil to the more traditional
1995860	1996860	Mr. Feeney.
1996860	2022220	The season 2 premiere helped establish that dynamic in this moment.
2022220	2024820	This exchange raises an interesting question.
2024820	2027980	What is the best way to improve a person's understanding of the world?
2027980	2031500	Do we go to them on their own level, or do we demand that they come up to ours?
2031500	2034820	If you start low, you might not provide them with the supports they can pull themselves
2034820	2038620	up higher, but if you start high, they might not try to reach up at all.
2038620	2042580	One of the more interesting clashes between Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner is in the episode
2042580	2047300	Wake Up, Little Cory, where Mr. Turner assigns his class to videotape each other talking
2047300	2071740	about love and sex.
2071740	2074060	Cory and Topanga partner up for this assignment.
2074060	2077140	After telling their parents they're staying at each other's homes, Cory and Topanga
2077140	2081620	spend the whole night editing footage at school, and then they fall asleep together, only to
2081620	2083380	be discovered later on.
2083380	2095980	Cory soon becomes a legend at school.
2095980	2117100	On the other hand, Topanga's reputation is not so esteemed.
2117100	2139060	Meanwhile the two teachers discuss the fallout.
2139060	2142780	Cory then cuts together a version of their assignment that's more about love and sex,
2142780	2171940	and includes a confession from him.
2171940	2176060	Cory and Topanga make up, but also important is how Mr. Feeney admits he might have been
2176060	2182580	wrong.
2182580	2186620	What makes this dynamic particularly interesting is that both teachers have a point.
2186620	2190620	The assignment did spiral out of control, and for a little while it made Topanga's
2190620	2195380	life horrible, but it was also in that diversity that Cory was able to rise to the occasion,
2195380	2199460	though it seems a bit unfair for him to have learned a lesson at the expense of someone
2199460	2200460	else.
2200460	2203820	It did reveal an important gender dynamic when it comes to sex and gossip, though, and
2203820	2207660	how it benefits the boys while hurting the girls, and that it was the side in power that
2207660	2210860	needed to learn the lesson, not the side that's victimized.
2210860	2214060	But above all the lessons learned in this episode, what caught my eye was how the clashing
2214060	2218340	styles of Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner reveal that neither one is entirely right.
2218340	2223120	Mr. Turner overestimated how well the kids would handle talking about sex, and Mr. Feeney
2223120	2224620	underestimated them.
2224620	2228820	In these seasons, the series is very much about replacing the idea of the always wise
2228820	2233260	and unerring Mr. Feeney with an alternative to that style of teaching, suggesting that
2233260	2237180	it's not that kids can only learn through classic methods, but also the question on
2237180	2241940	how to educate kids is a negotiation between old and new techniques, ideally finding the
2241940	2246140	optimal may of moving forward by experimenting with what new stuff might work while holding
2246140	2248300	onto the old stuff that still does.
2248300	2252620	This episode also marks part of the small drift Cory and Topanga had towards one another
2252620	2254300	throughout the second season.
2254300	2257660	It wouldn't be happening all at once, but series creator Michael Jacobs explained this
2257660	2260140	was an idea he had early on.
2260140	2263300	I thought, what's going to happen with this boy confused by life?
2263300	2265660	What would be the stabilizing influences?
2265660	2269300	And I thought he would want to discover and find love forever, and we pretty much decided
2269300	2272660	early on that, wouldn't it be great if we could do a show about a kid who knew what
2272660	2273660	he wanted?
2273660	2277020	Fell in absolute love with somebody, and against every conceivable storyline we could come
2277020	2278860	up, they would make it work.
2278860	2281160	And that was something that we wanted early on.
2281160	2285300	The second season's second episode, pairing off, introduces the world of dating to the
2285300	2288420	series, and it would be a major focal point for the rest of its run.
2288420	2292140	It also signified that this show would be growing up alongside its characters and its
2292140	2293140	audience.
2293140	2302700	Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend, believe me, I don't want this any more than
2302700	2306940	you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves
2306940	2309940	a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together.
2309940	2313060	Cory and Topanga aren't quite ready to be a thing just yet.
2313060	2318820	Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love, then after a week
2318820	2323020	they hate each other, so for one great passionate week we lose a friendship that could last
2323020	2324020	a lifetime.
2324020	2326020	I'm in if you are.
2326020	2332260	Cory, don't worry, I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
2332260	2334700	Give me a name!
2334700	2338420	Cory steps out in the world and has a few dates with other girls, though none of them lasts
2338420	2339420	for very long.
2339420	2342620	Although maybe he should have worked on his fashion sense a bit more, I'm not sure the
2342620	2346740	plaid shirt on top of another plaid shirt on top of a third shirt was really working
2346740	2347740	for him.
2347740	2351880	But while these other girls give Cory a taste of dating life, he's consistently drawn closer
2351880	2353280	to Topanga.
2353280	2357420	And it's in season 3 that we see Cory and Topanga get closer in the episode by best
2357420	2383180	friend's girl, where Shawn decides to push things along.
2383180	2405180	Driven by jealousy, Cory finally asks out Topanga.
2405180	2418000	And of course Cory and Shawn remain bros.
2418000	2421540	As the Cory and Topanga relationship develops, we learn more about their history with one
2421540	2436340	another.
2436340	2439500	Cory and Topanga's history before the start of the show changes throughout the years,
2439500	2443700	but more important than the messy continuity is how these changing stories establish their
2443700	2447940	deep romantic connection, presenting young love as something eternally true.
2447940	2451660	A love story like this sticks out like a sore thumb, particularly in the present day
2451660	2455260	where most relationships have traded romanticism for realism.
2455260	2458380	It's probably here that the series feels most unreal, although it's done in a way
2458380	2462220	that isn't quite as simple as the fairy tale it's often remembered as.
2462220	2467180	Aside from Cory and Topanga needing two seasons to even start dating, they break up very quickly,
2467180	2470220	11 episodes later, and the grass is always greener.
2470220	2496740	It would be another 9 episodes before we see them reconcile when they go to Disney
2496740	2516060	World in The Happiest Show on Earth.
2516060	2519940	A cynical reading of an episode like this would be how Cory and Topanga are meant to
2519940	2524400	be together in so far that they are brought together by the corporate-fix simile of magic.
2524400	2528480	The needs for sitcom romances to end happily, and they reconcile in another corporate-fix
2528480	2530680	simile of magic, Disney World.
2530680	2533760	But I think it would be unfair to write this romance off entirely.
2533760	2537700	It took Cory and Topanga nearly two seasons to reach this point after all, struggling
2537700	2541040	to come to terms with their feelings and then making an effort to stay together.
2541040	2544240	And this would hardly be the storybook ending for the couple as they had more challenges
2544240	2545600	to come in the future.
2545600	2549480	The romanticism of this pairing confronts the harsh reality of the real world.
2549480	2553040	It's a small example of how idealism can survive the crushing weight of the cynical
2553040	2557160	world, but only if the people involved are willing to do the work to stay together.
2557160	2559840	And far from being perfect, they stumble and fall along the way.
2559840	2561840	That's what helps make this couple feel relatable.
2561840	2565880	They represent the good of the old that overcomes the challenges of the new.
2565880	2569920	The idea that love, when it's real, can overcome anything so long as you don't give
2569920	2570920	up on it.
2570920	2572520	A few notes before leaving these seasons.
2572520	2574040	There were several changes to the cast.
2574040	2579360	When the character Harley exits the series, he's briefly replaced by Adam Scott as Griff.
2579360	2582600	Griff wouldn't last long, and the bullies would be phased out of the series in later
2582600	2583600	seasons.
2583600	2587160	Season 3 also introduced the character Eli Williams to the principal cast, played by
2587160	2588400	Alex Dazer.
2588400	2591720	He was a friend of Mr. Turner and briefly a teacher at John Adams High School.
2591720	2595520	Though with Mr. Turner playing less of a role in Season 4, his friend exited the series
2595520	2597880	entirely at the end of Season 3.
2597880	2601560	The biggest departure was saying goodbye to the original Morgan in Season 2.
2601560	2606000	Lily Nixay was not terribly happy being on the show, so it was decided she would leave.
2606000	2609580	She would be replaced halfway through Season 3 by Lindsay Ridgeway.
2609580	2613460	As for why we didn't see Morgan for so long, she explained that it was a very long
2613460	2614460	time out.
2614460	2634100	And later in Season 3, we find out why she got that time out.
2634100	2637560	As Boy Meets World matured, so too did the type of stories it told.
2637560	2641560	The simpler ideas of listening to your teacher in the first season gave way to more complicated
2641560	2644040	relationships with authority in the second and third.
2644040	2648160	And through the character of Sean, class dynamics and expectations began to make their way through
2648160	2650920	the safe middle-class bubble we had first met him in.
2650920	2654280	In Season 4 and 5, this became increasingly more pronounced.
2654280	2657360	In particular, as more of Sean's family became part of the story.
2657360	2661720	With Mr. Turner out and Chet Hunter in, as Sean's father figure, we get a better sense
2661720	2664560	of where Sean came from and how that shaped him.
2664560	2668720	In Fishing for Verna, we meet Sean's mother Verna, played by Shireen Mitchell, ready to
2668720	2693920	try being a family again with the Hunter men.
2693920	2706200	Chet tries to be a better father by getting a stable job as the school janitor.
2706200	2709280	Sean is eventually drawn into a fight with a kid mocking his father.
2709280	2713360	When Sean makes a trip to the principal's office, Mr. Feeny offers to fire Chet, knowing
2713360	2717240	Sean would eventually realize he doesn't want to take away his father's first steady
2717240	2725120	paycheck.
2725120	2728460	In addition to Sean learning an important lesson, what was particularly nice about this
2728460	2733200	episode was featuring someone working a janitorial job who doesn't, and shouldn't, feel any
2733200	2741960	shame about it.
2741960	2745640	That may not have been the best dad, but in the fourth season, he makes an effort to
2745640	2749560	be better, and that happens to start with working a job to support his family.
2749560	2753040	And it serves as a reminder that people's lives can take a number of turns for a variety
2753040	2756640	of reasons, whether it be a few bad choices or just some bad luck.
2756640	2760160	It doesn't matter nearly as much as treating them with respect and acknowledging the hard
2760160	2761240	work they do.
2761240	2764920	This job isn't a punishment for Chet's mistakes, but an opportunity to start making
2764920	2766160	things right.
2766160	2769880	It also shows us that these are people with lives and families who take some pride in
2769880	2771120	enjoying their work.
2771120	2774960	The episode where Verna returned similarly took a moment to acknowledge the school cafeteria
2774960	2779560	lunch server as well, revealing how the Hunter family is strongly connected to working class
2779560	2780560	characters.
2780560	2784840	Although these are small gestures in the grand scheme of things, they are appreciated nonetheless.
2784840	2789840	Sean's family also offers a glimpse into more class dynamics when his parents depart,
2789840	2793960	and in the fifth season we meet Sean's half-brother, Jack, played by Matthew Lawrence.
2793960	2798280	Jack is not to be confused with Sean's other brother Eddie, who we briefly meet and then
2798280	2802280	never hear about again in the season 3 episode, The Pink Flamingo Kid.
2802280	2806820	Jack joins Boy Meets World in season 5 opener, Brothers, whereas Sean grew up in poverty
2806820	2810400	with their father, Jack lived comfortably with his mother and her new husband.
2810400	2814080	Although they have trouble getting along because of their time apart, they do at least partially
2814080	2824720	reconcile by the end of the episode and move in together as Chet takes off once again.
2824720	2827920	And their other roommate is Cory's brother Eric.
2827920	2831360	Throughout the series, Jack's posh upbringing would create a divide between the two and
2831360	2834920	serve as a constant reminder of where these two characters came from.
2834920	2838360	Michael Jacobs explained the decision to include Jack in an interview saying,
2838360	2842160	"...Tony's character and Alex Dazer, who played Eli Williams, all of these wonderful
2842160	2846080	teachers were very beneficial to us, but it was always a coming-of-age comedy, and these
2846080	2848200	teachers had long since come-of-age.
2848200	2852200	But we felt that where the magnifying glass needed to be was on the generation that was
2852200	2854480	coming-of-age, and that's why we added Jack."
2854800	2858600	Over time, we would see less of these class dynamics as part of Sean's stories, as another
2858600	2862280	plotline would dominate his stories in later seasons, and Jack would appear more often
2862280	2863820	in stories with Eric.
2863820	2867640	But in these seasons, it was established that in the comfy middle-class space of Boy Meets
2867640	2872360	World, Sean would sometimes take the role of an outsider, his lower-class past and absent
2872360	2875520	parents reminding him that he doesn't quite fit in.
2875520	2879400	Another important addition to Sean's side of the stories was the arrival of Angela Moore,
2879400	2880800	played by Trina McGee.
2880800	2883960	Although just a random student in her first appearance, she would play a much bigger role
2883960	2888760	in the episode, I Love You Donna Karen, where Sean, growing dissatisfied with his two-week
2888760	2892080	limit dating life, falls for the owner of a lost purse.
2892080	2894680	"- And what if it's not as good as what I have now?"
2896280	2897480	"- With a purse?"
2898840	2900600	"- Just draw a bit, Corey.
2900600	2902040	Listen, what are you so afraid of?"
2902040	2904560	"- I'm afraid of getting hurt, okay?
2904560	2908360	I mean, I've seen the pain on my father's face every time a woman walks out because
2908360	2909920	he's not good enough."
2909920	2913440	"- Sean, you are not your father."
2913440	2917520	Sean later finds out the items in the purse belong to Angela, who he had just broken up
2917520	2919760	with, and he's suddenly filled with regrets.
2919760	2923680	And after a bit of back and forth on the subject, the two eventually begin dating once again,
2923680	2926560	only this time for longer than two weeks.
2926560	2930160	The relationship would be a part of the rest of season five, but it was later seasons that
2930160	2932560	we would more fully explore this dynamic.
2932560	2936640	As the series matured, it began tackling bigger social issues, so much so that a number of
2936640	2939200	episodes would be devoted to challenging topics.
2939200	2943520	In the episode, Dangerous Secret, Corey suspects Sean is hooking up with Claire, a girl in
2943520	2947400	her class, only to find out that Claire has been staying with Sean to get away from her
2947400	2948400	abusive father.
2948400	2950400	"- Okay, Claire and I aren't doing anything.
2950400	2951520	We never have.
2951520	2955520	The reason she's been staying at my place, her dad hits her.
2955520	2958200	What do you mean he hits her?
2958200	2959200	At night sometimes.
2959200	2961760	He yells a lot and beats her up."
2961760	2965680	Claire fears her father is untouchable, as he happens to be a bank vice president.
2965680	2969320	And even though the episode ends with Claire going to the police, it only holds the vague
2969320	2972440	hope that something might improve with her father going to therapy.
2972440	2975160	The story related back to the main cast in a more roundabout way.
2975160	2978880	When Corey thought Sean was having sex, he started pushing that line with Topanga, only
2978880	2982840	to realize he shouldn't base his decision on social pressure, but instead on whether
2982840	2984880	he and Topanga were both ready.
2984880	2989520	In cult fiction, feeling disconnected from the world, Sean decides to join a cult.
2989520	2991520	"- Do you believe in a mother and a father?
2991520	2993560	And a comfortable house and a comfortable street?
2993560	2994560	Because that's what you have?
2994960	2996520	Well, I don't have that.
2996520	2998000	So I found something with these people.
2998000	2999680	Yeah, but who are these people?
2999680	3001200	Stop trying to take away what I have.
3001200	3002440	I don't do that to you."
3002440	3006600	Eventually, when Mr. Turner is in a motorcycle accident, Corey talks some sense into Sean.
3006600	3007720	"- Turner took care of you.
3007720	3008800	He loves you.
3008800	3011040	And you love him.
3011040	3012680	Is that real?
3012680	3015240	Or are Mr. Mack in the center real?
3015240	3018040	You decide, but you cannot go."
3018040	3021640	This episode hits on the familiar Sean theme of feeling disconnected from the world and
3021640	3022980	the need for a home.
3022980	3028100	This episode is also, weirdly, the last time we see Mr. Turner in Boy Meets World.
3028100	3032860	And in If You Can't Be With The One You Love, Sean develops a drinking problem.
3032860	3036100	"- Nobody's listening to me, okay?
3036100	3040300	I drink this stuff because I like it.
3040300	3042460	It makes me feel good.
3042460	3043460	Hello?
3043460	3044460	Hello?
3044460	3047540	Is this thing on?
3047540	3049340	I have no problem."
3049340	3055780	"- Okay, maybe we don't have to talk about this in front of everybody.
3055780	3057540	Let's just go out into the hall-"
3057540	3058540	"- Go."
3058540	3066100	"- I don't like that you drink.
3066100	3071060	Call me when you don't."
3071060	3076540	Aside from one relapse in a later season, Sean's alcoholism is largely wrapped up in this episode.
3076540	3080260	Most sitcoms have a small collection of very special episodes.
3080260	3084580	Very special episodes being particularly dramatic episodes that tackle social issues.
3084580	3088380	But Boy Meets World seemed to have multiple very special episodes every season.
3088380	3091660	For a family sitcom, it very aggressively went after these serious topics.
3091660	3094820	I might speak to why it continued to resonate over the years.
3094820	3098300	Boy Meets World did have a tendency to wrap these stories up a bit quickly.
3098300	3103260	Sean joining an escaping occult really leaps to mind as I wonder how such a traumatic event
3103260	3105900	could be encapsulated in a little over 20 minutes.
3105900	3109180	It's helped by playing to common themes of the character, but it still feels like
3109180	3110180	a stretch.
3110180	3114140	What these episodes reveal are a lot of good intentions beyond the capacity of a 20-minute
3114140	3118220	family sitcom, even one that's relatively well put together like Boy Meets World.
3118220	3120500	It also reveals the limitations of its themes.
3120500	3124340	Unless the problem was simple and relatable, it didn't fit the format particularly well
3124340	3127820	and the ones that reached across multiple episodes tended to be more broad and less
3127820	3129900	specific than a drinking disorder.
3129900	3133300	It's also worth thinking about how these series began with the idea of school and other
3133300	3136320	places being safe staging grounds for these short lessons.
3136320	3139820	If these traumas persisted, it would change the tone of the show and make Boy Meets World
3139820	3144100	a very different experience, one that might have been too intense for its younger audience,
3144100	3146820	meaning they wouldn't see depictions of these issues at all.
3146820	3151540	There is no right or wrong answer in the best approach to very special episodes, just varying
3151540	3155220	degrees of success or failure based on the premise, characters, and theme a show has
3155220	3156560	to work with.
3156560	3160420	In these seasons, the show also started to drift towards more high-concept episodes,
3160420	3164260	that is, single episodes with a unique premise that allow the characters to be placed in
3164260	3165880	some strange contexts.
3165880	3171060	An early example from season 3 is I Was a Teenage Spy, where Cory is shocked by a microwave
3171060	3173380	and sent back to the 1950s.
3173380	3175820	Do me a favor, would ya?
3175820	3176820	Anything you want.
3176820	3178820	Would ya look at me that way I don't like?
3178820	3182380	I thought you said it scared you.
3182380	3184380	It does.
3184380	3190940	It was a cute episode that foreshadowed Cory and Topanga getting back together during their
3190940	3192360	third season breakup.
3192360	3197520	In season 4's Sixteen Candles and Four Hundred Pound Men, Cory and Sean offer advice to Frankie
3197520	3203640	to better connect with his father, who happens to be WWF slash WWE wrestler Vader.
3203640	3205600	And they end up at a wrestling match.
3205600	3210400	And in Eric Hollywood, Eric is invited to join the cast of a sitcom called Kid Gets
3210400	3214840	Acquainted with Universe, where he meets a fictionalized version of the cast of the
3214840	3235600	show.
3235600	3239600	But the most popular high-concept episode of the series, and maybe the most popular episode
3239600	3243080	of the series, is season 5's And Then There Was Sean.
3243080	3246860	Loosely inspired by the Scream movies, this episode sees everyone trapped in the school
3246860	3251120	at night, with the murderer slowly picking them off, while Sean recounts various horror
3251120	3270440	movie tropes.
3270440	3274960	The episode isn't just unique in its premise, it's also shot to look more like a horror
3274960	3275960	movie.
3275960	3279520	With camera angles and movements you wouldn't usually see in a sitcom, it even had the gall
3279520	3289160	to murder Mr. Feeney.
3289160	3292840	The episode does a great job of playing with horror movie tropes and delivering some solid
3292840	3307600	jokes.
3307600	3311340	It also included a special guest appearance from Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was seen in
3311340	3313960	I Know What You Did Last Summer a few months prior.
3313960	3318440	The episode was notoriously difficult to film because the cast broke down laughing for hours
3318440	3322280	at a time, but in spite of those difficulties, the finished product came together so well
3322280	3324040	that it became a fan favorite.
3324040	3327720	Part of the reason for Boy Meets World's success, and why the show is so often able
3327720	3331720	to take these kinds of chances, was because of its below-the-radar status.
3331720	3335560	Michael Jacobs was fairly protective of his show, and the network, rather than deal with
3335560	3339320	lengthy conversations about what the show was doing, let him do as he pleased so long
3339320	3340920	as the numbers were stable.
3340920	3343540	Ryder Strong describes how that influenced the audience.
3343540	3347240	When we stepped out of the box with an episode like this, it kind of felt like we were in
3347240	3350480	our own little corner of the playground, and no one was paying attention.
3350480	3355440	Which means, in a way, we were thumbing our nose at expanding our audience, and by definition,
3355440	3357000	building a cult following.
3357000	3360520	Even though, and then there was Sean was a bit of fun, it's still connected back to
3360520	3363520	one of the main through lines of the series in an important way.
3363560	3367200	By the end of the episode, the whole experience is revealed to be a bad dream of Sean's,
3367200	3370600	though in the dream, the killer is revealed to be Sean himself.
3370600	3373560	As for why he's killing his friends, it's revealed in this moment.
3373560	3375400	Why are you doing this to us?
3379120	3383040	Sean is tearing the world apart because he can't stand that Cory and Topanga have broken
3383040	3384040	up again.
3384040	3388080	Yes, broken up again, and that's as good a transition as any to give us a brief rundown
3388080	3392280	of what the fated couple of Cory and Topanga were doing in seasons 4 and 5.
3392280	3395440	At the end of season 3, our happy couple was still together, but they started facing
3395440	3398520	more hardships, part of the way through season 4.
3398520	3403080	In the two-parter, A Long Walk to Pittsburgh, Topanga is devastated to learn that her family
3403080	3407400	is moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, putting her relationship with Cory in jeopardy.
3407400	3411320	Okay, I don't care if I have to walk to Pittsburgh, nothing is going to come between us, alright?
3411320	3413600	We're going to be together for the rest of our lives.
3417600	3418600	Okay.
3418600	3419600	So there.
3420440	3423600	Cory's refusal to acknowledge the truth is tough to watch.
3423600	3425520	We're leaving for Pittsburgh.
3425520	3430360	No, you're not moving because we're supposed to be together like we've always talked about,
3430360	3432320	so you can't move.
3432320	3434280	Because we don't deserve that kind of pain.
3434800	3437400	Cory, will you just give me a hug and a kiss and say goodbye to me?
3437400	3438400	No.
3445600	3446600	Goodbye, Cory.
3448400	3449400	I love you.
3452560	3456800	As the weeks drag on and Cory's loved ones try to help him move on, he gets increasingly
3456800	3460240	frustrated not hearing from Topanga, and he's about ready to give up.
3460240	3464240	I'm sure you'll be real happy to know that I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh, okay?
3464880	3465880	Why not?
3465880	3466880	You and Topanga have a fight?
3466880	3467880	No, no fight.
3467880	3470400	I just realized that I'm the one making all the phone calls, I'm the one writing all
3470400	3474560	the letters, but I will not be the one who travels 300 miles to be rejected and look
3474560	3475560	like a fool.
3475560	3479240	So if life doesn't want me and Topanga together, then you can't fight life, can you?
3481240	3482240	Cory.
3483240	3484240	Amy.
3484240	3486880	This might be my favorite moment in the whole series.
3486880	3490600	Part of it is the reaction from the audience, and part of it is seeing how passionate young
3490600	3491600	love can be.
3491600	3495560	Topanga has run away from home, and even though Cory's parents aren't thrilled,
3495560	3499640	he offers his own definition of loved in an effort to keep them together.
3499640	3507080	When I'm better because she's here, now she won't be.
3507080	3509560	In other shows, this wouldn't be working.
3509560	3512640	It's so sweet, it's practically dripping honey.
3512640	3516880	But somehow Boy Meets World manages to walk this line without falling on its face.
3516880	3520520	It does require the audience to be willing to believe in Cory and Topanga, believe in
3520520	3524880	the idea of young love being something special that can last the test of time.
3524880	3528720	This feeling is only underscored when Topanga's aunt Prudence arrives, as she is played by
3528720	3534600	Olivia Hussie, who famously played Juliette, in 1968, Franco Ziffirelli's film adaptation
3534600	3535800	of Romeo and Juliette.
3535800	3539840	It's Topanga's aunt who offers her a place to stay in Philadelphia so she can spend
3539840	3543720	her last year of high school in the place she's familiar with, among her friends,
3543720	3546140	and most importantly, with Cory.
3546140	3549320	This might have been the best episode for the Cory and Topanga relationship, even though
3549320	3554040	it's complete fantasy, unbearably sentimental, and still somehow works.
3554040	3558000	It's the comfort you don't get with the more cynical TV that was popularized in later
3558000	3559000	years.
3559000	3562480	Maybe this is why it's such a strong symbol of youth and nostalgia, when we believe true
3562480	3566480	life could happen at 16, and nothing was more important than being with the person you cared
3566480	3567880	the most about.
3567880	3572080	Cory and Topanga are see-sawing between fantasy and reality, and after a bit of fantasy in
3572080	3575960	season 4, it would swing back to reality in season 5.
3575960	3581200	In Heartbreak Cory, the senior class goes on a ski trip to Mount Sun Lodge, where Cory
3581200	3585040	sprains his ankle getting off the bus, leaving him at the lodge while everyone else goes
3585040	3586040	skiing.
3586040	3597040	Keeping him company is Lauren, played by Linda Cardellini, an employee at the lodge.
3597040	3599960	Cory ends up talking with Lauren throughout the night, and on the next day lies about
3599960	3604160	his ankle still being sore, so he's once again trapped at the lodge.
3604160	3605160	With Lauren.
3605160	3620240	I wasn't expecting you, but sometimes people take you by surprise.
3620240	3624360	Cory tells the truth to Topanga about having spent the night talking to Lauren, but he
3624360	3626520	leaves out the part about the kiss.
3626520	3630840	Cory says goodbye to Lauren, though she leaves him with a letter, which Topanga finds at
3630840	3632120	the end of the episode.
3632120	3635720	Topanga confronts Cory about the letter in the next episode, and in the episode after
3635720	3661560	that one, torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool, Lauren shows up in Philadelphia.
3661560	3666000	Topanga tells Cory that if he isn't 100% sure about the two of them, he should spend
3666000	3667320	some time with Lauren.
3667320	3670120	So he does, and he spends the day talking to Lauren.
3670120	3672320	Later on, Cory makes his decision.
3672320	3674600	I like Lauren.
3674600	3679280	I like spending time with her.
3679280	3683840	But I can live without her.
3683840	3690560	I can't live without Topanga.
3690560	3692320	It's no contest.
3692320	3695000	And then he talks to Topanga about the experience.
3695000	3697760	Cory, I can't see you anymore.
3697760	3698760	What?
3698760	3706280	Do you have any idea how many guys sit on me?
3706280	3712200	What are you talking about?
3712200	3715840	I never needed to test my feelings for you.
3715840	3721680	I moved away from my parents in Pittsburgh to be close to you, but that you needed to
3721680	3726000	see her to test how you felt about me.
3726000	3728280	I don't forgive you for that, Cory.
3728280	3729280	No.
3729280	3730280	No.
3730280	3731280	You told me to see her, Topanga.
3731280	3738840	You told me to see how I felt.
3738840	3746640	And you listened.
3746640	3761600	It's going to be okay.
3761600	3766360	No, I won't.
3766360	3770360	What made this breakup so powerful was that it was a slow build over three episodes.
3770360	3773840	A couple like Cory and Topanga can't end things with a single fight.
3773840	3778860	It took time, and a series of bad choices, and when it ends, it feels like a real ending.
3778860	3782840	This is the episode that proceeded, and then there was Sean.
3782840	3786520	Episodes like these are in stark contrast to the more idyllic ones where Topanga goes
3786520	3790160	to Cory in the rain, or the heartfelt moment in Topanga's room.
3790160	3794240	It's a reminder that even supposedly perfect relationships are a lot of work, and that
3794240	3797000	it's better to be honest than hide something from your partner.
3797000	3801040	It'll also reflect how the series has changed the lessons it was teaching, moving from stories
3801040	3804800	about fitting into the wider world to how people fit into each other's lives.
3804800	3807480	And the lessons are getting more complex and messy.
3807480	3810520	That's why the stories have drifted away from the nice, tidy lessons learned at the
3810520	3813600	close of each episode to lingering doubts and confusion.
3813600	3817580	It reflects how some parts of the world aren't so easily learned from a speech delivered
3817580	3819080	by Mr. Feeney.
3819080	3822560	But the Cory and Topanga story didn't end here.
3822560	3827880	In Story Night, Topanga meets a guy named Ricky, played by Jonathan Jackson, and is
3827880	3830440	taken by his deep love of art.
3830440	3834400	Unsure of whether or not she's ready to move on, she tries taking Cory to see Van Gogh's
3834400	3836400	story night to get his impression of the piece.
3864400	3878840	Topanga isn't satisfied with Cory's answer.
3878840	3903080	Topanga decides to go out with Ricky, and when they kiss, she learns something.
3903080	3932200	And
3932200	3951160	all that's left is for them to get back together.
3951160	3954840	With Cory and Topanga reconciled, the rest of the season will supposedly play out just
3954840	3958080	fine until they're faced with one more challenge.
3958080	3962160	When things change, Topanga's offers a spot at Yale, which dashed the plans she's made
3962160	3978400	with Cory to attend Penbrook University together.
3978400	3981440	Cory tells Topanga she should take the chance to go to Yale.
3981440	3985100	And in the season 5 finale, Graduation, Cory and his friends prepare to end their high
3985100	4009340	school lives, and we get a cute cameo for Minkus.
4009340	4030140	More importantly, though, we find out what Topanga's decision is regarding Yale.
4030140	4043740	As far as sitcom cliffhangers go, the unanswered proposal is a classic.
4043740	4047460	And had this couple not just been put through the wringer for the last 10 episodes, it might
4047460	4049260	have felt like it was coming out of nowhere.
4049260	4051820	But in this case, it felt entirely natural.
4051820	4055820	Part of that reason is because Cory and Topanga's relationship has always been too idyllic,
4055820	4058780	so said in a romantic fantasy that it was hard to take seriously.
4058780	4061940	But in seasons 4 and 5, it started to feel more real.
4061940	4065580	The challenges were more difficult, and the answers were less obvious or certain.
4065580	4069820	These were the seasons that pulled that relationship into the real world, to test its ability to
4069820	4070820	survive.
4070820	4074560	And after going through some tough trials, it proved that it was the real thing.
4074560	4079260	But this is a relationship built on an amorphous past, one that seemed destined.
4079260	4083060	But the only reason it was destined is because of the traditional sentimentality that went
4083060	4084060	into making the show.
4084060	4088300	Boy Meets World is a very earnest series, not shined away from sensitive issues or social
4088300	4089300	commentary.
4089300	4092380	But at its heart, it's still a very traditional family sitcom.
4092380	4095340	It has one foot in the present and another in the past.
4095340	4099580	The show itself manifests this in the dynamic between Mr. Feeny and Mr. Turner in season
4099580	4100580	2.
4100580	4104700	This show is about how children become adults, and the forces of constancy and change that
4104700	4105780	shape them.
4105780	4110260	And in this maelstrom of forces, Cory and Topanga make it through, with their romanticized
4110260	4115180	version of love staying intact, now hardened by the harsh winds of reality.
4115180	4118260	And ultimately, this might be the perfect symbol as to why this show became such a
4118260	4119660	comforting favorite.
4119660	4122900	Because it tells you that through all the noise and fury, so long as you really work
4122900	4142500	at it, everything is going to be okay.
4142500	4146660	To then keep everyone hanging, let's make one thing perfectly clear.
4146660	4167580	Here is Cory's answer to Topanga's proposal.
4167580	4168980	That's a yes, by the way.
4168980	4172580	While I tease a quick wedding afterwards, ultimately Cory and Topanga decide to have
4172580	4174420	a long engagement instead.
4174420	4178500	There are plenty of other changes in store for the cast in these final two seasons, aside
4178500	4181460	from the impending nuptials.
4181460	4187180	Most obviously, we see Cory, Topanga, Sean, and Angela all heading off to Penbrook University.
4187180	4191740	Cory and Sean become roommates in their dorm while Topanga and Angela do the same in their
4191740	4192740	dorm.
4192740	4195460	And this might be a good time to look at some of the other characters that are joining at
4195460	4196460	Penbrook.
4196460	4200460	In the last five seasons, Eric Matthews has gone through a bit of a transformation.
4200460	4204980	In earlier seasons, he was the cool order brother who always had a new date every week,
4204980	4209500	but as the seasons progressed, that changed as the character became increasingly more
4209500	4210500	silly.
4210500	4214380	According to Will Friedle, the first sign of this was in the first season, when he got
4214380	4217100	the chance to be in a scene with William Daniels.
4217100	4235420	And he had to think of a funny way of throwing down a bag of fertilizer.
4235420	4239900	The lesson learned was to always go big in comedy, and over the years we would see Eric
4239900	4268100	going further and further over the top.
4268100	4271780	One fan theory as to why this is happening is because the series is told through the
4271780	4276260	eyes of Cory, and part of growing up is seeing your cool, hip, older brother for the goofball
4276260	4277500	he really is.
4277500	4281220	And while I would never rob someone of their interpretation, according to Friedle, behind
4281220	4285500	the scenes it was about the writers and Will Friedle challenging each other to get increasingly
4285500	4289900	ridiculous with the character, making him more akin to Friedle in real life, albeit
4289900	4291140	amped up some.
4291140	4295380	So in the final seasons, he would be completely off the wall, like coughing out winning lottery
4295380	4323620	numbers or disguising himself as a couch, but Eric not always being a perfect fit in
4323620	4327260	the Cory, Shawn, Topanga, and eventually Angela dynamic.
4327260	4331700	Eric was given his own supporting cast, first with the arrival of Shawn's brother Jack,
4331700	4336580	who became Eric's roommate, along with Shawn, and then in season 6, when Shawn moved out,
4336580	4340980	a new roommate replaced him, Rachel McGuire, played by Maitland Ward.
4340980	4343220	Michael Jacobs explains this evolution.
4343220	4346660	We knew that Eric was succeeding beautifully as a character, but we also knew that Eric
4346660	4349320	only involved with Shawn and Cory seemed odd.
4349320	4353420	We knew that what Eric really needed was something to play off of, and Matthew Lawrence was available
4353420	4354860	and it was a no-brainer to me.
4354860	4358420	And we put them together and then decided to add Maitland Ward, and all of a sudden
4358420	4361340	we had these wonderful secondary stories.
4361340	4365580	The typical dynamic here was Eric and Jack fighting over the beautiful Rachel, though
4365580	4381780	ultimately it was Jack who got the upper hand because it was funnier to see Eric fail.
4381780	4385760	Many of the beeplaws were basic stories and thinly-veiled excuses to give Will Friedel
4385760	4387560	something funny to do on camera.
4387560	4391380	Occasionally we would see Eric in some more mysterious stories, such as when he nearly
4391380	4393980	adopted a young boy named Tommy he was mentoring.
4393980	4397920	But generally speaking, Eric's stories were fun college adventures.
4397920	4401080	What Eric best represents, though, is the persistence of friendship.
4401080	4404540	Although his friendships with Jack and Rachel aren't as pronounced as, say, the Cory and
4404540	4409640	Shawn friendship, Eric is unusually talented when it comes to understanding people and
4409640	4410640	friendships.
4410640	4415400	As a 7-2 parter, the first episode titled The War, we see the bonds of this group tested
4415400	4420340	during a series of increasingly harsh pranks – Jack, Rachel, and Angela make up one team
4420340	4423360	with Cory, Shawn, and Topanga on the other team.
4423360	4425920	Eric is left out because no one wants him on their team.
4425920	4429720	Eventually, things get taken too far when Cory and Shawn put up a revealing picture
4429720	4432000	of Rachel in the Student Union.
4432000	4454320	The prank war turns into a fight, and Cory makes an unfortunate comment.
4454320	4477280	And things ripple out from there.
4477280	4490000	Eric tries to make peace between everyone, and then finds out the truth.
4490000	4494620	In the second part, titled Seven the Hard Way, Eric puts aside his bruised ego to work
4494620	4497820	with Mr. Feeny to try and mend these broken friendships.
4524620	4545900	Even the closest to friends, Cory and Shawn, might not be able to hold it together.
4545900	4562140	The episode flashes forward seven years to Mr. Feeny's retirement party to reveal that
4562140	4589100	this fight shattered the group.
4589100	4608900	And then Eric arrives.
4608900	4627260	And Plays with Squirrels has some words of wisdom.
4627260	4631020	When the episode goes back to the present day, it moves to a few moments after Rachel
4631020	4656300	is left, and Eric drags her back to read those same words of wisdom.
4656300	4658900	And it inspires everyone to reconcile.
4658900	4662140	Although Eric can never escape being the goofball, he holds together people much in
4662140	4664620	the same way he holds together the series itself.
4664620	4668420	If Boy Meets World was a series of tragedies, the characters would likely not be able to
4668420	4672140	keep their connection to one another, and the series itself could never maintain its
4672140	4674300	premise as a family-friendly sitcom.
4674300	4678060	Eric is the glue for all of these things, providing consistent comedic relief, and also
4678060	4681420	providing the wisdom needed to hold these characters together in the context of the
4681420	4682420	show.
4682420	4685900	For all the troubles that visit these characters, Eric is the Oasis in the Desert, a place to
4685900	4690660	enjoy a break from the heat, and he's an oasis for characters and audiences alike.
4690660	4694460	And in that calm, a simple truth can come from an unexpected place.
4694460	4699760	A character like Eric is particularly necessary when Boy Meets World gets heavy, and the heaviest
4699760	4703040	season was, almost certainly, season 6.
4703040	4707280	When Sean and Jack's father Chet returns in the episode, We'll Have a Good Time Then,
4707280	4709640	he announces that this time, he's staying for good.
4709640	4713200	From now on, there'll be lots and lots of time for us to play in pool.
4713200	4715000	So you're really staying for good?
4715000	4716000	That's the plan, son.
4716000	4719640	Sean is skeptical that Chet is going to be a run for the long haul, and in many ways
4719640	4721960	sees himself in Chet's lack of commitment.
4721960	4726040	Chet doesn't get the chance to prove himself, though, as he soon has a heart attack.
4726040	4728720	Sean and Jack don't handle it particularly well.
4756040	4783200	Sean and Chet do get a moment to reconcile, though.
4783200	4802040	But sadly, it's a little too late to make things right, as Chet has a second heart attack
4802040	4809200	and passes away.
4809200	4812780	Nothing is really resolved in this episode, and in some ways that might be an incredibly
4812780	4817460	realistic depiction of death, it doesn't solve problems or end a chapter.
4817460	4820300	Even if people reconcile, there's no time to enjoy that peace.
4820300	4824900	It's a sudden departure that comes too soon, no matter how late it may be.
4824900	4838820	Feeling lost, Sean once again takes off on a journey to discover himself.
4838820	4842760	What eventually brings Sean back two episodes later is the need to comfort his friend Corey
4842760	4844960	during a difficult time.
4844960	4849240	Before we begin, a quick content warning for anyone with a challenging pregnancy or infancy,
4849240	4851360	you can skip ahead to the timestamp below.
4851360	4855640	Amy Matthews revealed she was pregnant at the end of season 5, and in season 6, that
4855640	4858200	pregnancy was coming to an early end.
4858200	4878040	The baby was delivered early and is left in critical condition.
4878040	4882840	The next episode pulls no punches with several trips to the infant intensive care unit, and
4882840	4886080	it doesn't just highlight the struggle of the young Matthews baby.
4886080	4889880	Someone speaks to and gets to know the other parents who are going through the same thing,
4889880	4910440	including an uncredited cameo by series creator Michael Jacobs.
4910440	4914560	What I appreciate in this scene is how it acknowledges that many parents struggle with
4914560	4916040	this reality every day.
4916040	4919640	It isn't just a thing that the Matthews family come across one day to be conveniently
4919640	4922040	forgotten about when the show moves on.
4922040	4926440	The presence of the other families also carries with them in the awful suggestion that not
4926440	4928000	all babies can make it.
4928000	4932880	This is particularly clear in the revelation that, at least in this case, Joshua Matthews
4932880	4957280	is going to make it.
4957280	4961400	For all the difficulties the characters face in Boy Meets World, this one was probably
4961400	4963720	the most grueling and difficult to watch.
4963720	4973040	And it makes moments of levity even more of a relief.
4973040	4977300	What these heavy episodes also reveal is the greater dynamic for the series and its approach
4977300	4979760	to teaching its young audience about the world.
4979760	4983840	It began with familiar, well-known things that were taught to the kids, moved on to
4983840	4989400	things that were mysterious and a little uncertain, and then began moving towards the unexpected
4989400	4990400	unknown.
4990400	4994360	And it's a subject people never see coming, like the sudden early death of a parent or
4994360	4996920	a child being born in critical condition.
4996920	5000440	The stakes continuously go up in the series, revealing that the world is an increasingly
5000440	5004080	challenging place, and it can throw anything at you and you'll have to learn how to deal
5004080	5006520	with it, and hopefully learn from the experience.
5006520	5009600	The learning area isn't the safe space of the classroom anymore.
5009600	5013640	Although Boy Meets World had gotten incredibly heavy in these later seasons, it wasn't just
5013640	5015680	a series of unending traumas.
5015680	5019360	One bright spot was the impending marriage of Kori and Topanga, albeit with a few more
5019360	5020640	bumps along the way.
5020640	5024960	By the end of the perpetually-heavy season 6, we got to see the blossoming relationship
5024960	5027720	between Mr. Feeny and Dean Bolander.
5027720	5032560	Mr. Feeny having gone from fellow student at Penbrook University to one of the professors.
5032560	5036720	Because of course, Kori and his friends need Mr. Feeny to teach them through every year
5036720	5037720	of their education.
5037720	5042280	Dean Bolander was also played by William Daniels' real-life wife, Bonnie Bartlett.
5042280	5045040	Ahead of their marriage, Topanga finds out her parents are getting divorced, leading
5045040	5047560	Topanga devout her own engagement.
5047560	5050880	Season 7 opens with a two-parter where Kori tries to repair the relationship between
5050880	5054480	Topanga's parents, only to realize that sometimes love does die.
5054480	5057840	And while once again it may seem like this relationship is over, Kori and Topanga manage
5057840	5062360	to reconcile, when Topanga's mother tells her that even with the tragic end, love is
5062360	5063560	still worth it.
5063560	5065920	What can I do to make it up to you?
5065920	5067760	You could move your knee.
5067760	5068760	Sorry.
5068760	5073560	Whatever life takes us, I want it to be with you.
5073560	5074560	Forever.
5074560	5078560	Of all the breakups Kori and Topanga went through, this one was perhaps the least believable.
5078560	5081760	Largely because they had already called things quits three times before, and the appearance
5081760	5085660	of Lauren was a far more convincing threat than Topanga losing faith in love.
5085660	5089360	With their relationship so obviously solid, a wedding was the only place this story could
5089360	5090360	go.
5090360	5093240	And go there it did, albeit with some resistance from the network.
5093240	5097080	Michael Jacobs tells the story of how he convinced the network to let this happen.
5097080	5100840	The head of ABC, when I told them we were going to marry them at 19, said it was a very
5100840	5104040	irresponsible thing to do and that the audience didn't want it.
5104040	5107460	And I said to him, listen, you have this thing called abc.com.
5107460	5108460	It was brand new.
5108460	5111680	Why don't you run a graphic and find out how many people are waiting for Kori and Topanga
5111680	5112680	to marry?
5112680	5116240	And so he said, it's ridiculous, we'll get maybe 20,000 hits and that's it.
5116240	5117900	And who can tell anything from that?
5117900	5119480	And I said, why don't we try it?
5119480	5124380	And in the first seven minutes, they got about 280,000 hits and then the thing broke.
5124380	5129840	And out of the 280,000 hits, 280,000 people said, what do you think we're waiting for?
5129840	5133720	I got a call from the president of the network the next day who said, could you please marry
5133720	5135180	them in sweeps?
5135180	5138440	The week before the wedding, there was a cute tie-in during the credits for that week's
5138440	5139440	episode.
5139440	5143080	Kori and Topanga spoke about a website set up to celebrate their upcoming nuptials.
5143080	5147440	There's something very charming about how simple and quaint a website like this is.
5147440	5153200	And finally, in an episode titled, It's About Time, we see Kori and Topanga married.
5153200	5157320	Even though it's Kori and Topanga's wedding, the episode is actually about another important
5157320	5159760	relationship, Kori and Sean.
5159760	5165800	As far as you and me go, today is the last day that we're ever going to be Kori and Sean.
5165800	5169360	You know, Sean and Kori?
5169360	5170760	The fight runs into the wedding.
5170760	5172640	We have to talk about it.
5172640	5176560	I don't want to.
5176560	5179200	We have to.
5179200	5183280	Now?
5183280	5188960	Kori, after you get married, things are going to be different.
5188960	5191840	And I don't have a lot of friends, you know?
5191840	5194840	Do you really like her?
5194840	5200400	Yeah, I really do.
5200400	5202240	You sure?
5202240	5208080	John, I really think I've been very tolerant here.
5208080	5210760	Kori and Sean talk it out, and the wedding moves forward.
5210760	5214040	It's very strange that this wedding episode is about the guys.
5214040	5217960	It also highlights how important this friendship is to Kori, and how a marriage would change
5217960	5218960	that dynamic.
5218960	5222000	They're still best friends, but it's not quite the same anymore.
5222000	5225800	The Kori and Sean friendship can't really be understated, though it relies perhaps on
5225800	5229960	a few too many gay jokes about them, clearly written before the writers knew what the internet
5229960	5231720	did with that kind of bait.
5231720	5235480	It's still nice to see a male relationship that's not just about broing down and watching
5235480	5236880	the game together.
5236880	5240240	Kori and Sean support each other emotionally through some of the toughest parts of their
5240240	5243920	lives, and anyone would be lucky to have a friend like either one of them.
5243920	5245680	And it's a simple yet true lesson.
5245680	5248800	If you find a good friend who will stick with you during those tough times, hold on
5248800	5250360	to them as best you can.
5250360	5253640	It's one of the bittersweet moments of a wedding, knowing that this is the end of one
5253640	5255400	era and the beginning of another.
5255400	5259200	The series could have easily ended on this note, but it kept moving forward into a wider
5259200	5261480	unknown, the life of a married couple.
5261480	5264840	In The Honeymoon is Over, Kori and Topanga struggle to find housing.
5264840	5268520	They realize they don't have a place to live, with Topanga's apartment and Kori's
5268520	5270160	dorm conveniently occupied.
5270160	5272000	They go to Alan and Amy for help.
5272000	5273000	Amy?
5273000	5274800	They can't stay here.
5274920	5275920	They're married now.
5275920	5279760	It's Kori and Topanga, not Kori and us.
5279760	5280760	Remember?
5282760	5283760	Ma?
5283760	5286600	You can't stay here, Kori.
5286600	5290560	It seems pretty harsh for Kori's parents not to offer any kind of assistance here,
5290560	5294400	even a roof over their heads for a few days, especially when the alternative is for Kori
5294400	5299360	and Topanga to live in the dorm for married couples, which looks like this.
5299360	5303920	Why a university dorm is in shambles, I'm not entirely sure, but it clearly doesn't
5303920	5308320	matter for us, so Kori goes back to his father to once again ask for help.
5308320	5310880	You decided that you were old enough to get married.
5310880	5316080	You decided to take on the responsibility of a new life because you believed you could
5316080	5318520	handle it.
5318520	5326480	And this family supported that decision after we told you that it was going to be very difficult.
5326480	5328680	What did you think we were kidding?
5328680	5333120	I had many thoughts while watching this episode, but it would be unfair to discuss without
5333120	5336080	quickly running down the next one – picket fences.
5336080	5340360	The method to Alan's madness is explained in a later scene where Sean thinks the place
5340360	5353880	is nice, just in need of some work to fix it up a bit.
5353880	5357480	When Kori makes an effort to fix things up, he and Topanga gradually start to think they
5357480	5360200	can turn this rundown apartment into a home.
5360200	5361520	And a lesson is learned.
5361520	5364720	Topanga and I are going to pay in our place, we're going to put up a bookshelf, and
5364720	5368320	someday when we can afford it, we are going to buy that house with a nook without your
5368320	5369320	help.
5369320	5372400	Now, what do you have to say to that?
5372400	5376920	I'd say you finally figured it out.
5376920	5378880	Welcome to being an adult.
5378880	5383760	When your mother and I got married, we had nothing.
5383760	5386280	Nobody would help us, we did fine.
5386280	5389840	We didn't know it then, but it was the sweetest time in our lives.
5389840	5391780	We bonded together forever.
5391780	5396120	We felt completely in love because we knew we made a life for ourselves with nobody's
5396120	5398800	help but our own.
5398800	5401640	I would never take that away from you, son.
5401640	5404440	These two episodes are ridiculous.
5404440	5408120	In the first one, we find out what was fairly obvious throughout the series' run.
5408120	5410040	Kori and Topanga are upper middle class.
5410040	5413680	We're upper middle class, homeless college students.
5413680	5416680	And this lesson makes it abundantly clear.
5416680	5420800	The idea that suffering together through poverty is some kind of bonding ritual is
5420800	5422520	unbelievably privileged.
5422520	5425240	I want to look at how these episodes don't actually work.
5425240	5429080	The first question we should be asking is, who's paying for this dorm?
5429080	5431360	And who was paying for their previous dorm?
5431360	5435200	Neither Kory nor Topanga seem to have jobs, though they would in a few episodes.
5435200	5439080	They're also attending universities, something I imagine they aren't paying for with whatever
5439080	5440080	savings they have.
5440080	5444720	So it sounds like their parents are still taking care of at least some of those expenses.
5444720	5447840	For this story to be true to the message it's trying to present, Kori and Topanga
5447840	5452080	would be moving to their own place and having to get jobs to pay for everything, including
5452080	5454160	school, while attending.
5454160	5458520	This is a very hefty burden to put on someone, and expecting them to fix up their rundown
5458520	5460080	apartment on top of that.
5460080	5464640	How is this episode not about the absurd financial demands of obtaining a higher education, or
5464640	5467720	even just surviving in the modern world when you reach 20?
5467720	5471660	Clearly this real world experience isn't entirely real.
5471660	5476340	It seems more like a game for an upper-middle-class family to play at what it means to be poor,
5476340	5479580	and this little exercise is supposed to build character.
5479580	5483980	Except, there are people who live just the way Kory and Topanga would have to, working
5483980	5488380	and going to school while trying to keep a crummy apartment from collapsing in on itself.
5488380	5491880	And not because their parents want to teach them a lesson, it's because it's simply
5491880	5495900	a fact of their life, they don't have the means of affording anything better.
5495900	5499820	The biggest failure of this episode is to only fleetingly acknowledge that there are
5499820	5502360	people in situations such as Kory and Topanga.
5502360	5506540	Their neighbors are in rough spots, and they're at least depicted with some sensitivity, but
5506540	5510060	we don't get much acknowledgement from Kory and Topanga of how there seems to be something
5510060	5513660	wrong in a world where people are forced to live in rough conditions, because society
5513660	5518000	has made education a commodity easily purchased by the wealthy, and only attainable through
5518000	5520060	back-breaking effort for the poor.
5520060	5524020	If Allen and Amy's Grand Lesson had been instead to teach their kids about the injustice
5524020	5527800	in the world they had been sheltering them from, they would have made more sense.
5527800	5531240	It would still be harsh, of course, but it would be wisdom worth having.
5531240	5536080	The bonding exercise excuse seems like, at best, a rationalization, and the better lesson
5536080	5538960	learned from this episode is the unspoken one.
5538960	5542600	The seventh season was halfway through at this point, and while we'd see more of Kory
5542600	5546040	and Topanga's married life, including their first fight, there is another couple that
5546040	5547920	should be visited instead.
5547920	5552520	Angela and Sean's relationship is, much like Kory and Topanga's, a turbulent one.
5552520	5556040	Although unlike Kory and Topanga, their time apart is much longer.
5556040	5560560	At the beginning of season six, Angela and Sean break up, and manage to stay broken up
5560560	5563920	for the rest of the season, in spite of the fact that they clearly still have feelings
5563920	5584880	for one another, and in spite of the efforts of Kory and Topanga to get them back together.
5584920	5589680	The relationship between Sean and Angela is in direct contrast to Kory and Topanga.
5589680	5600040	Even Sean himself notices that.
5600040	5604000	Kory and Topanga are nice enough to point out that their romance is abnormal, but it's
5604000	5606280	clearly affected how Sean views relationships.
5606280	5610480	In a way, this puts the audience in Sean's shoes, seeing this ideal couple in Kory and
5610480	5614260	Topanga and wanting to live that themselves, but coming up short.
5614260	5618620	It isn't until season seven that Sean and Angela reconcile, bonding over having both
5618620	5622020	been abandoned by their parents, and the fear of growing up to be just like them, running
5622020	5638180	out on someone.
5638180	5642240	The relationship offers a nice lesson that it would only succeed if Angela and Sean were
5642240	5646100	able to relate to one another directly, and not trying to live up to the expectations
5646100	5648000	or example of their friends.
5648000	5653080	The relationship is also notable for being a very rare interracial pairing on 90s television.
5653080	5657500	Although the topic is never addressed in the show directly, and Angela's race is rarely
5657500	5660720	mentioned at all, it was a deliberate choice by the show's creators.
5660720	5664460	During an interview, Ryder Strong described the casting for Angela as exclusively looking
5664460	5666860	for Black or Latina actresses.
5666860	5670460	The pairing was meant to be the colorblind ideal where the race of the two characters
5670460	5672260	was entirely arbitrary.
5672260	5676140	This was something that Trina McGee appreciated, so much so that she wrote an op-ed in the
5676140	5680620	Los Angeles Times describing how she thought the relationship provided a positive example.
5680620	5682220	Here is an excerpt from that op-ed.
5682220	5686420	I get lots of positive reactions from both Black and white teenagers wanting to know
5686420	5688680	when Sean and I are getting back together.
5688680	5691740	The Black kids are not asking, why are you with that white boy?
5691740	5696620	When I intended the NAACP Image Awards, a Black girl lamented to me that Sean and Angela
5696620	5698840	are a perfect couple and should be back together.
5698840	5703080	The next day, a white girl in a mall begged to know if Sean and Angela are still in love.
5703080	5705280	One was nine, one pre-teen.
5705280	5707480	They are the new face of tolerance.
5707480	5711160	These kids are not looking at race, they're absorbing the love story.
5711160	5714800	To this day, Trina McGee still talks fondly about her experience on the show and how she
5714800	5717120	didn't really face many negative responses.
5717120	5720560	I think it's important to acknowledge that her op-ed was in response to outcry over a
5720560	5725520	scene in the series Allie McBeal where Callista Flockhart and Jesse L. Martin exchange a kiss
5725520	5728200	and that the series never broaches the topic of race.
5728200	5731000	A criticism never directed at Boy Meets World.
5731000	5734680	Part of that might be because the profile of Allie McBeal was higher, but it also may
5734680	5738200	be that Boy Meets World's younger audience wasn't expected to deal with a topic such
5738200	5742320	as race, and the fact that they weren't bothered by Angela and Sean, at least in Trina
5742320	5746680	McGee's experience, speaks to the fact of how racism is a learned behavior, that kids
5746680	5750000	aren't really born with this prejudice in their mind, but learn it through the examples
5750000	5751000	around them.
5751000	5755040	And from that perspective, Angela and Sean offer a positive example of an interracial
5755040	5756360	relationship.
5756360	5761000	But does that represent reality, a reality that a younger audience needs to learn about?
5761000	5764540	Those are big questions I'm not sure this video can really tackle, aside from acknowledging
5764540	5768480	that interracial relationships have faced a lot of social pressure and continue to do
5768480	5769480	so today.
5769480	5773840	I don't think a show is weaker for not reflecting reality though, it's just taking a different
5773840	5775480	approach to tackle the same problem.
5775480	5779400	I can't cover every single topic that comes up in one of these shows, so thankfully I
5779400	5781000	have a little help this time.
5781000	5783240	Hey, T1J here.
5783240	5789000	Just like Jose, I'm a huge fan of sitcoms, and I have a lot of nostalgic fondness for
5789000	5791680	Boy Meets World in particular.
5791680	5797240	So I actually also made a video about the show, except my video is focused around the
5797240	5803400	roller coaster relationship between Sean and Angela, which is maybe my favorite sitcom
5803400	5809160	couple story of all time, for various reasons, which you'll have to watch my video to learn.
5809160	5811760	Come check it out when you're done with Jose's video.
5811760	5816080	Sadly for Sean and Angela, the reunion only lasted until the end of season 7, as a few
5816080	5820960	episodes before the finale, we see Angela leave for Europe to spend some time reconnecting
5820960	5833520	with her father.
5833520	5838080	The episode also revealed another departure might be happening soon, with Tepanga getting
5838080	5849720	an offer from NYU.
5849720	5853840	And that brings us to the two-part series finale, Brave New World.
5853840	5857440	There isn't too much in the way of plot, as these episodes offer more a chance for
5857440	5861640	the characters to reflect on how their lives have brought them to this point, complete
5861640	5864760	with a number of clips from throughout the show's seven seasons.
5864760	5868700	Tepanga briefly considers not going to New York, but instead is convinced to go after
5868700	5888680	some words of wisdom from Mr. Feeney and some encouragement from Corey.
5888680	5899800	Eric decides to go along with Corey and Tepanga to New York City.
5899800	5904160	Sean and Corey are in the midst of saying goodbye, when Tepanga reveals, Sean is apparently
5904160	5923680	going with them too.
5923680	5927480	Jack and Rachel decide to go in the Peace Corps together, with Jack giving up his stepfather's
5927480	5939240	money.
5939240	5943320	And Corey has a moment with his new brother Joshua, who seems to have aged pretty quickly
5943320	5969560	in the last season.
5969560	5971840	And everyone says goodbye.
5999560	6014160	And the final line of the series is…
6014160	6017940	The series ends hitting the themes that ran through it, that those formative years are
6017940	6022320	called that for a reason, and those early relationships you forge can sit with you for
6022320	6024320	a lifetime.
6024320	6028280	Childhood isn't something to be frivolously forgotten as you age, but something to be
6028280	6030480	cherished and remembered as you grow older.
6030480	6034840	It's when the world begins to imprint itself on you, shaping your beliefs and relationships
6034840	6036640	for the rest of your life.
6036640	6040420	In an interview Michael Jacobs described it, what I think launched a sustained run for
6040420	6045760	Boy was an incredible evolution of what you knew, thought you know, to what you never
6045760	6047200	really knew at all.
6047200	6050920	And this final episode highlights that journey, from the world of the first season where the
6050920	6055080	lessons and stories are simple, to the more turbulent high school seasons where the world
6055080	6059000	of the characters is turned upside down, and then finally in the college years, it's
6059000	6062880	a whole new space where you realize how much more of the world there is to know.
6062880	6067360	The overarching story does reveal that this sitcom is coming from a very specific perspective,
6067360	6069920	one of the comfortable life of an upper middle class family.
6069920	6073760	Corey's life is challenging, but it doesn't feature hardships that outskied the scope
6073760	6075960	of a typical journey to adolescence.
6075960	6079680	That might be why the series doesn't feel dated, since the only troubles it tackles
6079680	6084480	are the ones kids have been facing for a long time and will continue to face into the future.
6084480	6088960	This show is ultimately about finding a place in the world, changing it where you can, but
6088960	6091560	still trusting that it is a place for you.
6091560	6094620	But the story of the Matthews family wasn't over here.
6094620	6099120	We get a glimpse of Corey and Topanga in New York, 14 years later, in a Boy Meets World
6099120	6103320	spinoff.
6103320	6106760	After Boy Meets World went off the air, it moved into syndication, and while most shows
6106760	6110400	have a few years there before fading away, something strange happened.
6110400	6113300	Boy Meets World did very well on the Disney Channel.
6113300	6117000	So well that the show's profile actually went up, with its old audience returning to
6117000	6120040	it and a new audience discovering it for the first time.
6120040	6124480	The growing popularity led to the possibility of a reboot, and after much urging from Disney,
6124480	6129240	Michael Jacobs would return to these characters in 2014 with Girl Meets World.
6129240	6133680	Starring Rowan Blanchard as Riley Matthews, Corey and Topanga's daughter, and Sabrina
6133680	6137840	Carpenter, her best friend Maya Hart, the series is set in New York City and tells the
6137840	6139640	story of a girl meeting the world.
6139640	6143360	Only the Mr. Feeny role this time is played by Corey Matthews.
6143360	6147080	In addition to telling the stories of Riley and Maya, and their group of friends, the
6147080	6151440	series also featured a number of cameos of Boy Meets World favorites, tying up several
6151440	6154120	loose ends and offering a few moments of closure.
6154120	6157380	Although the series stands well enough on its own, it's definitely enhanced by having
6157380	6159000	watched Boy Meets World.
6159000	6163120	Episode 16 in the first season, Girl Meets Home for the Holidays, is a particularly great
6163120	6172280	episode as it features the return of Sean Hunter.
6172280	6176360	What makes this episode work so well is how it builds on the original series, with Wayward
6176360	6180600	Sean constantly looking for a home and integrates him into the story of Maya who's struggling
6180600	6184760	to find a place for herself, and it speaks to the show's theme of how people change
6184760	6189520	people, how Corey changed Sean, Riley changed Maya, and how Sean and Maya can change one
6189520	6190520	another.
6190520	6195000	It ran for three seasons on the Disney Channel, totaling 72 episodes, before being canceled
6195000	6196360	in 2017.
6196360	6201000	The cancellation of the series was a bit surprising as its ratings had only slightly dipped over
6201000	6205040	three seasons, and Michael Jacobs had fought to keep the show on the air, whether at Disney
6205040	6206420	or somewhere else.
6206420	6210720	But it had a solid send-off, and while it might not have been as consistent as Boy Meets
6210720	6217640	World, Girl Meets World's highest points might have been a few notches higher.
6217640	6221040	After finishing Boy Meets World, Ben Savage would go to Stanford, where he majored in
6221040	6222360	political science.
6222360	6225840	After completing his education, he returned to the world of entertainment, acting and
6225840	6227760	directing, and a number of different projects.
6227760	6231880	He's also been cast to play younger versions of Mandy Patinkin on two different shows,
6231880	6234040	which I think is a fun fact.
6234040	6238120	Ryder Strong also took some time off from acting after Boy Meets World to attend Columbia
6238120	6241920	University, though he did take a semester off to appear on the movie Cabin Fever.
6241920	6246920	More recently, he's done less acting as he's instead chosen to focus on writing and directing.
6246920	6251400	Daniel Fischl went on to appear in a number of movies and worked as a TV presenter following
6251400	6252680	the end of Boy Meets World.
6252680	6257280	Eventually, she decided to go back to school attending California State University Fullerton,
6257280	6259160	attaining a degree in psychology.
6259160	6261800	More recently, she has been working as a director.
6261800	6265680	Will Friedle landed another major role while working on Boy Meets World, becoming the voice
6265680	6268920	of Terry McGinnis in the animated series Batman Beyond.
6268920	6273520	In a strange coincidence, that series finished its last recording on the same day that Boy
6273520	6275360	Meets World wrapped filming.
6275360	6279440	Since then though, Friedle has become a prolific voice actor, appearing in numerous series
6279440	6283200	from Kim Possible to a slew of other TV shows and video games.
6283200	6286560	In his personal life, he's also learned to manage anxiety issues that affected him
6286560	6290560	during and after the end of Boy Meets World, and happily he now seems to be in a much better
6290560	6292080	place in his life.
6292080	6295960	Betsy Randall took some time off from acting a few years after the end of Boy Meets World,
6295960	6299520	but she has been working continuously since returning in 2014.
6299520	6303400	She's most recently appeared in the movie Painter, and in 2013, she celebrated the
6303400	6305360	birth of her first grandchild.
6305360	6308840	William Russ has been acting consistently since the end of Boy Meets World, appearing
6308840	6310920	in countless TV shows and movies.
6310920	6313680	Most notably he appeared in Deadwood as Otis Russell.
6313680	6317400	He also has the unique distinction of being the only actor to direct episodes of Boy Meets
6317400	6319480	World and Girl Meets World.
6319480	6322880	Trina McGee continued to act following the end of Boy Meets World, appearing in movies
6322880	6328640	and television, including movies Friday after Next, and the excellently titled movie Da
6328640	6330240	Booty Shop.
6330240	6333400	Just recently she wrote and directed the film Detainment.
6333400	6337160	Matthew Lawrence continued to act in movies and television after finishing up on Boy Meets
6337160	6338160	World.
6338160	6341560	He's done less acting over the years, but he has continued singing on occasion, having
6341560	6343320	been a singer since his childhood.
6343320	6348720	He recently performed in the 2021 movie Mistletoe Mix-Up, singing alongside his brothers Joey
6348720	6350320	and Andrew.
6350320	6354080	After Boy Meets World, Maitland Ward continued to act for a few years, notably appearing
6354080	6355760	in the movie White Chicks.
6355760	6360200	Over the years she has moved away from the mainstream acting world and in 2019, she began
6360200	6361680	working in adult films.
6361680	6366360	She seems to be quite happy in her new field and is enjoying exploring this new career
6366360	6367480	path.
6367480	6371600	Even after such a long and prolific career, William Daniels continued to act in a number
6371600	6375800	of roles following the end of Boy Meets World, including a recent reprisal as the card Kit
6375800	6379840	from Knight Rider in the 2020 movie Super Intelligence.
6379840	6383480	Daniels has become more selective with his projects in recent years, and at 95 years
6383480	6386560	of age, he's mostly taking life easy these days.
6386560	6391600	He is still married to his wife of 70 years, Bonnie Bartlett, and they are still adorable
6391600	6392800	together.
6392800	6396680	While researching this video, I watched over a dozen different panels at band conventions
6396680	6400520	where the cast shared memories of working on the series, and what was particularly surprising
6400520	6402800	was how many of these panels were in the last five years.
6402800	6406680	And while there were always Girl Meets World fans who found the show later in life, there
6406680	6410160	are also a number of older fans who fondly remember it from their childhood, talking
6410160	6413800	about how comforting it was to watch these characters, who remind them of the more carefree
6413800	6415400	days of the 90s.
6415400	6418280	These are the childhood memories of when everything was going to turn out alright if
6418280	6422640	we just followed the rules, and we did, yet here we are.
6422640	6424240	Things aren't alright at all.
6424240	6428720	The world and television in general has become a more cynical place in the 22 years since
6428720	6432120	the last episode of Boy Meets World aired, and I don't think there's any shame in
6432120	6436040	watching a few episodes of a TV series that carried some optimism and hope about how in
6436040	6439160	this big scary world, there was still a place for you.
6439160	6442560	It's comfort without being completely overwhelmed by fantasy.
6442560	6446480	Boy Meets World isn't blind to the suffering of the world, and goes out of its way to explore
6446480	6451240	these topics, but it can never escape the family-friendly TGIF dynamic it was born into,
6451240	6454480	and while that doesn't make it a bad show, I think it's important to acknowledge its
6454480	6455880	perspective.
6455880	6460080	That comfort, with a dose of reality, might be the key to its longevity.
6460080	6465000	It saw the world, at least part of it, as something flawed, yet held out some hope that
6465000	6468600	it could be made better, which is why the series ended with a final lesson from Mr.
6468600	6472840	Feeney to dream, try, and do good.
6472840	6477600	With the safe lesson of Boy Meets World over, offering a hint of the trials ahead of us,
6477600	6482200	the lesson is not to wish for the fantasies it presented, or cynically sneer at its limited
6482200	6487400	scope, but to instead take to heart the idea that we make the most of the only world we've
6487400	6492320	got, and hopefully the next generation will be making a better one.
6492320	6495720	When I first started doing these retrospectives, Boy Meets World was one of the first shows
6495720	6497000	I saw requested.
6497000	6499480	I remember thinking to myself, probably not likely.
6499480	6503440	I was never a huge fan, I don't know if I necessarily want to revisit that one, but
6503440	6508660	over time the requests kept coming, and eventually I was worn down, and I was happily surprised.
6508660	6512280	It held up pretty well, and while it doesn't resonate as strongly as it probably does for
6512280	6516360	the more die-hard Boy Meets World fans out there who might be watching this, I hope you
6516360	6522080	still enjoyed this trip down memory line, and this revisiting of a beloved series.
6522080	6526880	This video would not have been possible without the lovely names you see floating up the screen
6526880	6527880	here.
