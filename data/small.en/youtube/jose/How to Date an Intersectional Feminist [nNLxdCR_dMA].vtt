00:00.000 --> 00:10.220
Oh, dating is hard. Really hard. Especially for leftist soy boys like me, who have never

00:10.220 --> 00:15.740
really touched a woman. But hey, my pal, Roaming Millennial has posted some great advice

00:15.740 --> 00:21.920
for how to date an intersectional feminist. Not really, of course. This is actually just

00:21.920 --> 00:26.900
a video of her talking shit about an intersectional feminist. In this case, it's a woman named

00:26.900 --> 00:31.820
Lyra Witt, who wrote an article about questions an intersectional feminist should ask on a

00:31.820 --> 00:36.820
first date. Before really getting into those questions, Roaming Millennial gives Lyra Witt's

00:36.820 --> 00:46.860
Twitter account a shoutout with this. Wow, that looks bad. Even worse if you decide not

00:46.860 --> 00:52.340
to look at the context. Instead, if you spend about one minute looking into it, you'll

00:52.340 --> 00:57.220
see that this tweet is actually at the end of a tiny little thread commenting on a story about a

00:57.220 --> 01:02.820
mixed race girl growing up in Ireland who was raised by white parents. It's a sad meditation

01:02.820 --> 01:07.460
on the limitations of colorblindness, and how pretending race is irrelevant is something that

01:07.460 --> 01:12.980
does a disservice to real discrimination. The idea is that living in a cloistered white world can

01:12.980 --> 01:18.100
leave someone of mixed racial background unprepared for a world that will judge them on the basis of

01:18.100 --> 01:24.180
their skin color. Now, I can't read Lyra Witt's mind, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say

01:24.180 --> 01:29.740
that her tweet about killing all the white people was a cheeky swipe at the idea of whiteness as a

01:29.740 --> 01:36.060
default identity disregarding the real discrimination people of color face. I managed to decode that

01:36.060 --> 01:42.220
tricky bit of subtext by reading the actual text of what she wrote. And if you really want to ignore

01:42.220 --> 01:48.780
that context, I'd like to point out that Lyra Witt has a white father and a white husband. Maybe

01:48.780 --> 01:53.020
Roaming Millennial should try doing some basic research when bringing up a tweet in the video.

01:53.020 --> 01:58.260
She can start by scrolling up slightly. Let's actually get to the meat of the article and

01:58.260 --> 02:05.500
Roaming Millennials rebuttal. Number one, do you believe that black lives matter? Yes, wonderful.

02:05.500 --> 02:10.260
Let's start here. There are three categories that are non-negotiables for me, an understanding of

02:10.260 --> 02:14.500
race, class, and gender. I don't want to have to have laborious discussions where I have to prove

02:14.500 --> 02:18.500
to someone that white privilege or not black privilege exists. If they are willing to learn

02:18.500 --> 02:23.540
and listen and make the space to decenter their whiteness, if they're white, that's a good place

02:23.540 --> 02:27.980
to start. People aren't debating whether black lives do in fact matter. People are debating whether

02:27.980 --> 02:32.420
systemic racial injustice still exists. Is someone having a different opinion than you on the issue

02:32.420 --> 02:36.540
really that much of a turnout that you need to find out their position right away on the first date

02:36.540 --> 02:40.700
in order to screen them out? Okay, what Roaming Millennial isn't getting here is that her position

02:41.420 --> 02:48.780
and brace herself here is one of privilege. It's easy to be a non-black person and respectfully

02:48.780 --> 02:53.820
disagree with a friendly person who doesn't think that systemic anti-black racial discrimination

02:53.820 --> 02:58.860
exists because you literally don't have any skin in the game. If you're an asshole, you might not

02:58.860 --> 03:04.220
even care, I guess. But if you're someone who cares about injustice, systemic discrimination

03:04.220 --> 03:08.700
might bother you. And this may be another shocker, but there are some people out there,

03:09.340 --> 03:14.860
let's just call them intersectional feminists, who are passionate about fighting injustice.

03:15.500 --> 03:21.580
And if that passionate person is black and someone who therefore faces that systemic discrimination,

03:21.580 --> 03:25.580
they might not want to date someone who thinks they're delusional. Basically,

03:25.580 --> 03:30.460
this first point is a simple test of empathy and Roaming Millennial failed.

03:31.180 --> 03:36.540
Number two, what are your thoughts on gender and sexual orientation? The gender binary is a tiny

03:36.540 --> 03:41.740
box and I wish it didn't exist, but it does. I can't imagine being with someone who is transphobic.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.300
As a feminist and woman of color, it would be a betrayal of what I stand for. Okay, this is

03:46.300 --> 03:51.740
something I see all the time and it bothers me. Believing in a gender binary is not the same thing

03:51.740 --> 03:59.420
as being transphobic. It kind of is transphobic. Not only does Roaming Millennial betray her

03:59.420 --> 04:04.540
ignorance on the subject, but she also denies the lived experience of people who fall outside the

04:04.540 --> 04:10.380
gender binary. Telling someone they're just confused in the face of evidence to the contrary

04:10.380 --> 04:15.980
is a pretty shitty thing to do. Oh, and since I know Roaming Millennial is such a lover of

04:15.980 --> 04:20.380
science and learning, I've included a link to my favorite science YouTuber, Concordance,

04:20.380 --> 04:27.420
and his video on binary gender. Maybe take 10 minutes out of your life and learn how to

04:28.300 --> 04:33.180
uh not be a dick, basically. There's no way straight to say that one, never mind.

04:33.900 --> 04:38.860
Number three, how do you work to dismantle sexism and misogyny in your life? I've met cishet men

04:38.860 --> 04:43.740
who hate women. They say they love women, but that love is conditional on not having their

04:43.740 --> 04:48.780
toxic masculinity questioned or threatened in any way. And they love us as a monolith. They love

04:48.780 --> 04:53.340
what women have to offer, whether it is sex, food, love care, emotional labor. They love us for what

04:53.340 --> 04:58.140
we can do for them, not because of who we are for ourselves. Wow, don't you hate it when men

04:58.140 --> 05:02.700
make their love for women conditional based on a woman's worldview? Gee, isn't it awful when men

05:02.700 --> 05:08.540
are only interested in women based on superficial aspects? Self-awareness, zero. I think she's saying

05:09.180 --> 05:15.660
a worldview is superficial. I'm actually not sure what she's trying to say because it's hidden

05:15.660 --> 05:20.940
under the weight of this terrible joke. She thinks she's caught the author in a bout of hypocrisy.

05:21.820 --> 05:27.420
This is the point she's responding to. Witt is saying that an intersectional feminist

05:27.420 --> 05:31.500
probably wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to toxic masculinity.

05:32.620 --> 05:38.060
In fact, I'd wager a guest that most women wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to

05:38.060 --> 05:43.420
toxic masculinity. This seems obvious and sensible to me, and you would think Roman

05:43.420 --> 05:47.900
Millennial would have understood it, having read it out loud just a few moments before her

05:47.900 --> 05:54.940
commentary, but no. She thinks having an ideology and criticizing someone else for having a different

05:54.940 --> 06:02.220
one is somehow hypocritical. It actually isn't when the two ideologies are polar opposites.

06:02.220 --> 06:09.980
You could even say they're conflicting. Also, an ideology is not superficial. It's actually the

06:09.980 --> 06:18.860
exact opposite. Jesus Christ. Let's move on. I grew up with Jewish, Israeli, and non-Israeli

06:18.860 --> 06:23.180
friends and Palestinian friends. Before even understanding how power and oppression work

06:23.180 --> 06:27.740
together, we understood the trivial hatred that colonized and put in constant danger the lives of

06:27.740 --> 06:33.020
Palestinians every single day. Being pro-Palestine is not the same thing as being anti-Semitic. I

06:33.020 --> 06:37.660
shouldn't even have to express that, but being pro-Palestine and BDS is a necessary part of

06:37.740 --> 06:42.060
intersectionality. You know, I get why people like this aren't big fans of Israeli, got the whole

06:42.060 --> 06:46.460
colonialism, settler, military power thing going on, but I don't understand why they would choose

06:46.460 --> 06:51.260
to identify themselves as being specifically pro-Palestine. Try going to Palestine and talking

06:51.260 --> 06:59.820
about all this LGBTQ non-binary gender stuff. Okay, so what do the LGBT policies of Israel or

06:59.820 --> 07:04.700
Palestine have to do with what Whit is talking about? Does Roman Millennial think we should ignore

07:04.700 --> 07:09.500
people being oppressed by a colonial power because they aren't down with the LGBT community?

07:10.300 --> 07:17.020
Is this her trying to use SJW logic against itself? She doesn't really understand how SJW

07:17.020 --> 07:22.380
or regular logic seem to work in this case. And this is basically just what about-ism run amok,

07:22.380 --> 07:27.340
and it won't be the last time we see this. Number six, what is your understanding of settler

07:27.340 --> 07:32.140
colonialism and indigenous rights? I didn't grow up in the United States. I was raised in Switzerland,

07:32.140 --> 07:35.980
so my understanding of how Europeans committed genocide against indigenous populations here in

07:35.980 --> 07:40.460
the U.S. was fairly limited. It required a good deal of my own research to really understand how

07:40.460 --> 07:45.100
settler colonialism works and how devastating the eraser and violence against Native Americans is

07:45.100 --> 07:50.780
and was. Your date thinks Native Americans are tropes or relics of the past? No thanks. No one

07:50.780 --> 07:58.300
thinks that. Just nobody. Okay, okay, this shit. She just kind of says that no one believes in it.

07:58.300 --> 08:02.460
Right after reading a section where the author admits that she was someone who believed in it

08:02.460 --> 08:08.700
until she was educated on the subject. Are you taking in anything you're actually reading here?

08:08.700 --> 08:12.860
If they support the school-to-prison pipeline, then there's a good chance they'll only value you

08:12.860 --> 08:17.180
for your ability to nurture them without any reciprocation. I feel like what she's actually

08:17.180 --> 08:23.740
saying here is that people who support capitalism can't love their partners. Love is just for

08:23.740 --> 08:32.300
communists. And what the fuck? Love is just for communists? How did you get that from the idea of

08:32.300 --> 08:41.500
someone supporting school-to-prison pipelines not being very nurturing? Wow. Er, wait, wait.

08:42.220 --> 08:48.380
Did Roman Millennial just say capitalists support the school-to-prison pipeline?

08:49.260 --> 08:53.020
She just gave the game away. Hit it, boys.

09:04.700 --> 09:10.380
Number eight. Can any human be illegal? We live on a tiny planet with land and water within a

09:10.380 --> 09:15.900
galaxy surrounded by a universe with an inconceivable number of other galaxies and planets. Yet here we

09:15.900 --> 09:20.620
dictate where we are and who is allowed to be where we are. Don't even know what she was trying

09:20.620 --> 09:24.460
to say with that. It seems like there were contradictory statements in those two sentences.

09:25.180 --> 09:30.060
The problem with this line is that it's slightly incongruent and probably could have been worded

09:30.060 --> 09:34.380
more effectively had it focused on the vastness of the earth rather than the vastness of the

09:34.380 --> 09:39.580
universe, which we can't really access. That's just me wearing my editor hat, of course. Roman

09:39.580 --> 09:43.580
Millennial doesn't make any sort of commentary on that. What she's saying here is that she doesn't

09:43.580 --> 09:50.860
understand that the contradiction here is the point. You know, there's lots of space, yet we're

09:50.860 --> 10:00.620
saying where people can and can't be. Do you get it now? No? Okay. But whatever. It's just really

10:00.620 --> 10:05.660
weird to me how she can claim that white Americans stole this land, yet that at the same time no one

10:05.660 --> 10:10.620
should be allowed to dictate where other people are. You can't be mad at whites being in the U.S.

10:10.620 --> 10:17.020
while also saying that all people should be able to come to the U.S. Do you not see the difference

10:17.020 --> 10:24.620
between letting people freely travel and migrate around the world and how that's different from

10:24.620 --> 10:32.300
colonizing a land and genociding the population? How do you not understand this?

10:32.940 --> 10:37.660
Number nine. Do you support Muslim Americans and non-Muslim people from Islamic countries?

10:37.660 --> 10:42.620
I can't think of any other religion which has been vilified and lied about more than Islam in

10:42.620 --> 10:47.660
a cultural and systemic way. I am not Muslim, so I will stay in my lane, but I cannot imagine for

10:47.660 --> 10:52.140
a second even claiming to be a feminist if I didn't stand in solidarity with my Muslim friends

10:52.140 --> 10:58.540
and family. Guys, we need to make this plane ticket happen. I'm not even meaning right now.

10:58.540 --> 11:04.220
Let's send her to Saudi Arabia, home of the two most holy sites in Islam. Let's do it, guys.

11:04.220 --> 11:10.380
So, Roaming Millennial says she's not meme-ing, but I assume she is because she's a liar,

11:10.380 --> 11:15.500
or at least disingenuous, or maybe she doesn't know what meme-ing is. She doesn't understand

11:15.500 --> 11:19.900
most of what she's talking about. So, yeah, maybe that's it. Anyway, Saudi Arabia is oppressive.

11:20.780 --> 11:25.740
What does that have to do with oppressing Muslim people in the U.S.? Does Roaming Millennial not

11:25.740 --> 11:31.580
think this is happening? Or does she think it's less important than people being oppressed in

11:31.580 --> 11:39.500
other countries? What about Islam strikes again? Also, read the title of point nine again.

11:39.500 --> 11:44.620
Whit explicitly writes non-Muslim people in Islamic countries needing support too,

11:45.180 --> 11:52.780
so she was speaking out against oppression in Saudi Arabia. I don't know. I'm not surprised

11:52.780 --> 11:57.980
you missed it. You missed most of this article. We're not really learning anything responding

11:58.060 --> 12:03.980
to her, so here's a fun fact. The term whataboutism was coined as a response to Soviets who refused

12:03.980 --> 12:09.980
to talk about their country's misdeeds to focus on American ones. And if Roaming Millennial is using

12:09.980 --> 12:13.900
Soviet tactics, we did it again, boys. We won.

12:13.900 --> 12:29.020
Also, I'm not a tanky. Buddhist Stalinism, etc.

12:29.660 --> 12:34.620
Number 10. Does your allyship include disabled folks? Be mindful of others who mock disabled

12:34.620 --> 12:39.820
people. That kind of cruelty is inexcusable. On a date with someone who uses ableist slurs,

12:39.820 --> 12:43.500
walk away. I don't think you should be cruel to disabled people. Don't think you should

12:43.500 --> 13:08.940
be cruel to anybody, really. But I have the feeling that this person would probably qualify

13:08.940 --> 13:13.580
using the word retarded to describe something that was not literally retarded as ableist,

13:13.580 --> 13:19.900
which I don't agree with. Why can't she just agree with wit and move on? Does she really need to

13:19.900 --> 13:26.620
make something up just to talk shit? Also, for the record, using that word to describe someone

13:26.620 --> 13:32.540
or something is a shitty thing to do. There's nothing really here to engage with. She's just

13:32.540 --> 13:38.380
like, it's okay to say it, and doesn't explain herself. You know, I'm actually starting to think

13:38.380 --> 13:42.780
that this list existing is a good thing and that all intersexual feminists should follow it

13:42.780 --> 13:46.780
so that people can know who you are and get out of there as quickly as possible.

13:47.340 --> 13:52.300
That's a great line for a closer. This list was designed to screen up people exactly like

13:52.300 --> 13:59.580
Roman Millennial. Very ironic. Personally, if I was on my first date ever and they brought up

13:59.580 --> 14:03.500
how shitty this Roman Millennial video was, I'd be crushing on her pretty hard.

14:03.500 --> 14:11.180
I'm feeling kind of down now. I mean, if I listen to Roman Millennial,

14:11.180 --> 14:16.780
intersexual feminists may be too nutty to date. Or at least the ones who follow that list, right?

14:16.780 --> 14:20.780
But you know what does Roman Millennial even know? She can't even read a damn article.

14:20.780 --> 14:25.180
So I'll wrap this up and I guess I'm gonna be alone forever. Bye!
