00:00.000 --> 00:04.660
Two taboos in polite conversation have traditionally been talking about religion and talking about

00:04.660 --> 00:05.660
politics.

00:05.660 --> 00:09.860
People get immediately heated, and it often isn't conducive to a pleasant, conflict-free

00:09.860 --> 00:13.660
encounter, so it's easy to make a new friend and have no idea there's some kind of political

00:13.660 --> 00:15.440
disagreement between the two of you.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.960
But if you take an interest in politics, and if you clicked on this video, odds are you

00:18.960 --> 00:22.020
do, it's something that will likely come up eventually.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.340
And suddenly, this blissful ignorance of your friendship fades away, and you have to look

00:25.340 --> 00:27.820
at the reality of your friendship in the eye.

00:27.820 --> 00:31.500
In the past few years, friendships being damaged by political differences has become a recurring

00:31.500 --> 00:35.960
topic in news media, and we often see media figures opining about political opinions costing

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
them friends.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.600
In many cases, it's easy to feel sympathy for someone who has lost a friend, or understanding

00:41.600 --> 00:46.200
when a person expresses anxiety as to why they keep their political affiliations hidden.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.100
But not all complaints about friendships being affected by politics are the same.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.520
The rules for friendships vary, and I want to look at how these dynamics shift, both

00:54.520 --> 00:59.480
for friendships in private, and for those of us who have friendships in public.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.460
In recent years, polling has shown people are increasingly less likely to have friends

01:02.460 --> 01:05.000
with different political persuasions.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.360
According to a YouGov poll of American citizens, all three categories of voters – Democrats,

01:09.360 --> 01:12.820
Republicans, and Independents – have become less likely to be friends with anyone who

01:12.820 --> 01:17.840
has different political opinions, with Democrats showing the biggest change from 2016 to 2020.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.080
A Pew Research poll changed the question slightly, instead asking supporters from each respective

01:22.080 --> 01:26.200
side in the previous federal election if they have a few or no friends who supported

01:26.200 --> 01:27.680
the opposite candidate.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.680
Once again, both sides revealed very few of their friends supported the other's candidate,

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
if any at all.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.200
In the UK, a similar poll was conducted by Ipsos, and the results were similar, although

01:37.200 --> 01:38.560
this one dug a little deeper.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.720
Much like the American polls, it showed that both the left and right found it difficult

01:41.720 --> 01:45.080
to be friends with someone who had a different political affiliation, with those supporting

01:45.080 --> 01:48.760
the left-wing Labour Party having more difficulty in being friends with those in the right-wing

01:48.760 --> 01:50.000
Conservative Party.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.560
When digging into this particular poll, though, the numbers reveal something interesting.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.800
The propositions asked on specific issues revealed that these divides are on significant

01:57.800 --> 02:01.040
issues that are more than mere disagreements on public policy.

02:01.040 --> 02:06.160
For example, participants were asked to agree or disagree with these two propositions.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.680
It would be hard to be friends with someone who supports the expansion of transgender

02:09.680 --> 02:14.920
rights in the UK, and it would be hard to be friends with someone who thinks transgender

02:14.920 --> 02:17.080
rights have gone too far in the UK.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.040
It's a much deeper question than asking what someone thinks is the appropriate tax

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
rate.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.400
Since 2015, reports of transphobic hate crimes have quadrupled.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.800
According to Gallup, 1 in 4 trans people have been threatened with or experienced transphobic

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
violence.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.320
1 in 3 UK employers are less likely to employ a trans person.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.560
Almost half of trans people have a suicide attempt in their past.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.840
So the state of trans rights in the UK are not great.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.160
Hearing that the question in the Ipsos poll reveals not just someone's attitude towards

02:47.160 --> 02:51.320
friendships across political lines, but how the assumption of political affiliation carries

02:51.320 --> 02:53.960
with it an attitude towards the rights of trans people.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.280
If someone believes trans rights have gone too far, it's a question that goes beyond

02:58.280 --> 03:01.280
politics and it's the realm of whether or not you believe someone has the right to

03:01.280 --> 03:05.240
publicly identify as the gender they understand themselves to be.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.120
We can try to intellectualize this in terms of it being a debate, and some people might

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
enjoy doing that.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.040
It may be easy enough for a cis person to be friends with someone who believes trans

03:13.040 --> 03:16.720
rights have gone too far, even if it means constantly getting into arguments.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.200
But for a trans person, these arguments can hit a lot harder when it's your own rights

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
being debated.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.800
And there's so many other degrees of differences, such as a cis person who might be more passionate

03:24.800 --> 03:28.600
about trans rights because a sister or brother is trans, or perhaps a trans person who can

03:28.600 --> 03:31.280
compartmentalize well enough to engage in that debate.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.640
But in the midst of all this rhetorical exercise, it should be understood that what's being

03:34.640 --> 03:38.840
debated here are the rights of human beings, and that this debate being politicized doesn't

03:38.840 --> 03:41.920
make it the same as other debates on policy issues.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.000
This is much like debates around marriage equality, civil rights, voting rights, and

03:46.000 --> 03:49.920
an endless number of issues that have been politicized, both in the past and present.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.800
Someone who advocates against trans rights is, whether they know it or not, advocating

03:53.800 --> 03:54.800
for bigotry.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.180
While someone can choose to be friends with a bigot in their personal life, reducing this

03:58.180 --> 04:02.020
disagreement to a political one is disingenuous.

04:02.020 --> 04:07.760
That isn't to say all disagreements across political affiliations are questions of personal

04:07.760 --> 04:08.760
rights.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.560
Considering what sort of issues get politicized, I think it's an important distinction to

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
make.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.700
Amidst all these discussions about friendships being affected by politics, disagreements

04:16.700 --> 04:19.440
on issues like this reveal something far deeper as at play.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.200
In late 2020, the New York Times asked students about relationships with people who have differing

04:23.200 --> 04:24.640
political opinions.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.520
Here are a few of the responses.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.720
Some people that believe that politics shouldn't ruin relationships don't realize that at

04:29.720 --> 04:32.360
times not caring about politics is a privilege.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.920
If my friends or family members have huge differences in opinions from me, for example,

04:36.920 --> 04:41.560
if they don't support Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+, and women's rights, etc., then I

04:41.560 --> 04:43.980
don't want to associate myself with them at all.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.320
That is more than just politics, it's about people's basic human rights.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.040
People's lives are more important than relationships.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.680
As a queer woman, hearing that one of my friends supports Trump means that they support all

04:53.680 --> 04:58.660
the discrimination and laws he has enacted against the LGBTQIA plus community, as well

04:58.660 --> 05:02.800
as women, people of color, Native Americans, disabled people, etc.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.800
Usually if they're a friend, I open a dialogue and talk about my beliefs often with them,

05:06.800 --> 05:09.940
trying to get them to understand what the facts are, what the other side is, and why

05:09.940 --> 05:11.020
I feel that way.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.360
If they're family, I tend to avoid them when I can.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.980
If they change their mind and admit that supporting someone who doesn't see me as a human being

05:16.980 --> 05:20.120
is wrong, then I will continue to have that relationship with them.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.320
If they can't or refuse to listen, then our relationship will die.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.520
I can't respect someone who doesn't respect me.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.400
Whatever the response is determines how our relationship changes, whether we drift apart

05:29.400 --> 05:31.080
or go closer together.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.760
What I liked about these particular quotes is how they establish the importance of the

05:33.760 --> 05:35.900
type of relationship being considered.

05:35.900 --> 05:40.060
Not all friendships are equal, and a relationship with a family member is often much more meaningful

05:40.060 --> 05:41.100
than a friendship.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.020
In those cases, it becomes a real test as to how to maintain that relationship.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.740
Opinions like these certainly aren't universal.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.420
In the same article, some students offer different responses.

05:49.420 --> 05:53.900
In my family, my father was a Republican and my mother is a Democrat, but my parents have

05:53.900 --> 05:57.580
learned to not judge each other because of their political beliefs, but to accept each

05:57.580 --> 06:01.240
other's opinions and be grateful they are able to agree to disagree.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.780
This election was a great test for this way of thinking.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.060
Writing came out victorious.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.920
My father accepts that and moves on.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.340
As simple as that sounded, it taught me something that I will use when I start to build important

06:10.340 --> 06:11.860
relationships with people.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.260
Don't judge people based on their political opinions or their opposing opinions.

06:15.260 --> 06:16.900
Judge them for what they mean to you.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.580
I actually think it's not important in the slightest to have similar political beliefs

06:20.580 --> 06:21.580
to your friends and family.

06:21.580 --> 06:25.260
Rather, I think it's important to have different beliefs and opinions in order to gain perspective

06:25.260 --> 06:26.260
and educate yourself.

06:26.260 --> 06:30.420
I come from an extremely divided family, where my parents are extremely Republican.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.160
One sister is extremely liberal.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.760
The other is fairly moderate, and I am moderate, leaning towards the left side.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.200
Although our disagreements can get frustrating and feelings can be hurt, I am thankful that

06:39.200 --> 06:43.480
I am able to have all perspectives and educate myself to the best of my ability in order

06:43.480 --> 06:47.400
to create my own political beliefs and not just choose my position based on those who

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
surround me.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.800
The real disparity between these attitudes regarding the intersection of friendship and

06:51.800 --> 06:56.360
politics is not so much the idea valuing one over the other, but rather what someone considers

06:56.360 --> 06:58.120
a political question.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.120
Speaking to The Atlantic, Emily Van Dyne, a communication professor at the University

07:02.120 --> 07:03.120
of Illinois, said,

07:03.120 --> 07:05.860
"'Politics isn't just politics anymore.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.280
Political identity now encompasses so many other things.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.200
Our social identity, our morals, our values."

07:11.200 --> 07:14.800
A casual friend whose incessant political rants may be easy enough to cut out of your

07:14.800 --> 07:18.660
life, but it's a bit tougher when it's a parent who regularly complains about immigrants.

07:18.660 --> 07:22.640
Some relationships can be formed around disagreement or argument, though this can sometimes reflect

07:22.640 --> 07:24.360
the stakes in the relationship.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.840
If politics are impacting how we form friendships, it might be worth stepping back to take a

07:27.840 --> 07:31.360
look at how much value one places in that particular friendship.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.280
Writing for Psychology Today, professor of psychology at George Mason University, Todd

07:35.280 --> 07:38.360
B. Kashtan, outlined some basics of friendship.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
1.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
There is a goal of pleasure.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.720
There is an expectation that both parties enjoy each other's company and show relatively

07:43.720 --> 07:46.240
equal amounts of appreciation and enjoyment.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
2.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.240
There is a sense of duty.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.400
There is an expectation that you will act in your friend's interests without being

07:51.400 --> 07:54.600
forced to, without being told to, without being accountable.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
3.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.320
There is a high level of empathy.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.840
There is an expectation that both parties will try to understand each other's perspective.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.840
You will not always agree, but you put in the work to understand who they are, where

08:03.840 --> 08:07.440
their motivations lie, and attempt to seek agreement when discord arises.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.160
When all friendships possess all three qualities, they typically have at least two.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
He then goes on.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
4.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.680
If you fear losing a friend or creating a turmoil in a relationship when being true

08:16.680 --> 08:21.120
to yourself, then your relationship lacks two of the three features of a firm foundation.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
Duty is missing.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
Empathy is missing.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.400
A solid friendship does not exist.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.920
When you are unable to reveal honest thoughts and feelings, then it becomes increasingly

08:28.920 --> 08:31.640
improbable that a solid friendship could even form.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.040
Although the article goes on to decry outspoken political testing as a means of determining

08:36.040 --> 08:40.400
one's friends, the passage above does suggest that friendships, at least the more meaningful

08:40.400 --> 08:45.080
ones, typically have an openness and honesty that would include not hiding one's politics.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.200
So how does one navigate a friendship with someone who has different politics?

08:49.200 --> 08:52.200
A number of articles have been produced exploring this very question.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.640
If you've decided that this relationship is one you want to maintain, a recurring

08:55.640 --> 08:59.880
theme is to engage calmly and with an attempt to understand the other side.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.360
Research has shown that taking the perspective of the person you're talking to can lead

09:03.360 --> 09:05.640
to a greater understanding of their position.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.240
One exercise that's recommended is trying to write a narrative from the perspective

09:09.240 --> 09:10.440
of the other person.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.400
This can help create some empathy and lead to more productive conversations.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.160
Listening and keeping a calm head can have a similar impact.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.500
It also helps to give someone room to be more complex.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.980
One bad political take may not mean someone can be easily slotted into a disastrous political

09:23.980 --> 09:24.980
position.

09:24.980 --> 09:29.820
There's also the very simple solution of just not talking about politics.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.180
Making it one of those topics you simply don't touch with that person.

09:33.180 --> 09:37.260
Like avoiding mentioning multi-level marketing scams around your Uncle Kevin so you can avoid

09:37.260 --> 09:38.820
another sales pitch.

09:38.820 --> 09:41.780
Everyone has to make choices for themselves as to what political lines they're okay

09:41.780 --> 09:42.780
with their friends being on.

09:42.780 --> 09:46.340
And while I encourage people to consider their choices carefully and not let themselves be

09:46.340 --> 09:50.300
trapped in a friendship that harms them or discard one based on minor differences, I

09:50.300 --> 09:54.140
think it's better to reserve judgment when it comes to who anyone chooses to be friends

09:54.140 --> 09:57.740
with in private, particularly if that person is a stranger.

09:57.740 --> 10:00.980
So if you're someone in that position, I don't think it's fair for anyone who doesn't

10:00.980 --> 10:03.700
know you to judge you on who you choose to be friends with.

10:03.700 --> 10:08.540
I would just express that I hope this friendship is something that makes you a more fulfilled

10:08.540 --> 10:09.540
person.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.340
This same outlook does not hold for public figures though.

10:12.340 --> 10:16.300
With all the groundwork of discussing star-crossed political friendships in the real world, let's

10:16.300 --> 10:18.580
now shift to something completely ridiculous.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.940
The world of online personalities.

10:19.940 --> 10:24.740
I'm sure everyone watching this has seen at least one video about parasocial relationships.

10:24.740 --> 10:29.540
That is, the relationship between a content creator, like me, and my audience.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.820
But what about the interplay between two different content creators?

10:32.820 --> 10:36.940
Or for our purposes, two content creators who engage in political commentary on different

10:36.940 --> 10:39.060
sides of the political spectrum?

10:39.060 --> 10:42.220
There are a couple of different ways political commentators strictly interact with one another

10:42.220 --> 10:43.340
here on YouTube.

10:43.340 --> 10:47.980
For video essayists, such as myself, you often see other commentators make guest appearances,

10:47.980 --> 10:50.580
typically reading quotes or excerpts from source material.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.740
I've had people do them for me, and I've done more of them than I can count for other

10:53.740 --> 10:54.740
people.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.740
Attention all trespassers!

10:56.740 --> 11:00.820
I am the supreme serpent!

11:00.820 --> 11:02.900
Less common is the collaboration.

11:02.900 --> 11:07.220
Two or more creators work on a video or videos that are available for one or more of their

11:07.220 --> 11:08.380
respective channels.

11:08.380 --> 11:12.700
I don't do much of these myself, though I recently worked on one with Mexie about a

11:12.700 --> 11:27.100
very special babysitting club.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.300
You might also see two creators interacting on a stream.

11:30.300 --> 11:35.020
This is where things get a bit more complicated, as there are a lot of ways this can go down.

11:35.020 --> 11:38.660
Someone might appear as part of a panel, it might be a one-on-one chat, sometimes it can

11:38.660 --> 11:39.660
be confrontational.

11:39.660 --> 11:43.340
I don't stream too much myself, so I have less experience with this one, but here is

11:43.340 --> 12:01.820
an example of what streams are like.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.260
Outside of YouTube, you might see creators interact in other mediums, like Twitter, like

12:05.260 --> 12:08.180
when I make a sick dunk and people acknowledge my brilliance.

12:08.180 --> 12:12.460
There are even some very rare moments when content creators beat in the real world as

12:12.460 --> 12:14.300
part of a public-facing event.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.980
As an example, in Toronto, myself and some other political content creators have hosted

12:17.980 --> 12:20.700
meetups where we interact with members of our audience.

12:20.700 --> 12:25.620
A fun bit of Jose trivia is that at the last one we did, that was in February 29th of 2020,

12:25.620 --> 12:29.060
I recorded the opening moments to my Married with Children video.

12:29.060 --> 12:33.260
Friends, I'm gonna need a boost to get through this video.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.260
Can I get a Whoa Jose?

12:35.260 --> 12:42.420
Okay, so those are five different examples of how content creators on YouTube interact.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.220
And there's one thing, to varying degrees, they all have in common.

12:45.220 --> 12:47.620
They are all performative.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.300
Let me clarify what I mean by performative.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.940
I don't mean presenting some kind of false front.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.620
Many of these moments can be authentic.

12:54.620 --> 12:58.340
Rather, I mean these appearances are done very much with the knowledge that they are

12:58.340 --> 13:00.200
in front of an audience.

13:00.200 --> 13:04.300
Some of these may or may not be actual friendships people are witnessing.

13:04.340 --> 13:07.620
What they do have the appearance, though, is of a friendly relationship between the

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620
people in question.

13:08.620 --> 13:12.220
To someone in the audience, they are watching a performance of friendship.

13:12.220 --> 13:16.020
When someone makes a decision to appear on another person's video or stream, or engages

13:16.020 --> 13:19.860
with them on social media or in the real world, it's with the awareness that people are paying

13:19.860 --> 13:21.540
attention to how they interact.

13:21.540 --> 13:25.300
Displays of kindness or hostility signal to the audience what sort of relationship these

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
people have.

13:26.300 --> 13:30.100
And to some degree, will inform that audience on how to engage with this other creator's

13:30.100 --> 13:31.100
content.

13:31.100 --> 13:35.420
If I ask someone to a guest voice on my channel, it signifies to my audience that this is another

13:35.420 --> 13:40.200
creator I approve of, and that perhaps they should give this person's content a chance.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.740
On the other hand, if I reply to a tweet telling someone that they're clueless and should

13:43.740 --> 13:47.660
try washing their disgusting beanie, it signals to my audience that this is a person you probably

13:47.660 --> 13:48.660
shouldn't listen to.

13:48.660 --> 13:53.020
A lot of this plays on the parasocial relationships that are formed by people watching online

13:53.020 --> 13:54.020
content.

13:54.020 --> 13:57.660
Just to quickly sum up, a parasocial relationship is a one-way relationship in which a viewer

13:57.660 --> 14:01.540
feels attached to a presenter who has no knowledge of the viewer's personal life.

14:01.540 --> 14:05.460
Even though it's only one-way to someone watching, it can feel like they have a virtual

14:05.460 --> 14:06.460
friend.

14:06.460 --> 14:10.180
When it comes to a viewer watching these performative friendships, it gets more complicated.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.040
It's like being in a parasocial relationship with multiple people.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.360
Or in other words, it's like being in a parasocial friend group.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.060
This is a pattern we've already seen on the right wing on YouTube.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.900
Rebecca Lewis's alternative influence paper demonstrated how different creators appearing

14:22.900 --> 14:25.560
on different platforms can create a shared audience.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.340
With the assistance of the U2 algorithm, the impact becomes even greater.

14:29.340 --> 14:33.820
As much as we might like to pretend we as content creators exist on our soul little

14:33.820 --> 14:38.540
islands not connected to anyone else, we all have audiences that overlap.

14:38.540 --> 14:42.960
And a paper like this is a reminder that we exist in community structures, and that there

14:42.960 --> 14:48.060
are very real risks of radicalization not just of our audiences, but of our own content.

14:48.060 --> 14:52.520
And who you choose to befriend on your channel pushes your audience, and sometimes your content,

14:52.520 --> 14:54.560
in certain political directions.

14:54.560 --> 14:59.440
While not all creators are necessarily conscious of this performance, although some certainly

14:59.440 --> 15:02.000
are, the results to the audience are the same.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.600
Positive interactions encourage an audience to be more positive to the person being interacted

15:05.600 --> 15:07.920
with, and negative ones do the opposite.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.040
When we step into the world of friendships across the political aisle, we can see how

15:11.040 --> 15:15.200
this becomes more complicated for anyone engaging in political commentary online.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.800
If someone is on the left, and supposedly championing left-wing ideas or policies, and

15:19.800 --> 15:24.200
then publicly engages in a friendly way with someone on the right, a performance of friendship,

15:24.200 --> 15:27.480
it's considerable to their audience that this person should be considered positively

15:27.480 --> 15:31.480
as well, and if this behavior becomes a pattern, it can be counterproductive to whatever left-wing

15:31.480 --> 15:33.520
goals the commentator has in mind.

15:33.520 --> 15:37.240
This isn't to say someone on the left should never be friendly with someone on the right,

15:37.240 --> 15:40.960
but it's important to consider the broadest social context of these interactions.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.520
If I were to appear on the channel of someone I disagree with, that could present a shift

15:44.520 --> 15:47.720
in the algorithm, one that's more powerful than the luck of one of my videos showing

15:47.720 --> 15:48.720
up as a recommendation.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.840
But as lovely as it may be for everyone to stop watching PragerU and instead one of my

15:52.840 --> 15:55.000
videos, it can backfire as well.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.120
Let's use a recent example.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.540
Figures supposedly on the left, such as Jimmy Dore and Glenn Greenwald, have regularly appeared

16:01.540 --> 16:05.760
on Tucker Carlson's program over the years having friendly, cordial interviews.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.440
This type of interaction is complicated as there is value in grabbing the attention of

16:09.440 --> 16:13.160
a right-wing audience and steering them towards your left-wing content, but when your supposed

16:13.160 --> 16:17.280
loving content largely consists of ignoring the right and attacking the party, that's

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
to the left of them.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.320
Perhaps, in an effort to satisfy this right-wing audience that has been introduced to you in

16:22.320 --> 16:26.920
a friendly manner, you have to ask the question what sort of project this is furthering.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.880
You can claim you're not trying to help the right, but this display of friendship

16:29.880 --> 16:33.360
and absence of right-wing critique ends up with clips like these.

16:33.360 --> 16:55.280
Well, I can't say I know the metrics of Jimmy Dore's channel.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.320
I'd wager he has a higher percentage of people who enjoy Tucker Carlson than mine, or most

16:59.320 --> 17:00.740
other left-wing channels.

17:00.740 --> 17:04.940
And I suspect they aren't going there to hear Jimmy Dore's left-wing ideals, but

17:04.940 --> 17:08.860
rather to see him beat up on their political rivals, the Democrats.

17:08.860 --> 17:12.460
Being friendly on someone else's platform, while still producing content that makes clear

17:12.460 --> 17:16.540
that someone is not a part of the right, would complicate someone's public profile.

17:16.540 --> 17:20.060
And I'm not going to pretend I understand the most effective way to thread that political

17:20.060 --> 17:21.060
needle.

17:21.060 --> 17:25.100
But in many cases, if someone is invited onto another platform, friendly conversation typically

17:25.100 --> 17:26.700
implies friendly content.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.620
Frequently, you might see a commentator lament that they are being critiqued for their

17:30.620 --> 17:34.860
associations and no one should ever be written off for one association or appearance or

17:34.860 --> 17:38.080
other incident without comparing it to their full body of work.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.700
But when it becomes a pattern and is reflected in their content, it brings into question

17:41.700 --> 17:45.340
how committed someone is to whatever political affiliation they claim to have.

17:45.340 --> 17:50.220
It also displays a stunning ignorance, as if this is just a question about private friendships.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.740
The details about cross-political friendships I outlined for private people is still true

17:53.740 --> 17:56.000
for anyone with a public profile.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.040
Just because someone has a YouTube channel doesn't give anyone the right to judge or

17:59.040 --> 18:00.380
police their private life.

18:00.380 --> 18:04.640
But when those relationships are with a content creator who has a public profile, they need

18:04.640 --> 18:09.220
to be aware that who they engage with on friendly terms sends a message to their audience, whether

18:09.220 --> 18:12.300
they want it to or not, and whether they think it should or not.

18:12.300 --> 18:17.060
If I started live-strafing with, for example, Alex Jones, and we were chummy and cordial,

18:17.060 --> 18:20.860
or if I had him read some quotations for one of my videos and never challenged him on his

18:20.860 --> 18:25.140
ridiculous conspiracy theories, it would, to varying degrees, signal to my audience

18:25.140 --> 18:28.900
that I think Alex Jones is someone who can be welcomed into public discourse, and that

18:28.900 --> 18:32.000
his ideas may not be as toxic to the public square as they are.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.820
And that would work directly against my own goals of pointing out how certain commentators

18:35.820 --> 18:37.380
should never be taken seriously.

18:37.380 --> 18:40.500
And in the case of Alex Jones, listening to him to learn about the world is a waste of

18:40.500 --> 18:42.100
time and brain cells.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.760
And I feel like I have to say this again, I'm not saying one should never be friendly

18:45.760 --> 18:47.860
with someone who disagrees with you politically.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.860
If there was a moderate conservative who disagreed with me on some issues, such as whether or

18:51.860 --> 18:55.260
not healthcare should cover dental, that's someone I wouldn't be too bothered being

18:55.260 --> 18:57.540
friendly with in public in a performative way.

18:57.540 --> 19:02.220
But by being friendly with someone who spreads racist pseudoscience or climate change denialism,

19:02.220 --> 19:05.860
or is just a complete asshole, I would be signaling to my audience that their presence

19:05.860 --> 19:10.380
in the political discourse, and by extension their extreme content, should be considered,

19:10.380 --> 19:12.420
to some degree, acceptable.

19:12.420 --> 19:15.780
And that's not something I'm going to do.
