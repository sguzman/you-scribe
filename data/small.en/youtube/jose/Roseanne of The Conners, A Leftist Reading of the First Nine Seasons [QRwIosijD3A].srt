1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
In March of 2018, the Roseanne TV series was revived for a tenth season,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
picking up the exploits of the Connor family 20 years after the series' original finale.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,840
We all know what happened a few months later. Roseanne made a racist tweet,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,480
the show was immediately cancelled, and we were dragged into a hail of anger and fury.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,960
What was lost in the noise, though, was the show itself, and for all the outreach over Roseanne

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,600
being fired, there wasn't much discussion about the tenth season of her show and what it was all

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,560
about, or what the preceding nine seasons were about for that matter. Roseanne was a free speech

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,280
martyr for the right, despite starring in a show that had much to say from the left.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,880
I think it's important to acknowledge that a TV show is a collaborative effort,

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,640
comprising the work of hundreds of people. While you can't discount the person who

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,360
is divorced behind it, you also can't treat the two as synonymous. That said,

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
I can't completely discount the words and actions of Roseanne Barr,

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
specifically when it comes to how she put her show together.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,080
So if you enjoy watching someone wrestle with whether or not art can be untangled from the

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,240
artist, you're going to have some fun in this video.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,080
This story starts back in the late 1980s. The Roseanne show started as the vague idea of a

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,440
series starring a working-class woman from producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Wartner. The

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,360
pair had recently helped create the Cosby Show for NBC. They planned on creating this

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,320
working-class series with a writer from the Cosby Show, Matt Williams, this time for rival network

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
ABC. At the same time, one of the hottest rising stars in the stand-up comedy world was a woman

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,600
named Roseanne Barr. Originally from Salt Lake City, she began a career performing stand-up across

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Colorado, drawing from her life as a wife and mother of three children. Often referring to

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,800
herself as a domestic goddess, Barr's work was charged with a fighting attitude that immediately

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,920
made her a star. A tape of her stand-up found its way into the hands of Mitzi Shore, owner of the

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,520
fabled Los Angeles Comedy Club, the Comedy Store. Roseanne Barr's appearance at the Comedy Store

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,120
led to an appearance on The Tonight Show, a national tour, and an HBO special. Barr was the

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,880
perfect fit for the new Carsey Wartner sitcom. This all happened in the space of about five years.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,800
And so the Roseanne show was born. Almost.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,320
One of the inescapable facts about talking about the Roseanne show is that you cannot escape

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,240
talking about the backstage drama, and it began even before the first episode aired. The first

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,240
major conflict was between Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams. Originally, the first draft

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,320
for the pilot episode was for a show titled Life and Stuff, which focused on the stories of three

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,160
women. A married woman with kids, a divorced woman with a kid, and a childless single woman,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,920
all working at a factory in Indiana, something taken from Williams's personal background.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
When Barr entered the project, she reshaped the series entirely, including changing the name of

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
the series to Roseanne, and having her character, the married woman with children, be the focal

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,200
point for the series. According to Barr, the reason Williams hadn't made her the star of the series was

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,160
because Williams had told her, I just don't think people would like you as the main character.

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaking to the LA Times in 1989, Williams gave full credit to Roseanne Barr for the character

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,160
Roseanne Connor, who she played on the show. He also credits her with bringing a feminist

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,960
perspective to the series, but the official credit for creating the show, as decided by

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,280
the Screenwriters Guild, would still go to Williams. This infuriated Barr. The pilot was

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,240
rewritten with the series now named Roseanne, and Life and Stuff was dropped to the episode

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,640
title, and Roseanne Connor would be the focus of the show now, with the other two women being

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,480
devoted to the supporting cast as her sister Jackie and friend Crystal. An unproven actress,

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
the producers chose to surround Roseanne Barr with experienced actors. Although Barr had originally

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,560
wanted her comedian friend Tom Arnold to play her husband on the show, the role was instead given

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
to John Goodman. The chemistry between Goodman and Barr was instantaneous, and he was chosen

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
to be Dan Connor within moments of his audition beginning. I pump those brakes to make sure they

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,720
grab. If they don't grab, I ruin the guy in front of me. I get a ticket. Our insurance premiums go

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,480
up. We go broke trying to pay them. Our children end up in a poor house. We starve. That's why I

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,000
pump the brakes. Okay, well, just tell me one thing. What? Why do you pump the brakes?

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
You know, Rosie.

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
The pair had instant chemistry, and the character of Dan Connor was born. Another major addition

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,120
to the cast was Laurie Metcalf, chosen for the role of Jackie Harris, Roseanne Connor's sister.

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,520
In a cast of talented actors, Metcalf was the only one to win multiple Emmys,

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,920
with three wins for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series from 1992 to 1994.

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,200
The Connor family was completed with Alicia Lacey Gorenson as eldest daughter Becky,

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Sarah Gilbert as middle child Darlene, and Michael Fishman as the youngest Connor kid,

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,840
David Jacob, or DJ. A few regulars would join the cast, such as Roseanne's friend Crystal,

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,600
played by Natalie West, and Roseanne's sometimes boss and Jackie's sometimes romantic interest,

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Booker Brooks, played by George Clooney. Yes, that George Clooney. At the center of this cast

63
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,480
was Roseanne Barr, playing Roseanne Connor, an abrasive working-class woman who held her family

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,680
together with love, humor, and grit. I'll do everything else like I always do. I'll have to

65
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
get off work an hour early, lose an hour's pay, totally rearrange my whole schedule,

66
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,480
but I don't mind. Unlike sitcoms of an earlier era, this wasn't a household run by a father who

67
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,040
knew best, but a mother who knew better, and the first episode set the stage for a series that

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,920
would bring an American audience new perspectives on the working class, feminism, and what it meant

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,840
to fight for everything you've got. A guy is a lump like this donut. Okay, so first you gotta

70
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:26,320
get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap

71
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,440
that they pick up from the beer commercial. And then there's my personal favorite, the male ego.

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:42,960
The first episode establishes our working-class family, and from the very beginning you can tell

73
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,040
this won't be like other shows. Roseanne isn't this sweet, put-together mother of other sitcoms.

74
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,440
She's loud, has a sharp tongue, and is rather heavy set. In other words, she's the exact sort

75
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,880
of person you wouldn't expect to see as the star of a primetime sitcom. Roseanne Connor works full

76
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,200
time in a plastics factory, but her second shift starts when she gets home, holding together her

77
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,480
household as a working mother. Her husband, Dan, doesn't do much to help out around the house when

78
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,600
he's off work from his struggling drywalling business. The kids are loud, bratty, and talk

79
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,480
back to their parents. In 2018, this isn't particularly groundbreaking stuff, but in 1988

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,000
this was far less common. Families were happy little units on TV, like you might see on shows

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,600
such as Full House or Growing Pains. On those shows, the teasing was gentler, and parents didn't

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,640
treat their kids like annoying brats. Perhaps most importantly, we were being invited to laugh

83
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,240
alongside the Conners, rather than at them, as an audience might do instead to other shows depicting

84
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,960
the working class, such as Married with Children. And look at the aesthetics of this show. The

85
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,840
Conners dress poorly, their food is shitty, and their furniture doesn't match. These aren't the

86
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,320
proper homes you might see on other shows depicting a happy middle class. These are firmly

87
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,200
working class people. In the first episode we get a sense of what money means to the Connor clan

88
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,400
when Darlene gets in trouble for barking in class. Your daughter barks. Our whole family barks!

89
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,040
Roseanne has to plead with Booker for some time off, and when she does loses part of her paycheck.

90
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,480
To the Conners, money is always a major concern. Not for luxuries or greed, but to pay for the

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,200
basics of what they need to survive. The struggle of holding the family together has real consequences

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,840
too, as Roseanne and Dan constantly argue from gentle teasing to full-on fights.

93
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:52,960
But the episode closes with Darlene getting hurt, and both parents springing to action to help her.

94
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,280
This encapsulates so much of what the show is about, a working class family being stretched

95
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,360
thin by economic demands, only held together by the love they have for one another.

96
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,760
The Conners have to hold on to each other to survive in a society where working class people,

97
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,840
and women in particular, are being worked to the bone. It's a damning critique of 1980s America,

98
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,080
and in 2018 it still holds some resonance. By the end of its first season, it would be the second

99
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,440
highest rated show on television, right behind the Cosby Show. The feminism of the first season is

100
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,400
also in sharp display, particularly the episode Nightmare on Oak Street, which featured what has

101
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,160
now become a sitcom cliché, Darlene getting her first period. An especially interesting choice,

102
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
considering Darlene was very much the tomboy of the family, and this step into womanhood created

103
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
a struggle with how she saw herself and how the world expected her to behave as a woman.

104
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:10,400
We even get some pushback against toxic masculinity in the episode

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Dan's Birthday Bash, where Roseanne demands Dan not get into a fight with some asshole at a bar

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:37,760
on his birthday. Roseanne and Dan end up having a frank conversation about getting older

107
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,640
and a vision of manhood that doesn't involve fighting people.

108
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:06,320
I really liked how in this episode, Roseanne's birthday gift to Dan is an anchor. The symbolism

109
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,880
would be damning if it weren't for the fact that the anchor is for Dan's pet project, building a

110
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,560
boat in their garage. A superficial reading here has the anchor tying Dan down and limiting his

111
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,760
freedom, but a deeper understanding shows you that this anchor is in some ways what Dan has always

112
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,280
wanted. A disappointing twist to this episode, and one of the first real signs that this show

113
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,640
is of its time, is that Dan ends up going back to the bar towards the end of the episode and

114
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,480
beating up the asshole anyway. His violence is a product of its time, and an example of how,

115
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
as progressive as Roseanne was, it's still a show from 30 years ago, and there are certain

116
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,440
artifacts that don't age well. Here's another example. In the episode Lovers Lane, Booker and

117
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,200
Jackie have a friendly bet. If I win, then you have to spend the night in my place. What if you win?

118
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,080
Then you spend the night in my place. Sounds good. Scrubbing my bathroom.

119
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:12,160
Alright, whatever gets you in the mood. Is that a bet? Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,800
I assume Booker means he wants to have sex with Jackie and not stay up reading the Bible together.

121
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
The episode makes it clear that they're both attracted to each other, but we still

122
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,800
get these vaguely, to be honest, rapey vibes. Would you really want me there against my will?

123
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:35,360
Absolutely. Booker does redeem himself. Not on a bet. Not tonight, and not on a bet.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,400
But it's still not the sort of thing I'd imagine many guys saying while flirting with someone.

125
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Not a guy who isn't a complete scumbag. As we'll see even more pointedly as we go through the

126
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,200
series, Roseanne is a show that does a lot of good things, but never completely escapes the

127
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,720
context of its time. And for a modern audience to appreciate it, or get anything out of it,

128
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,440
it's important to keep that in mind. While halfway through the first season,

129
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
the show seemed to be sailing along smoothly, behind the scenes things were starting to reach

130
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
a breaking point. While filming the fourth episode, Roseanne Barr was outraged that her

131
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,360
wardrobe requests were the only ones being ignored. According to Barr herself, she took a

132
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,000
pair of scissors, went to one of the producers responsible, and threatened her saying,

133
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,920
Bitch, do you want me to cut you? Barr also kept a prominently displayed list in her office that

134
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,120
had a title reading, These are the people who are going to be fired if they're not nice to me.

135
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,160
People who I am the boss of. Everybody. All producers, all writers, all subject to change.

136
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,480
She updated the list regularly. Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams continued to feud behind the

137
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,000
scenes, with Barr often refusing to read lines. Barr gave the executive producers an ultimatum.

138
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,640
It was her or Williams. One of them had to go. An agreement was reached with Williams,

139
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,600
and by episode 13, he left the show forever. One of the ideas credited to Williams was the setting

140
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,880
of a plastics factory, where Roseanne, Jackie, and Crystal worked. This artifact of his tenure

141
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
would only last until the end of the first season, but not before providing a great season finale.

142
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,120
In Let's Call It Quits, tensions at the workplace boil over when Booker is replaced by Keith Faber,

143
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,800
a hard-ass boss played by former diehard villain and Republican presidential nominee hopeful,

144
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,760
Fred Thompson. He not only applies harsh work quotas, he also picks on his employees.

145
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,680
Will you hold this for a minute? Honey, I'm not here to hold.

146
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm here to supervise. And in particular, he wants to break Roseanne Connor.

147
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,200
Now, my brother has this dairy farm. You know, some of those cows take the

148
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
milk and ride off. Some of them take a little longer.

149
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,080
Every once in a while, you run across a real stubborn. But you know what?

150
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,880
Sooner or later, they all give milk.

151
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,680
Eventually, Faber breaks Roseanne, getting her to agree to show him some respect

152
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
in exchange for lower work quotas.

153
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes. Yes, what?

154
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
Yes, we have a deal.

155
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,400
Sir.

156
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
But quotas still go back up.

157
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,920
So what are you raising our quotas to?

158
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
Nothing you girls can't handle. We're going to try 8,000 again.

159
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,320
And I have every confidence that you girls can cut the mustard.

160
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,920
And if you can't, then nice working with you.

161
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,240
In the final scene of the season, not counting a post-credits scene, Roseanne leads a walkout.

162
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
You okay, sis?

163
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,840
No, I'm not okay. I mean, I tried to be okay, but he doesn't want me to be okay.

164
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,200
He doesn't want any of us to be okay. You know why? Because he's not okay.

165
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
Roseanne, I told you not to walk away from me.

166
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm walking away from you, Faber, and I'm walking away from the stick of the factory.

167
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm walking away from this lousy job.

168
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,960
Well, that was a wonderful performance, Roseanne.

169
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,760
But if any of you are considering joining her, may I point out there are two doors to this room,

170
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,800
one that pays and one that doesn't.

171
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:53,840
I guess we're not going to make our quota today.

172
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,200
Honey Bunch.

173
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,280
Roseanne quitting, on her own, would have meant little, but a massive movement of workers

174
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:15,200
standing together in solidarity? That sounds like the beginning of a real political change.

175
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,920
In season two, Tom Arnold joined the show as a writer.

176
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,680
The controversial decision didn't sit well with the other writers,

177
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,000
who were told to teach him how to write a sitcom.

178
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Safford Vila, a writer for the show at the time, says,

179
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,680
We all thought he was 100% talent free.

180
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Arnold was Barr's man on the inside, as Barr didn't spend too much time in the writer's room,

181
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
and she was worried the writers would push her show in a direction she didn't like.

182
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,520
Barr would have a contentious relationship with her writing staff throughout the show's run.

183
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,680
In Vila's mind, it was really just fighting for power in the voice of the show.

184
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,400
This is also the season the show hit number one in the ratings.

185
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
After Roseanne Connor left her job at the Plastics Factory,

186
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,720
she took another selling magazine subscriptions over the phone.

187
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,200
She also briefly worked in a salon.

188
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,640
The salon job led Roseanne to confront her boss's boss from the first season, Mrs. Wellman,

189
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,000
the owner of the Plastics Factory Roseanne once worked at.

190
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
Mrs. Wellman can't even be bothered to remember Roseanne's name.

191
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,480
The two really collide, if you'll excuse the pun,

192
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,120
in an episode titled Fenderbender, where Mrs. Wellman hits Roseanne with her car.

193
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,880
The Connor family is quick to review their legal options,

194
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,240
but the only lawyer they can afford is apparently this hapless loser played by Stephen Root.

195
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,480
In response to a legal threat, Mrs. Wellman tries to buy her way out.

196
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Mrs. Wellman effectively avoids any threat from the law because she can afford a better attorney.

197
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
Once again, the working class are shown at a disadvantage in a system that supposedly

198
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,360
protects them. The two-tiered justice system is a difficult concept to unpack,

199
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,440
but in 20 minutes you can see this little TV episode explain it clearly.

200
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
I also want to highlight this little line.

201
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,880
Even though you no longer work for the company, we still think of you as part of the Wellman family.

202
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,920
I don't suppose my health insurance is still good.

203
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
Roseanne needs medical insurance.

204
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
The fact that someone hitting you with a car leaves you with a bill is cruel.

205
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:02,880
The symbolism of it being her former boss who treated her like garbage can't be understated.

206
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
Producer for the show Tom Warner arranged to have Roseanne Barr sing the national anthem

207
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:26,720
at a San Diego Padres game on July 25th, 1990. This is what it sounded like.

208
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:44,560
People were unimpressed. There was enough backlash to get Barr to stop touring,

209
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,480
and the president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, called it disgraceful. Although the

210
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
national anthem disaster would have slowed down other shows, that wasn't the case for season 3.

211
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,280
It premiered with strong ratings, continuing the trend of being viewed by over 20 million

212
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,560
Americans every week, and like a virgin, the topic of sexuality and birth control comes up.

213
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:34,320
It's a difficult subject to talk about, not just because it's centered on sex,

214
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,360
but because it's specifically about female sexuality.

215
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:17,360
Why do women feel the need to downplay their sexual history around men?

216
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,560
The opposite is rarely true. It speaks to the old-fashioned attitudes of Roseanne and Dan's

217
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,840
generation.

218
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:15,440
This is a nice demonstration of how social change isn't something that happens overnight,

219
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,520
but rather is a generational thing. On the theme of teenage sex, season 3 also sees the introduction

220
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:28,960
of Mark, played by Glenn Quinn in Becky, Beds, and Boys. This episode also establishes Roseanne's

221
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,640
new job, working as a waitress at a mall restaurant. Season 3 also introduced Leon,

222
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,840
Roseanne's boss at the restaurant played by Martin Mall, and the episode Dances with Darlene,

223
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
we find out something interesting about Leon.

224
00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Although he's certainly not the first gay character to appear on a sitcom,

225
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Leon is one of the few who wasn't a cheap stereotype. Back in season 2, the episode

226
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,960
Born to Be Wild introduced an old friend of Dan and Roseanne, Ziggy, played by J.O. Sanders.

227
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,040
It was a good episode where Dan and Roseanne confront the rebellious past and see how they've

228
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,160
been fit into their less-dramatic present. It ends with Ziggy helping Dan restore his old bike.

229
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,280
Roseanne and Dan holding onto their past in some ways explains what informs this show,

230
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,000
the rebellion of the 60s, and activism that, at the time of the show's airing,

231
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,280
is already 20 years behind the times. This isn't to say something still can't be learned,

232
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,880
but the romance of the past can create blind spots for the present. Ziggy embodies a romanticized

233
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,520
version of their past. In season 3, Ziggy makes a return with an opportunity for the present.

234
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:21,360
With some of Ziggy's backing and a second mortgage on the house,

235
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,160
it looks like it's going to happen, but Ziggy gets cold feet.

236
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:54,240
Ziggy, in this episode, is a counterpoint to what I said earlier about romanticizing the past.

237
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
He's shown to be a coward. He lacks the maturity that can make a dream attainable,

238
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,400
even if he does stumble into the means. The friendship ends poorly.

239
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:24,880
And while Dan doesn't want to give up on his dream, even if he has to do it solo,

240
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,240
the economic reality of his situation is that even risking everything isn't risking enough.

241
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,040
This isn't the only time we've seen the Conners want to roll the dice for a better future,

242
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,280
but a running theme of this series is that working class people can be screwed over by

243
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,240
the many sad facts of their realities, many of them not of their own making. But maybe not this

244
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
time. During the credits Darlene finds an envelope on the fridge, Ziggy's share of the investment

245
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,400
money gifted to his former friend. It's a sweet gesture, and one that gives Dan the chance to

246
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,840
chase his dream in the next season. How exactly do other working class people get an angel investor

247
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,720
like this? Although that's kind of a useless question because this blessing will just give

248
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,640
us further lessons on why it sucks to be working class in America.

249
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,080
One of the major threads through season four is Darlene's battle with depression.

250
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,000
In the season's fourth episode, Darlene fades to black, we're greeted with a despondent Darlene,

251
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,160
shed of her tomboyish persona, and instead now a couch-dwelling misanthrope. What's telling about

252
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,320
this is that there's no trauma, no sudden major life event, no crippling moment of realization.

253
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,760
We just see Darlene, and she's depressed.

254
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,240
Rosanne and Dan are at a loss on how to cope with her daughter's new depression.

255
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:12,400
The episode ends without any touching family moment or chance for Darlene to recover.

256
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,680
Depression isn't solved so easily. This is yet another way the Rosanne show departed from other

257
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,120
sitcoms. Problems weren't solved at the end of every episode. Things didn't always magically

258
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,200
get better with a heart-to-heart conversation with a loving parent. In this episode, mental

259
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,800
illness and invisible invader shows up in their lives, and they're completely incapable of handling

260
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:50,160
it. By the next episode, Darlene seems to be somewhat back to normal.

261
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:57,440
But the black clothes she started wearing remain.

262
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,720
Much like the way depression works in real life, there are good days and there are bad ones.

263
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,600
A few episodes later, Thanksgiving 91, Darlene has a bad day. We get a few touching scenes that

264
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,920
show how Darlene's parents are still reaching out to her. They won't give up on their daughter.

265
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:49,360
Confronted with Darlene's pain, we see what any

266
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,480
parents would do. They try to comfort her in any way they can, but perhaps more telling is how

267
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,320
ill-equipped they are to do it. The word depression is rarely used in these episodes, as if the

268
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,160
vocabulary of mental illness is out of their reach. In later episodes, this period in Darlene's life

269
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:17,520
would be referred to as her mood. For a working class family like the Connors, they literally

270
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,280
don't have the language to explain Darlene's problem. It may be generational, a class issue,

271
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,400
or just an overall social ignorance about depression in 1991, but it's another sign

272
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,160
of how the Connors are out of touch with what their kids need in a modern world.

273
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,920
But it isn't for a lack of caring, but rather a painful reality of the limitations of what it

274
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,800
means to be a parent and how being working class makes parenting that much harder. They can't

275
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,320
afford to send Darlene to a therapist or fall back on some sort of post-secondary education

276
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,200
to inform them of what's happening. They have to make do with what they've got, and what they've

277
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,840
got, sadly, isn't quite enough. Although he was called Kevin in his first appearance, the episode

278
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,520
The Bowling Show brought Johnny Galecki into the cast as Mark's younger brother, eventually named

279
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,240
David. He would go on to be a major player, not just in Darlene's life as a love interest,

280
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,440
but in the Connor household in general. Season four ends with the episode Aliens,

281
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,880
which brings with it a reckoning on the challenges of being a working class parent in the early 90s.

282
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,040
More so than the struggles with their daughters' sex lives and mental health, the Connors have

283
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,760
always struggled with providing for their family. While the Connor kids can expect the basics of

284
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,520
food, clothing, and shelter, what about the opportunity to have a better life than their

285
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,280
parents? The two main threads of this episode are DJ competing in, and eventually winning,

286
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,360
a spelling bee. And the other, more important one is Dan's bike shop, funded at the end of season

287
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,280
three, is now shutting down. Dan just couldn't get it to work out, and Becky is learning the ugly

288
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:59,200
truth. Please tell me there's a college fund. Well, there was, but... So even if I get into

289
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:08,640
these schools, I can't afford to go? Becky, it has been a really bad year. I can't believe this.

290
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,840
I mean, we may not have exactly been able to spoil her, but she still had it pretty good.

291
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,600
As good as we wanted her to. The episode tries to wrap things up in a happy ending of sorts,

292
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,120
but season five won't be leaving this thread alone. And perhaps the one true victory of this

293
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,640
episode, the credits scene features the character Arnie being abducted by aliens, forever ensuring

294
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,600
that Tom Arnold will not appear on the show. I've spared you clips of this guy as much as I could

295
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,400
throughout this video, but this marks a good fucking riddance to the worst part of the Rose

296
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,040
Dan show. The man was a comedy black hole, sucking in any and all humor that surrounded him into an

297
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:59,520
endless, unfunny void of misery. Season five opens up with terms of estrangement, a two-parter that's

298
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,880
one of my favorites. Dan is forced to close down his bike shop, proving that dream of pulling

299
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,680
yourself up by your own bootstraps is an illusion. Your mother and I have decided to close the bike

300
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:16,480
shop. We're going on a business sale and locking the doors on Friday. And I don't have a job,

301
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760
so that means no income. When Dan has to fire Becky's boyfriend, Mark, who had been helping

302
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,800
at the shop, Mark quickly lands on his feet and is offered a new job. Only it's in another state,

303
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,600
which means he would have to leave Becky. This leads to a scene where Becky tears Dan to fucking

304
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
pieces.

305
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:26,720
The episode ends with Becky and Mark running off to Minnesota to elope.

306
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,080
The next episode picks up with Becky returning home to pick up her belongings. Since leaving

307
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,720
home, Dan has been unable to speak to his daughter.

308
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:25,840
But it isn't that Dan is mad at Becky so much as that he's upset with himself.

309
00:36:32,080 --> 00:37:01,680
The episode ends with Becky departing, but instead of that last minute tearful goodbye,

310
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,840
Dan can't bear to face his daughter. Once again we don't get an easy resolution,

311
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,160
and there is a heavy emphasis on parents failing their children. In this case,

312
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,320
it's Dan being unable to provide for his daughter because he took a gamble and tried to start a

313
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,240
business. While a crueler interpretation would say Dan is a bad businessman and deserves failure,

314
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,280
the real question is, does Becky deserve to be punished because of that? Does a thoughtful,

315
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
academically successful young woman not deserve the chance to better her life with a higher

316
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,160
education because her father made a bad business decision? Rich people make bad business decisions

317
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,680
every day, sometimes losing more money in a day than Dan Connor lost in the year he ran his bike

318
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,520
shop. They can afford to screw up. Dan Connor can't. This illustrates the bind of the working

319
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,840
class that even when you have the chance to make something of your life, if you make a mistake,

320
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,520
you don't just let yourself down, you could potentially let your whole family down.

321
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,000
Dan and Becky patching things up was inevitable. They had a good relationship,

322
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,840
not so easily discarded over a failure. But will Becky's life ever recover? Will she be able to

323
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,160
go back to school and make something of the future she dreamed of herself? We won't be finding out

324
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,760
for a while because in season 5, Alicia Gorinson, the actress who played Becky, left the show.

325
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,280
The reason for Gorinson's departure was not, as you might have guessed,

326
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
fleeing in terror from Roseanne. She went to pursue an education at Vassar College,

327
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,640
although the Becky Connor character wouldn't exactly leave the show with Gorinson's departure,

328
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,920
but more on that in season 6. Season 5 brought with it one last major employment change for

329
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,280
Roseanne Connor. In looking for loans in all the wrong places, Roseanne, Jackie, and their friend

330
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,800
Nancy, played by Sandra Bernhardt, open a diner serving loose meat sandwiches. While that might

331
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,680
seem outrageous, coming off the heels of Dan having to sell his bike shop, the money for starting

332
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,880
the business mostly comes from Roseanne and Jackie's mother, Bev, played by Estelle Parsons.

333
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,280
It's a small crime, I haven't mentioned her until now. She had been playing Beverly Harris

334
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,680
in special guest spots since season 1. She never quite becomes a regular member of the cast,

335
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,840
but she's a constant figure, appearing in several episodes throughout each season.

336
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Through a combination of a gift and a loan, Roseanne is able to start a business of her own.

337
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,720
This is yet another chance afforded the Conners to make more of their situation. I don't want to

338
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,040
dive too much into this episode, but it's telling that the opportunities the Conners get to reshape

339
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,080
their lives often come from external help, almost as if the show is saying that the only way working

340
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,120
class people can get out of their situation is with some help from the outside, rather than the

341
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,120
whole fabled bootstrap method that has already been thoroughly undermined in earlier episodes.

342
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,280
A major plotline in season 5 is the introduction of Fisher. The name even gives me chills now.

343
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,360
Played by Matt Roth, the eventual real-life husband of Laurie Metcalf,

344
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,160
Fisher was introduced as Jackie's love interest in the episode titled Mommy Nearest.

345
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:24,640
All we really know about Fisher at first is that he's young.

346
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,560
The truth about Fisher comes out halfway through the season in Crime and Punishment, and as a

347
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,240
content warning, these next few scenes include some very wrenching depictions of an abuse victim,

348
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,440
so fair warning that you might want to skip ahead to the time written below.

349
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,920
One afternoon, when Jackie arrives at Roseanne's house to go out for dinner,

350
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,640
after Roseanne urges Jackie to change her shirt, her bruises are discovered by Darlene.

351
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
And the truth comes out.

352
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
You don't understand.

353
00:41:41,920 --> 00:42:07,360
When Dan learns the truth, he takes action and faces the consequences.

354
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:22,320
It's interesting to contrast the reactions of Dan and Roseanne.

355
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
Roseanne's impulse is to care for her sister and get her to a hospital.

356
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,320
Dan's impulse is to beat the shit out of Fisher.

357
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,840
The following episode, War and Peace,

358
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,680
sees Dan getting out of jail where he's confronted by a confused Jackie.

359
00:42:41,920 --> 00:43:01,760
This moment displays the struggle within Jackie, desperate for support, but not the kind Dan offers

360
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,280
her. She feels shame, confusion, and sadness in a way that makes the situation so hard for her to

361
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,640
process. She later considers going back to Fisher.

362
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:38,480
Jackie and Fisher eventually meet,

363
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
when another awful truth comes out.

364
00:43:41,360 --> 00:44:09,280
And in what is the most important part of the episode, Jackie is faced with a decision.

365
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:29,200
These episodes speak so clearly on their own,

366
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,040
but I want to highlight the difference between the various reactions to helping Jackie.

367
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,560
Roseanne and Dan do what they can, as best they can in their own ways, but ultimately,

368
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,360
it's a story about how Jackie finds the real power to solve her problems. It speaks to how often

369
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,120
the best way to help someone out of an abusive relationship isn't to fight their battles for

370
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,560
them, but to support and empower them so they can make the right choices. Done poorly, this episode

371
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,120
could have just been Jackie having to pull herself up by her bootstraps and stand up to an abusive

372
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,040
asshole, but instead we get a story of a victim who needs some port from those around her so she

373
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,440
can make a positive change in her life. It's precisely why instead of blaming victims for

374
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,640
getting into their situations or not being able to fix them, it's more productive to empower them

375
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,840
so they can actually make a change in their life for the better. In the middle of season 5, feeding

376
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,880
the monster, A Week in the Life of Roseanne aired on the BBC in the UK. It was a behind-the-scenes

377
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,320
look at the production of The Roseanne Show. If we had any doubt on whether or not this is a

378
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,720
left-wing show, here's a telling clip.

379
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,080
Left also. That's true. That's very true. And there they were left out. Yeah, left and left out.

380
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,920
All unemployed guys. We also get a sense of what Roseanne thinks of her own show. And it's not

381
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,840
only anti-television, it's totally anti-media and then they don't get that neither because that's

382
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,960
who they are until finally I'm talking about television itself which I did last in last week's

383
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,360
episode that aired, which I thought was great. I was actually talking about the horrible things

384
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,880
television has taught my generation and I'm doing it on television. I just think that's great.

385
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,680
And perhaps more importantly, there's this revealing clip with one of the show's writers.

386
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,560
And whenever I think of what Roseanne might think of this video I'm making right now,

387
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:51,520
I think of this moment. As season five closes, there is another exit on the show

388
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,480
in Daughters and Other Strangers. In contrast to Becky settling down with a new husband

389
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,080
and giving up on her dreams of college, Darlene is going to Chicago to attempt

390
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,520
to make something more of her life, something Roseanne can't refuse her.

391
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:37,120
This is the infamous season where writers had to start wearing shirts with numbers printed on them.

392
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,240
Instead of referring to them by their name, Roseanne Barr would call out their numbers instead.

393
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,720
None of the writers who worked on the show spoke fondly of this new management strategy.

394
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,040
This season also saw Sarah Gilbert going to Yale. Although unlike Gorinson, she remained a part of

395
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,520
the show. Apparently Barr thought she was so essential that a special set was made near Yale

396
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,080
so Gilbert could film her scenes speaking to various characters over the phone. She would

397
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,960
appear with the rest of the cast in a handful of episodes and as a result never officially

398
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,960
left the cast. This season brought with it two very controversial episodes with scenes that were

399
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,440
at the time completely shocking. There's no need for a content warning though,

400
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,160
unless your mind is easily blown by how conservative television was in the 1990s.

401
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,040
The first, a stash from the past, is about, as you might have guessed, marijuana. Roseanne finds

402
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,200
what she thinks is David's stash, only to later be reminded by Dan that it's actually hers.

403
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,120
Roseanne, Dan and Jackie then proceed to smoke up.

404
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:59,840
The most wonderful, beautiful, sexy, you know, thing.

405
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:09,840
Somehow, this ranked as number 21 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of Television in 1997.

406
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,280
It's a great example of time capsule activism where a truly groundbreaking act is rather

407
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,880
mundane by today's standards. But really, I only bring up this episode in the context of the next

408
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,200
one, which had a controversial moment that was a lot more than some middle-aged people getting

409
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,640
high. In Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Roseanne is directly confronted on her supposedly pro-gay

410
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,520
stance when it gets right up in her face. Literally, when a friend of Nancy's kisses her...

411
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,000
Although the kiss grabbed all the headlines, this episode was about more than that.

412
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,400
Roseanne has to confront the anxiety she now has when being gay is something she has to wonder

413
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,000
about herself. It leads to an important realization at the end.

414
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And you're afraid that just one little tiny percent of you might have been turned on by a woman.

415
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,960
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I am not afraid of any small percentage of

416
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,640
my gay-ness inside, you know what I mean? I am totally okay about whether I'm like

417
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:22,480
three percent or four percent or lower. While an unexpected kiss can be considered sexual assault,

418
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,120
this episode sidesteps the issue by making it non-threatening and uses it as a metaphor,

419
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,360
forcing Roseanne to really test how accepting she is of being gay.

420
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,720
I am not gay!

421
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:44,560
I didn't mean for that to sound like it was bad or anything, you know, because if I was gay,

422
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,440
that'd be just fine, but I'm not gay. So I just don't like people calling me things that I'm not,

423
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,800
like a hypocrite. I'm not gonna admit I was wrong or anything,

424
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,880
but I just don't want to fight with you anymore, so I was wrong. Thank you.

425
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,720
She realizes she's still uncomfortable with it deep down somewhere,

426
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,960
revealing a degree of homophobia she has towards the idea of being gay herself.

427
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,560
This is an especially powerful episode because it takes a woman who is the hero of the show and a

428
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,200
champion for the downtrodden and revealing that she too has some bigotry in her. Though those

429
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,480
feelings of awkwardness may not be out of hatred or malice, the phobia is very real. It's the fear

430
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,680
of being ostracized by the community and how much easier it is to be an ally than someone with skin

431
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,160
in the game. Because of the lesbian kiss, ABC fought to keep the show from airing.

432
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,000
Arnold and Barr threatened to take the whole series to another network if they didn't air

433
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,360
the episode, and ABC eventually caved, although the episode still ran with a parental warning.

434
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,480
Later on, ABC would say that of the 100 calls they got, 75 were positive.

435
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,200
Another major event of this season is the return of Becky, not Alicia Gorenson. Sarah Chalk,

436
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,040
maybe best known for her work on Scrubs, was cast as The New Becky. Although Gorenson would return

437
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,440
to the role in the later season, the two would still swap depending on how the role could be

438
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,000
scheduled. Another note about season 6, it was during the airing of this season that Roseanne

439
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,560
Barr and Tom Arnold divorced. Their volatile relationship wasn't a secret in the press,

440
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:20,960
and it was turned into a TV movie by NBC. According to a writer for the series at the time,

441
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,200
Amy Sherman Paladino, this is when things start getting erratic. Season 7 is also the one where

442
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,280
the show finally dropped out of the top 10 most viewed shows in the United States.

443
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,000
It's here where the show drifts heavily into the interpersonal drama. Although it's not as if the

444
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,800
show hasn't always had that be a part of it, but the working class struggles of the Connor family

445
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,000
are starting to feel more distant here. Dan has a steady job with the city, and Roseanne is the part

446
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,160
owner of a restaurant. They aren't on the edge they had walked on before. Part of the show's premise

447
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,080
receded, and it had to rely on the strength of its cast of characters, which can still lead to

448
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:12,240
fantastic television. In White Men Can't Kiss, we get what might very well be my favorite episode

449
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,680
of the series. The main plotline of the episode kicks off when we find out DJ refuses to take part

450
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,840
in a play where he would have to kiss a girl. Roseanne, sticking up for her son, confronts his

451
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,440
teacher, and then learns that there's more to this story than a bashful boy.

452
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,160
I'm not going to change the entire play because of certain people's values.

453
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,480
Wow, um, I guess if he's forced to kiss somebody, then I don't want him to be in the stupid play.

454
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,160
Where should I put my costume as a sin? Why don't you just put it on the table, Gina?

455
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:07,440
Uh, that wouldn't be the Gina, would it? Well, you can't tell them apart.

456
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,120
Oh, you thought that that's why DJ didn't want it, and then you thought I knew and that I supported

457
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,600
that. I see a lot of this around here. It always starts with the parents.

458
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,440
This leads to a confrontation at home where Roseanne insists DJ do the play.

459
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,720
What seems to be the truth about the origins of DJ's racism come out.

460
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,920
I think you're being a little too hard on the kid. He grew up in Lanford, it's only 5% black,

461
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,000
and kissing's a new thing for DJ. It's only natural he's not as comfortable kissing a black girl as

462
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:51,040
one of his own. I did not say that. This leads to an emergency game of poker where Dan invites his

463
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:59,120
one black friend, Chuck, played by James Pickens Jr., for some guidance. It doesn't go the way you

464
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,400
might expect. I mean, you know, we don't know, he's prejudiced. I mean, the kid is young,

465
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,960
he hasn't had much exposure to other cultures. Other cultures?

466
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,760
Why? Is a black girl from China?

467
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,440
You're saying that it's okay that DJ doesn't want to kiss this girl because she's black? No,

468
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm not saying that, but that's what you want me to say. No! Unless you really feel it.

469
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Man, why do you care how I feel so much more than everyone else?

470
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,200
Because I'm black?

471
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:45,440
Well, yeah. So if I feel okay, all black people feel okay, because we all the same.

472
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,960
I would never say that.

473
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,880
Of course not. Some of your best friends are black.

474
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,600
Yes, you're one of my best friends. That's why you're here.

475
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,760
Okay, then why is Bob here? DJ's got to kiss a dumb girl too? No offense, Bob.

476
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:05,120
This scene reveals some important information. Most strikingly, that Chuck has been living a

477
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:11,040
life that the others had no clue about, and Dan's sudden interest in the black experience as a way

478
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,960
of assaging his own anxiety come off as insulting. What makes this such a great scene is Chuck's

479
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,880
refusal to be Dan's guiding star on this. Being his black friend doesn't, and shouldn't, mean

480
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,160
that he has to give Dan permission to be a bigot, or be his guiding light on all things race.

481
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,960
The shame Chuck, as a character, doesn't get more screen time. I am very curious to hear

482
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,000
more of his experiences and what it's like to be one of the only black people in Lanford.

483
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,520
This scene is followed by Dan admitting to his faults and telling DJ he'll have to kiss that girl.

484
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,840
I can't let you get out of this, because that would be wrong.

485
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,840
But I'm afraid of what the other kids will say.

486
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,760
Oh, the other kids? Well, they're going to be extremely jealous, because you're Connor.

487
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,800
And Connor men are known as some of the world's best kissers.

488
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,800
You're okay, I'll do it.

489
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,320
You know, DJ, you're going to kiss a lot of girls in your life, and they're all going to be different.

490
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,520
Well, do you think I should even kiss Lila Matthews?

491
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,600
What's different about her? Well, Ralph says she uses her tongue.

492
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,280
I'd go for it.

493
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,080
And lest you think the show is over, we get another fantastic scene that builds on the idea

494
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,120
that it isn't just Dan's latent racism that's the problem. It's a longer scene,

495
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,840
but it's important to see a large portion of it.

496
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,480
Hello. Hi.

497
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,280
Hi, would you let me in, please?

498
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,320
Uh, uh, we're closed.

499
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Yeah, well, it says here you're open till 10.

500
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,360
Yeah, but see, we had a really busy day and we ran out of food.

501
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,800
You're scary.

502
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,680
Sounded like it.

503
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,920
I did the right thing, didn't I?

504
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,960
You said it was scary.

505
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah.

506
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,320
Hey, I think I should tell you something. I'm Mr. Williams, Gina's father.

507
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,400
Oh, well, come on in.

508
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,680
Roseanne Connor, why didn't you just say that you were Gina's father?

509
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,640
You need to know all your customers' names before they come into your restaurant?

510
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,240
Hey, Mr. Williams, uh, you think that you know what happened, but that wasn't what happened.

511
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,760
No, she didn't do that because you are African American. She did that because you're a man.

512
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,400
Yeah, and I'm prejudiced against all men equally.

513
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,080
That's real funny.

514
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,400
Hey, we're women, you know, and it's night. This is like a matter of safety.

515
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,600
And in situations like that, I just got to go with my gut instinct.

516
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,080
Well, I guess your kid inherited your instincts.

517
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,480
What? There's no way that that is anything like this.

518
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,440
Fine.

519
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,280
Mr. Williams, come on. I'm sure you didn't come here to fight.

520
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,040
Well, just forget about it anyway.

521
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,240
There's probably just no way you're ever going to see where I'm coming from.

522
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,000
You know, that's funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.

523
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,840
Well, I think you're right.

524
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,440
Well, I think he blew that out of proportion.

525
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,400
I mean, you invited him in. You tried to make it up to him.

526
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,440
You know, if he was a white guy with the exact same build in those exact same clothes,

527
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,800
you would have done the exact same thing.

528
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,560
Yeah, well, I'm glad one of us is sure.

529
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,320
Well, now don't beat yourself up over it, Roseanne.

530
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,280
You know, anybody else would have done just what you did.

531
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,320
Well, isn't that great?

532
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,520
The subtle things here are what capture my attention.

533
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,560
The way Jackie hides the register or how Roseanne flips the sign when she sees Mr. Williams.

534
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,880
Things you can imagine any scared person doing at night while closing their shop.

535
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,600
But why were they afraid?

536
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,760
The lines exchanged by Roseanne and Mr. Williams are the most telling.

537
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,640
They can never understand each other's experiences.

538
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,560
As the audience, we can understand Roseanne's experience.

539
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,080
We've had six and a half seasons of that, but Mr. Williams?

540
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,720
He's a cipher we can never really break.

541
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,200
Unless you're black, of course, then you probably get it pretty quickly.

542
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,720
Mr. Williams is the black experience in America coming right up to the face of white America

543
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,400
and saying that they don't see the racism he experiences.

544
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,320
And the realization of Roseanne at the end is that he may be right.

545
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,640
And that Roseanne, with those reflexive assumptions, is part of the problem.

546
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,360
This episode perfectly encapsulates what Roseanne is missing as a series when it comes to portraying

547
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,720
the working class.

548
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,400
Of course, it doesn't just miss race.

549
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,080
There are a lot of other factors as well.

550
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:22,800
But considering when this series was made, it's hard to really excuse not having it.

551
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,680
And it certainly points to more we could learn about in the future.

552
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,240
If Roseanne is to be some sort of guiding light on understanding the working class,

553
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,800
we have to understand areas that fall into the shadows.

554
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,200
To me, this is the last truly great episode of Roseanne.

555
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,400
It's something that could air today and still carry the same weight.

556
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,480
I know I basically spoiled the whole thing, but I highly recommend seeking it out and

557
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,000
watching it in its entirety.

558
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,800
And as a slight spoiler for season 10, Gina, that little girl DJ doesn't want to kiss,

559
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,600
they end up getting married and having a cute daughter named Mary.

560
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,880
One of the signs of the show starting to drift off the rails is how aware it becomes about its

561
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,000
success and eventual place in TV history.

562
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,120
The show toyed with fanciful episodes on rare occasions such as the Dream episode from season

563
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,400
2, but it's here where things start to kick it up a few years.

564
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,280
In All About Rosie, we get one of those old sitcom staples, the clip show.

565
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,040
These have thankfully died away, but in the past they were used to squeeze out an extra

566
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,200
episode of a show while keeping the budget down by having the characters sit around and

567
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,240
share memories.

568
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,320
What makes this one hour, yes, one hour, special different is the second half features Roseanne

569
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,760
Connor meeting famed TV moms Barbara Billingsley, June Lockhart, Isabel Sanford, Allie Mills,

570
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,360
and Patricia Crowley.

571
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,280
Whereas these mothers are initially judgmental of her brash persona,

572
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,200
she slowly convinces them that she's part of a new way mothers can be viewed on TV.

573
01:02:51,040 --> 01:03:06,400
Season 7's finale, Sherwood Schwartz, a loving tribute, continues with the retro TV

574
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,840
love as the topic of Dan's boat comes up, which leads to a lengthy Gilligan's Island parody where

575
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,560
the actors from Roseanne take up the roles of various castaways from the classic sitcom.

576
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,680
You can see a similar episode in the next season.

577
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:34,480
These episodes are… not great.

578
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,360
There's a subtext here that underscores the larger point of revering the past.

579
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,440
When these shows are parodied, it's taking time to discuss the inherent silliness and

580
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,440
negative stereotypes they hold.

581
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,040
They're being deconstructed in a way to show you the limits of TV sitcoms,

582
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,960
and that while they may be entertaining and even have something to say,

583
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,640
they are also products of their time, and it's only natural the same thing what happens to the

584
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,600
Roseanne show.

585
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,240
Except Roseanne was already a show that was changing the way sitcoms could be viewed,

586
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,960
and it was doing it in a way that was much more interesting and clever than simply parodying

587
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,400
older sitcoms.

588
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,640
Instead of being subtextual, these parodies make the commentary overt.

589
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,760
Instead of trying to say something new, the show is instead saying the same thing as it always had

590
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,960
just a bit louder.

591
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,080
And things are going to get louder still.

592
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,840
This season marks the return of Lacey Goren's into the role of Becky.

593
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,240
She would swap paces with Sarah Chalk throughout the season, and then Chalk would once again take

594
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,080
over the role completely in season 9.

595
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah, it gets confusing.

596
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,160
Another sign of the declining quality of the show is when we get the episode where the Connors are

597
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,840
totally woke.

598
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,800
In The Last Thursday in November, DJ School Play gets some negative reviews when it dares

599
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,960
to mention that the Pilgrims and Native Americans weren't the best of buddies.

600
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,320
God, Roseanne, could you believe how horrible that play was?

601
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,640
Well, I'm just sorry I let my son be in it.

602
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,640
It was nothing but violent propaganda.

603
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,000
And this debate drifts into another cheesy production where the cast pretends to be Pilgrims.

604
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,840
So what's wrong with this episode?

605
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,160
In the context of the series, where we had earlier episodes such as White Men Can't Kiss

606
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,480
and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, where the Connors learn about their own faults and blind spots,

607
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,680
they're just kind of woke for this episode.

608
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,760
The heat comes from the nameless parents at the school play who are passing morons and

609
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,280
capable of speaking in anything other than shitty right-wing talking points.

610
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,320
There's no real nuance or discussion.

611
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,480
This episode more than most others embodies all the things that are wrong with the Roseanne

612
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,600
show in later seasons.

613
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,040
Even though its message is ultimately a good one,

614
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,640
of respecting the people's displaced and massacred by colonialism,

615
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,640
but Season 8 had some bright spots that I would be remiss to point out.

616
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,960
The white sheep of the family includes a much-needed return of working-class dynamics when

617
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,720
it's revealed that Darlene has offered a relatively high-paying copywriting job

618
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,240
that she turned down so she could finish school and find something better.

619
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,720
The job was not for $200, okay?

620
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,400
It was as an advertising copywriter and it started at $500 a week.

621
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,080
The Conners are suddenly confronted with someone not being in the same working-class boots

622
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,520
and it creates tension at home.

623
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:49,840
The pain and pride of seeing Darlene succeed becomes clear.

624
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:14,800
This episode introduces something new.

625
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,680
The idea of one of the Conners making it.

626
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,720
The thing the Conners have supposedly been working so hard for.

627
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,680
The success of their children is finally happening.

628
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,280
This might be one of the last episodes of the series to deal with being working-class

629
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,840
and in a way that doesn't sugarcoat the Conners as unflinchingly supportive.

630
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,080
It portrays the fear of losing a child to a world that they could never be a part of,

631
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,960
knowing that it's in Darlene's best interests,

632
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,280
but with the fear that she may become one of the people they've always resented.

633
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,560
This all unravels in later episodes and we learn Darlene is pregnant in another mouth to shut up

634
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,320
and she and David get engaged.

635
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:18,480
The season putters along with Darlene getting married and Dan having a heart attack.

636
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,440
While these are major moments for the Conners,

637
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,080
I'm going to skip right ahead to the final episode of the season.

638
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,080
Fights and stuff.

639
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,840
When Dan won't stick to a diet regime that will help him with his heart condition,

640
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,320
he and Roseanne end up having a huge fight.

641
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,640
It starts with a cute callback to the first season.

642
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,360
I'll fix dinner.

643
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,200
I'm fixing dinner.

644
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,120
Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner 11 years ago.

645
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,600
You want me to fix dinner?

646
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,280
I'll fix dinner.

647
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,320
I'm fixing dinner.

648
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,800
Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago.

649
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,040
Then it gets nasty.

650
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,680
There are failures, Roseanne, and the only reason you won't admit it

651
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,920
is because you'll have to admit you failed as a mother.

652
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,040
The only way I failed as a mother is to let Becky and Darlene get married

653
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,880
so young that they threw their whole life away on a man, just like I did.

654
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,360
All the insecurities of being a parent boil over as the things that kept the family together,

655
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,400
the children, may not be enough when their goal of giving them a better life seems out of reach.

656
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,120
The real pain and discord here isn't from Roseanne and Dan not being able to get along,

657
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,080
but the fear of not being able to give their kids a better life,

658
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,400
the fear of remaining working class.

659
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,280
It's an anxiety that many can relate to and one that contradicts the myth of the American dream,

660
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,880
that anyone can be successful as long as they're willing to work hard enough.

661
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,640
Conners are hardworking.

662
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,040
The system just wasn't built for them.

663
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,920
The explosive finale of the last season may have just been an excuse to let John Goodman

664
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,680
spend some time away from the show.

665
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,480
Frustrations backstage and a burgeoning movie career are all cited as reasons for his departure,

666
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,280
though he would still show up for several episodes this season.

667
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,920
With Dan Connor gone though, and many of the cast regulars appearing only sporadically,

668
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,680
season 9 focused on Roseanne in some bizarre situations.

669
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,560
Janet Leahy, a writer for the series, credits Roseanne's executive control for some of the

670
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,880
more ludicrous stories that appear this season.

671
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,920
She says,

672
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,640
It is one thing to have editorial power and another to have creative power.

673
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,800
And I think that crossed over in the end, and that was part of the problem.

674
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,280
Season 9 is best known as the season where the Conners win the lottery.

675
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:41,040
After Dan and Roseanne are hastily brought back together through a series of cheesy TV parodies,

676
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:45,360
the Conners win the jackpot of $108 million dollars.

677
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,360
Adjusted for inflation, that works out to a shit ton of money in 2018.

678
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:55,040
In Millions from Heaven, we get this moment that somehow always makes me laugh.

679
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,720
I help pick the numbers.

680
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,520
I don't know why, but it always works.

681
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,840
The lottery win leads Roseanne on a number of strange adventures that my notes have marked

682
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,800
descriptively as weird shit.

683
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,720
This is also where John Goodman is noticeably absent for several episodes,

684
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,160
explained as him going to California to care for his ill mother.

685
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:19,680
In his place, we get some truly weird shit, including parodies of Rosemary's Baby,

686
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,920
Roseanne Connor literally fighting a train filled with terrorists,

687
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,120
and an appearance by a fake Hillary Clinton and a real Steven Seagal.

688
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:35,280
By the way, Roseambo, yeah it was called that, is widely thought of as the worst episode of the

689
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,800
series and is certainly the lowest rated one, at least from the original 9 season run.

690
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,280
As the series winds down, a pregnant darling goes into premature labor in

691
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,960
The Miracle, an episode with a story credited to Roseanne Barr.

692
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,320
The baby, Harris Connor Healy, is close to death,

693
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,200
and the Connor family money isn't able to solve their problem.

694
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,040
It's not a question of money, Mrs. Connor. Unfortunately, we cannot

695
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,800
duplicate the conditions in the womb.

696
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,960
But this is crazy. I mean, there's got to be something that you can do.

697
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
Well, I wish there was, Mrs. Connor. I'm so sorry.

698
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,800
What's perhaps most notable about this episode is the sudden turn towards the spiritual.

699
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,040
You're making it up. That doesn't work.

700
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,800
Oh yes, it does, Jackie. And you know why? Because they believe it's gonna work.

701
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
I read that in all those books that Nancy gave me. And you know what?

702
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,560
They all say the very same thing. You know what they say?

703
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,200
That the spiritual is the cause for the physical.

704
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,480
This is a strange episode for me to watch. As someone with no faith or belief in the supernatural,

705
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,520
Roseanne Connor is coming from a fundamentally different place.

706
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,760
The struggle to balance the question in her mind eventually leads her to a conclusion that's the

707
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,480
exact opposite of mine. This is one of those episodes where I feel very keenly that I'm

708
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,360
looking at someone completely different from me. Although season 9 had a lot of low points,

709
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,680
I don't think I would call this one of them. The struggle between faith and science show how,

710
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,840
even with material things, people still turn to the spiritual in the face of

711
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,880
unsolvable tragedy. Although I don't like the idea of divine intervention being the solution,

712
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,960
it does speak to the powerlessness people feel that lead them to believe it.

713
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,600
As you might have suspected from the title of the episode, The Baby Pulls Through.

714
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,240
And that brings us to the finale, a two-parter titled, Into That Good Night,

715
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,960
with another story credit to Roseanne Parr. The story of the last episode largely centers

716
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,560
around where the family is heading and the happy futures they all have together.

717
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,200
Darlene and David with their new daughter, Becky and Mark expecting a child of their own,

718
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,800
and DJ finding a calling as a filmmaker. We even get an almost woke moment about gender identity.

719
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:50,400
As the episode comes to a close, and it seems like we're getting a nice

720
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,560
bow to put on The Adventures of the Connor Clan, a recreation of the show's opening

721
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,920
credit sequence changes everything. A lengthy voiceover from Roseanne gives us the true story

722
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,160
of all the characters in the series, how Becky and David were the ones who got together,

723
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,920
and Darlene married Mark, how Jackie was actually a lesbian, and perhaps most shocking.

724
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:33,360
The last season, and much of the series,

725
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,520
are revealed to have been Roseanne working in the writing room her family had gotten her

726
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,800
at the end of season two.

727
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:32,400
The show ends with a quote from T.E. Lawrence, taken from the introduction to his signature

728
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,000
work, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

729
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:14,960
In 2011, the two-part finale was ranked number nine on the TV Guide Network special,

730
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:21,120
TV's Most Unforgettable Finale. Here are some comments from Barr herself, as well as Sarah

731
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,600
Gilbert.

732
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,200
That's how it ends. It doesn't end with a happy reunion on ABC every Christmas.

733
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,760
You know, it's not gonna go like that.

734
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,160
We probably should have been done at season eight. The lottery and stuff? It got so surreal and

735
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:52,320
started to follow Roseanne's real path. It wasn't what it started as. For me, I like the struggle of

736
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:57,600
the family a little more. The financial struggle. The show ended on a somber note, but lived on in

737
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,960
syndication. Reruns still air to this day on some channels. The struggle of a working-class

738
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,040
family could have been consigned to the history books, and this video need not even exist,

739
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,800
but the TV cards weren't done with the Roseanne show just yet.
