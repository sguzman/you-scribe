00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Hey everyone, welcome to my 35,000 subscriber special video. The game plan for this video

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,760
is to watch the special bonus video that was unlocked by my patrons over on Patreon. Then

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,040
I'll be announcing some fun new rewards for people who decide to join my Patreon,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,040
and then we'll have a very lengthy Q&A with way too many questions.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,640
And now let's watch that classic Jose episode from back in 2017 where I decided to discuss

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,680
the scourge of ironic Nazis. A few notes before we start the video. Number one, the audio is

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,800
very bad. Very, very bad. I almost recorded the whole thing again, but I feel like that kind of

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,320
loses the whole point of it being an old video. You'll also be able to tell that my style is a

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,480
bit different. Overall, I think the video actually holds up. Also, I say the word ironic very

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,080
strangely inside it. I wasn't actually trying for an accent back then. It was just trying to

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,760
imitate a funnier podcast that I had seen in the past. Enjoy and brace yourself for the audio.

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
Lately, there's been an outbreak of a certain type of jokesters on YouTube.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,560
People who love getting a rise out of others by adopting vocabulary, attitudes, imagery,

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
and music of history's most playful, silly authoritarian regime, the Third Reich.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,360
It's almost like we've gone back to the 1930s. Nazis invade your cult. Wait, excuse me,

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,080
ironic Nazis. Because nowadays it seems like it can't be a real Nazi unless you're literally

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,480
throwing someone into an oven. And even then someone might ask if they deserved it or not.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,840
But let's pretend what we've mostly gotten is an outbreak of the ironic Nazis. People who love

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,000
living well past the edge of good taste and revel in schlocky shock humor. A few commentators have

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,120
pointed out this trend already, but as someone who likes telling stories, I wanted to try relating

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,960
one of my own as a cautionary tale, and we have to start an unlikely place. This is Bon Jovi.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:16,720
That's right. Drink it in. When Bon Jovi isn't culturally appropriate in cigarette

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
advertising for their albums, they're producing the rock albums that have kept them relevant

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,320
for a decade. Throughout their 30-year career, they've had to weather some tough criticisms,

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,560
namely the one my friends and I came up with 10 years ago when we concluded that Bon Jovi

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,840
is the most generic rock band in history. So we began to mock them. Started off with

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
some sneering and jokes at their expense. But being the sophisticated cats we were,

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,600
we eventually moved on to the much sharper tool of belittling them. We became ironic Bon Jovi fans.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,480
With that move, we entered a golden age of comedy. There's no line that could not be crossed,

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,040
no bar that could not be topped. When someone said Bon Jovi's music retroactively became the best

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,160
music of the 1950s, someone had to correct them and say Bon Jovi's sweet sounds are the reason

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:17,200
we evolved to have ears. There were no limits. And we kept going deeper. We were buying Bon Jovi

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,360
albums, learning the lyrics to their music, and even went to one of their concerts. I remember

34
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
by the end of that night, we were hoarse from singing along to living on a prayer. The concert

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,760
came to an end. Or in other words, we actually had a lot of fun. And maybe it was because of

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,200
that fun that we sort of realized something that night. We realized that our ironic performance

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,640
had taken us so far that we had, in fact, become Bon Jovi fans. I went from the guy who sneered at

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,800
their music to the one who sings at least one Bon Jovi song every time on that karaoke. I went

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,200
from changing the station when they were on to memorizing their lyrics to more songs than I

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,760
really feel comfortable admitting in public. I had become and have become the thing I was pretending

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,720
to be. Now, my little ironic Nazis, you may be saying to yourself, you would never go so far as

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
to become an actual Nazi. My analogy is silly, and I should guess myself. I might have said

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
something similar in my early days of being an ironic Bon Jovi fan. But here's an interesting

44
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,880
point to consider. I am not, and will never likely be so silly as to think our ears evolve

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
to listen to the music of Bon Jovi. While I am always down to sing, wanted, dead, or alive,

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
I don't feel the need to see Bon Jovi whenever they're in town either. In other words,

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
my Jovi fandom is the mild sort of casual fan, which is a far cry from the super fandom I

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,480
pretended. Think to yourself, there's all this good-natured memeing around led you to start

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,920
believing some new ideas you had never considered. Perhaps you find yourself talking about how

50
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,360
multiculturalism can only fail, and ethnic homogeneity is essential to keep society

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,840
functioning. Perhaps you're starting to think that there are some cultures that are barbaric

52
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,960
or so morally reprehensible that anyone from said culture must be regarded with suspicion

53
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,800
or kept away at all costs. No doubt you have rationalizations for your new ideas,

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
that they're not as bad as Nazism, and that might even be true. But do you wonder why they sound

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:32,400
so similar? Is it possible your ironic Nazism is gradually turning into a soft Nazism? I hope

56
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,440
people who draped themselves in the colors of some of history's worst monsters stop and ask

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,600
themselves what all that pretending means and where it might take them. If you're finding your

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,480
moral development is being increasingly informed by a group of people you know is repulsive,

59
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,600
maybe you need to start asking yourself what you really believed in the first place.

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,200
This video isn't designed to be an accusation. I'm staring away from calling out any ideologies

61
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,120
that have been conflated with Nazism on purpose to focus on how some people like to deploy Nazi

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,880
themes for a laugh instead. I'm just hoping people will perhaps stop and think about what they're

63
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,960
doing and saying. I know that's not very popular when we all look to YouTube personalities to do

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:27,280
thinking for us, but maybe they don't always have the answers. And no, I'm actually not trying to be

65
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,480
an ironic YouTuber myself. You can tell me how wrong I am without resorting to name calling

66
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,040
and spamming memes. I'd at least be relieved you're thinking for yourself, even if you are wrong.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,240
At the end of my journey into irony, I ended up the fan of a rock band known for catchy music and

68
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,040
simple lyrics. What will you end up with at the end of yours? And I feel like we need to end on

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,000
the words of a great poet. Take a look around you. Nothing's what it seems. We're living in the

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,120
broken home of hopes and dreams. Let me be the first to shake a helping hand. Anybody brave enough

71
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,280
to take a stand. I've knocked on every door and every dead end street. Looking for forgiveness

72
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:27,040
what's left to be. I hope you all enjoyed that rewatching it. It actually held up better than

73
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,720
I thought it would for a little six minute video. It's not too bad. And I am 100% comfortable with

74
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,760
everyone knowing that I'm a Bon Jovi fan. I can live with this. Now let's get on to the new

75
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,240
patron rewards. I have two types of rewards that will now be available on my Patreon. The first is

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,800
an exclusive download of my theme song. I'll have some more details on the background of this song

77
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,920
in the Q&A since some people asked about it. But if you've ever wanted a copy of your own to listen

78
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,880
to this will be your chance and if you're worried about the artist who happens to be a friend of

79
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,520
mine she'll be getting a percentage of the first month of your donation and if you really want to

80
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
give her a little bit extra just leave a note when you become one of my patrons and say give this

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,160
extra money to your lovely singer. The second new reward is one that's being used by a lot of other

82
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,840
people so it's not quite as fun or creative but it will be super useful at least to me. And that's

83
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,400
letting patrons see videos a few days early. I kind of resisted this one because I would prefer

84
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,120
everyone seeing a video at the same time with no one getting preferential treatment but I'm

85
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,320
actually viewing these releases as something of a test case. So what I'm hoping for is that my

86
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,760
patrons will offer me some early feedback letting me edit and modify and just fix up any small

87
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,440
mistakes that appear in videos so when the final version comes out it'll be nice and not filled

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
with any silly mistakes. And if you're wondering what new expensive tier all of this will be for

89
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,600
the answer is no new tier. Both of these new rewards are being added to the five dollar tier.

90
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
Of course if you'd like to give me more than that that's always an option

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,280
but there won't be any additional rewards for it at least not for the time being.

92
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,920
Now it's time for the Q&A. The first question comes from overrunpatreon from one of my patrons

93
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,880
Liz Castro. She writes, Congrats! I am curious given the breadth of your research for your videos

94
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,440
were you involved in academia or publishing prior to becoming a youtube creator?

95
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
I myself am a teacher and thoroughly appreciate your attention to detail and conscientious

96
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,280
citations. I'm trying to maintain a degree of anonymity here so I won't discuss my professional

97
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,040
life too much but before that I was enrolled in university and have a background in both

98
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,160
english and psychology. I had a double major in my undergrad years. I considered going into a

99
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,360
master's program but for a number of reasons it just wasn't a good option for me. I've always

100
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,800
had a healthy respect for academia and very much appreciate the process and the effort people go

101
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,040
to to make sure their work is properly cited and grounded in appropriate sources. If that's

102
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,520
reflected in my work I'm glad that people are noticing that. A number of questions were asked

103
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,720
on my youtube channel so I am going to go through those in the order that they were asked.

104
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,080
First is, I have a question. What are your thoughts on Balkan politics and will you make

105
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,320
video on it? I assume this is from a viewer in the Balkans and I have to admit I don't know a

106
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,440
lot about Balkan politics. I believe I would have to spend a lot of time researching and learning

107
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,560
about it and to be honest I probably won't ever get around to doing something like that mostly

108
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,600
because this is something that would take years to do if I was going to do it properly and one of my

109
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,720
pet peeves on youtube is seeing people talk about things that they know little or nothing about.

110
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,280
I never want to be one of those people. Next question, are you friends with any right-wing

111
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,840
people? Yes in fact I have a couple of friends who are rather right-wing including family members

112
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,200
and that's always interesting when politics comes up. Thankfully none of the right-wing people I know

113
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,360
have especially noxious or terrible opinions so there's never been too much trouble. I'll share

114
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
our brief story. About a month ago I had some family visiting from out of town and they came

115
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,720
and they wanted to do something festive in the city so my idea was to go to a special pop-up bar

116
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,240
that had a christmas theme here in Toronto. It was a fun time. It was all fancy and dressed up

117
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
and they had specialty cocktails and we were all having a little fun. Later that evening there was

118
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
going to be a show though and one of the people who worked there went around was letting everyone

119
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,000
know there'd be a show that night. Of course I knew about it and I was just waiting to see

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,600
my cousin's reaction because when the staff member came by and said it would be a drag show

121
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:58,480
his eyes just popped out of his head and he was like a drag show? And I just couldn't stop laughing

122
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,680
it was probably my favorite part of the whole night. Okay next question, do you feel any sort

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,120
of pressure to hide any opinions you have because of fear of losing fans slash patrons? Even if you

124
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,640
don't do it do you at least consider it? Let me first address patrons. My patrons are actually

125
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,000
surprisingly quiet. If you go over to my patreon you'll see there aren't that many comments and I

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,600
get almost no messages from my patrons. I actually kind of like that they have this silent support

127
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,240
for me and I appreciate it. I do hope they're a bit more vocal when it comes time to offering

128
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,280
me some feedback for early videos before they go live but other than that I appreciate having

129
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,560
supporters who are willing to financially back my work without trying to influence it or push it

130
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,080
too much one way or another. With regard to the YouTube audience as a whole and any pressure I

131
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,760
feel from them I think pretty much any YouTube creator will feel a degree of pressure one way

132
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,760
or the other when it comes to certain types of opinions. That said when I look at the reactions

133
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,840
from my audience they're usually pretty positive and I feel as though if I go in a certain direction

134
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,360
that maybe they aren't used to and or don't expect I generally receive support more often

135
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,360
than not and I've never gone about making any particular video thinking I'm not sure people

136
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,400
will appreciate this or this is a topic I shouldn't touch because it might annoy my audience. If

137
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,120
anything I feel like I'm rewarded for taking chances like that. When my channel really blew up

138
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,800
with that Roseanne video that was me taking a chance because I wasn't sure anyone wanted to

139
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,360
listen to me talk about a sitcom from the 1980s and 90s and it turns out they did and the lesson

140
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,400
I learned is it's good to take chances and try and make something even if you think your audience

141
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,040
might not be down for it. That said there are moments when I'm making videos and I cut out

142
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,680
certain lines and certain terms of phrase sometimes in sire sections usually because I

143
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,480
think it'll be bad and people will think that's boring or uninteresting sometimes I'm worried

144
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,040
about things being a little too mean a little too gruff when I look at the reactions from my

145
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,560
audience I like the warm positive ones rather than the sort of angry positive ones if that makes

146
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,080
sense and I'm trying to be aware of the audience I'm cultivating and I don't ever want it to be one

147
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,880
where I feel like I am fearful of them fearful of losing viewers or patrons and if I feel myself

148
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,160
moving in that direction I'll feel as though I'm doing something wrong and right now at least I

149
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,960
don't feel like I'm quite in that space next question are you a socialist a sockdam or just a

150
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960
liberal well definitely not just a liberal so we can cross that off the list I tend to think of

151
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,240
politics in two different ways the practical reality of electoral politics and the broader

152
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,760
ideology that informs my vision of how I would like the world to be so when it comes to practical

153
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,520
politics and trying to implement policies I tend to act as a social democrat if an election is up

154
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,560
I will vote for the candidate who will represent policies that will move the country further to

155
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,680
the left I know it's not perfect and some people get frustrated that politicians are lagging behind

156
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,560
where they would like the left to be in the mainstream but I think small improvements are

157
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
better than no improvements and I think there's a real danger of sitting out in elections because

158
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,520
they have consequences even if they don't affect you other people are affected by these policies

159
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,440
and we owe it to one another to always try and make the world a better place when we have the

160
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,520
opportunity as for the long-term goals you could probably say I'm closer to a socialist

161
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,960
generally speaking I try not to be tied down to any sort of specific ideology and we have to be

162
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,360
aware that there are going to be changes and shifts to our society that will make frameworks

163
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,880
we have today not quite or not necessarily applicable to that much different tomorrow

164
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,600
like climate change that was something that has to be accommodated into any sort of framework we're

165
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
going to have for the future and who knows what other sorts of challenges might lie ahead of us

166
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,320
next question do you hobby bird watching you like birds I've actually never gone bird watching

167
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,560
as for liking birds yes I do like birds I don't have any specific affinity towards birds believe

168
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,120
it or not I actually love all animals so birds are also animals and are great next question

169
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,280
what is your take on veganism and animal agriculture I am actually a vegetarian and

170
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,080
have been for about a year and a half now it's been surprisingly easy because I was never a huge

171
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,200
meat eater to begin with so cutting it out was relatively simple although it's sometimes tough

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,360
to eat out which is a bit frustrating veganism is great I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it that far

173
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,600
I'd like to there is a version of animal agriculture that can be done humanely and without

174
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,880
cruelty and in a way might need to be done for certain domesticated animals that can't live in

175
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,240
the wild anymore that said that's not what we have at all and animals are really horribly treated

176
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,000
well I'm not about to go around slapping burgers out of people's hands I would recommend you know

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
if you do eat meat maybe cut down a little bit not just for the sake of the animals but also

178
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,080
the environment it has a pretty hefty toll lots of great channels out there can explain it better

179
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,240
than I can next question would you rather French kiss a poodle or cuddle a wild raccoon I assume

180
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,160
these are both consensual things because I would do neither if the animal wasn't up for it so I

181
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,760
probably go with cuddle wild raccoon because I think it would be weird to open mouth kiss a dog

182
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,680
next question what prompted you to start this channel I saw a increasing amount of reactionary

183
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,080
content on YouTube and it was really starting to annoy me so I wanted to push back against that

184
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,960
honestly for a while I wasn't sure if I was capable of doing something like this but considering the

185
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,840
caliber of the opposition really anyone can debunk some of this garbage that's spewed out there

186
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,320
and from there I've just been experimenting and trying new things and building a channel that's

187
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,600
got some cool different stuff on it now next what do you think is going to stop people from

188
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,560
falling for demagogues um nothing I think demagogues are always going to be an issue and always a

189
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,400
problem as for what people can do there are some general tips and advice and that's to try and be

190
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,240
as educated as possible when it comes to listen to a passionate speaker ask yourself the question

191
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,440
if this is something they're so passionate about and I'm so passionate about why am I simply sitting

192
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,400
here letting this person educate me when I could go out there and use my passion for this subject

193
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
to educate myself and you might find that this person who speaks with such passion is actually

194
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,880
full of crap and you just ID'd a demagogue congratulations next your profile picture looks

195
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,640
like a blue jay correct me if I'm wrong why did you choose this it is a blue jay and why I chose

196
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,920
this was actually pretty random I drew this picture back when I started my channel I had actually been

197
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,720
trying to teach myself to draw for about a year or two when I drew that and it was actually my

198
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,760
first time trying to draw a blue jay and my first time ever digitally coloring anything and when I

199
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,320
made my channel I knew I wasn't just going to take a picture of my face I wanted to have some

200
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,320
graphic or image and I was really worried about taking someone else's so I just took this picture

201
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,360
which was mine and I thought it was pretty cute and I figured what the heck I'll use it I originally

202
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,880
had it as part of the name of this channel but I got rid of that pretty quickly and just switched

203
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,360
the name to Jose because that's so much easier next what's your favorite animated film Princess

204
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,040
Mononoke which is actually my favorite movie entirely uh maybe I'll do a video about it someday

205
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,160
who knows which languages do you speak English a little bit of French but it gets worse every year

206
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,800
because I never use it and I understand some Spanish usually just when someone is yelling at me

207
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,680
next what do you think of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life I have not read it the only

208
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:03,360
familiarity I have with it is I watch the videos by Hannah and Jake discussing it it seems kind of

209
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,560
dopey and a cheap way to smuggle in some Christianity into people's lives I don't really like self-help

210
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,960
books and I like religious self-help books even less probably gonna skip this one what's an example

211
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,360
of a movie that you think is really underrated I wish I had really cool unique tastes in movies

212
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,880
but I don't really maybe Children of Men I feel like that's a movie that was a big deal when it

213
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,040
came out but then just got quickly forgotten stars Clive Owen in a post-apocalyptic future

214
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,560
where no new children are being born it's really good do you ever plan on doing live

215
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,440
streams or debate discussions with people on the other side no not in any time in the near future

216
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,240
most people on the other side I'm gonna be totally honest I don't think approach live streams or

217
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,880
these debate discussions in a way that's helpful I don't just mean the people who are adversarial

218
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
and see it as an attempt to just dunk on the other side and try and make someone look like

219
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,760
a fool in real time even if someone comes in good faith to have a genuine discussion or debate

220
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,600
I don't think they're gonna become armed with enough research or material to make it worthwhile

221
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,280
you'd basically see me show up with as much as I could find speaking to someone who will just pivot

222
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,680
ignore and shoot out talking points and it would be a waste of time I feel like it would be easier

223
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,960
just to respond to their videos because at least then I don't have someone changing the subject

224
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,160
just as I get going on something because they realize they have no response to anything I'm

225
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,840
bringing up or at least I won't have to deal with responses that are completely incongruent with what

226
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm saying will you are you planning on doing more videos about comics yes definitely I was

227
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,840
actually supposed to have a comic book related video in either late December early January

228
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,320
I got about two-thirds the way through the script when I realized I wasn't saying anything new or

229
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,800
interesting I was just looking for an excuse to talk about a certain Avengers comic I still might

230
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,200
do it in the future if I can find a more worthwhile bit of commentary I don't want to just create

231
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
videos for the sake of creating videos I want it to be a little more worthwhile as far as big videos

232
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,440
like the Secret Empire one oof I'd need to find another big event I'd want to cover like that

233
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,400
again although it was kind of fun featuring all those different voices in there and having a

234
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,520
really big video discussing comics I might do that again in the future we'll see congrats on

235
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,840
35k Jose have you ever thought about making a video on gamer gate like you did on comics gate

236
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,480
keep up the good work yes I have I kind of want to do this it's going to be an enormous project and

237
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,800
it's going to be painful it'll be more of a an autopsy I guess because gamer gate's pretty dead

238
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,280
right now right it's it's dead huh I hope so what's your hottest take ooh good question

239
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,200
one day I might have to do a video about how Batman is terrible and there are almost no good

240
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Batman stories and as I say that as someone who has read a lot of them it's not even the usual

241
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,800
like ooh Batman's a fascist he's a rich white male he's actually a conservative dream libertarian

242
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:24,560
etc etc no I just think a lot of Batman stories suck and they just read like fan fiction because

243
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,920
most writers are fans of Batman even if you are atheistic what's your favorite deity

244
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,120
that is a good good question I always thought Poseidon was really cool Greek god of the sea

245
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,240
he always seemed to get downplayed a little in most stories about Greek mythology people are

246
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,880
more interested in Zeus or Aries maybe Athena but why not Poseidon he's got the whole ocean

247
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
the ocean's pretty neat next question what method do you believe would be effective in showing

248
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,560
progressives that they are becoming the tea party of the left first of all you're assuming I buy

249
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,360
into that premise the tea party for those who don't know was a very right-wing group that emerged in

250
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,800
conservative politics in 2009 2010 thereabouts it was very much a response to the election of

251
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,600
Barack Obama but it was supposedly more about the out of control spending and the massive debt

252
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,560
deficit as for the comparisons to the tea party I can see what people are saying and that it seems

253
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,840
to be on the extreme left of the spectrum I think pushing for their left is actually a good thing

254
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,360
when it comes to certain tactics though there is something to be said about elements on the left

255
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,360
that give the left a bad name and really the difficulty is finding a way to criticize that

256
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,400
in a way that isn't helpful to the right and becoming a useful idiot like Tim Poole or Dave

257
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,640
Rubin I'm actually working on a video it's still just a germ of an idea and I'm just not sure the

258
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160
best way of doing this but a video on how to critique the left in a way that will make it

259
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,240
better rather than just try and tear it down like some secret right-wing operative if you want to

260
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,520
see a good example of that Mexy actually had a video about that I the name is blanking on me at

261
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,000
the moment but I'll put it on the screen and there'll be a link somewhere I think we need more

262
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,600
of that more ways of not necessarily making sure everyone on the left believes the same thing

263
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,400
but that we are all pushing in the same direction and see each other as allies next do you agree

264
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,720
rats greater than blue jays of course you do what is your take on political violence first of all

265
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
no I don't agree that rats are greater than blue jays I would put them equal because I try not to be

266
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,440
an animal supremacist okay okay why am I take on political violence in defense I I think it's

267
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,200
absolutely vital and necessary there are a lot of rough groups out there and I think if you're

268
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
marching against certain groups and you know certain elements will be there it's important to

269
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,480
defend yourself the police might not necessarily have your back or be there in time that said

270
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,240
a poor political violence more broadly and I don't believe it's an especially great tool when

271
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,280
there are avenues to express or to enact actual change people might not like electoral politics

272
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,680
but it has been shown to change and it's far more effective than political violence in the system

273
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,960
we have now I'm also skeptical of more revolutionary types of violence that completely that roll out

274
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,400
the guillotine and start chopping people's heads off because well revolutions are very turbulent

275
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
and you never know what you're gonna get and it's important to look at the population around you

276
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,520
I would advise any violent revolutionary or anyone who advocates political violence to look at the

277
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,960
other side look at how many there are of them and to what degree they are armed and ask yourself

278
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,240
what the result of open combat or violence would be here I think it's better to persuade people

279
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,600
non-violently to our side and ironically enough once we have all those people on our side we won't

280
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,640
need violence anymore because electoral politics will become more powerful what is your favorite

281
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,240
book or best book you've read one of my all-time favorites is Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire

282
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,040
really great book about the invasive nature of literary criticism or recently I really enjoyed

283
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,680
The Memoir Educated by Tara Westover very stirring story about a woman who grew up in a very

284
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,880
restrictive environment if you want something a little more fun I would recommend the Mistborn

285
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
trilogy by Brandon Sanderson I had a lot of fun reading those too I want to read more Brandon

286
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,920
Sanderson but it's hard to find the time when you're oh god I'm just thinking about the horrible

287
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,680
conservative novel I have to start reading that's gonna be fun are there any conservative content

288
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,960
creators you respect I assume that means respect on YouTube I'm gonna go with no there are

289
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,280
conservative commentators who I generally not necessarily enjoy but honestly disagree with

290
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,160
on YouTube ugh no what is the most painful right-wing youtuber you've ever watched don't

291
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,440
kind of convenient these questions are so close I would probably say no bullshit I'm sure there

292
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,360
have been singular videos from other people who are worse but his content is just so completely

293
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:15,120
devoid of anything it's just the most asinine superficial stuff I've ever seen I haven't

294
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,840
watched it in a while maybe he's gotten better I doubt it his stuff blows I just cannot watch it

295
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,240
okay let's move on to the curious cat questions what's your process making media analysis videos

296
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,040
I rewatch your sitcom analysis and secret empire videos all the time they're so well made and I'd

297
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,560
love to know how they happen huh also would you ever make a video on Frasier love your channel

298
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,600
first of all thank you I always appreciate that as for the process when it comes to either

299
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,800
watching a TV show or reading a comic book event I watch and read all of it while taking copious

300
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,880
notes either little things I notice they'd be funny jokes any recurring patterns or themes or

301
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,720
ideas while taking those notes I always include timestamps page numbers whatever I need to to

302
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,840
make sure that the section I'm referring to can be easily found again when I'm actually

303
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,440
writing the script and then editing together the video it sucks to mention a certain scene

304
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,280
or moment or line that you then have to hunt for because you totally forgot where it was

305
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,040
200 episodes of a sitcom ago when I get to the end I might rewatch certain key sections or moments

306
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,720
and I usually mark that stuff out ahead of time but I'll try to look over the whole thing just

307
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,720
in case there's anything I missed after that I will then go about putting together a script

308
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
how I organize it depends on what I'm talking about sometimes I'll just go through things

309
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,280
chronologically usually because that's the easiest way to do it but I also like pulling out

310
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,800
specific touchstones or themes to certain sections I try to create these videos for people who have

311
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,320
either watched or read what I'm talking about or haven't so I try to offer as many handholds as

312
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,640
possible when it comes to the plot and the characters just to make sure everyone is on

313
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,080
board and following along and then I try to probe a little deeper digging further into

314
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,600
what the central themes and ideas being explored are as for a Frasier video it's

315
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,800
possible I've been asked for a Frasier and Cheers one in the past and I'd probably want to make

316
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:25,040
back-to-back videos about those who knows maybe in the future I don't have any plans at the moment

317
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:32,560
though next question what is your ideal partner one thing I would appreciate in an ideal partner

318
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,280
is a healthy sense of curiosity I think someone who has questions about the world and is willing

319
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,120
to try and figure them out is quite admirable and something I like to think I do myself I also

320
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,880
appreciate warmth and kindness and a big heart really matters to me also someone with that

321
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
healthy sense of adventure I like traveling I like seeing the world don't always have the

322
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,040
opportunity to do it but when I do I'd like to have someone who's willing to go on those adventures

323
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,960
with me next do you like snow I like snow one of my favorite times of year is a cool winter night

324
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,960
not too cold with snow falling is really beautiful and you really get a sense of quiet and peacefulness

325
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,200
in moments like that even in the city so I do have a lot of love for snow hello Jose I was wondering

326
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
since you make analyses on sitcoms what are some of your personal favorites oh good question I have

327
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,280
very boring favorites when it comes to sitcoms The Simpsons is one of my all-time favorite TV

328
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,240
shows I also really enjoyed Seinfeld I wish I could offer some more obscure and strange choices but uh

329
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,320
you know it is what it is next are you looking to make youtube more of a career or just something

330
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,040
you do on the side well right now it's on the side because I simply don't make enough to make

331
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,480
it a career if enough people start giving to my patreon uh sure it's something I would consider

332
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,160
next what were your thoughts on the Canadian election considering the range of possibilities

333
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,160
which I think we got somewhere in the middle a compromise that satisfies no one we were looking

334
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,640
at a possible conservative minority so I think avoiding that is a huge win even though I'm not

335
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,320
really a huge fan of the Liberal Party or Justin Trudeau specifically that said the loss of all

336
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,360
those NDP seats is certainly going to hurt the leftist project in Canada hopefully the next

337
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,960
election will be a push back towards the left we'll see conservatives really blow and are bad

338
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,480
at elections so I guess I'm just grateful for that because the way the wind was blowing that

339
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,480
election could have gone much worse next will you ever do a leftist analysis on a movie instead of

340
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,000
a sitcom I don't have any planned right now a movie would be so much easier than a sitcom because

341
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
it's just one thing to watch instead of several hundred small things it's just a question of which

342
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,240
movie because movies are so overdone on YouTube that I'd want to find one that people aren't

343
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,880
talking about I have a few in mind I'd like to do but I would have to do some preliminary research

344
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,400
to make sure no one said what I have in mind because I never liked being the second person

345
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,360
to make a point thoughts on Nick Fuentes maybe you could do a video analyzing him like you

346
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,080
analyzed Tim Poole that's unlikely the issue with Nick Fuentes is that I saw this one clip of him

347
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,360
discussing tactics and one of those tactics involved a very loose relationship with the

348
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,080
truth and the idea that you can say or do whatever you want as long as it's advancing your cause

349
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,800
you don't have to hold yourself to any sort of personal standard as long as you're advancing the

350
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,760
cause and that really just summed up why people like that aren't necessarily worth engaging

351
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,560
if he becomes more relevant maybe I'll make a video about him but he seems pretty fringe at

352
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,960
the moment thoughts on Ronald Reagan it's weird that he's become a deity of sorts even though

353
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,000
most of his policies were pretty bad and his victory over the Soviet Union has been wildly

354
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,560
exaggerated and it really shows the power of the modern conservative echo chamber to deify a man

355
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,120
who while popular was not a great president I wonder if we'll see that happen again with

356
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,480
the current man in charge next who are your influences when making YouTube content who do

357
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,640
you perceive as the influences on your beliefs well for YouTube content I think it's pretty obvious

358
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:26,240
I owe a debt to the youtuber Sean who as we all know invented the whole idea of talking and not

359
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,160
appearing on camera before then it just was not a thing right potholder 54 for instance is a

360
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,880
youtuber I have a lot of respect for also an influence on how I make my content the way he

361
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,960
approaches his work his dogged attempts to engage with research and portray people honestly is

362
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,760
something I really respect and to do it in a fun entertaining way I think everything has a degree

363
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,480
of influence on you one way or the other I could say for instance Dave Rubin had a massive influence

364
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,920
on me on what not to do and that is to never do anything that ever resembles Dave Rubin's work

365
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,600
ever lest I start hating myself uncontrollably as for influences on my beliefs who there are a lot

366
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,920
of them a lot of what I believe now is influenced by the life I've led the people I've met in my

367
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,440
my personal life the books I've read the things I've learned about the world and generally just

368
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,800
trying to keep a positive attitude to the world around me not necessarily a positive in the terms

369
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,520
of being happy but positive in wanting the best for the world next what is your introduction song

370
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,440
I like the voice for that one I actually got my friend Dana to record a little answer so let's

371
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,440
let her handle this one hey it's Dana I recorded the intro and outro music for Jose's videos which

372
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,080
was truly such an honor and like oh my god I'm on a Q&A now am I like famous for this high channel

373
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,640
oh anyway let's get into this so the song is untitled but I think if I had to call it something

374
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,280
I would call it what could have been a beautiful love letter to a long and amazing friendship

375
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,800
but Jose demanded we cut it down to about three seconds by Dana and also kind of by Jose

376
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,520
but actually thank you so much every time you guys say something sweet about me Jose screenshots and

377
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,960
sends it to me and every time you say something not so nice he screenshots and texts that to me

378
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,200
as well so don't think that I don't see you just kidding you guys are so nice and you make me blush

379
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,240
like all the time so just thank you so much I'm really pleased that you liked the song bye

380
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,080
so thank you Fat Dana next have you heard of ContraPoints she's a trans youtuber who

381
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,840
was recently cancelled due to hiring transphobe Buck Angel to do a 10 second voice clip there's

382
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,640
more to the story of course but I was wondering what your opinions on the controversy were if any

383
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,000
and or if you'd be willing to do a video on it slash ContraPoints not to bring her down but offer

384
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,360
a calmer opinion on the events to answer the first part of the question yes I have heard of the

385
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,840
ContraPoints channel I've been a viewer for a very long time and have enjoyed many of our videos

386
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,320
as for the second part of that question as to whether or not I will make a video about

387
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,800
that whole controversy I will absolutely not be doing that it seems like a very intense war that

388
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,960
does more harm than good in the division it sows amongst people I will say this there should

389
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,880
always be a space to offer friendly and constructive criticism of any youtuber and the

390
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,160
choices they make in their videos so long as people are doing that respectfully and with the

391
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,200
effort to get someone to improve that's only ever a good thing next do you own any blue jays if not

392
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,120
what birds do you own I don't think you can legally own a blue jay I don't think it's a

393
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,400
bird that's been domesticated I don't own any birds I don't plan to own any birds I am

394
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,680
uncomfortable with the idea of owning birds myself because I don't like the idea of caging them birds

395
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,120
can fly free through the sky and I can't imagine them liking their cages if you're a bird owner I

396
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,480
hope you treat them kindly and with love and affection very open to the idea of having a like

397
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,600
a bird friend that lives in my backyard or flies around and maybe shows up every now and again for

398
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,400
some seed and to hang out but that's as far as I'd go with a bird relationship next how does

399
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,640
Canada determine who wins an election because in the United States we have the electoral college

400
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,960
who is a body of electors established by the United States Constitution which forms every

401
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,440
four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States

402
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,240
it has a lot of flaws like the existence of swing states and giving small more votes and more power

403
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,400
despite a small percentage living there in fact I learned from CGP Grey that the president can win

404
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,960
the electoral college with only 22 of the popular vote is the way Canada determines election more

405
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,200
fair than the US personally I think so in Canada we have a parliamentary system so the idea is

406
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,560
whichever political party wins the most seats in election the leader of that party becomes

407
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,000
the prime minister there's also the possibility if you don't win enough seats to form a majority

408
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,320
or even a clear minority there's also the possibility of coalition governments forming

409
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,160
where two parties can combine their forces and name a prime minister and form a government together

410
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,560
although that's pretty rare in Canada we almost never have coalition governments

411
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,520
I also think it's neat that the leaders of the parties actually have to run in specific ridings

412
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,880
so we've had cases like in our previous election where Maxine Bernier who is the leader of the

413
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,720
People's Party of Canada also known as the far-right anti-immigration party he actually

414
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,040
lost in his riding so he doesn't even get to be in parliament which is awesome oh yeah that's

415
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,280
another thing even if your party loses if you're the leader of the party effectively running for

416
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,320
the prime ministership you can still be in the government but you would just be a member of

417
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,240
parliament you probably wouldn't be the leader of your party come the next election either

418
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,440
next do you believe in the deep state sort of in the sense that there are career bureaucrats who

419
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,320
work within governments through most of their lives and will carry with them certain opinions

420
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:19,760
and political positions sure but I think the term deep state is often weaponized by administrations

421
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,880
to filter out these career bureaucrats and instead replace them with lackeys who will just operate as

422
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:34,080
ideological tools if we're going to truly combat the deep state or I should say the entrenched

423
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,640
wisdom within political structures it needs to be done in a way that isn't so in terms of partisan

424
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,960
hackery are there any video games that you like let's keep it to more recent games I just finished

425
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,760
playing god of war which I kind of want to do a video on there's so much to say there I think

426
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,840
that one's been done to death one of my favorite games of all time is the legend of zelda breath

427
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,720
of the wild that was just that but like I was playing the future mario galaxy 2 is one of my

428
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,080
absolute favorites persona 4 metal gear solid even the twin snakes version snake eater that

429
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,800
was probably my favorite of that series elite beat agents or any sort of music game is something I

430
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,080
can get down for I actually nearly made a video for my channel about no more heroes which I think

431
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,280
is one of the best examples of video games as art but then I noticed there was a channel out there

432
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,480
oh god I don't even remember the name of the channel or the name of the video but it did a

433
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,240
look at no more heroes that said everything that I want to say so I thought it's been said and then

434
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,640
I didn't make the video I might make one on video games at some point in the future but I'm not in

435
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,160
a rush next do you think these right wingers will ever lose their fame they're just dominating the

436
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,680
internet I think a lot of them actually have especially the ones have been around for years

437
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,880
and years a lot of them seem to have carved out these little fiefdoms and while they do have

438
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,760
viewership and some success they don't have the relevance they once did of course there's an

439
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,320
endless stream of them and they just seem to cycle them out as old ones lose their luster

440
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,720
I don't think we should ever count on them just losing their fame that's why part of the reason

441
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,840
I made this channel is to push back against it and I'm so encouraged by all the new left-wing

442
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,640
channels I've seen appear since I started making mine not that I think mine is necessarily

443
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,920
influencing any specific ones I'm just glad that there are more voices because this truly is

444
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,440
an all hands on deck type of situation and the more we push back against it the better and it's

445
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,120
always easier to push back when you're doing it with a lot of people next have you thought about

446
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,560
exploring Caitlin Bennett and her horrible content for those who don't know this is the gun girl

447
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,680
she showed up to some college with an assault rifle she took photographs of her walking around

448
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,320
she was instantly the poster girl for many conservatives and she now goes around for info

449
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,960
wars interviewing college students asking them questions and then they just humiliate her with

450
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,480
the responses it's kind of like the opposite of Steven Crowder's thing where he goes out and tries

451
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,080
to make them look stupid and usually by using his deceptive tactics can do that Caitlin Bennett

452
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,520
isn't nearly as capable and she just ends up looking like an idiot I don't think I need to

453
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,080
make a video of it I think just watching one of her videos is enough to embarrass her next do you

454
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,520
think capitalism will fall sometime in this century oh since we're only about 20 years in

455
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,800
it's possible think about the end of capitalism which I generally like the sound of it needs to

456
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,880
be done by people who are ready for it by that I mean it's something we all have to buy into rather

457
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,600
than something that will create a top-down improvement in the world I think there has to

458
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,000
be a degree of bottom-up buying into so to speak of a post-capitalism world that's a lot of hearts

459
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,760
and minds to change can we get there by the end of the century I think we have to try will it happen

460
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,640
though I'm not that optimistic next where do you go for unbiased news what about biased entertaining

461
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,200
news I go nowhere for unbiased news here's a new slash all news is biased what I tried to do is

462
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,800
find news that can be sourced when I say biased news I should clarify I don't mean the sort of

463
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,680
stupid left right-wing bias that people talk about a lot of mainstream media isn't as left

464
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,120
biased as people pretend it is it's more biased toward the status quo so generally speaking I

465
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:20,560
think any news that can inform you is helpful regardless of its bias the more extreme it's

466
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,200
biased it gets tougher because often that includes distorting things through some kind of

467
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,320
funhouse mirror what I would recommend is always look for news that can be adequately sourced

468
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,240
to some primary source of information if it mentions a poll for instance if it instead of

469
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,480
like sending you to blog after blog after blog and eventually finding the poll something that

470
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,800
links directly to the poll is better better still is checking out that poll for yourself and seeing

471
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,840
how accurately the article in question represents it same thing for interviews or descriptions of

472
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,240
events and there's the old reporter's adage of believe nothing you hear in half of what you see

473
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,840
it's always good to be skeptical but that said if someone can demonstrate something is true I

474
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,360
suggest you believe it and not just write it off as fake news because it might be something you

475
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,600
don't agree with another little axiom that might be helpful the truth does not change in accordance

476
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,760
with our ability to stomach it that's from Flannery O'Connor are there any anime and manga

477
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,400
that you like yes definitely loads my favorite tv series of all time not just anime is nana

478
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,080
favorite manga too by the way it is so good I will make a video about this one day I kind of

479
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,440
hope the series ends before I do but it's been on hiatus for eight years so who knows but there's

480
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,360
loads of others I enjoyed cowboy bebop is one of my all-time favorites also a big fan of gundam seed

481
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,520
best gundam don't care what anyone says I just watched carol on tuesday that was fantastic more

482
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,840
people should check that out great music kids on the slope is really good and I even like things

483
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,640
not by shinshirawa nabe anything by studio ghibli obviously I mentioned princess mononoke but grave

484
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,640
of the fireflies is also fantastic spirited way manga wise let's give a shout out to uh monster

485
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,720
by naoki odisawa which is true work of art I might make a video of that someday too I also like

486
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,360
which is great manga I don't know if they made that into an anime yet they should I also have

487
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,560
a soft spot for shonen manga and anime although it's very hard to watch it and make time though

488
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,240
I do try to keep up with world trigger which I really enjoy I love your content thank you

489
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,200
I have two questions one are there any alt right youtubers you have a morbid fascination with

490
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,120
two I really loved your rosan analysis do you have any other shows that you think would be worth

491
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,080
a rewatch if I've made a video on someone I probably have some degree of fascination with

492
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,080
them I don't know if I'd call it morbid though pretty good at disconnecting from the alt right

493
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,000
space when I'm not actively working on something as for the second one if I make a video on something

494
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,800
you can assume I think it's probably worth a rewatch and I've got another sickon video in the

495
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,320
works and I will say that's worth a rewatch too but with some caveats these are all big shows

496
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,800
sometimes it's better to just check out certain episodes and I try to highlight them as I go along

497
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,280
there are lots of great shows to rewatch though I'm just gonna put a bunch on screen pick any of

498
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,640
those sure they're good dumb question alert if you live in Toronto and have a JPFP then was your

499
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,320
channel inspired by the Toronto Blue Jays no I just think Blue Jays are really cool the team's

500
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,800
fine uh the similarity to the Blue Jay logos is a coincidence it just happens that the bird looks

501
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,080
like the logo and I'll put them side by side you can see the similarity but uh you know what I'm

502
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,080
also going to show you all the original photo that my drawing was inspired by this was the image I

503
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:48,480
was trying to recreate in my own unique style next how do you pronounce your channel name

504
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:56,800
Jose that was easy there were two questions about Tim Poole's eventual response to my videos about

505
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,760
him I don't know if this is actually happening these two questions are all that I've heard about

506
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,680
if Tim Poole wants to defend his work he's more than entitled to my main concern is that I'm

507
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,360
worried he won't understand my video if he were to respond at all he'll try to defend individual

508
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:20,560
points and say I was wrong about this I was wrong about that and try to argue in that sense and that

509
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:27,600
misses the whole point my video wasn't about the content found in that specific week so much as it

510
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,680
was about how Tim delivers his content more broadly I was looking at his methods the way

511
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,720
he frames issues the way he just repeats conservative talking points and the way he

512
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,440
just gives you a superficial understanding of the stories he reads for example I noticed a lot of

513
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,280
people were pushing back on me about the California bill that affects freelance employees I actually

514
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,440
have no opinion on that because I've not really researched it maybe I should have made that clearer

515
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,120
in the video my point was that Tim is trying to present a very specific perspective on that bill

516
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,760
that reinforces a conservative narrative it could very well be that that bill is awful and does

517
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,280
terrible things that's not what I was interested in I was more interested in how Tim was dishonestly

518
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,800
framing that bill by omitting certain key facts in the story he supposedly read if he actually

519
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,440
responds to my videos in a thoughtful way that actually understands the point I was trying to

520
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,840
make I'd love to see that not holding my breath though last question and I'm so glad the last

521
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:32,880
question is so so good and such a valuable insight into my site thoughts on cat girls

522
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,600
if someone is a cat girl I respect their identity and to identify as a cat girl I value and respect

523
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:46,480
you and on that lovely note the Q&A comes to a close thank you to all my patrons for helping

524
