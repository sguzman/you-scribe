00:00.000 --> 00:09.720
Debuting in the year 2000, Malcolm in the Middle had a profound impact on the world

00:09.720 --> 00:11.320
of television sitcoms.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.920
The show centered its stories around an over-the-top family while popularizing a single-camera style

00:15.920 --> 00:18.160
of filming on network television.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.360
Throughout its run, it was nominated for multiple awards, was a critical darling, and achieved

00:22.360 --> 00:26.680
rating success before finally becoming to an end in its seventh season.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.960
The series was created by Linwood Boomer.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.620
Originally an actor, he broke into the TV world as the character Adam Kendall on the

00:33.620 --> 00:36.080
series Little House on the Prairie.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.620
He gradually moved towards writing and producing, soon finding himself working on a number of

00:39.620 --> 00:41.060
TV sitcoms.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.220
In the writers' room, he would entertain his colleagues with stories of his family

00:44.220 --> 00:47.920
growing up, and eventually he'd put together a pilot based on those early years of his

00:47.920 --> 00:48.920
life.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.000
Boomer was considered gifted and put into special classes, much like the main character

00:53.000 --> 00:54.440
on his show, Malcolm.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.080
My mom would never tell me what my IQ was, so when I wrote Malcolm, I said his IQ was

00:59.080 --> 01:00.680
165.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.600
My mom then told me that mine was never that high.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.760
The idea of a child prodigy in less-than-ideal circumstances was at the center of Boomer's

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
pitch.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.560
It was easy to write because I knew the material.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.280
I'd been thinking about it for a very long time, and a lot of those pieces in the pilot

01:15.280 --> 01:16.720
were pieces of my life.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.840
I'd spent a lot of time telling them as anecdotes.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.200
They were polished.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.960
Although it was shown to several different networks, the show ultimately landed on Fox,

01:24.960 --> 01:29.320
a network with a history for depicting non-traditional family dynamics, at least non-traditional when

01:29.320 --> 01:31.640
it came to what you would see on network television.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.960
The role of Malcolm was given to Frankie Muniz.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.120
Originally written as a 9-year-old, Malcolm's age was instead made vague to accommodate

01:38.120 --> 01:40.000
the 13-year-old Muniz.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.920
Although Boomer considered himself at that age to be more antagonistic, Malcolm was written

01:43.920 --> 01:48.640
to be more of a charming eccentric, a genius living in a family of underachievers, trying

01:48.640 --> 02:12.680
to understand a world that demeans people like him.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.800
Jane Kaczmarek was cast as Malcolm's mother, Lois.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.680
It was a role that earned Kaczmarek seven Emmy nominations for a lead actress in a comedy

02:20.680 --> 02:23.360
series, one for every year the show is on the air.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.080
Though sadly she would never win the award, she does hold the record for most nominations

02:27.080 --> 02:29.840
within that category without actually winning it.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.600
Along with Malcolm, Lois was one of the two characters left largely unchanged from the

02:33.600 --> 02:37.840
original script for the pilot, a fierce matriarch of her family that holds them together through

02:37.840 --> 02:39.280
sheer force of will.

02:39.280 --> 02:58.400
Brian Cranston was cast as a father of the family, Hal, and unlike the other characters,

02:58.400 --> 03:01.240
was radically transformed by the actor.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.560
Originally a ghostly presence in the series, Cranston played Hal as a character motivated

03:05.560 --> 03:06.640
by fear.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.080
This opened him up to some of the more absurd plot lines and physical gags, with stunts

03:11.080 --> 03:34.880
often performed by Cranston himself.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.200
The oldest child of the family, Francis, was played by Christopher Masterson.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.400
Having been sent away to military school, Francis typically appears in his own self-contained

03:43.400 --> 03:47.080
plot lines, disconnected from the stories back in his family's household, though he

03:47.080 --> 04:00.120
does appear in a handful of episodes that bring everyone together for some chaos.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.640
Justin Burfield played the second oldest brother, Reese, although technically younger than

04:04.640 --> 04:07.880
Frankie Munes, his character was a year older on the show.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.280
Reese is the dimmest member of the family.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.480
He would only be caught using his head to solve the problem if it meant smashing it

04:13.480 --> 04:19.600
against something.

04:19.600 --> 04:32.800
The final member of the family is Dewey, played by Eric Per Sullivan, the youngest member

04:32.800 --> 04:34.700
of the family, at least in the beginning.

04:34.700 --> 04:38.760
He began the series as a cute bit of comic relief, and gradually grew into a budding

04:38.760 --> 04:48.680
musical virtuoso by the series' end.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.360
In the pilot episode of the series, the family was given the name Wilkerson, though this

04:52.360 --> 04:56.320
was dropped afterwards to avoid any specific ethnic label for them.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.640
In the interest of sticking to how they are most often presented in the series, I am going

04:59.640 --> 05:02.240
to avoid using any last name for the family.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.720
The cast was joined by a host of other characters, such as Craig Feldspar, played by David Anthony

05:06.720 --> 05:11.040
Higgins, Malcolm's friend Stevie Carnarbon, played by Craig Lamar Traylor, and Lois'

05:11.040 --> 05:13.500
mother Ida, played by Cloris Lechman.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.440
Another vital aspect of the series was its style, which was unique on network television

05:17.440 --> 05:22.160
at the time, breaking the tradition of a multi-camera setup, where a scene was filmed from multiple

05:22.160 --> 05:23.600
angles at once.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.160
Malcolm in the middle opted to use a single camera for filming, something more akin to

05:27.160 --> 05:30.760
dramas on network television or comedies on cable television.

05:30.760 --> 05:35.080
There was no studio audience, or laugh track for that matter, and to compensate, the series

05:35.080 --> 05:41.240
used a number of techniques, camera movements, montages, and lots of changes in filming locations.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.240
Although commonplace among comedies today, back in 2000, this was incredibly rare for

05:45.240 --> 05:47.120
network television sitcoms.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.640
Malcolm in the middle premiered on January 9, 2000, on Sunday night, between The Simpsons

05:52.640 --> 05:54.080
and The X-Files.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.400
It was a plum spot, and an advertising blitz ensured that this show would have every advantage

05:58.400 --> 06:03.080
possible to make a strong first impression, and a strong first impression is exactly

06:03.080 --> 06:09.920
what it made.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.520
The first episode of the series, creatively titled Pilot, begins with Malcolm offering

06:14.520 --> 06:20.720
some narration to the camera.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.000
A rarity for TV sitcoms, Malcolm offers us a running narration throughout the series,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.280
giving us some insight into how his mind works in any given scene.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.880
But this does more than provide context, it lets us see into the mind of a genius to

06:31.880 --> 06:35.400
realize that the things he cares about in life aren't all that different from what

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
we care about.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.120
After the opening credits, with a song performed by They Might Be Giants, we meet the rest

06:40.120 --> 06:41.760
of Malcolm's family.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.280
Malcolm and his brothers have two states of being in their home.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.840
They're either fighting with each other, or they're asleep.

06:46.840 --> 06:51.160
While the boys walk to school, Francis is introduced through a short montage.

06:51.160 --> 07:18.120
It's here we see two strengths of the show's style.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.760
On your standard sitcom, there are usually only a handful of locations, due to the cost

07:21.760 --> 07:24.280
and effort of building new sets for a multi-camera setup.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.320
A single camera lets them film on various locations more easily, so we get to see things

07:28.320 --> 07:31.080
that would otherwise be summarized by dialogue.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.680
In this example, it's the many exploits of Francis, shown through a series of quick

07:34.680 --> 07:39.000
cuts, watching the chaos of his teenage years unfold, rather than having it summarized by

07:39.000 --> 07:41.280
a character describing his antics.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.040
This moment would have far less impact if it was someone talking about how Francis lit

07:45.040 --> 07:48.840
a car on fire and hooked up with a girl, instead we actually get to see it.

07:48.840 --> 07:53.200
The episode's plot introduces the premise of Malcolm's genius finally being noticed

07:53.200 --> 08:05.160
in school, and him being brought into the gifted class.

08:05.160 --> 08:19.000
We meet Malcolm's eventual friend Stevie, and Malcolm reluctantly connects with him.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.040
The idea of being normal comes up a lot in this series, and Malcolm is desperate to hold

08:23.040 --> 08:36.720
on to that.

08:36.720 --> 08:41.240
By the end of the episode, we realize that this is Malcolm's first step into realizing

08:41.240 --> 08:52.280
he doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the world, that he isn't quite normal.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.880
Although most of us aren't geniuses, what's relatable here is the feeling of not quite

08:55.880 --> 09:00.520
fitting in at school, of being unsure of where exactly your place is in the world.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.640
In Malcolm's case, he's a genius.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.880
But for other kids, it might mean braces, an unexpected growth spurt, or having to move

09:06.880 --> 09:07.880
somewhere new.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.280
This episode's resolution sees Malcolm embracing Stevie as a friend, standing up to a bully,

09:12.280 --> 09:14.680
and deciding to make the most of his new situation.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.780
Although rough around the edges, Malcolm is a good kid, and now he's stuck trying to

09:17.780 --> 09:20.720
figure out his new status as a krellboying.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.680
In the series krellboying is a term used to describe kids in the gifted program.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.680
It gradually fades away over time, as Malcolm's krellboying friends become a less prominent

09:28.680 --> 09:29.940
part of the series.

09:29.940 --> 09:34.440
The name is a reference to the Rick Moranis character in the 1986 movie Little Shop of

09:34.440 --> 09:35.440
Horrors.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.160
It's hard to imagine kids in the year 2000 having strong memories of a fourteen-year-old

09:40.160 --> 09:41.600
horror musical.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.920
This is one of those little details that remind us this is a show written by adults about

09:45.920 --> 09:50.960
kids who don't necessarily have their finger on the pulse of pop culture in the 2000s.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.560
This episode includes the first and only appearance of the family's last name, Wilkerson, seen

09:55.560 --> 09:57.960
here on Francis' nametag.

09:57.960 --> 10:03.200
The pilot was a huge success, winning Primetime Emmy Awards for Writing for a Comedy Series,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.960
awarded to Linwood Boomer, and Directing, awarded to Todd Holland.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.880
In the ratings, it pulled in 22.4 million viewers, and the following week's episode,

10:11.880 --> 10:17.320
Red Dress, set a series high for 23.3 million viewers, although the first season would eventually

10:17.320 --> 10:21.520
settle to an average of roughly 15 million viewers per episode.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.320
The episode Red Dress also includes one of the most obvious shots of a crew member in

10:25.320 --> 10:27.680
an episode I've ever seen.

10:27.680 --> 10:32.320
Another thing that made Malcolm in the Middle different was how it structured its episodes.

10:32.320 --> 10:37.200
While other sitcoms would have a main plotline and a shorter backup plotline in each episode,

10:37.200 --> 10:41.040
Malcolm in the Middle could sometimes include up to four different plotlines running through

10:41.040 --> 10:42.440
a single episode.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.960
It ensured that, even though Malcolm was the main character, he would never have to shoulder

10:45.960 --> 10:50.720
the bulk of each episode, and really emphasize that the show was an ensemble cast.

10:50.720 --> 10:55.520
Malcolm's teacher, Caroline Miller, played by Catherine Lloyd Burns, is credited as a

10:55.520 --> 10:58.760
principal member of the cast, though that would only last for the season.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.840
She serves as a guide for Malcolm into his new surroundings in the gifted class.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.960
Malcolm's world in the gifted class, self-contained in the first few episodes, comes crashing

11:07.960 --> 11:23.200
up against the reality of his family in the episode Crawl Boyin' Picnic.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.480
Up to this point, Malcolm's intelligence has largely just been an abstract IQ score,

11:27.480 --> 11:31.760
but the climax of this episode shows us what his brain is truly capable of.

11:31.760 --> 11:57.120
And, much to Malcolm's relief, he finds out his family, while shocked, isn't about

11:57.120 --> 12:09.600
to treat him like a completely different person.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.040
One interesting distinction here is that Malcolm isn't entirely alone.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.240
Throughout this episode, the Crawl Boyins are constantly fawning over him.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.960
He's the smartest kid in class, and they're all deeply impressed, and it's heavily implied

12:19.960 --> 12:23.720
in the series that these nerds being bullied in the present are destined for great things

12:23.720 --> 12:25.000
in the future.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.480
Malcolm is literally being welcomed into a new class of people, and he's afraid of

12:28.480 --> 12:33.240
losing his place in the world he would have to leave behind, represented by his family.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.160
Malcolm's family is not rich.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.460
Far from it, in fact.

12:36.460 --> 12:40.640
One of the running themes of the series is just how little money they have for anything.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.600
Malcolm shares a room with his two brothers, both parents work dead-end jobs, and their

12:44.600 --> 12:47.400
house is in a constant state of disrepair.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.160
The outside world is a cruel place for the family, and while they may torment one another,

12:51.160 --> 12:53.280
they also protect each other as well.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.500
Malcolm's fear of losing that connection and being swept up into that new world is

12:56.500 --> 12:58.880
another reason his family is so important to him.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.240
He's seen enough of the world to know that even if he has an edge, he's just a few

13:02.240 --> 13:05.600
mistakes back into that same rut his family ended up in.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.840
While the Crawl Boyins are convinced the world will get better for them in the future, Malcolm

13:08.840 --> 13:11.200
is well aware that it isn't good for them in the present.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.680
The laws of the playground don't favor the smart, they favor the strong.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.000
The Crawl Boyin kids are constantly bullied.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.460
While Malcolm's family can make him feel like he's been cursed, it's all he really

13:20.460 --> 13:21.460
has to hold onto.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.160
There's no winning for Malcolm.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.320
He can only lose the least amount possible, and in this case, it's about not losing

13:27.320 --> 13:28.400
his family.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.880
The dynamic between Hal and Lois is interesting insofar that you have this very strong mother

13:32.880 --> 13:36.720
figure taking charge of the family, and a father figure who is a bit more fearful and

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
timid.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.640
Not afraid of his wife, of course, but more the world around him.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.120
This unique dynamic invites a conversation about gender roles on the show.

13:45.120 --> 13:50.260
Men in this series are generally presented as uncivilized brutes, only tamed by the presence

13:50.260 --> 13:51.260
of women.

13:51.260 --> 13:55.420
For a season, we can see two examples, with Reese going from schoolyard bully to queried

13:55.420 --> 13:57.460
mess when dealing with a crush.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.380
Eventually, Hal sits him down, along with the other boys, for a talk.

14:21.260 --> 14:36.580
The idea of this destructive behavior being genetic is a bit worrying, and we actually

14:36.580 --> 14:40.820
see it challenged in the episode where Reese, instead of acting like a maniac, takes an

14:40.820 --> 14:44.180
interest in his crush's cheerleading and then trying to talk to her.

14:51.260 --> 15:07.940
The pyramid, a symbol of ancient civilization, is a fitting metaphor for gender roles.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.860
As Reese and Wendy decide to connect in a meaningful way, instead of the more primal

15:11.860 --> 15:17.380
fashion described by Hal, it risks the very pillars that hold this social order together.

15:17.380 --> 15:21.580
Even if society is brought down around them, the bond between two people survives.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.820
And isn't that more meaningful than some dumb pyramid?

15:23.820 --> 15:28.740
We can see the impact of Lois and Hal in the episode, The Bots and the Bees, where Lois's

15:28.740 --> 15:32.820
departure causes Hal to regress into the person he was before he met her.

15:32.820 --> 15:37.700
Hal is a dangerous rebel, untamed and wild, so long as Lois isn't around.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.220
Hal and Reese are interesting to contrast in these two episodes.

15:41.220 --> 15:45.240
The show presents rebellious behavior as a method of attracting women and as a product

15:45.240 --> 15:46.780
of being outside their influence.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.140
It's an outward sign that a man needs a woman to civilize him.

15:50.140 --> 15:55.420
In one generation, we see this script followed unthinkingly, and in another, it's contradicted.

15:55.420 --> 15:59.380
Reese ends up with a potential to love interest, and Hal ends up covered in bees.

15:59.380 --> 16:03.700
It's the difference between critically examining yourself and internalizing what you think

16:03.700 --> 16:09.060
society is telling you a man should be, reducing it to some kind of biological imperative.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.420
Season 1 ended with the episode, Water Park, part 1.

16:12.420 --> 16:16.380
The plot lines here are mostly concluded at the end of the episode, with the exception

16:16.380 --> 16:21.740
of Dewey, who had been left all at home with a babysitter who dies by the end of the episode,

16:21.740 --> 16:28.640
leaving Dewey completely unattended.

16:28.640 --> 16:33.520
The season 2 opener, Traffic Jam, part 2, has the family stuck in traffic while trying

16:33.520 --> 16:35.880
to return home from the water park.

16:35.880 --> 16:40.000
While technically a continuation of the previous episode, the plot lines are all new, with

16:40.000 --> 16:43.960
every member of the family and their own storyline, the Dewey plot line carried over from last

16:43.960 --> 16:47.360
season is resolved when he's finally brought home by some bikers.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.720
But the one plot line from this episode I want to highlight is how Lois tries to resolve

16:50.720 --> 16:54.320
the Traffic Jam through sheer force of will.

16:54.320 --> 17:07.340
Lois, who is such a dominant force throughout the first season, is starting to show the

17:07.340 --> 17:08.880
limits of her power.

17:08.880 --> 17:33.120
Can this notice it again this season in the episode, Traffic Ticket?

17:33.120 --> 18:02.200
The

18:02.200 --> 18:06.180
contrast between Lois being the voice of authority and her using that voice to stand up to a

18:06.180 --> 18:10.220
greater authority reveals that at the heart of the character, Lois believes in a higher

18:10.220 --> 18:12.100
form of morality.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.900
There's a theory of moral development created by American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg

18:15.900 --> 18:19.980
that describes how we grow as moral beings, moving from understanding morals as rules

18:19.980 --> 18:24.300
we use to achieve certain outcomes to applying a system of universal ethics.

18:24.300 --> 18:29.100
Lois operates at the post-conventional level, certain of her morals and bucking at the system

18:29.100 --> 18:30.780
when it won't let her express them.

18:30.780 --> 18:34.760
And when Lois is disciplining her children, she's trying to move them up that ladder.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.400
In later seasons, we'd see examples of Lois' bending to the rules, but this is typically

18:38.400 --> 18:42.400
a product of her needing something from the system, like keeping her job.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.060
Although Lois is trying to instill a higher order of morality in her kids, she's also

18:46.060 --> 18:51.080
capable of realizing that a system requires some degree of conformity for survival.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.520
Going back to Howe's response to Lois about the world working against the family, this

18:54.520 --> 18:58.900
is brought into sharp focus throughout the series, and this season has some great examples.

18:58.900 --> 19:03.340
In the episode, New Neighbors, we find out the family has had a less-than-positive relationship

19:03.340 --> 19:05.700
with most of the other families on their street.

19:05.700 --> 19:15.300
Families keep moving in and out of that house, I wonder why?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.720
The neighbors here represent the world at large.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.660
One important part of this episode is how it shows just what brings the family together,

19:21.660 --> 19:24.140
an outside threat, like new neighbors.

19:24.140 --> 19:28.540
I think the word everyone is tiptoeing around is feud.

19:29.540 --> 19:42.100
Some of the better episodes intersect their various plotlines using this very principle.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.300
The ending to Lois' birthday uses a similar conclusion, where the family bands together

19:46.300 --> 19:48.420
to fight off a group of clowns.

19:48.420 --> 19:52.140
The show never explains why so many clowns are hanging out at the batting cages, unless

19:52.140 --> 19:56.000
that one birthday party had four clowns, which seems excessive to me.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.880
The economics of hiring clowns aside, the family's ability to hold together against

19:59.880 --> 20:02.760
outside threats is a frequent theme throughout the series.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.520
It echoes other sitcoms featuring working-class families, where an external conflict, symbolizing

20:07.520 --> 20:12.600
the hostility of the outside world, requires the family to band together as a single unit.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.720
Season 2 also introduced a few memorable supporting cast members, including Cynthia, played by

20:16.720 --> 20:20.240
Tanya Raymond, a girl in Malcolm's gifted class he has a crush on.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.560
Although not the first or last girl Malcolm would explore his feelings for, Cynthia is

20:23.560 --> 20:39.160
probably the most memorable.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.240
Sadly Cynthia would only hang around until Season 4, and was replaced before then by

20:43.240 --> 20:46.480
a rotation of increasingly forgettable love interests.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.880
And Season 2 introduced us to another special talent held by one of the boys, Reese, who

20:50.880 --> 21:14.080
is a gifted chef.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.240
But Season 2's most celebrated episode, by far, is bowling.

21:18.240 --> 21:23.120
The episode uses the premise of either Hal or Lois taking the boys out bowling, and displaying

21:23.120 --> 21:27.440
two stories in parallel that represent the different timelines created depending on which

21:27.440 --> 21:29.720
parent takes the boys out on that trip.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.640
While the respective stories offer a few interesting twists and turns, it's the novelty of how

21:33.640 --> 21:37.640
they're presented that really sets this episode apart, using creative editing techniques

21:37.640 --> 21:39.780
to highlight each timeline transition.

21:39.780 --> 21:43.880
The fortunes of the characters vary, and the episode contrasts Hal's loose parenting

21:43.880 --> 21:48.160
style with Lois' stricter style to create happy endings for different boys.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.280
A good night out is a roll of the dice, and neither parent is necessarily better than

21:52.280 --> 21:55.920
the other, but each one has their own strengths and weaknesses.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.480
Highly praised at the time, it won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing and Writing

22:00.480 --> 22:04.480
for a Comedy Series for Todd Holland and Alex Reed, respectively.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.560
To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle for me to find much to say about this episode

22:08.560 --> 22:09.760
outside of its style.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.760
The randomness of parenting and the largely forgettable nature of both storylines makes

22:13.760 --> 22:18.440
me think a lot of the acclaim this episode got was for its technical achievement.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.200
Episodes like this make me feel as though Malcolm in the Middle's more interesting

22:21.200 --> 22:23.400
aspects were overshadowed by its style.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.060
The better episodes did have some interesting commentary in them, but the show was so unique

22:27.060 --> 22:31.560
in its presentation at the time that it garnered most of the critical attention.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.960
The last episode I want to highlight from this season is Flashback, where we see how

22:34.960 --> 23:01.920
Parenthood ruined the family's fortunes through a series of flashbacks.

23:01.920 --> 23:26.640
The episode ends with Hell and Lois reminding each other of why they're in love.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.420
This is such a sweet episode.

23:28.420 --> 23:32.280
Love holds the family together in the face of their increasingly dire circumstances.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.100
The episode is an inversion of the threats highlighted in the episodes like New Neighbors.

23:36.100 --> 23:40.300
This shows how families create disruptions in their own lives, but unlike the hostile

23:40.300 --> 23:44.380
world, a family can offer the very real reward of comfort and love.

23:44.380 --> 23:48.060
Even when the world is literally raining on you and the only dry space is a house with

23:48.060 --> 23:52.260
three screaming boys, it's not so bad when you know there's some love in there too.

23:52.260 --> 23:56.020
Part of why I think this show struck a chord with so many people is because of that.

23:56.020 --> 24:00.660
Most people's families are messy and complicated, but there's still a core of love in there.

24:00.660 --> 24:08.340
This was a sitcom that dared to show an unvarnished version of that love.

24:08.340 --> 24:12.300
Unlike the other boys in his family, Francis' plotlines are typically far removed from the

24:12.300 --> 24:14.060
other characters in the household.

24:14.060 --> 24:18.380
Starting the series off in a military economy, his plotlines contain their own unique supporting

24:18.380 --> 24:23.580
cast where Francis and his buddies are constantly at odds with the demanding common-dense Spangler,

24:23.580 --> 24:25.980
played by Daniel van Bergen.

24:25.980 --> 24:30.780
Season 3 completely changes Francis' circumstances as he emancipates himself, letting him leave

24:30.780 --> 24:35.940
the military academy, and heads to Alaska for promises of riches with his friend Eric

24:35.940 --> 24:37.780
Hansen, played by Eric Neninger.

24:37.780 --> 24:42.340
Francis' stories in the first two seasons center around rebellion against authority,

24:42.340 --> 24:43.900
and the third is no exception.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.820
When he travels to Alaska in season 3, he finds himself working a rough job under the

24:47.820 --> 25:04.180
auspice of the hot-tempered Lavernia, played by Brenda Well.

25:04.180 --> 25:08.060
Season 3 also meant the introduction of the most prominent member of Francis' supporting

25:08.060 --> 25:11.540
cast, Piyama, played by Emmy Coligado.

25:11.540 --> 25:16.180
Piyama introduces a shift in Francis towards more responsible behavior, eventually leading

25:16.180 --> 25:20.100
him to work as a ranch hand in season 4, though he never quite gets it together in

25:20.100 --> 25:22.740
a way suggested by her early appearances.

25:22.740 --> 25:27.500
And while I think it's neat that the show included an indigenous character of an unspecified

25:27.500 --> 25:32.220
tribe, and Coligado does do a great job in her performance, it's a little awkward seeing

25:32.220 --> 25:37.880
an indigenous character portrayed by someone whose background is Filipino, which is literally

25:37.880 --> 25:40.100
on the other side of the world.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.580
Francis as a character is a symbol of unfocused rebellion.

25:42.580 --> 25:46.980
While it might be tempting to write him off as a bad seed, Francis demonstrates kindness

25:46.980 --> 25:50.700
and intelligence throughout the series, though it never manifests itself in the special ways

25:50.700 --> 25:52.220
we see in his brothers.

25:52.220 --> 25:57.060
Reese has his cooking, Malcolm is a genius, and Dewey eventually blossoms into a musician,

25:57.060 --> 25:59.620
but Francis never gets any special skills.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.420
As we only see him in his futile struggles against a military school trying to shape

26:03.420 --> 26:07.500
him and a low-paying job exploiting him, this is a commentary on how the world punishes

26:07.500 --> 26:08.500
rebellion.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.060
With his brothers as a comparison, it appears though the family space is the one that affords

26:12.060 --> 26:16.700
the chance to explore possibilities and push limits in a safe way, and one thing all the

26:16.700 --> 26:20.900
boys in this family do is consistently push the limits through their acts of rebellion

26:20.900 --> 26:22.420
against authority.

26:22.420 --> 26:26.620
After his family sent him to military school, Francis was more or less at the mercy of the

26:26.620 --> 26:30.820
system, and this show demonstrates that the system does not care about him at all.

26:30.820 --> 26:34.300
He can either become a military drone or work a dead-end job in misery.

26:34.300 --> 26:38.460
The closest we see to Francis living a happy life is in season 4, with the boss who treats

26:38.460 --> 26:42.860
him with kindness and respect, though in this case it's an outsider to that system,

26:42.860 --> 26:45.900
Otto Mankuser, played by Kenneth Mars.

26:45.900 --> 26:49.420
Eventually Francis drops the ball there too, perhaps it was just too late for him to learn

26:49.420 --> 26:53.340
how to function in society, or perhaps more accurately, Christopher Masterson would have

26:53.340 --> 26:56.860
less of an on-screen presence on the show in later seasons.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.980
Either way, his character remains an indictment of a system that abandons those who buck up

27:00.980 --> 27:02.020
against it.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.700
One moment I want to highlight in season 3 is the synthesis of some of the ideas presented

27:05.700 --> 27:06.940
in earlier seasons.

27:06.940 --> 27:10.860
In Los' makeover, when the boys play against Hal in a game of basketball, they come into

27:10.860 --> 27:15.300
one of the few domains where Hal feels comfortable being a domineering patriarch.

27:15.300 --> 27:29.860
The boys bend together to fight back.

27:29.860 --> 27:40.860
But Hal then starts to play dirty.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.860
Eventually they play a final game where the boys unveil their secret weapon.

27:44.860 --> 27:47.580
The boys take down the system by punching it in the balls.

27:47.580 --> 27:51.260
It's a nice little story about how the rules are stacked against the younger generation

27:51.260 --> 27:54.020
until they bound together to hit it where it hurts.

27:54.020 --> 27:58.100
So simple and so effective, this little moment I think embodies so much of what this series

27:58.100 --> 27:59.100
is.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.860
And in Mayan Pagan, this is where the series peaks, with its strongest message about uniting

28:02.860 --> 28:07.900
together against an unjust authority.

28:07.900 --> 28:12.820
It isn't pretty, but it's a response in kind, and one Hal certainly won't be forgetting.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.780
Hal is the past and the boys are the future.

28:15.780 --> 28:18.780
One they'll be making more just by working together.

28:18.780 --> 28:23.300
There was still much more Malcolm in the middle to go, and season 3 had a major one-hour special

28:23.300 --> 28:27.780
that included a number of guest stars, including Terry Bradshaw, Heidi Klum, Tom Green, Howie

28:27.780 --> 28:32.140
Long, Christina Ricci, Magic Johnson, Bradley Whitford, who was married to Jane Kaczmarek

28:32.140 --> 28:37.060
at the time, and Susan Sarandon, who was nominated for an Emmy in this appearance in the episode

28:37.060 --> 28:39.060
Company Picnic.

28:39.060 --> 28:43.940
While ratings for season 3 were strong, and Company Picnic in particular was a great performer,

28:43.940 --> 28:46.180
the gentle decline was starting to show.

28:46.180 --> 28:49.620
The series still had some important things to say, and would of course return to some

28:49.620 --> 28:51.300
of its earlier themes as well.

28:51.300 --> 29:00.420
Much of the impact it had made in its debut was starting to wear off.

29:00.420 --> 29:04.420
As the series progressed, Malcolm's stories tended to be less about his krull-boying friends

29:04.420 --> 29:06.340
and more about his dating life.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.780
He had numerous love interests over the years, like the blonde one, the other blonde one,

29:10.780 --> 29:12.180
and another blonde-haired girl.

29:12.180 --> 29:17.000
These stories tended to downplay his intelligence, revealing that being a genius can come hand-in-hand

29:17.000 --> 29:20.220
with being ignorant of how to act around a girl you have a crush on.

29:20.220 --> 29:24.020
In the episode Stupid Girl, we see Malcolm actively hide his intelligence to attract

29:24.020 --> 29:43.660
a girl named Allison, played by Brittany Finnimore.

29:43.660 --> 29:47.340
More importantly than his love interests, Malcolm's relationship with his mother is

29:47.340 --> 29:51.920
afforded the rare opportunity to grow when she traps him for a special talk about dating.

30:18.200 --> 30:21.120
Malcolm's conversation with Lois was really great.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.800
It shows us a parent-child connection that's rarely seen on sitcoms and presents it as

30:24.800 --> 30:26.760
something healthy and productive.

30:26.760 --> 30:30.360
Growing up involves seeing your parents as adults and learning from all their experiences.

30:30.360 --> 30:34.720
It's hard to imagine Lois having this conversation with Reese, so maybe it's not a perfect fit

30:34.720 --> 30:39.160
for every kid, but it's a nice contrast to seeing the boys at odds with their parents.

30:39.160 --> 30:43.280
Sadly, this wasn't followed up in any meaningful way throughout the series, which is an example

30:43.280 --> 30:47.960
I think of how the show was capable of producing great episodes, but couldn't change its dynamic

30:47.960 --> 30:51.100
enough in a meaningful way to capitalize on them.

30:51.100 --> 30:55.320
Another example of some of the limitations of the show appeared in the episode, if boys

30:55.320 --> 30:59.460
were girls were Lois fantasizes what her life would have been like if she had had daughters

30:59.460 --> 31:00.660
instead of sons.

31:13.280 --> 31:23.520
Reese has become Renee, Mimi Paley, Malcolm is Mallory, Lisa Foyles, and Dewey is Daisy,

31:23.520 --> 31:24.520
Jeanette McCurdy.

31:24.520 --> 31:41.840
Lois's fantasy eventually makes a turn for the realistic.

31:41.860 --> 31:45.940
The episode ends with Lois still wanting a girl, so the conclusion is satisfying enough

31:45.940 --> 31:49.740
as it shows parental love accepts the good with the bad, but a sign of the show losing

31:49.740 --> 31:54.160
some of its edge was watching the girls deliver the message of the episode so bluntly.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.620
Having the moral of the story delivered in such a ham-fisted way is a lot less clever

31:57.620 --> 31:59.680
than those earlier episodes.

31:59.680 --> 32:03.700
One interesting bit of trivia about this episode is that the story credit went to Alexandra

32:03.700 --> 32:08.380
Kaczynski, the 11-year-old niece of the show's costume designer Heidi Kaczynski.

32:08.380 --> 32:12.940
I wish they had done a better job of bringing this 11-year-old visionaries idea to life.

32:12.940 --> 32:17.280
One new idea introduced in season 4 that the series actually built upon was Dewey's special

32:17.280 --> 32:28.680
talent, being a musical prodigy.

32:28.680 --> 32:48.400
And we find out that Hal was a YouTuber before YouTube was even a thing.

32:48.400 --> 32:53.280
But the most important change for the series was, undoubtedly, the birth of Jamie.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.760
Early in this season, we found out Lois was pregnant, much like Jane Kaczmarek was at

32:56.760 --> 32:57.760
the time.

32:57.760 --> 33:01.400
Kaczmarek would miss several episodes because of her pregnancy, although we would see her

33:01.400 --> 33:03.640
getting increasingly pregnant on camera as well.

33:03.640 --> 33:27.880
This pregnancy came to the explosive finish in the two-parter titled, Baby.

33:27.880 --> 33:50.600
The baby is named Jamie.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.200
And while initially there is some mystery around the baby's gender, Jamie is eventually

33:54.200 --> 33:57.020
revealed to be a boy at the beginning of season 5.

33:57.020 --> 34:00.420
The new child undoubtedly means new hardships for the family, and perhaps that's why

34:00.420 --> 34:04.500
the season ended not with the baby being born, but instead an episode trying to find Jamie

34:04.500 --> 34:07.340
Daycare in an episode appropriately titled, Daycare.

34:07.340 --> 34:16.060
In need of some assistance, the family turns to the church.

34:16.060 --> 34:19.940
The completely non-religious family has suddenly become inspired by the word of God.

34:19.940 --> 34:24.160
It's a simple dramatization of how religion can sometimes be less a product of spiritual

34:24.160 --> 34:27.960
discovery and more a necessity for people who need community connections to make ends

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
meet.

34:28.960 --> 34:55.800
It also introduces an interesting moment where Lois realizes something about Jamie.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.440
In an episode where we see the family reject religion, we also see a mother who doesn't

34:59.440 --> 35:02.480
instantly turn into a maternal force upon meeting her baby.

35:02.480 --> 35:06.760
That's a couple of very big conventions this episode turns on their head, a rarity compared

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
to sitcom's past.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.600
One of the great strengths of this show is that it takes very common ideas that might

35:11.600 --> 35:15.600
pop into people's minds, like not loving your child as much as you think you should

35:15.600 --> 35:19.520
or not being religious when it's expected of you, and presents these thoughts as things

35:19.520 --> 35:22.600
not to be ashamed of, but instead to be addressed.

35:22.600 --> 35:27.360
But living up to some unrealistic sitcom perfection is not only okay, but more realistic

35:27.360 --> 35:32.560
than the more commonly depicted happy family on the quiet street with the picket fence.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.920
This was a huge part of the appeal of Malcolm in the Middle, it portrayed a family that

35:35.920 --> 35:40.160
not only behaved in ways that felt more real, it also included characters with psychology

35:40.160 --> 35:41.720
that felt more real as well.

35:41.720 --> 35:45.360
The birth of Jamie is often described as the point where the show began its decline in

35:45.360 --> 35:49.400
quality, and while I'd personally say it happened a bit earlier, a decline in quality

35:49.400 --> 35:52.100
doesn't necessarily mean the show has gotten bad.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.380
One later season still had a few interesting things to say.

35:55.380 --> 36:01.220
My parents tell me this is going to be a very special Thanksgiving.

36:01.220 --> 36:04.500
In season 5, Malcolm finally gets a job.

36:04.500 --> 36:08.100
Even though he's still in high school, he's drafted into an entry-level position at The

36:08.100 --> 36:11.280
Lucky Aid, which is the same drugstore Lois works at.

36:11.280 --> 36:15.340
Work is presented as boring and lacking in challenge, what's even more depressing is

36:15.340 --> 36:19.780
that by working alongside his mother, Malcolm is getting a glimpse into his possible future.

36:19.780 --> 36:24.020
We're proud of our 95% employee retention rate.

36:24.020 --> 36:29.300
You may think you're just starting a job, but when you join the Lucky Aid family, you're

36:29.300 --> 36:31.980
here for life.

36:31.980 --> 36:34.660
He also sees a side of Lois that he hadn't before.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.060
One minute you're telling me I'm doing a great job, and the next minute you're writing

36:37.060 --> 36:38.060
me up.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.060
You broke the rules, Malcolm.

36:39.060 --> 36:42.140
Come on, that box-planting area is a stupid rule.

36:42.140 --> 36:43.140
You know I'm right.

36:43.140 --> 36:47.460
Albert is a grade 5 employee, he has put in 20 years of service time.

36:47.460 --> 36:50.980
Sometimes that's more important than what's right or wrong.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.740
Who are you?

36:52.740 --> 36:56.660
Lois manages to convince Malcolm not to share her secret, but when the favor needs to be

36:56.660 --> 36:59.700
returned, Lois stitches Malcolm right up.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.900
It's not what it looks like.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.380
Lois, are you in there?

37:03.380 --> 37:04.380
I'll explain later.

37:04.380 --> 37:08.540
I know exactly what this looks like to you, but I'm asking you for a little flexibility.

37:08.540 --> 37:09.540
Trust me.

37:09.540 --> 37:12.060
Lois, where's the- what's going on here?

37:12.060 --> 37:14.980
Well, I'll have to write Malcolm up again.

37:14.980 --> 37:18.340
He's flattened another box outside of the box-flattening area.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.340
And he has no recourse.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.660
You're growing up.

37:21.660 --> 37:23.180
You're sick of living under my authority.

37:23.180 --> 37:24.580
You want me to cut you some slack?

37:24.580 --> 37:27.700
You're wondering when I'll finally see you as an adult.

37:27.700 --> 37:31.140
Well, that's never going to happen.

37:31.140 --> 37:33.780
That's just not the way it works.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.980
You can move away from home, you can get married, you can have kids of your own.

37:36.980 --> 37:40.100
You can even become a professor of physics at MIT.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.860
I will always be your mother.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.740
And that's just the way it is until one of us dies.

37:45.740 --> 37:50.300
After all this time, seeing Lois go from strict but ultimately just to becoming another tool

37:50.300 --> 37:52.340
of the system is disappointing.

37:52.340 --> 37:56.060
This is probably the saddest lesson learned in the series, that the world that's so unfair

37:56.060 --> 37:58.600
to Malcolm can also include his parents.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.620
They have to live under the same system that imposes their rules on him, and in many ways

38:02.620 --> 38:07.980
this is another example of Malcolm seeing his parents as adults, as he enters adulthood

38:07.980 --> 38:09.100
himself.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.180
Work is often the tool used to keep Malcolm and his family in their place.

38:12.180 --> 38:16.060
The only reason Malcolm has to take this job is because Hal is the victim of a corporate

38:16.060 --> 38:19.720
shake-up that he doesn't completely understand, and money is tied in the family.

38:19.720 --> 38:24.260
Work is consistently shown as a means of being exploited by someone somewhere.

38:24.260 --> 38:28.940
Way back in season one, in the episode, Malcolm Babysits, Malcolm gets his first ever taste

38:28.940 --> 38:32.700
of employment working as a babysitter, only to find out that the generous couple had been

38:32.700 --> 38:34.740
secretly recording him the whole time.

38:34.740 --> 38:38.180
A few lines from Lois and Hal in this episode make the point especially clear.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.900
I don't even know what they're going to pay me.

38:39.900 --> 38:40.900
I'll tell you what they're going to pay you.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.060
They're going to pay you what all jobs pay.

38:43.060 --> 38:45.700
Less than your worth, and just enough to keep your crawling back for more.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.100
So how's the job going?

38:47.100 --> 38:49.020
They were jerks, so I quit.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.380
Well, that's pretty much what work is.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.020
Welcome to the club.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.180
And in season two, we see what Hal's life would have been like outside of work, where

38:56.180 --> 38:58.820
he dedicates his time to creating a painting.

38:58.820 --> 39:02.700
Hal goes on a rollercoaster becoming a more effective parent, to becoming an obsessive

39:02.700 --> 39:05.980
painter, to finally creating something truly beautiful.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.460
I did it.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.860
I really did it.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.860
What's that sound?

39:13.860 --> 39:17.780
I don't know.

39:17.780 --> 39:18.780
It sounds like...

39:18.780 --> 39:19.780
Look out!

39:19.780 --> 39:20.780
Paint the lairs!

39:20.780 --> 39:21.780
Help!

39:21.780 --> 39:30.140
The family could never have anything good, and the world seems to constantly be working

39:30.140 --> 39:31.140
against it.

39:31.140 --> 39:32.820
Why do we root for these losers?

39:32.820 --> 39:33.860
Because they never give up?

39:33.860 --> 39:35.140
Is that what life is?

39:35.140 --> 39:37.220
Getting knocked down over and over again?

39:37.220 --> 39:38.540
Always getting up?

39:38.540 --> 39:39.540
Until you die?

39:39.540 --> 39:43.660
That piece of art that immediately self-destructs is a good metaphor from that case.

39:43.660 --> 39:47.740
The only options Hal has now is to pick up the brush again, or forget it and go back

39:47.740 --> 39:48.860
to work.

39:48.860 --> 39:52.300
And who can't relate to putting your dreams on hold because you have to go up there and

39:52.300 --> 39:53.300
make a living?

39:53.300 --> 39:56.420
It makes Hal want to stand up and do something about it.

39:56.420 --> 39:59.980
Although I really only mentioned this episode because it included one other moment I've

39:59.980 --> 40:00.980
had to highlight.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.980
I've had this cute lab partner in science for eight weeks now.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.920
Her name is Cheryl.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.540
I finally left Cheryl no on her desk asking her out.

40:08.540 --> 40:14.380
And when she read it, she turned to me and said, do you know who Reese is?

40:14.380 --> 40:17.760
So then she goes, does anybody know who Reese is?

40:17.760 --> 40:20.260
And everybody shrugged.

40:20.260 --> 40:23.420
So then I said, probably some nobody.

40:23.420 --> 40:26.140
And you know what?

40:26.140 --> 40:27.140
I was right.

40:27.380 --> 40:31.740
Okay, now that I've brought the mood down, let's talk about Reese.

40:31.740 --> 40:35.460
Although often presented as a dumb force of destruction, he's probably the most tragic

40:35.460 --> 40:37.100
character in the principal cast.

40:57.140 --> 41:00.940
Then I worked on my triceps.

41:00.940 --> 41:03.340
I want to break up.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.340
Oh.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.340
Yeah.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.340
Yeah.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.340
That's okay.

41:09.340 --> 41:10.340
Yeah, it's fine.

41:10.340 --> 41:11.340
No.

41:11.340 --> 41:17.020
I was just kidding anyway about, yeah, no biggie.

41:17.020 --> 41:20.780
Look, Reese, it's not you.

41:20.780 --> 41:21.780
It's me.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.500
I just think I can do better.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.940
Reese is a very tough character to like.

41:25.940 --> 41:29.520
He's a bully and completely heartless at times, but he's also capable of showing

41:29.520 --> 41:33.700
some genuine concern for others, at least when it comes to his family.

41:33.700 --> 41:38.260
I'll say grace.

41:38.260 --> 41:41.780
Thank you Lord for giving me the talent to express my love for my family and the only

41:41.780 --> 41:43.060
way I know how.

41:43.060 --> 41:44.060
Amen.

41:44.060 --> 41:48.420
In Reese's apartment, we see a great example of what's really holding him back.

41:48.420 --> 41:50.220
He's just not that bright.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.860
You've been using credit cards?

41:51.860 --> 41:52.860
How much have you spent?

41:52.860 --> 41:56.180
10, 11 grand, but I'm still way under the $20,000 limit.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.420
How can you spend that much in 10 days?

41:58.420 --> 42:01.780
Well, you know, I got that new convection oven, and that made the refrigerator look

42:01.780 --> 42:02.780
kind of shabby.

42:02.780 --> 42:06.100
Plus, I had to buy new clothes every time mine got dirty, and that giant gong in the

42:06.100 --> 42:07.100
bathroom?

42:07.100 --> 42:09.660
I mean, how do you guys do it?

42:09.660 --> 42:11.620
And this is his whole character in a nutshell.

42:11.620 --> 42:16.380
He's not that smart, and not being that smart makes an already tough world that much tougher.

42:16.380 --> 42:19.260
His options are limited, and he's left to lash out violently.

42:19.300 --> 42:24.540
That may be why this season ends with a two-parter titled, Reese Joins the Army, and Reese becomes

42:24.540 --> 42:26.140
the ideal soldier.

42:42.140 --> 42:46.300
But eventually, Reese has to turn on his brain and use his misbehaving to win the war game.

42:49.260 --> 43:15.300
It's frightening to think that what makes Reese a good soldier is that he can go from

43:15.300 --> 43:17.900
unthinking robot to malevolent troublemaker.

43:17.900 --> 43:22.140
Both are apparently crucial modes for a soldier, at least according to the show, and this

43:22.140 --> 43:25.900
season ends with Reese headed into active duty in Afghanistan.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.780
As a character, Reese seems to have the dimmest future ahead of him.

43:28.780 --> 43:33.180
His good qualities can only manifest in environments that he spent years carving out a space in,

43:33.180 --> 43:37.420
and the US military is less patient with him than Lois, ready to ship him off to Afghanistan

43:37.420 --> 43:39.100
rather than send him to his room.

43:45.300 --> 43:55.900
Season 6 resolves the Reese plotline with Lois traveling to somewhere in non-specific

43:55.900 --> 44:02.420
South Asia to bring him home.

44:02.420 --> 44:08.060
With the US government failing him, Reese's only salvation is, once again, his family.

44:08.060 --> 44:12.540
The old theme of family holding together in the face of an indifferent society returns,

44:12.540 --> 44:16.500
albeit in a very extreme and strange way that's less compelling than it was the first

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
time around.

44:17.500 --> 44:20.820
The commentary on the military could have just as easily been applied to Francis'

44:20.820 --> 44:22.620
time in the military academy.

44:22.620 --> 44:25.500
One major change was the larger role in the series for Dewey.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.980
In season 5, Dewey don't mix up at his school, Dewey is placed in the special ed class and

44:29.980 --> 44:34.340
we're introduced to a supporting cast of kids called Buseys, taking their name from

44:34.340 --> 44:37.780
actor Gary Busey, known for his eccentric behavior.

44:37.780 --> 44:42.060
This gives us a glimpse into the lives of the kids in the special education class.

44:42.580 --> 44:46.740
While a premise like this could have taken a very bad turn, the show instead reveals

44:46.740 --> 44:51.380
how placing these children in classes that have given up on them only makes things worse,

44:51.380 --> 44:55.780
and the differences displayed between the special needs and gifted classes are so stark

44:55.780 --> 45:00.300
that I can't help but read a very real commentary on social class differences here.

45:00.300 --> 45:04.180
All it takes is doing poorly on some tests, and then your change in class means you'll

45:04.180 --> 45:08.220
be perpetually falling behind your peers, forced to watch them excel in ways you'll

45:08.220 --> 45:09.540
never have a chance to.

45:09.540 --> 45:14.260
Much like Reese's military adventure mirrored Francis's, a change in class for Dewey and

45:14.260 --> 45:18.780
a metaphor for a change in social class mirrors Malcolm's, although there's a less promising

45:18.780 --> 45:21.160
future in Dewey's new class.

45:21.160 --> 45:25.240
Season 6 takes the special ed class premise and continues to build on it, with the Busey

45:25.240 --> 45:27.280
kids appearing in several episodes.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.540
Each of them revolve around the basic idea that they need Dewey to take care of them,

45:30.540 --> 45:33.920
whether it's an episode where they all run away to live in a tree, or an episode where

45:33.920 --> 45:38.300
Dewey arranges for them to be in an opera based on his family's internal strife.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.860
Although generally a decent depiction of kids with special needs, taking some time

45:41.860 --> 45:46.180
to portray them as having personalities and not just a walking collection of symptoms,

45:46.180 --> 45:49.140
their dependency on Dewey borders on depressing at times.

45:49.140 --> 45:53.340
In the episode, Buseys take a hostage, Dewey has neglected his friends, and without his

45:53.340 --> 46:07.700
guidance they lash out at their teacher.

46:07.700 --> 46:11.740
This episode goes a long way in explaining how these kids, left behind by the system,

46:11.740 --> 46:15.700
desperately cling to the one person who offers them the chance to have fuller lives, and

46:15.700 --> 46:20.140
the fact that this person is also a kid puts a huge strain on him, and he neglects them.

46:20.140 --> 46:24.100
It's ridiculous to imagine that a classroom full of kids should be cared for by another

46:24.100 --> 46:25.100
kid.

46:25.100 --> 46:28.020
This is a portrait of how society has failed the children who need them the most, and even

46:28.020 --> 46:37.060
worse, lets them be exploited.

46:37.060 --> 46:41.460
The episode's framing sadly obscures this point, as demonstrated by Francis' talk

46:41.460 --> 46:56.540
with Dewey, where he's told he shouldn't shirk his responsibilities.

46:56.540 --> 46:59.540
The idea that this should be on Dewey is completely backwards.

46:59.540 --> 47:03.020
The kids in the class need help, and even if Dewey can somehow get them through the

47:03.020 --> 47:05.740
year, is his life now just taking care of them?

47:06.100 --> 47:07.460
And what about kids in other grades?

47:07.460 --> 47:11.100
They would have to hope to get lucky enough to have a compassionate caretaker.

47:11.100 --> 47:14.700
Dewey is forced to sacrifice his own happiness for others, and the show's framing of this

47:14.700 --> 47:19.740
is admirable, while positive on its face, is more accurately read as a complete failure

47:19.740 --> 47:20.860
of the system.

47:20.860 --> 47:25.700
One person cannot fix a system on their own, though when one person makes a stand it can

47:25.700 --> 47:28.260
sometimes inspire a greater call to action.

47:28.260 --> 47:32.540
In the episode Billboard, the boys vandalize a giant billboard, and when caught they try

47:32.540 --> 47:58.940
to play it off as activism.

47:58.940 --> 48:17.300
As the episode progresses, Reese has a realization about women.

48:17.300 --> 48:21.860
The idea of using activism to escape blame is interesting, and it fits in with the cynicism

48:21.860 --> 48:22.860
of the show.

48:22.860 --> 48:27.380
All the power of activism affecting change, even on the people exploiting it, demonstrates

48:27.380 --> 48:28.380
its power.

48:28.380 --> 48:32.820
We are who we pretend to be, after all, and maybe even performative activism is better

48:32.820 --> 48:34.340
than doing nothing at all.

48:34.340 --> 48:39.220
In the episode Tiki Lounge, this same idea is taken a step further when Malcolm is forced

48:39.220 --> 48:43.800
into joining his school's booster club, a blisteringly positive group of teens always

48:43.800 --> 48:46.900
looking to hold special events to raise money for charity.

48:46.900 --> 48:50.500
Malcolm assumes they're just a bunch of phonies looking for an excuse to throw a party, and

48:50.500 --> 48:54.860
their unrelenting positivity is a cover for their insincerity, while running the auction

48:54.860 --> 48:57.580
he tries to expose their hypocrisy.

48:57.580 --> 49:03.220
First set him up, our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put up for auction a photograph

49:03.220 --> 49:12.380
of herself from 8th grade, with her original nose.

49:12.380 --> 49:34.220
I appreciate that the booster club really was passionate about the causes they claim

49:34.220 --> 49:36.980
to care about, even though they're not very good at raising money.

49:36.980 --> 49:41.140
It's a very kind critique of the champagne liberal stereotype.

49:41.140 --> 50:05.520
Her hearts may be in the right place, but their methods are less than ideal.

50:05.520 --> 50:09.340
A lot of the praise for a show like Malcolm in the Middle I see from people further on

50:09.340 --> 50:14.220
the left often touts its realism, and that realism, especially in earlier seasons, is

50:14.220 --> 50:17.060
often buoyed by a deep cynicism about the world.

50:17.060 --> 50:21.020
Unlike previous episodes, though, this episode was surprisingly positive in its outlook and

50:21.020 --> 50:24.820
conclusion, offering the important lesson that setting aside pride can help different

50:24.820 --> 50:27.260
groups of people achieve great things.

50:27.260 --> 50:31.660
Thinking of the modern day and the temptation of people further left to mock liberals for

50:31.660 --> 50:37.140
their hypocrisy makes this episode seem like a stark contrast to that tendency, as it offers

50:37.140 --> 50:41.460
a counterpoint that good things are possible when working on goals together with people

50:41.460 --> 50:45.900
who may be misguided in their methods, but are ultimately interested in helping other

50:45.900 --> 50:46.900
people.

50:46.900 --> 50:50.860
And it's better to set pride aside to achieve positive change rather than sneer at people

50:50.860 --> 51:01.020
who could be allies.

51:01.020 --> 51:05.580
The season 7 premiere, Burning Man, took the family on the road to experience the desert

51:05.580 --> 51:06.580
festival.

51:06.580 --> 51:10.860
It's weirdly fitting and strangely out of place at the same time, a familiar feeling

51:10.860 --> 51:12.020
in the later seasons.

51:12.020 --> 51:16.340
There's one interesting part where Hal's suburban father routine is considered an art

51:16.340 --> 51:31.580
piece.

51:31.580 --> 51:32.980
Is this show art?

51:32.980 --> 51:34.260
What even is art?

51:34.260 --> 51:35.780
Is it the depiction of the real?

51:35.780 --> 51:36.780
The unreal?

51:36.780 --> 51:39.740
Is it an emotional experience or an intellectual encounter?

51:39.740 --> 51:43.780
Hal's subplot seems to be asking these questions about the show, with a crowd viewing him

51:43.780 --> 51:48.260
as a stand-in for suburbia, offering them a window into this forbidden space.

51:48.260 --> 51:52.300
Is that, then, how we, the audience of the show, also experience it?

51:52.300 --> 51:56.900
Or do we feel kinship with Hal's perspective, seeing these eccentrics as the outsiders?

51:56.900 --> 52:01.940
We're watching them, watching him, but also, watching him, watch them.

52:01.940 --> 52:05.980
What is the act of watching someone in a space we can never enter, as our stand-in

52:05.980 --> 52:07.700
is entering it for us?

52:07.700 --> 52:12.900
We will never go to Burning Man, or rather, we will never go to the idea we have of Burning

52:12.900 --> 52:15.300
Man that this show is representing.

52:15.300 --> 52:21.300
Or maybe more accurately, the show is mocking the kind of overwrought artistic interpretation

52:21.300 --> 52:22.980
like the one I just gave.

52:22.980 --> 52:26.740
Malcolm in the Middle is a show that, when it works, feels very real.

52:26.740 --> 52:31.100
It's conveying the idea of the family struggling to survive in a world that sees them as commodities

52:31.100 --> 52:32.340
to be exploited.

52:32.340 --> 52:35.780
When they go on adventures like this one, it starts to feel less real.

52:35.780 --> 52:38.180
It's more like a hallucination out in the desert.

52:38.180 --> 52:43.300
The season 7 premiere scored a 3.5 in the ratings, which is a very far cry from its

52:43.300 --> 52:44.800
earlier seasons.

52:44.800 --> 52:49.020
On average, it was getting less than 4 million viewers per episode.

52:49.020 --> 52:55.100
In January of 2006, Fox announced that Malcolm in the Middle would be ending this season.

52:55.100 --> 52:59.220
Francis had largely exited the show by this point, only appearing in a handful of episodes,

52:59.220 --> 53:02.720
but Christopher Masterson was still a part of the series, directing an episode this season

53:02.720 --> 53:04.820
titled Hal Greaves.

53:04.820 --> 53:07.980
Masterson wasn't the only cast member to direct an episode in the series, though.

53:07.980 --> 53:12.660
Bryan Cranston directed several episodes in the series, including Malcolm Defends Reese,

53:12.660 --> 53:14.260
which also aired this season.

53:14.260 --> 53:18.820
The final season still managed to effectively hit some familiar notes, such as in Lois Strikes

53:18.820 --> 53:23.060
Back, where Lois decides to get even with some mean girls who played a cruel prank on

53:23.060 --> 53:24.060
Reese.

53:24.060 --> 53:47.060
Lois uses some brutal techniques.

53:47.060 --> 53:51.060
The idea that certain people are less deserving of justice because their troublemakers might

53:51.060 --> 53:54.340
have landed clear had Reese been less of a jerk in earlier episodes.

53:54.340 --> 53:57.660
It also doesn't help that the show kinda had the same premise for an episode a few

53:57.660 --> 54:01.660
seasons back, in which a teacher flunks Reese because he thinks he's a punk.

54:01.660 --> 54:05.460
The episode ends with Lois and Reese finally having something to bond over, the use of

54:05.460 --> 54:08.260
cruelty to satisfy their need for justice.

54:08.260 --> 54:11.000
Although Reese is probably just in it for their cruelty.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.180
As the series wound down, it brought into focus Malcolm and Reese's final year of high

54:15.180 --> 54:19.180
school, Reese having deliberately failed a grade so he could spend another year there.

54:19.180 --> 54:23.420
Well established as a social outcast, Malcolm works with some of the other school misfits

54:23.420 --> 54:26.860
to hold a morp, that's prom spelled backwards.

54:26.860 --> 54:32.180
A counterparty for the prom happening in the gym, the morp is in the basement.

54:32.180 --> 54:35.220
Malcolm's insecurity gets the better of him, and he has to confront the other kids

54:35.220 --> 54:38.860
to let them know he and his outsider friends are having a good time.

55:05.220 --> 55:10.420
And no one cares.

55:10.420 --> 55:14.020
But eventually the two parties come together, bridges are mended, and the kids decide to

55:14.020 --> 55:34.100
leave high school behind, which isn't enough for Malcolm.

55:34.100 --> 55:38.260
Things like this that seem to contrast the Malcolm we knew just a season ago, ready to

55:38.260 --> 55:41.980
join up with the boosters when he realizes their genuine desire to do good.

55:41.980 --> 55:43.900
But that's not the Malcolm we have anymore.

55:43.900 --> 55:47.540
And this represents the Malcolm we see more frequently in these later seasons where he's

55:47.540 --> 55:51.100
not quite the charming eccentric he was originally written as.

55:51.100 --> 55:59.500
And that brings us to the final episode of the series, Graduation, airing May 14th, 2006.

55:59.500 --> 56:03.060
The premise for this episode is that Malcolm's family is struggling to find a way to afford

56:03.060 --> 56:10.260
sending him to college.

56:10.260 --> 56:13.660
Linwood Boomer, the creator of the series, makes a fun cameo in this episode, playing

56:13.660 --> 56:21.460
on a loan shark Hal tries to get money from.

56:21.460 --> 56:26.300
A friend of Abe, Stevie's father, shows up to offer Malcolm a shortcut, letting him skip

56:26.300 --> 56:30.740
college and go straight into the workforce with a hefty six-figure salary.

56:30.740 --> 56:54.420
A

56:54.420 --> 56:58.500
garbage bomb set up by Reese goes off early in the car, and we get an exchange that sums

56:58.500 --> 57:08.140
up the series.

58:08.140 --> 58:17.700
I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path.

58:17.700 --> 58:21.180
You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.180
That's Dewey.

58:22.180 --> 58:23.180
Really?

58:23.180 --> 58:25.620
This is unbelievable.

58:25.620 --> 58:28.380
You actually expect me to be president.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.740
No, no, I'm sorry.

58:30.740 --> 58:35.840
You expect me to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.

58:35.840 --> 58:40.740
You look me in the eye, and you tell me you can't do it.

58:40.740 --> 58:45.720
The show wraps up with a few interesting visuals, such as this callback to the first episode.

58:45.720 --> 58:50.240
Another callback to the first episode is once again revealing the family's last name through

58:50.240 --> 58:56.320
Francis' name tag at his new office job, only now the last name we see is no last name.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.960
That name is also clearly mouthed by the speaker during graduation when Malcolm is introduced

59:00.960 --> 59:02.440
as valedictorian.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.900
And the scene closes with Malcolm delivering a nice speech about family.

59:05.900 --> 59:10.440
And the series comes to an end with an epilogue, giving us a sense of where all these characters

59:10.440 --> 59:11.440
are heading.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.040
The final line of the series is,

59:13.040 --> 59:15.000
Listen, I'm gonna get to my cab pass.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
I'll talk to you later.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.600
A huge part of what made the series work so well was the obvious chemistry between the

59:19.600 --> 59:20.840
actors on screen.

59:20.840 --> 59:24.000
It felt like a real family, and in some ways it was.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.760
Frankie Muniz spoke to that in a recent interview.

59:26.760 --> 59:30.280
It really did feel like a family, especially with us kids.

59:30.280 --> 59:33.160
We spent more time together than we did with our real families.

59:33.160 --> 59:37.240
We'd be outside playing kickball in sports, and we'd be arguing, fighting, bickering,

59:37.240 --> 59:39.640
and playing pranks on each other just like brothers would.

59:39.640 --> 59:42.280
So in that sense, you really do become like a family.

59:42.280 --> 59:45.160
While the family and Malcolm in the middle was consistently at each other's throats,

59:45.160 --> 59:48.760
they also demonstrated the love they had for one another and how protective they were against

59:48.760 --> 59:49.760
the outside world.

59:49.760 --> 59:57.800
That struck a chord for any family that knew how to band together when it counted.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.520
During the end of the series, Frankie Muniz took a handful of rules over the years, but

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.920
largely stepped away from the world of acting.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.400
Sadly Muniz has had continuing difficulties with his health, including two transient ischmetic

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.040
attacks, also known as mini-strokes, and nine concussions.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:16.000
Muniz believes this is the reason his memory has been severely compromised, to the point

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.640
where he struggles to remember his time when Malcolm in the middle.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.240
That said, he has reported memories returning to him and generally seems happy in his life.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.320
He and his wife are expecting their first child in early 2021.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.320
Although he was nominated for three Emmys for Malcolm in the Middle, Bryan Cranston's

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.560
career really took off in 2008 when he was cast as Walter White on Breaking Bad, a role

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.040
completely unlike Hal, and one which earned him four Emmys, enormous ratings, and glowing

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.980
praise as one of the most iconic roles on television.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.600
So he became a pretty big deal.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.680
Cranston has been working on high-profile projects ever since, though he clearly has

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.840
some affinity for his time on Malcolm in the Middle, going so far as to film a bonus alternate

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.400
ending to Breaking Bad, which features him waking up as Hal, realizing the Walter White

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.800
character was just a dream.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.720
The same scene included Jane Kaczmarek, who, post-Malcolm in the Middle, found her career

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:10.000
completely changed, although she hasn't been cast in a role quite as prominent as Lois

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
since her time on the show.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.720
In an interview, she spoke about struggling to get auditions and never being considered

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.240
for comedy roles at all prior to her time on Malcolm in the Middle.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.000
Since the show ended, she's had a steady stream of roles on dozens of projects.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Christopher Masterson acted in a handful of projects after Malcolm in the Middle ended,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.080
though he seems to have transitioned out of acting entirely in 2014 and now works as a

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080
DJ.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.480
One fun fact I found about the role of Francis is that Bryan Cranston's Breaking Bad co-star

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.520
Aaron Paul had auditioned for the role, though the part eventually went to Masterson.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.640
Justin Burfield moved away from acting almost immediately after Malcolm in the Middle ended

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.640
and went into working as a producer, working on several projects before eventually becoming

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.080
the Chief Creative Officer at Version Produced.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.560
Eric Purr Sullivan also stepped out of the acting world, having only appeared in four

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.800
projects after Malcolm in the Middle, the last one released in 2010.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.120
Sullivan has largely left the public eye, though a handful of photos and appearances

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.760
have emerged in recent years.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.080
Since the show's end, there has been some discussion on bringing Malcolm in the Middle

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.520
back in some capacity, some of the cast members shared their thoughts on a revival.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.600
We've talked about how fun it'd be to do a reunion show, season, or a movie, and

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.480
I don't think anything excites me more.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.560
I'd love it because I had such a great time doing the show and the whole cast was amazing.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.360
I feel like we have more story to tell, especially 20 years later.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.280
There were so many possibilities about what the family could be up to.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.040
As a fan of the show, I want to know what happened.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.720
I remember one of the final things in that final episode in 2006.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.240
Hal and I are rejoicing that we've got two kids out of the house and I come home with

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.600
a pregnancy stick and you hear us both screaming because I'm pregnant again.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.400
If that was true, we'd have a 14 year old.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.040
We'd have another Malcolm at home because when the show started, Malcolm was 14.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.200
I told Linwin this thing still resonates.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.420
I want him to pull him out of retirement and have him write a reunion movie.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:04.360
If we were to produce a Malcolm in the Middle 20 years later show, we'd absolutely contact

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.200
every single crew member to come back because that's the family.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.760
I'm going to keep working on him.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.500
I think I can convince him.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500
Like a good wine.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500
It endures.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.600
It passes the test of time.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.320
It's a classic story and series and I couldn't be prouder.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.920
It remains to be seen if anything concrete will materialize, particularly with Linwood

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.620
Boomer seemingly content with the show not coming back.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.920
But in August of 2020, there was a small reunion for many of the cast members on the show.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.160
They performed a reading of the first episode of the series over Zoom.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.780
Tickets sold to the viewing raised funds for Healing California, a charitable organization

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.280
that provides free dental, medical and vision care.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.960
A handful of photos have emerged from the event and a number of guest stars who appeared

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.700
in the series throughout the years can be spotted making cameos.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.920
Watching the series was a strange experience.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.840
At the time of its airing, I was at that young age where I could relate to the younger characters,

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.480
but now I'm not quite old enough to relate to the adults with children.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.480
Late in the series, there's a scene where Hal and a random kid are dancing on an arcade

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.900
machine that is legally distinct from a dance dance revolution machine.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.960
In this footage, I can see my past and my future.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.040
And while I could probably smoke both of these scrubs at DVR, I think the power of the series

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:18.280
is in moments like this, seemingly absurd but utterly relatable, speaking across generations.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.080
Malcolm in the Middle was a major force in popularizing the single-camera style sitcom

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.440
on network television.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.800
It helped end the age of laugh tracks, introduced more sophisticated uses of music, and let

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.980
characters travel to a number of exciting and not-so-exciting locations.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.760
But through these stylistic accomplishments, at its core was the story of a family struggling

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.280
with one another and uniting together to take on the world.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.800
The idea of life being an endless struggle is at the center of what makes this show feel

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800
real.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.640
It's relatable to anyone who feels that they live in a world where you can feel lost

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.640
in a crowd vanishing into faceless anonymity, like a middle child constantly overlooked

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.880
by their family.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.680
But even though Malcolm was the middle child, if you don't count Francis, until Jamie

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.480
is born, his family never treat him that way.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Hal and Lois love all their boys, hard as that may be sometimes, and in spite of the

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.520
rough edges of their dynamic, they're there for one another.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.240
In a recent interview, Jane Kaczmarek summed this up.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.400
People say they're such a dysfunctional family, and I would think, are you kidding

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.400
me?

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.000
They sit down for dinner together every night.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.920
Those kids don't get away with anything.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.600
This is a highly functioning family.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.560
They're mean, loud, and aggressive, but they're highly functioning.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.880
When Malcolm runs off to one day be president, he does so with the knowledge of what it means

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.880
to suffer.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.640
Instead of falling into a cynicism and despair, show leaves us with some degree of hope that

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.820
things might change and get better.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.740
But Malcolm's very existence has always been absurd.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.500
A child genius who was born in just the right circumstances to change the world around him.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.380
The solution to the struggle Malcolm's family faces is to get extremely lucky, and that's

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.020
the hope for people like them in their world, that someone like Malcolm might be born in

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.500
the right family to make things better.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.980
And then what are the odds of that happening?

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.380
It's an indictment of the world they live in.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.540
And for anyone who's struggled to get ahead in the world, sometimes it feels like the

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.940
only solution is to become extremely lucky.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:10.460
Something that, for most people, only exists in the world of fantasy.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.780
So that is Malcolm in the Middle in the books.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.140
To be honest, I had actually stopped watching Malcolm in the Middle when it was first airing

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:21.580
around season four or five-ish, so seeing those later seasons was a first for me.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.080
And for anyone curious, Malcolm in the Middle is easily the most abandoned series I've had

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.300
for one of these retrospectives, and I hope people enjoyed this.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.680
