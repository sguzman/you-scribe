00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
I didn't expect this movie about Bernie Sanders' life to have so much sex stuff.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.880
In December of 2020, the world was given a satirical movie about the life of Bernie

00:16.880 --> 00:21.840
Sanders titled Free Lunch Express. It follows Sanders from his early days,

00:21.840 --> 00:26.560
starting with his blood pact with Joseph Stalin to his more recent years where he was

00:26.560 --> 00:30.720
nearly murdered by Hillary Clinton. Most movies about the lives of politicians don't have a lot

00:30.720 --> 00:35.360
of laughs in them, and Free Lunch Express is no exception. Unlike a serious drama such as

00:35.360 --> 00:40.320
Spielberg's Lincoln, this movie about the life of Bernie Sanders was supposed to be a comedy.

00:40.320 --> 00:45.120
According to its writer-producer-director Lenny Britton, its mission first and foremost

00:45.120 --> 00:47.920
was to be funny. Here's how the movie does a joke.

00:56.560 --> 01:04.640
It's only going to get worse from here.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.040
The relationship a biopic has to historical facts tells us a lot about what the filmmaker's

01:09.040 --> 01:14.320
concerns are. Most politicians have very rich, complex lives, and the details a filmmaker decides

01:14.320 --> 01:19.360
to focus on reveals what part of their lives we as an audience are being told are most relevant to

01:19.360 --> 01:23.760
whatever point the movie is trying to make. A satire is obviously going to take some liberties

01:23.760 --> 01:27.840
with the subject's history for the purposes of humor. I'm sure no one watching this movie is

01:27.840 --> 01:31.920
going to think that the whole blood pact thing with Stalin actually happened, nor would anyone

01:31.920 --> 01:36.400
assume Bernie Sanders is actually having these Jojo Rabbit-esque moments where he talks to

01:36.400 --> 01:42.960
an imaginary Stalin. This stuff is all fine. Well, not fine. It's completely devoid of humor,

01:42.960 --> 01:47.680
but conceptually I can understand this attempt at humor being in a satire movie. It still makes

01:47.680 --> 01:52.400
sense. The interesting parts of this movie start cropping up from the supposed facts that inform

01:52.400 --> 01:58.480
some of these satirical twists, the true events that one would need to make a biopic. These changes

01:58.480 --> 02:02.960
to Bernie Sanders' life seem less like an attempted humor and more like a misunderstanding

02:02.960 --> 02:06.240
of the basic facts of his life. Here's one example. In the movie,

02:06.240 --> 02:09.360
Sanders goes to Moscow with his first wife for their honeymoon.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.480
We're going to Moscow on a honeymoon. Oh, Moscow? Really? You sure you don't want to just go to

02:14.480 --> 02:22.480
Youngstown? Youngstown? Ugh. Seeing Moscow has always been my lifelong dream.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.720
The right-wing character of Bernie Sanders is that he's such a committed communist that he went to

02:26.720 --> 02:31.680
Moscow for his honeymoon. This isn't the joke. This is the setup for the joke. And if Bernie

02:31.680 --> 02:36.080
Sanders' life is supposed to be setting up this comedy, it makes some glaring mistakes with the

02:36.080 --> 02:41.200
facts here. Let's go over some of the problems. First off, Sanders and his first wife, Deborah

02:41.200 --> 02:45.920
Schilling, never went to Moscow. They were married in the 1960s and the only traveling they

02:45.920 --> 02:50.720
did I could find was a trip to Israel to work on a kibbutz, which was before they married.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.600
They were only married for a few years, divorcing in the 1960s. The next problem is Bernie's trip

02:55.600 --> 03:00.320
to Moscow happened in the 1980s. And even though it did happen the day after a second marriage to

03:00.320 --> 03:04.720
Jane O'Meara, it wasn't a honeymoon, but actually a part of his official business as mayor of

03:04.720 --> 03:10.320
Burlington, Vermont. And I should also mention that Sanders' second marriage is depicted in this movie

03:10.320 --> 03:17.440
after he becomes senator in 2007, when in reality it was in 1988. That's a lot of stuff to get wrong.

03:17.440 --> 03:22.800
And all of these facts were completely butchered so we can get this scene in Moscow where Sanders'

03:22.800 --> 03:27.360
first wife is so disgusted with her honeymoon destination that she divorces him on the spot

03:27.360 --> 03:31.840
and Bernie fakes having sex with her to impress his Soviet comrades who are listening in on them.

03:31.840 --> 03:43.200
This exemplifies the movie's relationship with its subject history.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.000
The joke isn't, let's pretend Bernie went to Moscow on his honeymoon. The joke is,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.280
Bernie faked having sex on his Moscow honeymoon. You have to accept the lie in the premise to get

03:53.280 --> 03:58.000
the joke. And the joke isn't even funny, so why bother with any of this? We aren't watching a

03:58.080 --> 04:01.760
movie about the life of Bernie Sanders, we're watching a movie about a right-wing caricature

04:01.760 --> 04:07.520
of Bernie Sanders with some bad jokes thrown at. Here's another example. In 1972, Bernie Sanders

04:07.520 --> 04:12.880
wrote an essay about gender roles titled Man and Woman for an alternative newspaper that used some

04:12.880 --> 04:18.320
rather tasteless creative imagery. It resurfaced in 2015 as part of an article in Mother Jones.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.480
And while the spokesperson from his campaign distanced Sanders from the nearly 50-year-old

04:22.480 --> 04:27.760
article, some hate was made about Sanders being some kind of S&M fanatic. Free Lunch

04:27.760 --> 04:31.840
Express takes that misunderstanding from the right and makes this version of Bernie Sanders

04:31.840 --> 04:36.320
some kind of sexually repressed guy who's constantly trying to get his S&M erotica published.

04:36.320 --> 04:54.800
This, I suspect, is the basis for another tasteless joke where we meet Sanders' parents

04:54.800 --> 04:59.760
who, for some reason, are really into hooking up. We meet them once in the opening scenes,

04:59.760 --> 05:03.760
and then later on in the movie when Bernie is campaigning for political office. The joke,

05:03.760 --> 05:07.520
I guess, is that older people with an active sex life are funny.

05:08.080 --> 05:13.280
The truth is Sanders' parents had passed away before he was 22, well before he became a

05:13.280 --> 05:19.440
politician. Keeping them alive for this lame joke seems pointlessly cruel and a needless explanation

05:19.440 --> 05:25.120
for a lie about Bernie Sanders having some kind of repressed sexuality. There are so many instances

05:25.120 --> 05:28.880
like this that I'm not sure how someone can really understand what this movie is saying without

05:28.880 --> 05:32.800
having that right-wing caricature of Sanders in mind. And if you went into this movie having

05:32.800 --> 05:36.720
never heard of Bernie Sanders, you would be no closer to understanding most of the basics of his

05:36.720 --> 05:41.680
life, aside from him being a politician. I should reiterate that a movie, especially a satire,

05:41.680 --> 05:45.920
doesn't need to be completely historically accurate, but when the real parts of a subject's

05:45.920 --> 05:50.880
story that are highlighted are complete fiction, it reveals how worthless this movie is in depicting

05:50.880 --> 05:55.920
its subject's life. It's a huge waste. And speaking of huge wastes, much to my own personal

05:55.920 --> 06:00.880
heartbreak, Malcolm McDowell is in this movie as the narrator. He recently gave an interview about

06:00.880 --> 06:05.120
this role in the movie and, to hear him tell it, he was apparently bored sitting at home without

06:05.120 --> 06:08.880
much to do, thought the script was funny enough, and signed on to be the narrator.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.480
They asked me to do it, and it was right in the middle of the pandemic, so

06:13.200 --> 06:19.200
when there was nothing happening at all, and they all came up, everyone was in a bubble 12 feet away

06:19.200 --> 06:28.640
and massed, whipped the mass off just to do the shoot. So it was sort of fun. It was fun doing it.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.200
I wouldn't be surprised if he had only worked a day or two to deliver all his lines.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.200
And, wow, to see deliver.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.840
Hammy, over the top, and constantly silly, it's a performance that's both delightful and

06:55.840 --> 07:01.680
completely above the likes of this movie. And I feel I have to defend McDowell's honor here.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.160
While I don't know for certain what Malcolm McDowell's politics are, I suspect he's not a huge

07:06.160 --> 07:11.600
fan of Donald Trump. From what I could gather in that recent interview, he's a Kamala Harris guy.

07:11.600 --> 07:19.840
And, of course, the vice president nomination, now the elect, who is a terrific candidate, I think,

07:19.840 --> 07:25.200
I mean, she's really wonderful. So I guess Malcolm McDowell's in the K hive. That's better than being

07:25.200 --> 07:30.400
MAGA. And in an interview with Salon, McDowell's philosophy on making movies is beautifully summed

07:30.400 --> 07:35.680
up by this quote. The whole point with careers is, and I learned this at a young age, you are not

07:35.680 --> 07:40.240
going to make that many great movies in your life. So what's one more to the pile, I guess?

07:40.880 --> 07:45.680
The narration was designed to fill in the gaps of the plot, sometimes jumping years into the future.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.360
Strangely, there are these weird mockumentary type interviews with a few figures supposedly

07:51.360 --> 07:57.840
from Sanders past. These interviews only exist in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, though,

07:57.840 --> 08:03.200
and then it just stops using them. Is this movie still a mockumentary if it only keeps

08:03.200 --> 08:07.760
it up for the first quarter of the movie? It makes me suspect some ball was dropped during

08:07.760 --> 08:17.360
a script rewrite and no one bothered to fix it. And speaking of lazy, let's look at some more of

08:17.360 --> 08:22.000
the humor in this movie. Here's one example where Bernie is getting political advice from Ben and

08:22.080 --> 08:28.800
Jerry of Ben and Jerry Ice Cream fame while getting high in the park. Ben and or Jerry gave

08:28.800 --> 08:37.760
Bernie the most unfortunate of ideas. But you're hot. The joke here, I guess, is that Ben and Jerry

08:37.760 --> 08:43.760
are gay. How is this a joke, though? In real life, they aren't, but why would it be funny if they were?

08:44.320 --> 08:49.280
Another example of this movie's humor comes when we meet Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez late in the movie.

08:49.280 --> 08:54.800
Here we are, two people of different generations trying to take the country downtown to socialism

08:54.800 --> 09:01.440
town, Cory. Yeah, sure, sure. Sounding completely unlike herself, we see AOC speaking with an

09:01.440 --> 09:06.560
accent and dropping it in some casual Spanish. It doesn't really sound like her at all. And even if

09:06.560 --> 09:12.400
she did sound like this, why is it funny that she would have an accent? The idea here seems to be

09:12.400 --> 09:16.640
that the left is hiding their identity and when the cameras stop rolling, they reveal the parts

09:16.640 --> 09:21.360
of their identity that would supposedly hurt their popularity. But if anything, I think being

09:21.360 --> 09:26.000
gay would win Ben and Jerry, who are very supportive of gay rights, more support within that community.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.720
And AOC having an accent probably wouldn't bother a district that's 56% Hispanic. But I suspect this

09:32.720 --> 09:38.160
movie isn't targeting an audience that might not find humor in two men being gay or a Hispanic

09:38.160 --> 09:43.440
woman having an accent. It speaks volumes as to what this movie is trying to pass off as humor.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.480
And speaking of that, did you really think a lazy right-wing movie mocking Bernie Sanders

09:48.480 --> 09:51.280
wasn't going to have a little bit of anti-Semitism in it?

10:06.720 --> 10:10.320
It's the adjectives that really hammer home the Jewish stereotypes here.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.640
Ultimately, I think the reason this movie fails so completely is, aside from the lack of talent of

10:14.640 --> 10:19.200
almost everyone involved, is it makes no effort to understand its subjects beyond the right-wing

10:19.200 --> 10:23.920
caricature of him. Creating a movie that presents its subject in a way only those who despise Bernie

10:23.920 --> 10:28.880
Sanders the most would be able to appreciate. And the humor is crafted with this audience in mind.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.120
To the average person, at least based on the audience reviews for this movie, none of this

10:33.120 --> 10:38.560
stuff is funny. But perhaps we need some perspective. Let's look at a similar movie.

10:38.560 --> 10:43.760
In Oliver Stone's W, we get a satirical look at the life of George W. Bush, following him from

10:43.760 --> 10:48.800
his days in college right up to his time in office as the 43rd president of the United States.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.280
Although a film limited in its scope and perhaps not as attached to reality as it often presents

10:53.280 --> 10:57.840
itself, W does distinguish itself from Free Lunch Express in that it presents a more complete

10:57.840 --> 11:02.480
picture of its subject. It shows us the influence of George Bush Sr. on his son and how W's

11:02.480 --> 11:06.720
relationship with him supposedly motivated his drive to be more than a perpetual failure,

11:06.720 --> 11:10.560
and to right the wrong he believes his father made in Iraq. We also get a portrait of how

11:10.560 --> 11:15.120
the Bush family's privilege carried a mediocre man to the highest office in the land as he's

11:15.120 --> 11:19.920
surrounded by skilled political operatives and bequeathed his spot in politics by his very

11:19.920 --> 11:24.880
successful father. And a number of scenes within this movie are created using verifiable moments

11:24.880 --> 11:29.440
from Bush's past, sometimes recreating famous speeches or hearings with the film's performers.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.040
Comparatively, Free Lunch Express never explores Sanders' motivation aside from being upset that

11:35.040 --> 11:39.920
he was bullied in school. His political ambitions are supposedly driven by stealing campaign money,

11:39.920 --> 11:44.240
something I couldn't find any evidence of him having done, and his political success is largely

11:44.240 --> 11:49.040
presented as a lucky accident. One interesting similarity these two movies have is how they

11:49.040 --> 11:54.000
explain the rises to power by their respective subjects. Sanders and Bush aren't presented too

11:54.000 --> 11:58.960
favorably in their respective movies, so their rises to power are similar in that they're both

11:58.960 --> 12:04.080
shabby dudes who fail upwards into their success. Both movies advance the idea that neither of these

12:04.080 --> 12:09.520
two earned their way into future success. In W we see a shocking ambivalence at times, such as

12:09.520 --> 12:14.480
President Bush giving out t-shirts to soldiers wounded in Iraq and in Free Lunch Express. Bernie

12:14.480 --> 12:18.960
never even whispers about Medicare for All until it's time to make a deal with Hillary Clinton.

12:18.960 --> 12:23.600
The idea that either of these men could care at all about the people they represent is never

12:23.600 --> 12:29.200
seriously considered. Considering Bernie's whole brand is standing up for the little guy and he has

12:29.200 --> 12:33.680
a history of activism and political engagement, ignoring these parts of his history seemed like

12:33.680 --> 12:39.360
a deliberate effort to not understand him as a subject or at least not present these very real

12:39.360 --> 12:44.880
parts of his history. These movies have a lot in common in that respect and it reveals that making

12:44.880 --> 12:49.040
a movie like this is often designed to be a political statement rather than strictly a

12:49.040 --> 12:54.560
comedy or a depiction of history. In W there are some notable omissions regarding the Bush

12:54.560 --> 12:59.440
presidency. There's no mention of the terrorist attack on September 11th or the devastation of

12:59.440 --> 13:04.160
Hurricane Katrina. It's a movie primarily concerned with trying to understand how the invasion of Iraq

13:04.160 --> 13:08.560
happened. And even though it ultimately comes down hard on Bush for his role in the invasion, there's

13:08.560 --> 13:13.360
still some strange affection for former President Bush, as we have moments of sympathy for a guy

13:13.360 --> 13:18.320
doing the best he can with his limited faculties. In Free Lunch Express we see Bernie constantly

13:18.320 --> 13:23.200
being a scheming, conniving, lazy villain. He's never portrayed as a sympathetic character,

13:23.200 --> 13:27.440
with one exception. The only time you'll feel sympathy for Bernie in this movie is when he's

13:27.440 --> 13:31.760
faced with an even greater villain. And of course I'm talking about Hillary Clinton. Although late

13:31.760 --> 13:36.800
arrival into the movie it's amazing how terrifyingly she's portrayed. She bullies him, mocks him, and

13:36.800 --> 13:41.280
even threatens his life. It seems like the Free Lunch Express's hatred for Hillary is so strong

13:41.280 --> 13:46.240
that even a movie primarily built around mocking Bernie Sanders has to go out of its way to make

13:46.240 --> 13:51.680
sure the audience knows Hillary Clinton is so much worse. And of course instead of offering a

13:51.680 --> 13:57.360
sensible criticism of Clinton, something that's very easy to do, it instead shrapes into conspiracy

13:57.440 --> 14:01.920
theories, like the Clintons supposedly having Vince Foster murdered. It's also another example

14:01.920 --> 14:07.040
of how this movie is really built around right-wing caricatures and an alternate perspective of

14:07.040 --> 14:12.720
reality. So of course Hillary Clinton is presented as the most evil person in politics. I've been

14:12.720 --> 14:16.480
going pretty hard on Free Lunch Express, but it's also important for us to take a step back from

14:16.480 --> 14:21.840
these movies and examine ourselves as the audience. Or since this is my video, examining myself as

14:21.840 --> 14:27.040
the audience. A movie like W. Wood seemingly play better to a left-wing person such as myself,

14:27.040 --> 14:31.920
and an obviously right-wing movie like Free Lunch Express would not. So my political leanings may

14:31.920 --> 14:36.240
be coloring my interpretation here, since these movies are quite clearly shaped by the politics

14:36.240 --> 14:40.960
of their respective filmmakers. But while I think W. is a better movie than Free Lunch Express,

14:40.960 --> 14:46.800
I wouldn't call it good either. It felt long, with way too much emphasis on George W. Bush's

14:46.800 --> 14:52.640
daddy issues, and wasn't really that funny. While it was comparatively the funnier of the two movies,

14:52.640 --> 14:57.680
being funnier than Free Lunch Express isn't a very tough thing to do. But let's take a look at

14:57.680 --> 15:03.600
another satirical biopic about a politician, or in this case eventual politician, one that was made

15:03.600 --> 15:09.920
by actual comedians. Funnier Dies' 2016 movie Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal the movie gave

15:09.920 --> 15:15.280
us a brief history of the eventual 45th president of the United States. Presented as if it were a

15:15.280 --> 15:22.160
movie created by Donald Trump back in the 1980s, it has a very 80s aesthetic. The movie has cameos

15:22.160 --> 15:27.280
from Alf and Christopher Lloyd. It even has Kenny Loggins' track over the credits. It's a reminder

15:27.280 --> 15:32.240
that we used to think of Donald Trump as this ghost from the 80s, desperate to stay relevant

15:32.240 --> 15:37.760
in the modern day. But now we think of a lot of other things when talking about this guy. You might

15:37.760 --> 15:42.640
not recognize Johnny Depp as Donald Trump, but that's him under all that makeup. He's joined by

15:42.640 --> 15:47.280
a host of other performers, many of them quite experienced in doing jokes. And I even popped

15:47.280 --> 16:00.240
in myself for a brief cameo. So was the NFL violating antitrust laws? Although well received

16:00.240 --> 16:06.000
at the time, this movie has not aged well. The Trump jokes, which must have felt fresh in 2016,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.320
now come across as boring and stale. The movie does reflect something very important though.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.640
How we look at the lives of these figures is defined largely by the moment in which we look

16:14.640 --> 16:19.200
back. Freelance Express gives us a look at the life of Bernie Sanders, based on a caricature

16:19.200 --> 16:24.480
of him taken directly from the present. With his past life rewritten, to lead us towards this

16:24.480 --> 16:30.720
bumbling communist who secretly loves Stalin. And W is very much the same, giving us a selective

16:30.720 --> 16:35.680
look at George W. Bush's history based on the version of him we were seen as president at the

16:35.680 --> 16:41.440
time, with the failure of a rock looming especially large as his second term in office drew to an end.

16:41.520 --> 16:46.400
And the Trump movie is, as I mentioned, a look back at Trump before he assumed office when he

16:46.400 --> 16:51.520
was simply an 80s relic. These movies are moments in time trying to stamp a specific understanding

16:51.520 --> 16:55.520
of these politicians into the minds of their audience. This understanding will reflect the

16:55.520 --> 16:59.600
politics of the filmmaker, and if we're really lucky, it will give us a greater understanding

16:59.600 --> 17:04.800
of the subjects. We know Freelance Express is no good to us, and W is fixated on one major

17:04.800 --> 17:09.920
aspect of the Bush presidency, and the Donald Trump movie only looks at who Trump was before

17:09.920 --> 17:15.040
he assumed his role in office. So let's look at one more political satire biopic that very

17:15.040 --> 17:20.160
deliberately looks at one politician from a moment in time that might give us a better look at the

17:20.160 --> 17:26.800
impact they had on the world. Armando Nucci's 2017 movie The Death of Stalin offers a more

17:26.800 --> 17:32.160
interesting take on the satirical political biopic based on a graphic novel from 2012 by Fabian

17:32.160 --> 17:37.680
Nury and Thierry Robin, which subject Joseph Stalin spends most of the movie dead, or almost

17:37.680 --> 17:42.080
dead, and we spend the bulk of the movie watching the many men in his orbit scramble to make sense

17:42.080 --> 17:47.760
of a nation held together by this one man. It, of course, takes a lot of liberties with historical

17:47.760 --> 17:52.000
facts, but it does so in service to a greater narrative about how authoritarian rule does not

17:52.000 --> 17:57.280
abide sharing power, and how Stalin structured his government around fear of him. You learn much about

17:57.280 --> 18:03.120
the stature he grew to in his final days by seeing the effect his sudden absence had on those around

18:03.360 --> 18:08.080
him. We may never understand the any workings of these political figures, especially when they're

18:08.080 --> 18:12.480
dead, but we can learn something of them through art that highlights how silly it is to have a world

18:12.480 --> 18:17.520
where the death of one guy can bring the ruling structure of an entire nation to a screeching halt.

18:17.520 --> 18:22.400
No doubt there are plenty of historical inaccuracies in The Death of Stalin, and it's

18:22.400 --> 18:27.120
jarring to see men who help to commit atrocities being portrayed as bumbling fools, even when the

18:27.120 --> 18:32.240
movie makes no attempt to hide their more monstrous sides. Thousands of people died during this movie,

18:32.320 --> 18:38.000
and execution scenes are played for laughs. It's a wonderful embodiment of a dark comedy. And it

18:38.000 --> 18:43.200
gets away with all of this, because it managed to do one thing that Free Lunch Express failed at

18:43.200 --> 18:46.480
miserably. The death of Stalin is funny.

18:46.480 --> 19:03.840
All the faults I found with Free Lunch Express might have seemed like nothing had it made me

19:03.840 --> 19:09.920
laugh throughout its runtime. But instead, I sat there with a bored expression, counting each

19:09.920 --> 19:14.320
excruciating minute. If you're curious to know what joke got me the closest to laughter,

19:14.320 --> 19:30.640
it was this one. That's as good as it got. The reasons for Free Lunch Express not being funny

19:30.640 --> 19:36.160
vary. One of the main problems is how exhaustively conservative it is. Not with its politics,

19:36.160 --> 19:41.040
although it is conservative politically, but rather, it's conservative with its humor. The

19:41.040 --> 19:46.160
jokes amount to nothing more than Bernie constantly smoking pot, old people getting frisky,

19:46.160 --> 19:50.960
and ham-fisted caricatures. It all feels like something ripped from a comedy 20 years ago.

19:51.520 --> 19:57.120
One of the taglines of this movie is that it comes from the creators who saw Airplane too many times.

19:57.120 --> 20:02.320
That movie came out 40 years ago. And while it holds up in some ways, largely due to the talent

20:02.320 --> 20:06.880
of the people who created it, comedy and film has evolved quite a bit since then. Free Lunch

20:06.880 --> 20:12.800
Express doesn't seem to have gotten that message. Comedy generally doesn't age well, so boring from

20:12.800 --> 20:17.760
the past can be a risky thing to do. While sometimes humor is lost through changing values

20:17.760 --> 20:22.240
in a culture, and when it comes to making fun of people for their ethnicity or sexuality, that

20:22.240 --> 20:26.480
definitely seems like a good thing to me. There's also the simple fact that the more often you hear

20:26.480 --> 20:32.160
the same joke, even one that's acceptable, the less funny it gets over time. Some comedy holds

20:32.160 --> 20:37.920
up and some does it, and it takes a sound comedic mind to know when to replicate and when to innovate,

20:37.920 --> 20:43.440
not pushing the envelope in a way that drags comedy back towards tired cliches, but instead pushing

20:43.440 --> 20:48.560
it into new exciting directions. There is no innovation in Free Lunch Express. It rehashes

20:48.560 --> 20:52.960
jokes that have been in movies for decades, and it doesn't do a particularly good job of retelling

20:52.960 --> 20:57.520
them. It would be unfair to say politically conservative artists can't be funny, but to be

20:57.520 --> 21:02.160
funny to a modern audience, it requires them to be less conservative artistically.

21:02.160 --> 21:08.240
There you have it. A tale so curious. It may seem quite spurious.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.480
The choices made surrounding the making of this movie raise important questions about the

21:12.480 --> 21:18.000
filmmakers involved. Who is writer-director-producer Lenny Britton, and what does he have against

21:18.000 --> 21:23.760
Bernie Sanders? Leonard Wheeler Britton currently serves as the lead writer-director for a production

21:23.760 --> 21:29.680
company called Right and Funny, a name which is only half right. In his younger days, he worked as

21:29.680 --> 21:35.520
a writer before taking over his father's business, Britton Lumber Landscape at Feed. I couldn't figure

21:35.520 --> 21:40.880
out exactly what he was writing though. The most interesting part of his CV is that Britton ran for

21:40.880 --> 21:46.560
office in 2010 in Vermont, for the Senate. And while it would have been too perfect had his

21:46.560 --> 21:51.600
opponent been Bernie Sanders himself, he instead ran against the other senator from Vermont, Patrick

21:51.600 --> 21:57.200
Leahy, who's been holding that seat for decades. Naturally, Britton lost, though the 30% of the vote

21:57.200 --> 22:01.680
he got was more than Leahy's last Republican challenger could achieve. And Britton gave us

22:01.680 --> 22:09.040
several memorable campaign ads. This is a bill for your family share of the national debt. It's $168,000.

22:09.040 --> 22:14.800
This is a joke, right? Miss, we're from the government. There is no joking. That's a lot of money,

22:14.800 --> 22:20.000
mister. Better get a paper route, Billy. When one of these ads proved a minor viral hit,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.800
nabbing tens of thousands of views compared to the usual few hundred, it convinced Britton and

22:24.800 --> 22:29.600
his partner, Bradford Broyles, to step into the world of comedy. So they decided to make some

22:29.600 --> 22:34.800
scripted comedy from a conservative standpoint. As to how a former senatorial candidate got the

22:34.800 --> 22:39.600
funding to make a movie, the answer to that lies with the executive producer for the film, Lenore

22:39.600 --> 22:45.200
Broughton. Broughton is an heiress living off the fabulous wealth of her late grandfather,

22:45.200 --> 22:50.640
Sue Lavery, a businessman from the early half of the 20th century, whose fortune was estimated to

22:50.640 --> 22:56.720
be 327 million dollars when he retired in 1955. Although very little is known about Broughton,

22:56.720 --> 23:02.160
as she's a very private person, one thing very much publicly available is her extensive support

23:02.160 --> 23:06.560
of Republican politicians, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle,

23:06.560 --> 23:11.280
typically on hard-right candidates. And naturally one of those candidates included Britton's run

23:11.280 --> 23:15.840
for Senate in 2010. Broughton has helped finance a number of right-wing media outlets,

23:15.840 --> 23:20.640
such as True North Reports, which a brief glance at reveals plenty of right-wing nonsense right down

23:20.640 --> 23:25.760
to reposting clips from Tucker Carlson's Nightly Hour of Trash. Broughton apparently saw some value

23:25.760 --> 23:29.920
in Britton's vision for a movie mocking Bernie Sanders, and as is predictable, this isn't the

23:29.920 --> 23:34.880
first time she's financed his antics. Aside from those campaign contributions, she's also financed

23:34.880 --> 23:40.400
a few of his other projects, such as a web series, News Done Right, mocking Vermont Republican

23:40.400 --> 23:45.600
governor Phil Scott for being far too moderate, and she also financed a web series that I've been

23:45.600 --> 23:50.960
told is a comedy starring Kevin Sorbo, titled The World According to Billy Potwin. Although the

23:50.960 --> 23:56.560
series was originally Sorbo-less, he joined in its second season, replacing the previous actor

23:56.560 --> 24:02.080
who had the role of Nate Potwin, the patriarch of the Potwin clan, and of the four shorts produced

24:02.080 --> 24:06.880
in the Sorbo era, three were cut into a single episode, which seems to be serving as a pilot for

24:06.960 --> 24:10.320
the series. Here's a little taste of what this show is like.

24:10.320 --> 24:15.280
And if we do not reduce our carbon footprint, the polar caps will melt,

24:15.280 --> 24:20.320
and the rising sea level will put major American coastal cities underwater.

24:20.320 --> 24:26.320
So New York, Miami, and Los Angeles underwater. What's the downside?

24:26.320 --> 24:27.120
Billy!

24:27.120 --> 24:32.320
Billy's grandfather is played by Barry Bostwick of Rocky Horror and Spin City fame. I can only

24:32.320 --> 24:37.280
hope he just really needed the money, especially since they spelled his name wrong in the credits.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.200
You may recognize the actor who played young Bernie Sanders in Free Lunch Express,

24:41.200 --> 24:46.160
taking on the role of Billy Potwin. This young man is named Jonah Britton,

24:46.160 --> 24:51.040
and he is the son of series creator Lenny Britton. Although it had a very brief run online,

24:51.040 --> 24:54.800
this web series got a full season with at least eight episodes produced so far,

24:54.800 --> 24:59.520
though they have yet to air, it doesn't seem to have a distributor yet. But if it gets one,

24:59.520 --> 25:03.120
I'll make a whole video looking at what I'm sure will be a fantastic sitcom.

25:03.120 --> 25:08.000
There's some sweet irony here where a wealthy financier who didn't earn a cent of her own money

25:08.000 --> 25:12.720
is financing an unfummy former politician to make bad entertainment for a right-wing audience who

25:12.720 --> 25:17.200
wants to fuel their hatred for Bernie Sanders. When Bernie is presented as a hopeless slacker

25:17.200 --> 25:21.440
who locked his way into his position, it seems a more fitting description for those responsible

25:21.440 --> 25:26.880
for this lazily put together movie, financed on the back of inherited wealth, and constructed

25:26.880 --> 25:31.840
by someone who doesn't appear to have any talent whatsoever for comedy. Free Lunch

25:31.840 --> 25:36.960
Express is a movie that demands a response that's as lazy as the effort that went into making it.

25:36.960 --> 25:42.000
A waste of time for everyone involved, I encourage all of you to keep not watching it.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.520
Originally, this video was actually going to be entirely about the whole Billy Potwin series,

25:50.240 --> 25:54.000
but there were only a few shorts and it didn't feel quite so meaty,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.440
and I wasn't sure there was enough content there for me to make a whole video.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.360
While doing my research, I decided to watch Free Lunch Express just to get a sense of what

26:01.360 --> 26:06.080
Britain is all about in his creative work, and there was so much there that I just felt like

26:06.080 --> 26:10.400
it would make a much better subject for a video. And there were so many things in this movie I

26:10.400 --> 26:16.000
didn't even get to touch that were just absolutely atrocious. So consider this a sanitized reading of

26:16.000 --> 26:21.760
the movie that doesn't bombard you with every last morsel of its garbage. If you enjoyed this movie,
