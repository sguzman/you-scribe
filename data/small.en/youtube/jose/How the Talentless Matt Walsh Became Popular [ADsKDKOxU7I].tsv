0	6480	Matt Walsh is not an interesting guy. His talking points are poorly evidenced and infantile,
6480	12000	his delivery is flat and lacking in charisma, and the subjects he covers reveal an embarrassingly
12000	17600	narrow perspective of the world. But he is incredibly lucky, and that's the secret to
17600	23440	his success. Matt Walsh matters insofar that he serves as an object lesson on how right-wing
23440	28800	media figures continuously push on the limits of acceptable discourse to direct society backwards
28800	33200	into a regressive state that strips away the rights of people to create a religiously centered
33200	38560	culture. This kind of extreme Christian conservatism has been going on for a long time, and it's
38560	44480	important to continuously oppose. But Matt Walsh himself? He's mediocre at best. There are a lot
44480	49040	of other people doing the same thing and often much better than he is, but why is he someone
49040	53360	people suddenly have to care about? Let's do a quick rundown of this guy's history if you're not
53360	57840	familiar with him. Originally a radio host in Delaware, Walsh bounced around from a few jobs
57840	62880	struggling to last for more than a year or two. He started a blog in 2012, eventually catching
62880	68800	the attention of Glenn Beck's The Blaze in 2014. In 2017 he started writing for Ben Shapiro's The
68800	75520	Daily Wire, and he got his own show, The Matt Walsh Show, in 2018. But it wasn't until 2022 that he
75520	80640	really started catching people's eye, notably with his anti-trans movie What is a Woman.
80640	85520	As his biggest success by far, it would be weird not to mention it, but I'm not going to go too
85520	90640	into depth on this particular movie because it's been thoroughly debunked by other people on YouTube.
90640	94960	So if you want a detailed breakdown, I would recommend Jessie Jender's videos on the subject.
94960	100320	She goes into great detail on why this movie is a little propaganda. But we do at least have to
100320	104960	address what kind of content he puts out there, so instead I'm going to take a look at what it's
104960	111200	like to watch his show. The Matt Walsh Show has a basic formula. He has one story he speaks to for
111200	115920	the first 15 to 20 minutes of the show, then a series of five headlines he gives a couple of
115920	121600	minutes to, then he responds to viewer comments, and finally one last story to cap off the episode.
121600	126080	Although it's segmented to give the show the appearance of variety, the only real difference
126080	131040	is the length of each segment as pretty much all of it is just Walsh commenting on a piece of news
131040	136240	or another commentary. The first thing I noticed while watching is that, even for the big stories
136320	142480	up front, Matt Walsh very rarely goes into detail about any subject he's supposedly commenting on.
142480	147280	This is particularly obvious when he discusses trans issues, something he typically touches
147280	154240	on several times in episode. In one episode, from May 2nd, 2023 titled Princeton Professor
154240	162240	Tries to Debunk Biology Fails Hilariously, episode 1156, my god he's done a lot of these,
162240	166160	Walsh responds to an article published on the Scientific American website.
166160	172000	For some context before we jump in, this article is titled Here's Why Human Sex is Not Binary,
172000	176880	Over the Don't Make a Woman, and Sperm Don't Make a Man by Augustin Fuentes, a professor of
176880	182800	anthropology at Princeton University. This article is a response to how the emphasis is often placed
182800	187280	on how people are assigned male or female at birth on the basis of whether they produce
187280	192800	sperm or ova. He provides a few examples of people reducing sex to one of those two things,
192800	197520	and then explains with more examples and commentary from various scientific sources
197520	202560	how the many complications of human sex make it difficult to place it in a binary.
202560	206400	Here's an excerpt from the article that sums it up well. When someone states that
206400	212320	quote, an organism's sex is defined by the type of gamete, sperm, or ova it has the function of
212320	218960	producing, unquote, and argues that legal and social policy should be quote, rooted in properties
218960	225120	of bodies, unquote, they are not really talking about gametes and sex biology. They are arguing
225120	230000	for a specific political and discriminatory definition of what is quote unquote natural
230000	234720	and quote unquote right for humans based on a false representation of biology.
234720	239120	And he gives several historical examples of what that discrimination has often looked like.
239120	244240	It's a pretty good article that offers a primary for why sex shouldn't be understood as a binary
244240	248720	and focuses on how sex is used by political actors to discriminate against others.
249280	254720	Matt Walsh is not so kind in his assessment of the article. What's most noticeable in his analysis
254720	260000	though is how shallow his reading of the article is. Here's how he starts a segment. Starting at
260000	264800	the top of the article says, there are those politicians, pundits, and even a few scientists
264800	270960	who maintain that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex.
271760	278080	We already see the game that he's playing. The headline promises proof that human sex is not
278080	284080	binary. This is a big promise. But then in the first sentence, Professor Fuentes sets himself up
284080	291520	for a very different and much smaller task. It's weird that Matt Walsh is calling the first sentence
291520	296560	some kind of sleight of hand when it was clear what the article was about from the subheading.
296560	301360	Though that part of the article is never shown or read during this segment, just the broad headline
301360	306080	up top. Kind of be like talking about the Star Wars movies without including their subheadings.
306080	309840	It kind of is important to differentiate them and give you a little more context of what's being
309840	314400	discussed, but instead we're getting context removed so Matt Walsh can more easily make his
314400	319040	point. You really get the impression he either has it read or is deliberately ignoring certain
319040	323840	parts of this article. Here's some more evidence of that. He announces his intention to respond to
323840	330400	the claim that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex, except
330400	336160	that, well, nobody ever said that ova and sperm are all we need to know about sex. If you read the
336160	341040	original Scientific American article, you can see he's linked several examples of people saying
341040	344880	just that. Not that you have to go anywhere else because you can see Walsh do a version of it
344880	349280	himself less than a minute later. He's not actually, it looks like we're disproving it,
349280	355360	he's just adding on other details. But even if those other details are true, that wouldn't
355360	361040	disprove the basic fact that there are only male and female gametes, which means that there are
361040	367040	only two sexes, which means that sex is binary. Reading the article, Professor Fuentes clarifies
367040	372960	that when someone, like Matt Walsh, claims there are other factors, they never seem to explain
372960	378720	anything beyond genitals and gametes. This video is just another case of that. We're told there are
378720	383120	other factors, but never what those factors actually are. Seems like it would be a really
383120	388880	good time to bring them up, but we just don't get them here. The segment is exhausting in that it's
388880	393520	more or less Walsh going through the article, reading lengthy excerpts, and reacting to them,
393520	398400	but each time he misses crucial context that would either change or complicate what he's trying to
398400	404000	respond to. He'll complain that the article is just making empty assertions, apparently unaware
404000	409200	that in the original you can see it links to many sources, several from peer-reviewed journals. It
409200	413120	actually assembles quite a bit of evidence to support each claim that's being made. Not that
413120	417680	you could ever tell from the Walsh segment, since the excerpts are just displayed as text and you
417680	422400	can't really tell, they're linking to a lot of supporting information. Throughout this entire
422400	428720	segment, Matt Walsh doesn't cite a single source. He just makes a vague allusion to the science.
428720	433280	This is a pattern of his. The challenge in responding to so much of what Matt Walsh says
433280	438640	is that he not only doesn't understand what he's responding to, whether that's deliberate or not,
438640	444320	he also refuses to do any homework. If someone cites scientific research that counters his claim,
444320	448240	he just doesn't acknowledge it. Walsh smugly argues at the end,
448720	457200	Variations within a category do not invalidate the category. Males need to exist as a category
457200	462240	in order for us to say anything about a male, a human male, such as human males are all different,
462240	467840	they have different expressions. This article is not arguing that categories within sex don't exist.
467840	473920	Categories do exist within a spectrum. When a scientist says light is a spectrum, for instance,
473920	478880	they're not saying that colors don't exist, just that the boundaries between colors are not so clear
478880	484400	cut as they would be in a binary. And Walsh doesn't even seem to understand the basic point of this
484400	489840	article. It's not about upending some kind of scientific consensus that he's imagined. It's
489840	495360	using established science to talk about how that science is politicized. And Matt Walsh is doing
495360	500480	that politicizing in this very video. He's not engaging with any of the material in a meaningful
500480	506400	sense, he's just twisting it to meet his own ends. This is what Walsh's content often boils down to,
506400	512240	butchering evidence to make a hateful point. In the May 3rd, 2023 episode of his show,
512240	519120	others of trans kids give insane reasons for transitioning their children, episode 1157,
519120	523600	we get all of that ignorance distilled into one of Matt Walsh's favorite rhetorical moves.
523600	527760	But we don't even need to talk about the science, because it's also logically fallacious. It doesn't
527760	532160	make any logical sense. Of all the episodes I watched while researching this video,
532160	536800	he never gets around to talking about the science. He would rather fixate on the simplified language
536800	541520	of activists than actually dive into the science he's supposedly defending. And that's how he
541520	547120	operates on most topics. In another episode, the left demands we surrender our families and
547120	553040	communities to violent criminals, episode 1159. He describes a story where a trans man,
553440	558560	Brown, in San Francisco was shot and killed by armed security outside of Walgreens after Brown
558560	564400	was suspected of shoplifting. Since no charges were filed and Brown was trans and black,
564400	568640	and since this happened in San Francisco, Matt Walsh believes we don't need to look at the actual
568640	575200	details of this case. As we know, the official legal bar for self-defense is set at a certain
575200	580960	height. But the unofficial bar for self-defense against someone who belongs to three different
580960	586720	victim classes is set significantly higher. And this security guard apparently cleared both the
586720	590960	official bar and the unofficial bar, which is all we really need to know about the case.
591520	596160	He mentions three victim classes in this clip because he's also misgendering Brown. Actually,
596160	600960	looking at the details of this case reveals some interesting facts, such as Brown was alleged to
600960	605920	have threatened to stab the security guard, yet no knife was recovered at the scene. And Walsh's
605920	610080	commentary completely ignores that the fact that this killing has raised an interesting question
610080	615600	about armed security being used at a drugstore. We can see Walsh lie about this in real time as he
615600	621200	describes the activists. That's why activists in San Francisco are now calling for the abolition
621200	626320	of security guards in response to this incident. Activists aren't calling for the elimination of
626320	631040	security guards, though. We can see that in the article Walsh himself is reading out. It's very
631040	635760	explicit about it being armed security that they're concerned about. Instead of dealing
635760	639760	with the points being raised by activists, Walsh would sooner misrepresent them so he can say stuff
639760	649360	like this. Stealing isn't worth the cost of human life. So don't steal. Walsh then goes on to make
649360	653920	a painfully simplistic argument about the need to defend property with lethal force, which includes
653920	659840	anything you might get from a Walgreens. It's a very bad and silly point on the face of it.
659840	664880	If you need a YouTuber to explain why someone shouldn't be executed on the spot for stealing
664880	671120	loaf of bread or even, as Walsh at one point speculates, some fancy headphones, then you have
671120	675200	a perspective on life that I don't think is going to be changed by a single YouTube video. Here's
675200	679840	some more criminal justice reform ideas from Walsh. This time it's regarding the death penalty for
679840	685040	pedophiles. Not only are we executing these people, but we're doing it quickly. We're not giving them
685040	691440	30 years to appeal, okay? The conviction is passed down, you're convicted, you're guilty, you've been
691440	700560	found guilty, and then the execution is carried out the next day. Take them up, take them out to
700560	705200	the gallows, you bring them up on the platform, you tie a rope around their neck, pull the lever,
705200	710400	boom, it's done. Walsh concocts this whole imaginary scenario that, I'm sure in his mind,
710400	714960	makes perfect sense. In the real world though, death sentences are highly contested because
714960	719440	many of them are overturned. For example, the Innocence Project specializes in overturning
719440	723600	wrongful convictions through more modern investigative techniques, and many others
723600	727760	sentenced to death have had those convictions overturned when new evidences discovered.
727760	733200	Walsh's fantasy leaves no room for that and would mean innocent people would die. It also has this
733200	738800	assumption that the justice system is perfect, which is just not true. Even on the point of a
738800	743760	hanging being quick and effective, the reason hangings were stopped was because they often aren't.
743760	748960	A botched hanging results in someone being slowly strangled to death. It's a struggle to describe
749040	754160	Walsh's arguments as anything more than childish and lazy. He's very good at finding a way to never
754160	759040	think deeply about any of the topics he covers. Why cite scientific research when you can simply
759040	764400	make a reference to the science? Why honestly debate what activists are saying when you can
764400	769760	create a simpler strawman to rail against instead? Why genuinely consider how the death penalty is
769760	775200	applied when you can instead make up an imaginary scenario that is completely divorced from reality?
775200	780000	Poor arguments framed by missing context are all his show is though. He does devote a lot of
780000	785120	time to creating bait. This is usually in the shape of having an over-the-top reaction about
785120	790240	trivial things. For example, calling people savages if they let their pets sleep in the same bed.
794000	799760	He also describes adults who like Disney World as mentally ill and he hates bicycle lanes.
799760	805680	It's here his commentary is more obviously laid bare as the trolling it so often is. And what
805680	810560	makes it effective is that it's hard to tell apart from his more serious commentary. They're
810560	816080	similarly poorly argued and often based on Walsh's gut feelings about something and he's needlessly
816080	820720	confrontational about everything he says. It would be nice if he were just a silly guy we could
820720	826080	afford to ignore, crying about people who let their pets sleep on the bed, using his pathetic
826080	831040	bait to get media watchdogs and other commentators like myself to address him like he's someone
831040	836400	worth considering. And if that was all he was, I wouldn't waste time talking about him in a video
836400	841280	like this one. Instead, I think it's important to acknowledge this bait because it reflects the
841280	846720	soft nature of all his news commentary and there are aspects of that commentary that are genuinely
846720	852240	harmful. The bait and the harmful commentary are similar in that none of it is very substantial
852240	858080	and whenever it approaches any subject that has any complexity whatsoever, for example gender,
858080	863120	all that nuance and complexity gets wiped away so Matt Walsh can comment on it at his own level.
863120	868400	And as embarrassing as all of this is, the saddest part of the show is when he starts arguing with
868400	875840	YouTube comments. And at Accretionist says, yes, respecting LGBT people is difficult for you and
875840	881200	asking for that respect is brainwashing. We understand witless sadism, Matt. Well, I'm sure
881200	887280	you do. Or what he calls on his audience to harass Dwayne Wade. Dwayne Wade everywhere he
887280	893520	goes should be jeered and mocked and shouted at everywhere he goes. That should happen.
893520	899120	And there are so many other examples where Matt Walsh just seems determined to come off as like
899120	904480	this lecturing dad type ready to put someone in their place. He desperately wants to be seen as
904480	909840	some kind of tough guy or authority figure, but it's not very convincing and it just reads as
909840	916160	deeply insecure. Part of the problem of responding to a guy like this is it's very easy to get trapped
916160	920880	in the endless corrections for all the lies he spreads, whether he's doing it knowingly or
920880	925600	because he just doesn't understand. The one overriding impression though is that this guy
926160	930960	is clearly not capable enough to be arguing in the position he's found himself in.
931520	936240	The whole package of the Matt Walsh show is a sad one. He's a limited man,
936240	941280	desperate to present himself as some kind of powerful voice. It raises the important question
941280	948000	of how did this guy become as successful as he is? First we should probably ask though,
948000	953920	was he always this bad? In a lengthy expose put together by Media Matters, a series of old clips
953920	959360	from 2010 to 2011 revealed some commentary from Matt Walsh that display some of his more extreme
959360	960400	positions.
989360	1003280	When this story broke, some people were shocked by the content and while it's certainly more
1003280	1008480	masked off than his current stuff, you can see a lot of the patterns Walsh uses in the present day.
1008480	1013040	In these old clips he makes vague gestures to the past while being completely historically
1013040	1017440	illiterate and he's unable to engage with viewpoints that aren't his own. For example,
1017440	1022240	in one of the longer clips when he's making a point about teenage pregnancy and marriage,
1022240	1026560	he has very poor responses to his co-host who keeps raising the point of how difficult it is
1026560	1031520	to avoid a family these days, these days being about 10 years ago. Not that it's gotten much
1031520	1037120	better. Instead of actually engaging with this very valid point, Walsh goes on a rant about how
1037120	1041680	college is useless and how people had the right idea 50 years ago and that 16 year olds are
1041680	1046160	basically adults. None of that is true and none of it addresses the point that's being raised about
1046160	1050640	the economics of bringing up a family today, especially if we're talking about a pregnant
1050640	1056240	teenager. Never mind the social, personal, and physical burdens as well. But that's how Matt
1056240	1060960	Walsh engages in any sort of debate. He has a specific idea of how things work in his head
1060960	1065120	and he's not going to deviate from that no matter what evidence you show him or what arguments you
1065120	1070720	bring to his face. He has an opinion set in stone that's often simple and poorly informed and he's
1070720	1075440	not going to let anything change that. What these clips reveal is that Matt Walsh was making the same
1075520	1079520	thoughtless, religiously tinted commentary throughout his career. This isn't a character
1079520	1084960	he adopted a few years ago, this is just who this guy is. One of the keys to understanding this
1084960	1090640	commentary is to know that Matt Walsh has a very specific kind of Christian worldview. He identifies
1090640	1095600	as a Catholic and through that faith he interprets the world around him. While not all Christians or
1095600	1100560	even all Catholics would share Walsh's vision of Christianity, he has found common cause among other
1100560	1106080	Christian conservatives who support his faith-based arguments. When Walsh starts discussing politics
1106080	1111040	it's through that Christian lens his worldview starts to make sense, specifically when he
1111040	1117600	identifies liberalism as satanic. It is 2017 book, The Unholy Trinity, blocking the left's assault on
1117600	1123840	life, marriage, and gender. It opens, the first liberal was named Lucifer. He elaborates on this
1123840	1129360	a bit later, writing, this philosophy has propelled all the great villains throughout history.
1129440	1135680	It is the philosophy of Judas, of Nero, of Genghis Khan, of Adolf Hitler, of Hillary Clinton.
1135680	1140400	The specifics of what these people all believed and how they framed it around political circumstances
1140400	1145440	of the day isn't terribly relevant, for they desired the same thing and worshipped the same
1145440	1151520	god, the self. Walsh later claims that even the label of liberal or progressive are different
1151520	1158160	reflections of that same deeper idea of self-worship, making this opposition to self-worship a very
1158160	1162560	malleable thing. When Walsh writes about the political circumstances of the day not being
1162560	1167280	terribly relevant, it's a convenient way of discarding any additional facts or circumstances
1167280	1171840	that might complicate the point he's trying to make. A tactic you probably noticed earlier.
1175760	1181200	This is just Matt Walsh's move. Ignore nuance, ignore complexity or depth, reduce everything to
1181200	1186400	a simple talking point, and move on from there. To the point where Nero, Adolf Hitler, and Hillary
1186400	1191920	Clinton are basically the same villain. Walsh certainly isn't an originator of this idea of
1191920	1197120	self-worship, and it's a charge that any non-believers will probably recognize. It's this
1197120	1201920	move of defining you not by what you believe, but what someone else says you're missing.
1201920	1206320	In this case, worship of the god Matt Walsh believes in. It's a way of taking someone's
1206320	1212000	arguments and beliefs away from them and instead placing them into an easily shaped strawman that
1212000	1217280	can be more easily dispatched. It's a very lazy and dishonest way to frame somebody. And by the
1217280	1222880	way, that god Matt Walsh believes in is not one shared by all Christians, at least according to
1222880	1228560	him. In his 2020 book, Church of Cowards, a wake-up call to complacent Christians, he writes,
1228560	1235440	Today, around 70% of Americans claim to be Christian. This number represents a marked decline,
1235440	1241520	but the problem is not the decline in professed believers. If we had simply lost 10 or 20%,
1242480	1247920	but still we had 70 who were really and truly on fire with the faith, there would be far less
1247920	1255760	cause for concern. But the problem with the 70% is that it is not really 70%. The 70% is mostly
1255760	1260800	composed of the sort of Christians who cannot be readily distinguished from atheists. He then
1260800	1265040	decries how Christians in America have become too permissive and don't take their faith seriously
1265040	1269520	enough. The book even opens with a hypothetical scenario of a group of heathens invading America
1269520	1273040	and being shocked to find out it isn't the Christian nation they thought it was.
1273040	1278560	One of the big crises Walsh sees is the lack of Christianity in America, the type of Christianity
1278560	1284080	he espouses, particularly on issues that animate him. The three causes he mentions in Unholy
1284080	1289920	Trinity are abortion, gay marriage, and transgender people. And he believes any real Christian would
1289920	1296160	oppose all three things. He comes across as very strident and firm in his faith. But it's interesting
1296160	1301760	to contrast how hard Walsh is against Christians he thinks don't measure up, compared to when he
1301760	1307040	speaks to Ben Shapiro about religion. If you figure out how to love anyone outside of yourself
1307040	1312640	during your life, then I think that's something God can take and work with. And those are little
1312640	1319680	embers of something that he can ignite into fire in a good sense. Some important context here is
1319680	1325120	that Shapiro is Jewish and Matt Walsh's boss, and you can see Walsh's tone become much softer,
1325120	1329680	mumbling something vague about loving other people and giving God something to work with.
1329680	1333840	What he and Shapiro really share is that they happen to be fighting the same enemy.
1333840	1338800	This is how alliances are often forged in right-wing spaces, particularly at right-wing media.
1338800	1342080	It's not about what you fight for, it's about what you fight against,
1342080	1346720	and it's not about what you believe, it's about what you hate. That's not really enough to explain
1346800	1350880	why Matt Walsh's profile has risen to the point where he's more well known than many other
1350880	1356400	conservative commentary figures. While he's not at the level of Ben Shapiro or even Candace Owens,
1356400	1362720	his name is probably more likely to be recognized than Andrew Clavin or Jake Crane or 75% of the
1362720	1368080	lineup of Glenn Beck's Blaze TV, Walsh's former home. Matt Walsh's broader success can be easily
1368080	1373200	understood by comparing him to one of his Daily Wire colleagues, the somehow even less talented
1373200	1377520	Michael Knowles. If anyone knows who Michael Knowles is, it's because of comments he made
1377520	1383440	back at CPAC in March of 2023 when he called for the eradication of transgenderism.
1384160	1392320	Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely, the whole preposterous ideology
1392880	1398880	at every level. This statement is a very clear example of getting as close as possible to calling
1398880	1404320	for genocide without being explicit about it. The implication is clear though, to remove trans
1404320	1408880	people from public life. It raises the obvious question of, what happens to the people who say
1408880	1414240	being trans is a core part of their identity? The answer, at least looking at historical examples,
1414240	1419520	tends to be murder or displacement. In other words, genocide. These comments are genocidal
1419520	1424880	in character even if they aren't an explicit call for genocide. The grotesque nature of these
1424880	1430160	comments aside, what this briefly did was tell the world that Michael Knowles exists. Looking at
1430160	1434320	the headlines for this story we can see pretty clearly that most people weren't aware of who
1434320	1439840	this guy was even though he had been hosting a show for the Daily Wire since 2017 at this point.
1439840	1445120	CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism and somehow claims he's not
1445120	1450480	calling for elimination of transgender people. CPAC's speaker sparks alarm with call for
1450480	1457840	transgenderism to be eradicated. CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism. Crowd
1457840	1463760	goes wild. As a fun aside, when I released my video on the Daily Wire's terror on the prairie,
1463760	1468480	I put a black bar over Michael Knowles' face in the thumbnail to see if anyone would notice. I
1468480	1472720	didn't see a single comment mention that. Michael Knowles has been trying to break through the noise
1472720	1477280	of conservative commentary for years, and in spite of the financial resources behind him,
1477280	1481920	he's had very little success. The only way he captured anyone's attention at all was to
1481920	1487600	embrace genocidal rhetoric that had the thinnest layer of plausible deniability. This is how Matt
1487600	1493600	Walsh did it too. Matt Walsh wasn't quite as brazen as Knowles, but he has similarly built a brand by
1493600	1497760	demonizing trans people as much as possible, and looking at his history we can see this has been
1497760	1503200	an issue he's been passionate about for years. And as we saw in the commentary I highlighted earlier,
1503200	1508000	Matt Walsh is not a sophisticated operator but rather a true believer, so I don't think this
1508000	1513280	is a simple grift. Instead, I think Matt Walsh is someone who is just lucky. To explain this,
1513280	1517200	I have to zoom out a little bit though. There's a helpful tool we'll need to understand called
1517200	1522240	the Overton Window. For those who are unfamiliar, that explains how political discourse exists on
1522240	1527840	a spectrum that changes over time. What's left-wing today can become right-wing tomorrow and vice versa,
1527840	1532640	depending on a population's general political leaning. The general political sentiments of a
1532640	1538480	population are called the Overton Window. Anything outside that window is considered extreme.
1538480	1543280	So if we're talking about the United States, this can usually be split along party lines,
1543280	1547520	though it's possible to be further to the left or right in either party and still be part of
1547520	1553520	mainstream political discourse. But if you go too far, say being an anarchist or an open white
1553520	1559040	nationalist, you fall right out of the Overton Window and typically have your voice marginalized.
1559040	1563200	This isn't a value judgment by the way, just a statement of how this window works.
1563200	1568400	Anarchists are cool and interesting people. White nationalists are scum though, and I am judging
1568400	1573520	them for being terrible. If I were to place Matt Walsh on this spectrum, we'd probably put him
1573520	1578320	somewhere around here, particularly if we're talking about trans issues. And keep in mind,
1578320	1584640	this is an image of commonly accepted political discourse, not personal feelings or subtext of the
1584800	1590640	figure we're talking about. So dog whistles and masks, sadly, are in play, even if you're someone
1590640	1596640	who can spot them. They work, and that's why people use them. And sadly, anti-trans rhetoric
1596640	1602080	is broadly accepted on the right wing, so long as you aren't too obvious with the calls for genocide.
1602080	1607200	You notice Matt Walsh is just on the side of acceptability when it comes to anti-trans rhetoric.
1607200	1612400	He'll get pretty close to that line, making a lot of extreme statements, but he's savvy enough to
1612400	1616960	couch it in a plausible deniability that keeps him from falling outside the Overton window of
1616960	1621920	discourse. There are dozens of political commentators being bankrolled by millionaires and billionaires
1621920	1626560	trying to influence the discourse. Most of them don't succeed because their talking points don't
1626560	1630880	animate people enough. There are lots of reasons for this, and it varies from person to person,
1630880	1635360	but the short version is that their particular niche doesn't animate enough of the base.
1635360	1640400	Matt Walsh happened upon the anti-trans discord with his What is a Woman movie,
1640400	1645040	even talking about trans people for years, but this key success made him the face of a major
1645040	1650240	culture war issue. It's not just that he's anti-trans, but he's anti-trans in a way where he gets
1650240	1655760	as close to the line as possible while appearing not to cross it. Matt Walsh's success exists
1655760	1661120	entirely because of the moment he finds himself in, and getting very lucky with that movie.
1661120	1666960	In this way, pushback against him ironically keeps him relevant. If the issue of trans people were
1666960	1671520	a little more settled in people's minds and anti-trans sentiment were more commonplace,
1671520	1676160	he would lose relevance and no one would care about him. And if it were less hospitable to
1676160	1682080	be anti-trans publicly, then he would be shunned as a pariah and would similarly lose his position.
1682080	1687760	He needs to be in this extreme position to have any sense of relevancy. And while he is relevant
1687760	1692960	and popular, he could be used to animate the political base, which can be used to fuel
1692960	1697840	political change. While the far right may not be in danger of going left, they sometimes need to
1697840	1702560	be motivated to vote and organize for various causes, so they need to be riled up with hot
1702560	1707760	button issues. This is what makes Matt Walsh valuable in the right-wing media space. It's not
1707760	1712800	the value of his commentary being transformative, it's that he happens to hate the right people at
1712800	1718400	the right time in the right way that can be used to mobilize political change. Or at least that's
1718400	1722720	the assumption by the people who finance him. This is how Matt Walsh is useful. And just to
1722720	1728080	be super clear, Matt Walsh didn't invent hating trans people. And in the grand scheme of things,
1728080	1732080	his critiques are no more interesting or compelling than any other bigot. He just
1732080	1737600	happened to come up with a catchy slogan for it. And he managed to stretch out that one-glib question
1737600	1742240	into a movie. And that's how someone can make a lucrative career living just on the border of
1742240	1748160	acceptable political discourse. In other words, Matt Walsh's immorality is incredibly lucky.
1748800	1753280	Looking at the impact of anti-trans rhetoric, we can get a sense of the feelings Walsh is tapping
1753280	1757680	into. Opinion polls regarding transgender people and trans issues varies quite a bit.
1757680	1763200	In a recent Washington Post poll conducted with the KFF, they found anti-trans legislation was
1763200	1766880	quite popular, particularly when it comes to certain types of gender affirming care for
1766880	1771840	trans kids. An excerpt from that article reads, nearly seven in ten adults said they opposed
1771840	1776240	allowing children ages 10 to 14 access to medication that stops the body from going
1776240	1781200	through puberty and nearly six in ten oppose giving 15 to 17 year olds access to hormone
1781200	1786080	therapy. There was, however, majority support for gender affirming counseling or therapy,
1786080	1790960	with more than six in ten supporting this for both age groups. But looking at other polling,
1790960	1796320	for instance, a poll conducted by PBS NewsHour shows different results. In this case, the question
1796320	1800960	being asked is, do you support legislation that criminalizes providing gender affirming care for
1800960	1806960	minors? The results in this poll was that 54% opposed the bans while 43% supported them.
1806960	1811280	This comparison was made in an article for The Stranger by Alex Corin, a journalist and
1811280	1817120	researcher on transphobia. She highlighted how this poll from the Post and KFF suffers from issues
1817120	1823200	similar to polls on abortion, how questions are asked on polls matter and results shift accordingly.
1823200	1828160	She brings up another point of comparison. In a Mason Dixon poll in Kentucky, there was an even
1828160	1832880	more pronounced result when it was asked, would you support or oppose a proposed Kentucky law
1832880	1837680	that would allow the state to overrule parents' decision to obtain certain health care for their
1837680	1843520	transgender teenager, such as certain medications that can regulate the onset of puberty? In this
1843520	1850480	case, 71% opposed the legislation and 21% supported it. As Corin describes in her article, rather than
1850480	1855200	just throw certain polls out in hold of the ones we want, looking at all of this information reveals
1855200	1860880	to us that what matters to people is who decides in these issues. While people may oppose certain
1860880	1865760	types of gender affirming care personally, that does not necessarily reveal any desire for the
1865760	1869760	state to intervene and prevent parents from deciding what's best for their child. And there
1869760	1875040	are still more polls that reveal a general fatigue over trans issues being emphasized in political
1875040	1880640	discourse. Here's an excerpt from the website Roll Call about one recent poll from Data for
1880640	1885280	Progress. When asked about the more than 400 pieces of legislation working their way through
1885280	1890080	state houses aimed at limiting the rights of transgender and gay people in America,
1890080	1895680	64% of respondents, including 55% of Republicans, sided with the statement,
1895680	1900320	this is too much legislation, politicians are playing political theater, and using these
1900320	1905520	bills as a wedge issue. Compared with 25% who agreed with the statement, this is the right
1905520	1909760	amount of legislation, politicians are dealing with a real danger that needs to be addressed.
1910640	1916720	This figure rose to 78% among respondents who know a transgender person. And that last part is
1916720	1920880	especially interesting because just knowing a transgender person seems to have a dramatic
1920880	1925440	impact in all polling for supporting transgender people in general, and also underscores the
1925440	1930480	importance of representation. Seeing who these people are and the struggles they go with creates
1930480	1934960	greater degrees of sympathy and support. Other results show that the younger generation is
1934960	1939360	generally pro-trans rights, with some predicting a massive change on the topic within 10 years.
1939920	1944720	All that said, it's also true that many people are still ignorant regarding trans issues,
1944720	1949360	and remain susceptible to messengers like Walsh. That's part of what makes him particularly
1949360	1954080	valuable. One funny thing I noticed while watching Matt Walsh was he often fought back against other
1954080	1959200	figures on the right when they would criticize an emphasis on the culture wars. Okay, understand
1959200	1964240	this, if you are doing this whole focus on the economy, not the culture war thing, you are
1964240	1970960	repeating the same talking point that the GOP establishment has used for 40 years. It's because
1970960	1975040	the Republican Party, who are supposed to be ostensibly the leaders of the conservative
1975040	1979440	movement for decades now, they've been saying the culture doesn't matter, all that matters is the
1979440	1983840	economy and foreign policy, let's worry about that. And so they surrendered the culture to the left,
1983840	1990080	and now here we are. The defensiveness and lack of historical literacy here is pretty funny. The
1990080	1994000	right has been harping about culture war issues for decades. They brought them up with gay
1994000	1998720	marriage, prayer in school, and all sorts of religiously themed topics I would assume Matt
1998720	2003280	Walsh would know something about. Obviously what Matt Walsh is concerned with here is
2003280	2008640	sliding into political relevancy. Without the culture wars and specifically anti-trans rhetoric,
2008640	2013200	no one would care about what this guy has to say, so he has to cling on to it for dear life.
2013200	2016480	But the reason there's a pushback against culture war issues by the right,
2016480	2021040	at least when it comes to trans issues, is that it's a very poor political performer.
2021040	2026560	In a sub-stacked post from a user named Ettingermentum titled The Modern Electoral History of
2026560	2031120	Transphobia, we get a lengthy breakdown in how many times transphobia has failed at the ballot
2031120	2036960	box in the United States, most recently in the 2022 midterm elections. What much of the polling
2036960	2041120	highlighted early in this video fails to capture, and something I wish people would understand
2041120	2045680	broadly about any opinion poll, is that just because someone feels a way about an issue
2045680	2050160	doesn't mean that that issue will influence how they vote, or how they'll even politically
2050160	2055440	organize. For example, if ketchup had a 90% approval rating and a politician said they were
2055440	2060560	going to ban it, it probably wouldn't influence the election if voters were convinced that that
2060560	2065760	same politician had a plan that would revitalize the economy for working people. Issues like the
2065760	2070800	economy are far more important in elections than what you put on your french fries. But that speaks
2070800	2075120	to something that Ettingermentum brings up in their article. Here's an excerpt.
2075120	2079920	While general public apathy towards the issue means that voters are exceedingly unlikely
2080000	2086400	to vote for republicans because of anti-trans messaging, as has been extensively demonstrated,
2086400	2092320	it also means that politicians who pass anti-trans laws are not likely to face significant electoral
2092320	2097440	pushback over it. And that would explain why so many anti-trans laws are being passed in
2097440	2102880	red states with limited pushback. People are generally not motivated by transphobia,
2102880	2107520	whether it's to take part of the transphobia or to stand against it. And while that's great for
2107520	2113280	the former, it's tragic for the latter. These are issues that people should want to take a stand for,
2113280	2119280	to stand up for the humanity of people. And the saddest part of these polls are the people who
2119280	2125120	just seem willing to not care. And so even if someone like Bat Walsh has limited appeal,
2125120	2129200	it's important for people to know what sort of hate a goal like this is spreading because even
2129200	2133360	if it won't swing a federal election, it's still something that impacts any transgender person
2133360	2138320	living in a red state or any transgender person more broadly who's been a victim of harassment
2138320	2143280	or a hate crime. If anti-trans legislation isn't going to move the needle electorally, it does raise
2143280	2148240	the question of why do it at all. And the answer seems to be, according to Antony Grementum,
2148240	2153520	is that some of these people are just true believers. Here's another excerpt from the article.
2153520	2158480	Much like the old demographics as destiny theory that captured the Democratic Party in the 2000s
2158560	2166640	and 2010s, anti-trans or more broadly anti-woke lore is the right kind of story for the right
2166640	2172800	political class at just the right time. I swear, I thought of using that phrase to describe Bat
2172800	2177280	Walsh before reading this article, but it does speak to how his success really is a product of
2177280	2182560	very fortunate timing. And while a lot of this is being presented in this video as how it impacts
2182560	2187200	electoral politics, I do want to stress there are many other real threats impacting transgender
2187200	2192640	people outside of legislation. The frightening number of hate crimes, including murder, is fostered
2192640	2198240	by anti-trans render spread by the likes of Walsh. I'm not entirely sure he's savvy enough to be aware
2198240	2204000	that his hobby horse has no real electoral heft, but if he is, that's even worse, because instead
2204000	2208320	of being a willing tool of the right-wing media ecosystem that serves as a PR wing for the
2208320	2213600	Republican Party, he's instead using this platform he's lucked into to make as much money as he can
2213600	2218160	while spreading hatred that actively harms transgender people. There is a bit of a silver
2218160	2223600	lining here in that one-trick ponies rarely have any staying power. While transphobia will be a
2223600	2228640	long-term struggle, the fight against mediocre bigots like Matt Walsh probably won't be as long.
2229200	2233280	So the whole point of this video, I guess, is to remind everyone that the fight for trans rights
2233280	2238560	is about more than this guy, and while it's important to oppose him, the real problem is
2238560	2243440	the moment we find ourselves in when trans people are continuously under threat. Going back to the
2243440	2248560	point I mentioned earlier, most people aren't motivated by trans issues. Not caring is perfectly
2248560	2253040	fine in a better world, letting people live how they choose without making your business is a very
2253040	2257840	good and valid position. But right now we live in a world that's hostile to trans people, and that
2257840	2263360	threat is multiplied for a number of intersectional identities. So it's not just trans men and trans
2263360	2268320	women who are under threat, but also non-binary people, transgender people who are POCs or have
2268320	2272960	disabilities, or just any transgender person who might need somebody to fight alongside them.
2272960	2278080	So I guess the message I hope you all take away from this is that, when fighting for the rights
2278080	2282560	of others, it's less about fighting against a certain man and more about fighting in a certain
2282560	2288320	moment. A big thanks to all the trans creators who blended their voice to this video. I hope
2288320	2293120	you all check out their channels listed below. Once upon a time, I told myself I would never
2293120	2299680	make a video discussing Matt Walsh because he is so boring and untalented and inconsequential.
2300400	2305040	Sadly, things have changed to the point where he actually is worth some attention and some
2305040	2309760	pushback, though hopefully this video contextualized him in a way that reveals he's not so big and
2309760	2315440	scary as he poses he's just a lucky dude who happened upon a lucrative career hating the right
2315440	2321360	people. That's something to keep in mind for others of his ilk in the future. Although a year
2321360	2326480	from now I find myself making a video about Michael Knowles, someone get a wellness check
2326480	2332720	ready because I will be very, very sad that I have to even discuss that loser. If you would
