1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
In my first video, I went into detail about the leftist politics that are often on display

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
throughout much of the first nine seasons of Roseanne. If you haven't watched my video,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
maybe give it a shot. Much like the series itself, it ended on an unsatisfying note with no meaningful

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,520
conclusion. Aside from that, working class people are constantly getting crushed in a system that

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,320
isn't designed to help them. This important message was brought to us by a woman who acted

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,120
like the dictator of her show. It's one of the many contradictions of Roseanne Barr and her TV

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,840
series, and one that a viewer such as myself struggles with. Can we salvage something of the

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,880
Roseanne show in the face of Roseanne Barr's general awfulness, and truly have a show about

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,680
the working class made by people who, as far as we know, aren't shitty? Can the TV sensibilities

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,560
of the past still have something to say in the modern day? We add an indirect answer to that

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,640
question when ABC brought back Roseanne for its 10th season in 2018. But before we get to that,

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
let's have a quick catch-up with the cast of Roseanne before that 10th season revival.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
One of the true tragedies following the ending of season 9 of the series was the death of actor

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Glenn Quinn, who played Mark Healy. He passed away in 2002 of a drug overdose at the age of 32.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
Although he wouldn't be a part of the show's revival in 2018, the character was not recast,

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,680
and the character of Mark died between seasons 9 and 10. Darlene's son was given the name Mark

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,800
in honor of him. In that 20-year gap, Roseanne Barr became increasingly well-known for her

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,480
political commentary, even running for president under the Green Party banner in 2012. In 2011,

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,520
Barr reflected on her time in television in an article for Vulture, commenting briefly on the

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,360
possibility of a Roseanne reboot. Hollywood hates labor, and hates shows about labor worse than any

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,200
other thing, and that's why you won't be seeing another Roseanne anytime soon. Instead, all over

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,680
the tube, you'll find enterprising, over-medicated, painted-up capitalist whores claiming to be housewives.

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,520
But I'm not bitter. While that might make her sound like a darling Anne Cap, she isn't quite the ally

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,240
most on the left would be looking for. Here's some comments she had about the trans community.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,120
She also spoke to a number of right-wing conspiracy theories, from Pizzagate to the supposedly

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
suspicious murder of Seth Rich. And of course, her support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
is well-documented. Many of these noxious tweets have since been deleted. Sarah Gilbert, who played

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,880
Darlene, had some success of her own by creating the TV daytime talk show The Talk for CBS.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,320
It was on that show she had a brief reunion with John Goodman.

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Um, god, I don't know how to say this. I'm a talk show host.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
It was this short clip that would eventually lead to the series being revived on ABC for a 10th

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,640
season, 20 years later. The cast was reunited, and it seemed like all of America was ready to

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,920
forgive, forget, or in some cases celebrate Roseanne's rather curious political leanings,

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,440
all in an effort to warmly welcome the return of one of the biggest sitcoms of the 90s.

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,320
For the previous nine seasons, I've been trying to find some sort of value or meaning that a viewer

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,080
can discover within them. Season 10 takes the characters and context of those seasons and brings

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
them all the way into the present. But does this show exist carrying the baggage of the past,

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,960
or does that baggage make it something more than a show starting from scratch,

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,320
and can it escape the shadow of its titular star, Roseanne?

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:48,400
In the first episode of season 10, 20 years to life, we are reintroduced to most of the familiar

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,600
faces from the show. Dan and Roseanne are in old age, still struggling to get by, Becky works as

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,560
a waitress for a Mexican restaurant, Darlene, after losing her job in Chicago, is forced to

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,360
move back in with her parents, now a single mother with two kids, Harris and Mark. DJ,

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,520
a veteran home from fighting in the Middle East, struggles to pay his bills and raise his daughter

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,920
Mary. His wife, Gina, is still deployed in Syria. And Jackie is still single, trying to find someone

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
to love her. A few serious regulars have cameos throughout the season, updating us all on their

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
whereabouts, but in most cases they seem to be right where we left them 20 years ago, struggling

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,440
to survive in a town where the rules seem written for people who aren't them, likely informed by

49
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Roseanne Barr's political profile. The first episode runs into the political commentaries

50
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,720
whether Jackie and Roseanne haven't been speaking since the 2016 election that put Donald Trump into

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,320
the White House. As you may have noticed, in that nearly one hour and 20 minutes I spent rambling

52
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,880
about the first nine seasons, I never mentioned the characters delving into partisan politics,

53
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,480
largely because they didn't. Taken from an interview in 1992, Barr told the LA Times that

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,720
when it comes to the politics of the Conner family, they're somewhere in the middle of it all,

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,600
not knowing what anything stands for anymore. So really, what they do is go to work and come

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,720
to be with their family and try to make do. Even the Conners aren't spared the burden of partisanship

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,920
in 2018, and this partisanship was what brought the show a lot of attention. Its first episode was

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,720
a breakout success, and it seemed like Roseanne was set for another run at the top of primetime,

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,440
or might have been if 2018 was as tolerant of those stars' eccentricities as the 1990s have been.

60
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,960
The first thing I noticed in this first episode of Roseanne's tenth season is the passage of time,

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,000
not just the faces of the actors, but the very production of the show. Multi-camera sitcoms

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
filmed in front of a live studio audience are increasingly rare, most opt for the single-camera

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,520
style you would see on a drama series. Roseanne stays true to its roots, though, with a loving

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,920
recreation of all the sights of the old Conner home. It's as though these characters have been

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,280
living this endless loop of their hopeless sitcom lives for the past 20 years. But the subtext

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,920
here isn't that the Conners' lives are still sorted, but rather the lives of the working class

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,320
are still desperate. We can smile nostalgically at how nothing has changed for the Conners,

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,080
but applying the same truth to the people they represent is heartbreaking.

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,840
Although now in old age, a new host of problems present themselves, like a lack of healthcare.

70
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:33,120
There are also strange new problems that aren't really problems, such as not really

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:51,760
understanding a non-gender conforming grandson. The generational split from the earlier seasons

72
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,600
is even more pronounced, and with a third generation in the mix, more than ever we get

73
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:18,800
a sense of how old and out of date Roseanne and Dan are. Things are brought into sharper focus when

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,880
we find out Becky, desperate for cash, is going to be a surrogate for, well, the other Becky,

75
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,360
although she's playing a new character, Andrea, in this season. The payment of $50,000 is too much

76
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,000
for Becky to ignore, and we get an interesting callback to an earlier episode, where a woman's

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
body is her choice, regardless of, in this case, what her father may think.

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:08:09,440
It's a reminder of how, even though the Conners are older and less in step with modern discourse,

79
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,880
they aren't completely hopeless. That said, the show genuinely seems to be asking the question

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,400
if there's anything they can still say that's of value. Dan's frustration is symbolic of that,

81
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,760
that the old relic he is no longer has a say in how the world works. To be honest, he never had

82
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,320
much of a say in the old show, but he did carry weight and authority, as father typically does.

83
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,960
Roseanne's acquiescence was also huge, letting Becky decide for herself, even if later on she

84
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,520
admitted she really didn't want her to be a surrogate. Just watching the show feels like

85
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,160
slipping back in time, but what part do we want to go back to? And more importantly, how can

86
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,200
revisiting the past help us in the present? Let's do a quick comparison between season 10 and an

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,400
episode from the original run of the series. Back in season 3, the episode Trick or Treat includes

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,680
some interesting gender bedding, as DJ wants to dress as a witch for Halloween, and Roseanne

89
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,360
dresses up as a man. We do get her a few revealing lines from Dan.

90
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:37,280
And this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Dan's anxiety about his son's

91
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,480
masculinity. He's worried about it. That said, they do resolve it nicely by the end of the show.

92
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,240
But overall, particularly the scenes with Roseanne, this episode feels like a missed

93
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,120
opportunity. We get a sampling of the violence and toxic masculinity, but it's hidden behind

94
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,560
far too many cheap jokes about men's bathroom habits. Season 10's take on the issue of not

95
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,800
being gender conforming is different. In Dress to Impress, Mark's dressing up in traditionally

96
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,560
female clothing makes Dan and Roseanne concerned. We have a surprisingly sweet scene between

97
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,280
grandmother and grandson. Okay, I'm gonna ask you something kind of adult, but you're growing up and

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:34,560
I think you can handle it. Do you feel like you're a boy or a girl? A boy? Well, you answered that

99
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:42,560
pretty quick. I thought it was going to be more complicated. So what's up with the girl's clothes?

100
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
This just feels like me. I like colors that pop. It's more creative.

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,320
Well, your mom's creative, so I get that, but here's the thing. You've got to pick your fights

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:05,120
in life. How important is this to you? It's important. Okay. Well, you know it's going to

103
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:15,520
be rough on you at school, right? But we'll back you up. Dan's advice of giving Mark a knife does

104
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,960
less good. So you admit it. You were trying to make it more masculine. When did masculine become

105
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,680
a dirty word? And no, I'm not. I'm scared for him. If I don't get what's going on, what do you

106
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,240
think a classroom full of 10 year olds from Lanford is going to do? But Mark proves surprisingly

107
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,160
resilient. But if things get rough, I put pants and a t-shirt in your backpack and you know what?

108
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You're still going to be you. No, I won't. I'm fine, Mom. Well, what if that kid teases you again or

109
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,320
pushes you down or something? He'll get tired of it eventually. I like my clothes. In some ways,

110
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
it's refreshing to see a kid who can so effectively stand up for himself. That said,

111
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,600
what precisely does Mark need from his grandparents? He has support from his mother and proves how

112
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,840
strong he already is. Note that some of that toughness is a Connor trait inherited from his

113
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,160
grandparents, but a trait that doesn't need shaping the way it needed shaping in Becky,

114
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,400
Darlene, and DJ. If anything, the show is addressing the older people in the audience,

115
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,680
telling them that non-gender conformity is okay and the real problem is the kids who tease Mark.

116
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,480
In other words, the social pressure. The original series never escaped the gender binary,

117
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,040
and season 10 doesn't quite get away from that either. That said, it does at least delve into

118
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,440
the idea that gender norms are performative and lets a child explore those boundaries in a way

119
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
where it isn't him learning his place in the world, but his world learning how to accept him.

120
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,320
In the original run of the series, though, being non-gender conforming is a part of a holiday

121
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
tradition. When it comes to wearing those non-gender conforming clothes every day,

122
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,120
that's a tougher bridge to cross for Roseanne and Dan. I think the progression seen in these

123
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,080
episodes is pretty neat. It shows how society can take steps forward quicker than people,

124
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080
and that isn't always the bad thing. While it doesn't make Roseanne and Dan monsters for

125
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,000
falling behind the times, it definitely shows us that they're out of touch with what their

126
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
grandchildren need to be happy. It also doesn't completely discard their experiences as old

127
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
fogeys. They knew Mark would be teased, and they wanted to help. They just didn't know how to do

128
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,720
it. In Roseanne Gets the Chair, we get even more extreme parenting advice from Roseanne when Harris

129
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
is shown to be completely walking all over Darlene. And this time, it's kinda messed up.

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Let's go back to the original run of the series for a moment. In the Season 6 episode,

131
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,400
The Driver's Seat, this episode includes a plotline where DJ steals Roseanne's car

132
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,600
and gets caught by the cops. Roseanne's reaction is pretty dark.

133
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm really sorry that I hit you, DJ. I was totally wrong. I never should have done that.

134
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm so mad at myself for doing it.

135
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,440
Mad and, you know, kind of embarrassed. Wrong.

136
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Lots of way that I used to feel when I got hit. Who hit you?

137
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,640
Your grandpa hit me. A lot. What'd you do wrong?

138
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,720
I mean, I breathed or something. Do you hate him?

139
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,360
Yes, sometimes. You know, because the worst thing was that, you know, he never,

140
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,840
ever said he was sorry for any of it, you know. I don't want you to hit me,

141
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,320
DJ. I'm really sorry that I hit you. No matter what, I'm never gonna hit you again, ever.

142
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,760
No matter what I do? No matter what you do, ever.

143
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:45,440
I'm sorry you got hit. I'm sorry you got hit, too. I mean, big sorry.

144
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Right now would be a great time to ask me for a new puppy's kind of sorry.

145
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,720
This episode really demonstrated the cycle of abuse and how victims can still be capable of abuse

146
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,760
themselves. There were several episodes that documented Roseanne Connor's abuse at the hands

147
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,400
of her father that I didn't get to touch on in my first video, but it's an important bit of context

148
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,080
that sadly gets lost in season 10. This season 10 revival of Roseanne supposedly has the old

149
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,360
working-class ethics revived in it, but in this episode we see some real abuse of her granddaughter.

150
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,840
Is this really the Roseanne Connor from earlier seasons, or is this the Trump supporting

151
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,280
reimagining of what she was? This moment reminds me of the strange rebranding of Roseanne as a

152
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,160
conservative hero. Sure, she was a dreadful person in the 90s, but unless she was full of shit with

153
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
her critiques of how the government and society left the working class behind, she obviously

154
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,760
wasn't a member of the right. The character of Roseanne was heartbroken when she hit DJ, but

155
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,160
now she's willing to hold her granddaughter's head underwater, have the perceptions of the

156
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
writers of Roseanne Barr being on the right colored their perspective of the character of

157
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Roseanne Connor. Well, people parent differently than they did in your day. Turns out a lot of

158
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,720
what you did did not work, and some of it was against the law. Yeah, it's against the law

159
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,560
because your generation made everything so PC. Instead of spanking them, you tell them to go

160
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,240
over there and think about what they did wrong. You know what they're thinking? I can't believe

161
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,480
this loser isn't spanking me. We get a conclusion to the Becky surrogate storyline when we tragically

162
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,840
learn that Becky is too old to have children in Eggs Over Not Easy, which is just a cruel title

163
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,520
to be honest. Even with interventions, I'd say you have less than a five percent chance of ever

164
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,960
getting pregnant. I know you've both been looking forward to this, I'm sorry. It coalesces into a

165
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,880
hard truth about Becky's life these past 20 years. I don't know if you can see yourself frozen in

166
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,720
the same place since Mark died, but everybody else can. I wouldn't have changed anything.

167
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:03,040
I can't have kids. You said you didn't want kids. I thought I had more time. Was 50 grand really

168
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,200
going to change Becky's life forever? Probably would have gotten her a few years if she were

169
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,080
lucky. Things don't magically get better when someone gives you a bit of extra money. What Becky

170
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,360
really needs is a change to her life, a change to the world she lives in where she can find a way

171
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,960
of surviving without having to be some sort of baby machine, a subtle bit of commentary about

172
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,120
the role of women in our society and how their worth is determined based on whether or not they

173
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,560
can squeeze out a baby. On the lighter side for a moment, this episode also reminds us that John

174
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,600
Goodman is fantastic with physical comedy. Look at the expression on his face here.

175
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:16,640
In Go Cubs, the Conners, Roseanne in particular, are confronted with Muslim neighbors,

176
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,120
Samir and Fatima. It's here we get one of those episodes where the Conners are faced with their

177
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,080
own bigotry, but in a way that's less subtle than previous episode. Roseanne seems especially racist.

178
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,080
What if this is a sleeper cell full of terrorists getting ready to blow up our neighborhood?

179
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,960
This is what people from Iraq and Taliban just stand do.

180
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,040
They hide out in neighborhoods like Lanford. Don't you watch the news?

181
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,480
Her opinion changes when she encounters her neighbor at a grocery store.

182
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,880
It says insufficient funds. You're $30 short. Um, I didn't know. Sorry, maybe the American

183
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:05,040
taxpayers forgot to fill it up last week. Excuse me? I'm an American taxpayer sometimes.

184
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,280
Put it on my EBT card. You don't need to do that. Well, we're stealing your cable,

185
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,120
so this probably makes us even. Maybe you can help her carry the groceries out to her camel too.

186
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:32,400
Roseanne's growth happens less in a moment of self-reflection and more in a moment of empathy

187
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,040
when she sees what bigotry looks like. Unlike the complicated and messy bigotry of the earlier

188
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,120
seasons, in episodes like White Man Can't Kiss, this story is straightforward. Bigotry like this

189
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,120
certainly exists, and there's certainly no harm in showing Roseanne changing her way when she

190
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,000
observes it, but in some ways this feels more old-fashioned than the Roseanne episodes of 20

191
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,400
years earlier, the few that dared to tackle the issue to begin with. Some interesting behind the

192
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,040
scenes commentary for this episode is that the idea of giving Roseanne Connor Muslim neighbors

193
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,920
apparently came from Barr herself. On the other hand, one of the former writers of the Roseanne

194
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,800
series speaking anonymously to Buzzfeed said, I don't recognize that character. I believe the

195
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,560
original character would have said, who cares about having Muslim neighbors? And now she's

196
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,920
saying she does care. This might be another case of Roseanne Barr's Trump support being projected

197
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,200
onto the character of Roseanne Connor. As a sharper point of comparison, the third season

198
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,600
brought us the Bowman's wealthy neighbors who also moved in across the street from the Connors.

199
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,320
Your living room reminds me of ours.

200
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Well, I'm not quite finished with it yet. The tension between Roseanne and Kathy Bowman is

201
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,640
immediate, as Kathy is incapable of accepting the living conditions of her working-class neighborhood.

202
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,840
This episode, like other episodes that include the Bowman's, highlight the class differences that

203
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,720
animate what the series was about. It's no coincidence that the hostility to the Connors

204
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,680
come from right outside their home, as if the society right outside their doors against them,

205
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,200
and the only comfort they can have is within their happy little home. Well, happy being a relative

206
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,560
term. In season 10, the roles have been reversed. The Connor household is where the hostility is

207
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,200
coming from, and it takes the shape of prejudice towards their neighbors based on their ethnicity.

208
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,280
In some ways, this feels like a microcosm of what the original nine seasons of the series missed.

209
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,320
It was very good at pointing out the snobbery of the upper class, a la Kathy Bowman, but when it

210
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,360
came to the racial bigotry of the Connors, it was relegated to a handful of episodes, and often

211
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,920
struggled to really grasp where the other side was coming from. In many ways, it highlights how

212
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,720
a white working-class family is a great setting for discussions about class, but less so for ones

213
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:59,520
about race. So, actually, Roseanne. I'm going to have to disagree on that one. The eighth episode,

214
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,320
Netflix and Pill, delves into Roseanne's pain pill addiction. She had been suffering a bad

215
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,400
knee all season, and this episode reveals she had been hiding pills all over the house.

216
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,040
The champagne on the Vicodin should say, do not take it with label.

217
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,320
But the good news is, my knees are gone.

218
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,960
How did you possibly have taken more Vicodin? I didn't even get the prescription yet.

219
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,160
Well, you better get on it, because my secret bottles are running low.

220
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,400
You don't have any idea how bad it hurts. Yeah, I do. I get a bad back.

221
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,880
And when your back goes out, you lay on the couch for two weeks, and I wait on you hand and foot.

222
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,760
You know what happens when my knee hurts? I do the cleaning, the shopping, the cooking.

223
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,320
Fine, I'll do all that. Just show me where the water bucket is and the sponge on the stick thingy.

224
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,680
Roseanne's addiction is a product of their poverty, not being able to afford knee surgery.

225
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,920
It's a portrait of addiction that also doesn't blame the addict, and shows how people are driven

226
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,480
into it not because of loose morals, but desperation. It sums up what the show has

227
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,640
always tried to be about, whether we relate to the Conners directly or we're getting a glimpse

228
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,360
of the people we may have looked down on. Either way, we're confronted with people in shitty

229
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,400
situations that aren't of their own making. They're people making do as best they can with what

230
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,160
they've got. In the final episode of season 10, and consequently of Roseanne, knee deep,

231
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,360
a flood hits Lanford and the cost of repairing the foundation drove Dan to hire illegal immigrants

232
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,800
in an effort to win a bid on a drywall job, leaving his longtime friend Chuck out in the cold.

233
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,200
What do you want me to do? I got three extra mouths to feed since Darlene moved back in.

234
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,320
Roseanne started popping pills because we didn't have the money to fix her knee,

235
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,840
and now I got 20 grand of water damage. I spent my whole life hanging on by my fingertips telling

236
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,520
everybody not to worry that I was going to make it okay because that's my job. Well, now I can't

237
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,160
promise that anymore. So yeah, it makes me sick, but I'm going to do whatever I have to do to take

238
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:43,040
care of my family because I'm old, I'm tired, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on.

239
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,840
Well, I'm old too, and I'm tired, and now I'm unemployed. I always told you, if I'm eating,

240
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,160
you're eating. I'm not eating. As the family is pushed closer to financial ruin, they're saved

241
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,200
when the president declares a state of emergency, which means a FEMA program that will help cover

242
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,000
the damages. You have young children rooting for other people's misery. He just declared it!

243
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,560
With that problem mostly solved, Roseanne can finally go under the knife for knee surgery,

244
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,360
and the Connors get the chance to enjoy a meal together, their last meal, at least under the

245
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,600
banner of Roseanne. The series ends in a low-key way, almost as if they were expected another

246
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,480
season. A broken-off series can feel incomplete, but does Roseanne's story really feel like it's

247
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,880
missing pages? She had 10 seasons of stories, even with an abbreviated tenth. Old problems are joined

248
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,560
by new ones, and anything that's solved never lasts. The Connors are in some ways the victims

249
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,240
of the TV culture Roseanne parodied in its original run. They can never change, or else

250
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,520
we'd stop caring about them. It's also what makes them feel real, the same way we rarely ascend from

251
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,880
our own circumstances. Working class stays working class, and the series shows that it's not because

252
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,200
they're shitty people, but they're in a society that doesn't really give a shit about them.

253
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,560
The sudden end of the series came on May 29th when Roseanne Barr made a racist comment about

254
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,320
one of President Obama's senior advisors, Valerie Jarrett. The Roseanne show was cancelled hours

255
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:42,960
later. Her defense for her actions was… well… Following this video, the next day she released

256
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,680
an official statement, filmed in the same setting with a more tranquil Roseanne. In longer

257
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,080
interviews she would place the blame more squarely on her ambient usage influencing her.

258
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:14,080
I'm not sure if she said the same for the many other incendiary tweets she's made over the years.

259
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,600
Barr's castmates immediately turned on her as one would if someone tweeted out a racist insult.

260
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,000
With that tweet, Roseanne was able to do something very special for one of the questions I asked at

261
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,200
the beginning of this video. Can we have a socially conscious show like Roseanne, but without

262
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,320
Roseanne Barr herself? The answer so far is… kind of. And it comes in the form of The Conners.

263
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:49,760
In the months that followed Barr's exit, rumors swirled about a new show focusing on Darlene

264
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,560
Connor. Darlene's importance in higher profile in season 10 seemed to set the stage quite nicely,

265
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,240
but ultimately what we got was the more neutral title of The Conners, and a shared focus on Darlene

266
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,920
and Dan. In the first episode, Keep on Trucking premiered on October 16th. It picked up right

267
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,720
where last season left off, only this time following the sudden death of Roseanne Connor.

268
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:46,480
Roseanne's death is used to immediately spring towards the social issue that had been in the

269
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,680
background of season 10, and that was covered briefly in episode 8 of that season, Roseanne's

270
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,280
addiction to pain pills. If you'll remember that episode, Roseanne's problem wasn't brought about

271
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,320
by her moral degeneracy or any sort of personal issue, but rather her character's lack of access

272
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,600
to proper medical care that she couldn't afford knee surgery when she desperately needed it.

273
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,880
That addiction was created in an effort to cope with a real physical problem that could have been

274
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,000
addressed with proper medical care. In this episode of The Conners, it highlights the underground pill

275
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,120
community in Lanford, and most strikingly how these people aren't horrible drug dealers, but

276
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,040
people trying to help each other survive. Nobody can afford their meds. We all help each other. When

277
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,480
Sally Benson needed Lipitor for her husband's cholesterol, they got some from Maria Ramirez,

278
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,360
and they gave her the anxiety meds. She needed for some because they dropped her insurance.

279
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:53,120
Rosie needed painkillers. I had some, so I gave them to her. So you're part of a neighborhood

280
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,360
drug ring. Congratulations to you. You know what, Dan? You can judge, but Roseanne called me.

281
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,040
She told me that her knee wasn't healing up fast enough, and I was the only person she could turn

282
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,840
to. She said that she needed those pain pills to get back to work because you guys were running

283
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,640
out of money. It's important to acknowledge that access to care isn't a perfect safeguard against

284
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,680
addiction, as it is possible for doctors to overprescribe, but a doctor is still a better source

285
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,080
of medication than some nice lady who lives down the street. More broadly for this show, it

286
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,440
demonstrates what the Connors can be without Roseanne by underscoring what the original show was at its

287
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,560
best. The character of Roseanne is the premise upon which real issues affecting working-class

288
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,120
people can be discussed. Whether she's alive or dead matters less than the fact that she's a

289
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,320
catalyst for this discussion to begin. A dead character can't direct conversations in a show,

290
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,640
so her dying kind of ends that. It does open the door for the rest of the family to center

291
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,520
those discussions around themselves and the problems that they face, all while keeping their

292
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:17,200
trademark sense of humor. One thing season 10 of Roseanne made a nominal attempt to do was

293
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,640
offer a fig leaf to right-wing audience members, and the first season of The Connors does something

294
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,000
similar. In the third episode, There Won't Be Blood, Halloween, a favorite holiday in the

295
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,720
Connor household, sets the stage for a small controversy about Halloween costumes.

296
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:58,720
Darlene's son Mark is soon refused entry into a school carnival where he dresses as Frida Kahlo.

297
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:44,880
This is the red meat episode, a tip of the hat to an argument you more often hear from the right

298
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,400
that isn't completely without merit, and an example of a show trying to be balanced. From

299
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,440
a leftist perspective, there is still value in this episode. Much like in the second episode of

300
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,720
season 10 of Roseanne, the Mark-centric episode focuses on his wardrobe, something you certainly

301
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,520
don't see reflected in stories about young boys on TV. Although this could be framed as strictly

302
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,320
an episode for conservatives to reel about political correctness affecting Halloween costumes,

303
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,840
I would rather look at how it's framing the discussion in a way that would support a young

304
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,840
boy's decision to dress in something non-traditional male. This is the sort of

305
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,680
compromise that I think can leave both sides happy. Fancy that. This episode also introduces

306
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,960
us to Jackie's new boyfriend, Peter, played by Matthew Broderick.

307
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:48,640
One big change for this series is Dan's new role as the voice of reason. In the Roseanne show,

308
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
his voice was paired with Roseanne's, so he didn't have quite the patriarchal role that has fallen

309
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,240
so heavily on him in this series. In the fifth episode, Miracles, we can see that new role after

310
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:21,920
Becky announces she's pregnant and plans on raising the child alone. This episode also introduces love

311
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,280
interests for both Becky and Darlene. Respectively, they are Emilio, played by René Rosado,

312
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:43,200
and Ben, played by J.R. Ferguson. This episode highlights growing diversity within the series.

313
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,120
Emilio is going to be a bigger force than you might expect, and his role has a political

314
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,760
dimension that makes perfect sense. Previous incarnation of the show often did shy away from

315
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,040
racial issues, but this one isn't. That seems like an improvement to me. An important realization that

316
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,800
when talking about the working class in the United States, you shouldn't leave out the Hispanic

317
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,000
population and the unique problems they face. The romance between Ben and Darlene is cute,

318
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,480
and it shows that what appeals to the bulldozer personality of a strong female character like

319
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,240
Darlene isn't a pushover like David or a strong man to dominate her, but a man that's her match.

320
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,320
I would love the three shrimp tacos. Pick something else. A lot of shrimp is peeled

321
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,400
by Thai kids forced into slave labor, so you think you're eating scampi, but really you're

322
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,560
exploiting children. I got an idea. What if I just had one small shrimp taco and I feel bad about it?

323
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Have the chile relleno. They're really good here. They're vegan. Yeah, I really like those. No, you will.

324
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,040
Well, I think I speak for everyone in the internet department when I say I think we can go out

325
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,480
for dinner. What do you like? Uh, Chinese. I could go for some shrimp fried rice.

326
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,480
You probably, you probably don't know this. Uh, most of the shrimp we eat isn't processed

327
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:12,480
ethically, so you don't want to get that. Oh, you're confused. You thought I was a child when

328
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm actually a grown-ass adult. Yeah, I didn't mean to push. That's not who I am. Oh, great.

329
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,320
Ben is her boss, though she does get a promotion within the first episode and is clearly on her

330
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,560
way up to being his equal, but the fact that he's still her boss says something about economic

331
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,080
disparity. Ben obviously isn't rich, but he seems to be a step ahead of Darlene in the world. The

332
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,520
wage gap exists in all classes, even the working class. This can be viewed through that lens,

333
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,560
rather than the gender dynamics of a man having power over a woman. It isn't trying to reinforce

334
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,320
the patriarchy. It's about how capitalism uses the patriarchy to present supposedly natural power

335
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,800
dynamics between men and women. Women's work is less valuable, and look at that, the man is the

336
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,440
boss. Continuing on that theme of working class issues that don't just affect white people,

337
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,880
in episode 10, Don't Shoot the Piano Teacher, we learn specifically that Emilio is an illegal

338
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,160
immigrant. Is he here illegally? Well, who cares if he's illegal? Who cares if he's a busboy?

339
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,920
A lot of people with difficult beginnings have risen above their station in life,

340
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,800
Dan. I mean, nobody in our family, but I've read about it. It's pretty inspirational when it

341
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:31,440
happens. And we see Dan evolve on the subject. Look, I gotta be honest with you. I don't like

342
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,960
the way you got here. You broke the law and you could be putting me in a bad situation,

343
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,320
but I want to help my daughter, so I have to help you. I understand. Dan's position on hiring

344
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,800
undocumented immigrants is less of a difficult question when it comes to helping his daughter.

345
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Dan also realizes something. Rather than the hideous drug dealer caricature presented by,

346
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,040
say, the president of the United States, Emilio is a hardworking guy who's come to the United States

347
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,160
to make a better life for himself. Dan doesn't have to like the way Emilio entered the country,

348
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,600
but he also can't deny that his family's lives would be better if he was there.

349
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,040
Becky's fear of Emilio being deported is a callback to her fear of being left behind again,

350
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,000
the same way Mark left her behind when he died. While the deportation angle doesn't enter into

351
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,400
her mind in a racist context, it does color her relationship with him. How can she think of

352
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
building a life with him, even if he says he'll be around, when he might be gone the next day?

353
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,200
Why are you pushing him into my life? Because you're being stubborn and stupid. I'm sorry. I'm

354
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,880
a life coach. You're being overly rooted and intelligent adjacent. What is your problem?

355
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,320
You know what my problem is? I've been doing fine. So why should I start depending on somebody who

356
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,040
might not be here when I need him? Living in fear prevents undocumented immigrants from reaching a

357
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,720
greater potential. The season finale, we continue to truck ends with a few major bombshells. Jackie

358
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,120
breaks up with her boyfriend, Peter, after she finds out he's been cheating on her.

359
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,240
I'm with you and not her. A stupid affair doesn't mean I love you any less.

360
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,040
Don't throw what we have away by being so narrow-minded and provincial.

361
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,640
Don't play your mind games with me. This isn't my fault.

362
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,160
Isn't it Jackie?

363
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,760
Don't let your insecurity drive away another man.

364
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,880
Oh my god. Dan told me you were taking advantage of me and I didn't listen because I was weak.

365
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600
You're not weak.

366
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,040
Well, not anymore. I'm not.

367
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,840
Oh, ow. Ow, ow. That hurt.

368
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,080
Good. Well, then that means I'm doing it right.

369
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,560
This leads Jackie to a bit of a breakdown, and it really highlights what the first season has been

370
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,920
about, and that's loss. Dealing with the loss of Roseanne and trying to organize their lives

371
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,360
around the gaping hole her absence has created. In many ways, the show itself is still struggling

372
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,680
to fill that missing role of Roseanne Connor. To get those characters back to a place where they

373
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,880
could be happy, Jackie's breakdown at the end is the sad realization that they can never go back.

374
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
They'll never be happy the way they used to be.

375
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:12,080
Me and my sister. We owned the place. We called it the lunchbox, and it was the last place I was

376
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,600
happy. It's entirely possible things will change in future seasons, and it seems to be building in

377
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,560
that direction, but it really demonstrates how families just don't bounce back from a trauma.

378
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,800
The working class vibe is present, but it's understated compared to the earlier incarnation

379
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,360
of the show, and its plays are more personal intersectional stories, touching on the Hispanic

380
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
working class experience in Emilio.

381
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,800
It's Emilio, right?

382
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,160
Taking me to Tejas, and then turning me over to authorities in Juarez,

383
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,520
I will find a way back to you and our baby after a short time in Chihuahua.

384
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,360
In the city, no big dog.

385
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,120
Characters of color are a welcome addition, and generally add new dimensions to the show,

386
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,440
though there hasn't been much racial commentary with Gina and Mary. It also would have been nice

387
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,360
to see something more of Gina outside of her intense religiosity.

388
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,280
Well, you can gamble with your souls if you want, but my family's going to church.

389
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,120
Aunt Darlene doesn't make Mark and Harris go, so why do I have to?

390
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,240
Because I say so.

391
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,800
These may be for future seasons.

392
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,160
Gina Connor, would you stand and be recognized?

393
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,000
Baby, people stop raising the roof in 2005.

394
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,360
Can we have Roseanne without Roseanne?

395
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,280
The answer is yes.

396
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,960
Sort of.

397
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,400
But it's not like so many of these stories couldn't or wouldn't be done in an 11th season of Roseanne.

398
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,120
It feels more like the show is picking up where it left off,

399
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,640
trying to cut off the toxic elements of the previous series, including Roseanne Barr herself.

400
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,480
In some ways, the series didn't really need her to begin with,

401
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,440
although in other ways it absolutely did because it was named for her and was a vehicle for her.

402
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,840
One joke Roseanne Barr demanded to be put in the first episode of season 10 was about Hillary Clinton,

403
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,280
to at least try to balance all the jokes about Donald Trump.

404
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,720
Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should grow up and be president,

405
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,200
even if they're a liar liar pantsuit on fire.

406
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,400
And it makes me wonder what other things Roseanne would have demanded be included in future seasons.

407
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,200
In many ways, she was a passenger in season 10.

408
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,480
But season 11?

409
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,200
Season 12?

410
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,200
Considering how her influence grew throughout the first nine seasons,

411
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,920
I think it's a decent assumption that her controlling personality would have bled to the fore

412
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,040
and had a heavier influence on the direction of the show.

413
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,040
It'll be interesting to see how the Conners grow in the future, without Roseanne's influence.

414
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,560
That'll give it a freer hand to be what it wants, but what does it want to be?

415
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,760
A show about the working class, in all its many shapes and forms,

416
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
and how it struggles to get by in America today?

417
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,360
That's possible, but not without more work to deliver on some of the early promises of its first season.

418
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,280
It's a show that has a lot of baggage, but maybe that's what makes it feel all the more real,

419
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
and maybe that's how it connects to people.

420
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,800
In an interview she gave, Sarah Gilbert reflected on what the first season of The Conners accomplished.

421
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,240
In this context, she's discussing the final episode of the first season.

422
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,440
Some of the emotions of the premiere come up again in this episode.

423
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,520
That's something that was really important to me.

424
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,080
I didn't want to do a sitcom version of Lost where there's one very special episode,

425
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,400
and then it's done and everybody moves on.

426
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,560
This episode shows that emotional themes run through people's lives, and not just through a week.

427
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Perhaps most importantly, The Conners gave us a chance to enjoy a show that dramatized

428
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,000
in the struggles of the working class in an entertaining way,

429
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,920
just as the first nine seasons of Roseanne did, and just as the tenth season did.

430
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,440
Though The Conners may never shake the ghost of its upbringing,

431
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,840
it does point to a better future we can work towards,

432
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,240
one that builds off the strengths of its past and hopefully leaves its weaknesses behind.

433
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,120
One of its best strengths was highlighting the humor and joy that sustains people,

434
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,360
even when the world seems to be forgetting them.

435
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,720
While some may feel affinity in the hollow words of a conman,

436
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,040
we can still learn about the struggles of these characters and perhaps even more from their

437
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,480
failings, and hopefully it can create an awareness that this is a society not working for the working

438
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,040
class, and from there, maybe the realization that it can be changed for the better.

439
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,800
If Roseanne can get rid of its toxicity to become The Conners,

440
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,160
why can't we be better and remove the toxicity from our own world?
