0	2220	Part 2 of 2.
2220	6900	And looking back on this week, I can safely say I'm so glad it's over.
6900	20900	The world is weird, it makes me nervous, I get to talk about it, but how I say.
20900	24620	Only touches on the subject in a few videos, I did want to highlight this specifically
24620	28500	because it encapsulates what right-wing propaganda does so effectively.
28500	32160	Even if Tim doesn't think of himself as right-wing, the fact that he parrots their
32160	35840	talking points uncritically makes his personal opinions irrelevant.
35840	39520	When it comes to trans issues, he helps spread a conservative narrative.
39520	46400	In Far Leftists Are Tearing, JK Rowling to Shreds after a transphobic tweet.
46400	51360	Tim came out, as you might have guessed, in favor of JK Rowling and her transphobic tweet.
51360	56600	If JK Rowling is going to speak up for a woman who is unjustly fired, she did the right thing.
56600	60500	And this is exactly what you can expect from the fringe, authoritarian left who want to
60500	65860	now destroy her over this.
65860	67760	Male and female exist.
67760	68940	She is correct.
68940	72340	She said gender expression identity is different and people can express themselves however
72340	73420	they want.
73420	76380	She took the fair and reasonable approach.
76380	81180	She actually ceded the gender framing to the left.
81180	86180	But because she said male and female are real, and a male can never become a female, that's
86180	87180	it.
87180	102000	Before covering the trans issue, I'd like to note Tim's framing of JK Rowling in general.
102000	106320	When Rowling does something that might appeal to the left, like revealing one of her characters
106320	109140	was actually gay, it's considered pandering.
109140	113560	But when appealing to the right, by defending a turf, she's apparently standing up for
113560	115100	something she believes in.
115100	118920	This is another example of how Tim frames left and right-wing opinions.
118920	123760	One is cynical and disingenuous, and the other one is genuine and heartfelt.
123760	127840	The story of the woman Rowling was tweeting her support of could make for a whole video
127840	131940	in and of itself, but I want to focus on Tim's opinions about trans people and how these
131940	133740	opinions frame his commentary.
133740	138880	Up until the point we develop technology that can radically alter your DNA and reconstruct
138880	144280	your body at the cellular level, males cannot become female or vice versa.
144280	148920	Now you can become a trans, you know, you can transition, and you can present as male
148920	152160	or female, but that's different from literally being as such.
152160	153520	He backs this up by saying,
153520	154580	They're facts!
154580	156480	It's biological fact!
156480	157720	Where's reality going?
157720	159660	This is the standard right-wing talking point.
159660	163480	When someone is assigned male or female at birth, this is something stamped on them to
163480	168340	never be altered or changed, and something that is apparently instantly evident at the
168340	169840	moment of birth.
169840	174920	Let's jump ahead to Hollywood leftists just proved they are spineless cowards bending
174920	177480	the knee to far-left Twitter Roddy.
177480	179720	He's very concerned about science in this one.
179720	181660	I have some bad news for people.
181660	182740	Science is a thing.
182740	187240	And you can't just say something is anti-science without actually having academia to back it
187240	188240	up.
188240	192080	In this video, Tim goes off against GLAAD and HRC, who, you would think, might know
192080	193580	something about trans people.
193580	196200	But Tim is about to blow them out of the water.
196200	198800	He opens with this powerful statement.
198800	199800	My opinion.
199800	201440	I am not saying these things to be hurtful.
201440	206880	I am saying that currently, based on human knowledge and the structure of the English
206880	211240	language, what they said is just fundamentally false.
211240	216640	If you Google the word woman, they tell you a woman is an adult human female.
216640	220320	And now we are getting to the point where definitions literally don't make sense.
220320	221700	But he doesn't stop there.
221700	224440	He goes with the strongest science he knows.
224440	225760	Here's the Wikipedia page for women.
225760	228200	I have shown this many a time.
228200	231640	It says, a woman is a female human being.
231640	233520	The word woman is usually reserved for an adult.
233520	236800	Girl is usually the term for a female child or adolescent.
236800	242040	The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases
242040	243360	such as women's rights.
243360	247320	My favorite part is when he gets to the section on the page that explains trans women are
247320	249960	also women, and he just gets angry about it.
249960	253160	However, it also says some women are trans.
253160	256180	That literally makes no sense.
256180	258580	If you want it to be true, that's fine.
258580	262460	It's not an argument about opinions or ideology, I'm literally telling you.
262460	265060	You can't simultaneously say at the same time.
265060	268500	A woman is a female human being, and some women are trans.
268500	274060	The some women are trans would then actually mean that some women are trans men.
274060	277620	So Wikipedia is an authority until Tim decides it isn't.
277620	279720	Tim is at his most honest here, though.
279720	284820	That means I need you to define what this means so that I can agree with you.
284820	287620	Because right now, basically, I have no idea what you're trying to say.
287620	288940	I really, really don't.
288940	290660	But he offers a path forward.
290660	295020	If it turns out, because yes, I've read much of this academic literature.
295020	297580	So I've seen the arguments.
297580	300900	I am just saying right now, we are not in that place.
300900	304900	This is the standard conservative pushback against the idea of trans people.
304900	309600	When in doubt, cite science without pointing towards any specific researcher or findings
309600	310600	or anything, really.
310600	315340	The word science, and in this case a Wikipedia page that disagrees with you, is all that
315340	316340	anyone needs.
316340	320660	Tim's spin on this is to repeatedly claim how much he respects trans people and will
320660	324680	use their pronouns out of politeness, but ultimately he doesn't see any scientific
324680	328440	basis in them saying they are the gender they identify with.
328440	333120	For those of us not as well versed on this as Professor Poole thinks he is, I'd point
333120	339940	people towards a lovely article in Scientific American by neuroscientist and doctoral candidate
339940	345040	Simone D. Sun that makes a good case for the biological underpinnings of being trans
345040	349640	and the complexity of the male and female labels we use so freely.
349640	354560	Turns out it's far more complicated than people assume and not firmly fixed as someone
354560	356680	such as Tim would have you believe.
356680	361580	By covering for people like J.K. Rowling when they say something anti-trans, Tim is helping
361580	366480	uphold a conservative narrative that trans people's lived experiences are delusions.
369940	378380	Tim's analysis of pretty much all news stories reveal a complete lack of curiosity.
378380	382400	He will complain about the mainstream media jumping to conclusions or not doing their
382400	386440	due diligence, but there are several examples of how his bias guides him through news stories
386440	389440	to frame them within a general anti-left sentiment.
389440	394360	In the video, 5 students ARRESTED for beating a 14 year old allegedly for wearing a MAGA
394360	395360	hat.
395360	398200	I probably didn't need to say MAGA like that, but I will leave it in.
398200	402880	He credulously repeats the common narrative of right-wingers being under attack for supporting
402880	404200	Trump in public.
404200	408360	One important caveat to this video's title is that at the time of the attack, the kid
408360	410420	was not wearing a MAGA hat.
410420	414020	At the time of the incident, he wasn't wearing the hat.
414020	415380	Question it, whatever.
415380	419560	The argument is that he had worn it in the past, was bullied for it, so stopped and then
419560	421020	got bullied again.
421020	425020	The only piece of evidence we have, a video of this attack, shows the kid not wearing
425020	426020	a MAGA hat.
426020	429680	So why does Tim believe that this is somehow linked to it?
429680	433500	Because this is so, well it's common enough, I kinda believe it.
433500	436780	So Tim just believes it, because, well, it's happened before.
436780	438740	This isn't how journalism works.
438740	442620	You can't just take a claim on face value because you believe it happened before.
442620	447120	The onus is still on the person making the claim to provide evidence.
447120	451380	The story was publicized by the boy's mother, who happens to run a fairly prominent Twitter
451380	453880	account with nearly half a million followers.
453880	458400	This is the only source saying the boy was being bullied for wearing a MAGA hat.
458400	463320	She also claims it was a hate crime because her son is white and his attackers were black.
463320	467480	There's an official statement from the school, which Tim mentions, that says the fight had
467480	469440	nothing to do with clothing.
469440	472500	There was no evidence found during the investigation that indicated the student was wearing any
472500	477760	of this apparel at the time of the altercation, or that his wearing of such apparel on a prior
477760	479280	occasion motivated the incident.
479280	480280	Boom.
480280	481280	There it is.
481280	482280	That's the important point.
482280	485160	You gotta be careful, man, because there are people who take advantage of your good
485160	486600	will on the left and the right.
486600	490000	Tim responds to this by suggesting the school might be lying.
490000	494720	I understand the school has reason to try and deflect and be like, no, no, no, it doesn't
494720	496040	happen at our school.
496040	499800	But I also want to make sure you're all aware, tons of people lie.
499800	502440	They are grifters and they will come for you.
502440	504360	I'm not accusing them of anything.
504360	508480	He never assumes this of the boy's mother, or at least he doesn't assume the mother
508480	512920	might not have all the facts, that a GoFundMe was started by the boy's mother so that
512920	518000	she can homeschool him is similarly mentioned without the faintest bit of suspicion.
518000	520640	But the most telling line is here.
520640	521720	How do you prove a negative?
521720	522720	You know what I mean?
522720	526680	Like, if the school is saying it was not motivated by a previous political hat, how do you know
526680	527680	that?
527680	530080	That's just not how proving anything works.
530080	535480	If there's a claim and no evidence is provided for it, as a journalist, you should try finding
535480	536480	it.
536480	539160	If you can't find that evidence, then guess what?
539160	541200	You don't run the story.
541200	544720	I lean more towards the likelihood of this being true, regardless of what the school
544720	550600	said, simply because it fits with what we've seen in the past.
550600	554140	This is the perfect example of the laziness of Tim Poole.
554140	558380	He would sooner believe the framing he sees on Twitter rather than the school's investigation
558380	563200	because it fits in with the persecuted conservative narrative he already believes is true.
563200	567600	This is what happens when you let narratives determine how you view the news of the day.
567600	571960	This seems grossly irresponsible to me, and reading the comments we can see what his audience
571960	574200	took away from this.
574200	577920	Imagine if five of white's kids did this to a black kid.
577920	579680	Worldwide news for weeks.
579680	583320	Can you imagine eight white kids doing this?
583320	589040	CNN, the KKK is back, and lynchings of POC have begun again.
589040	590480	God help us.
590480	596800	They beat him because he was white, and their best excuse was he was wearing Trump's merch.
596800	600680	It makes one wonder why Tim Poole's audience gets so worked up about white people.
600680	604200	But what's most alarming to me about this story is that the kids seen fighting in the
604200	609000	first video are getting charged, which seems pretty extreme for kids so young.
609000	612360	But no one seems to care that they now have criminal records before they've even gotten
612360	614120	their driver's license.
614120	618580	Fights on school buses happen every day, but thanks to the coverage from conservative media,
618580	621980	this one almost certainly got more scrutiny than it otherwise would have.
621980	625660	And Tim is part of the problem when he propagates baseless stories like this one.
625660	629980	Although he claims to be a liberal, someone who parrots conservative media stories, especially
629980	634220	ones like these, with racist undertones of white people being under attack, aren't just
634220	635580	fostering hatred.
635580	638660	There are direct, real-world consequences to this.
638660	642380	Another conservative narrative Tim loves to repeat is that there's an impending civil
642380	643380	war.
643380	648420	What would that topic in 95 Second Amendment sanctuaries emerge in Virginia if there's
648420	651440	a second civil war it starts here?
651440	653440	In this video, Tim boldly claims,
653440	656700	Well, now we can see what's happening in Virginia.
656700	661580	As the Democrats won a majority and now they're trying to enact a ton of laws, essentially
661580	662580	gun confiscation.
662580	663580	It's kind of complicated.
663580	664900	Of course it's complicated.
664900	666980	I know I say it a lot, but it is.
666980	669380	I genuinely don't know what he's talking about here.
669380	673340	It would help if he explained which laws Democrats are passing within Virginia that are threatened
673340	675240	to take away people's guns.
675240	676540	But he doesn't.
676540	680020	I know this is a common talking point on the right, but where's the evidence that this
680020	681340	is actually happening?
681340	686220	The only details Tim offers refer to the Republicans being responsible for these Virginia counties
686220	688900	passing laws to protect gun ownership.
688900	692180	Tim believes guns are essential to living in the middle of nowhere.
692180	694020	He provides us a chilling example.
694020	698140	If you're in the middle of nowhere and you see, I don't know, a coyote?
698140	699660	Or a villain?
699660	700660	Because guess what?
700660	701660	People can be bad too.
701660	702660	What do you do?
702980	704300	You're out in the middle of nowhere.
704300	705860	You're in your little car.
705860	707460	You pull off on the side of the road.
707460	708980	You know, you're going to change your tire.
708980	709980	Who knows what?
709980	714660	And all of a sudden you see this shambling dude lurking all about and he pulls out a
714660	715660	knife.
715660	716660	Yeah.
716660	717660	You're going to call the police?
717660	718660	Congratulations.
718660	719660	They'll be there.
719660	720660	They're 200 miles away.
720660	721660	No.
721660	724940	So in this scenario, there are shambling, knife wielding villains on the prowl in the
724940	726020	middle of nowhere.
726020	729340	Does Tim think rural America is like Silent Hill?
729340	732900	But let's get back to the real narrative Tim is pushing here that the left is coming
732900	734700	for everyone's guns.
734700	736100	And how are they going to do it?
736100	737740	With immigration.
737740	740700	Immigrants are religious and they're going to bring with them more conservative values
740700	742220	than progressives will have.
742220	743220	Progressives are secular.
743220	744220	Okay.
744220	745220	Latino migrants from Mexico.
745220	746220	They're not.
746220	747220	They're Christians.
747220	748220	Okay.
748220	750900	That's a good win for conservatives, but they also don't have the same constitutional values
750900	751900	that Americans have.
751900	755420	So yes, they will vote Democrat and they will vote to take away your rights in the
755420	756940	long run.
756940	760780	But things are going to shift very religious and there will be a lot of conservative aspects
760780	763620	that come back like Christmas, for instance.
763620	768260	So immigrants will arrive with their religious values and apparently not assimilate, turning
768260	771740	the democratic party into the party of Christian conservatism.
771740	772740	This is quite the prediction.
772740	776500	If you know anything about the evangelical base of the Republican party.
776500	778420	Just a side note, when did Christmas go away?
778420	780420	I think he's trying to explain that here.
780420	784020	All the people screeching that some guy said Merry Christmas.
784020	785020	Oh no.
785020	786020	Who cares?
786100	791620	Yeah, you realize in like 30 years, happy holidays will be gone because the people you're
791620	796180	inviting into the country are overwhelmingly Christians, you know, I don't think they
796180	797180	get it.
797180	801060	I'm pretty sure Christmas was just celebrated in the US.
801060	802820	Can someone confirm that for me?
802820	806580	But that aside, there's a more sinister point Tim is making here.
806580	810100	So they're Christians, but they're not constitutional Americans.
810100	812900	They don't look at free speech and these issues the same way.
812900	814500	That's the real threat to our rights.
814500	818820	This is a common conservative narrative, this idea that immigrants will not assimilate
818820	822500	and demand the country upend the Constitution to limit people's rights.
822500	826740	Tim doesn't even understand why he just buys into the idea that immigrants have distinct
826740	831580	cultures and won't become real Americans that believe in American ideals.
831580	835260	For what it's worth, Tim clarifies and says literally everybody can come to the United
835260	836260	States.
836260	839900	All of them, every single person, okay, if it's legally done.
839900	843100	And he explains it's illegal immigration.
843100	844100	That's the issue.
844340	848900	To be as charitable as possible, maybe Tim thinks the real danger is making illegal immigrants
848900	854260	citizens will shift the balance of immigrants and native born Americans so that immigrants
854260	858180	would be empowered to vote away everyone's rights.
858180	862020	I don't understand how this can be anything other than prejudice to assume that anyone
862020	867020	coming to America will do so in an effort to reshape the country, to take away everyone's
867020	868020	rights.
868020	869020	It's not the end of the world.
869020	870020	Y'all need to calm down.
870020	874060	And I like how this video ends with Tim telling people to calm down right after he spent 12
874060	877140	minutes talking about how there was an impending civil war.
877140	878660	Thanks for the advice, Tim.
878660	882740	Since I chose a week close to the holidays, I got a nice dose of festive content from
882740	883740	Tim.
883740	888140	Here's one video that's strangely titled, Soon Merry Christmas Will Be Hate Speech.
888140	890460	Comedian got in trouble at work for saying it.
890460	892420	Tim's discussing two stories here.
892420	897540	One is of comedian Whitney Cummings supposedly being reported to HR for wishing someone a
897540	907300	Merry Christmas, and the other example is Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch being
907300	919620	criticized for saying Merry Christmas on Fox News.
919620	923700	You can see the glee Tim gets when he hears a story about people being stupid.
923700	926240	I wonder if he watches his own videos.
926240	931400	And speaking on the Whitney Cummings incident, taking this chat show anecdote on face value,
931400	934440	it sounds like an intern was perhaps too sensitive.
934440	937080	And that's assuming there's no missing context here.
937080	945440	Tim frames it like this.
945440	950320	The punishment for Cummings, near as I can tell, was someone from HR mentioning it to
950320	951320	her.
951320	952320	And that's it.
952320	953320	How nightmarish.
953920	958000	The second story is more interesting, and it would have made more sense if Gorsuch had
958000	960560	made his statement in a less obvious way.
960560	973040	But let's look at the actual clip of him saying Merry Christmas.
973040	977600	So the context here is that Fox News pretends that you can't say Merry Christmas on TV,
977600	982760	and when Ainsley Earhart says she loves that he says it, it reinforces the idea that there's
982760	987960	a war on Christmas, a conspiracy theory Fox News has been pushing for 15 years.
987960	992080	Overall it's a minor point, and somehow became the focal point of this interview when
992080	996120	I think the real question is why a Supreme Court justice is making a rare TV appearance
996120	998740	on a partisan show like Fox and Friends.
998740	1003760	The outrage over the left going crazy appeared in article after article, each one mentioning
1003760	1008000	an article that was published in Salon and a handful of tweets complaining about the
1008000	1009660	Merry Christmas dog whistle.
1009660	1014060	This is the perfect example of a manufactured story, and how the right wing is so effective
1014060	1017980	in repeating their talking points, they believe they can spin it into a bigger deal than it
1017980	1022460	really was, and Tim is playing his part in tarnishing the left with a ginned up story
1022460	1023460	of outrage.
1023460	1027820	And don't look, the Republicans are also fundraising off this appearance, that's not
1027820	1029100	suspect at all.
1029100	1033740	This video also features Tim racing to the defense of Fox's All-American Christmas ad,
1033740	1036340	which was criticized for being too white.
1036340	1041620	They're angry that a commercial for Ainsley Earhart doesn't include people of color,
1041620	1044980	what the commercial probably has like what, three people in it?
1044980	1046700	These people are insane.
1046700	1049180	Just for fun, how many people were in this commercial?

1063100	1067220	This December on Fox Nation, your favorite Fox personalities celebrate an All-American
1067220	1068220	Christmas.
1068220	1071340	Plus, we're breaking into the Christmas vault for some classic holiday entertainment.
1071340	1074100	It's an All-American Christmas on Fox Nation.
1074100	1075980	So Tim was almost close.
1075980	1080020	It wasn't three people, it was closer to 24.
1080020	1084100	The War on Christmas idea has long been a staple at Fox News, and the Salon article
1084100	1088540	I mentioned taking all the heat at least goes to the trouble of describing its origin with
1088700	1093140	Bill O'Reilly back in 2004, and it includes a link to a political article that goes into
1093140	1094660	further historical detail.
1094660	1099140	Tim, of course, doesn't engage with any of this, and instead pretends like people pointing
1099140	1104220	out the conspiracy theory are, in fact, the conspiracy theorists themselves.
1104220	1108300	That a Fox host and a Supreme Court justice simply saying, Merry Christmas, I love that
1108300	1114060	you say that, is actually them trying to validate a conspiracy theory, you're actually the
1114060	1116660	one pushing the conspiracy theory.
1116660	1119540	So I will ask, how long do you think until they start actually banning people for saying
1119540	1120540	things like this?
1120540	1124820	Ironically, Tim talking about people getting banned for saying Merry Christmas, a statement
1124820	1129220	not backed up by any of the facts and any of the stories here, is actually perpetuating
1129220	1131020	the War on Christmas conspiracy theory.
1131020	1136780	A few tweets and one article Salon criticizing something isn't the same as asking for words
1136780	1138260	to be banned.
1138260	1141700	Tim also deploys one of his most commonly used tactics when it comes to ignoring the
1141700	1142700	left.
1142700	1144540	He simply writes them off as crazy.
1144540	1148860	This is the epitome of just, you know what, I've never seen a more insane leftist article.
1148860	1149860	I'm sorry.
1149860	1150860	I'm sorry.
1150860	1151860	Okay.
1151860	1155980	This is one of the most common talking points he deploys and a classic method used to sidestep
1155980	1159940	any real discussion or debate when you can write off your opposition is crazy.
1159940	1162140	You don't have to engage with them in a meaningful sense.
1162140	1166140	And I know while Tim has tried addressing people on the left in debates, like his recent
1166140	1170500	embarrassing conversation with Sam Cedar, he's revealed that he isn't equipped to be
1170500	1172260	having these discussions.
1172260	1177260	And I admit it's it's I'll call it dickish utilitarianism is typically the villain in
1177260	1179660	most movies.
1179660	1180660	I don't care.
1180660	1181660	Yeah.
1181660	1186900	So, so for instance, like Thanos was the utilitarian and Captain America was deontological.
1186900	1187900	I did.
1187900	1191860	So Thanos willing to reduce the suffering by killing, you know, hundreds of trillions
1191860	1196220	versus the thousands of trillions, which would be living better off.
1196900	1203620	So maybe that's why he would sooner write off the left as crazy or detached from reality.
1203620	1207380	He's not capable of really engaging with them in a meaningful way.
1207380	1212740	I suspect a lot of that comes from him generally not understanding what he reads as evidenced
1212740	1215780	by the many previous examples already in this video.
1215780	1220060	Here's another example of how he doesn't really read the articles he highlights.
1220060	1223940	In the war on Christmas video, I mentioned he waved away all claims about Fox News pushing
1223940	1227980	a war on Christmas narrative with they say Fox News is a long history of claiming there
1227980	1232500	is a war on Christmas tracing back to a 2004 segment by former talk show host Bill O'Reilly
1232500	1234760	called Christmas under siege.
1234760	1236700	This is insanity.
1236700	1240860	He literally just said Merry Christmas and said, I love you say that.
1240860	1243340	I don't know what that's supposed to mean other than Merry Christmas.
1243340	1246140	And here's what happens when he gets further along in the article.
1246140	1247540	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
1247540	1248540	It's also anti-Semitic.
1248540	1250820	They added that too.
1250820	1253100	You know what, man, I'm over it.
1253100	1257140	It seems like Tim was genuinely surprised to read that bit almost as if he hadn't
1257140	1262020	read the article fully before deciding to make a video on it or being more fair than
1262020	1263060	maybe I should be.
1263060	1264940	Maybe Tim forgot about that part.
1264940	1266800	He certainly didn't have anything to say about it.
1266800	1268780	And that's how Tim handles most of his topics.
1268780	1273420	He points out ridiculous lefts being writes them off as crazy and absolves himself of
1273420	1276580	the weighty business of addressing their criticisms.
1276580	1281860	And those are the exact anti-left wing narratives that his right wing audience snaps up so
1281860	1288420	readily.
1288420	1292600	With those major themes all covered, I did see a few videos that don't fit into any
1292600	1296980	specific category that still display some of the poor tactics Tim uses to talk about
1296980	1297980	the news.
1297980	1302820	In a video charmingly titled Greta Thunberg Accidentally Calls for Execution of Politicians
1302820	1308780	Take the Greta Thunberg Challenge, climate activist Greta Thunberg is of course a hot
1308780	1313980	button topic being an advocate for climate change and Tim, though a believer in climate
1313980	1316900	change supposedly, isn't a fan of Greta.
1316900	1320980	The heart of this video is Greta's claim that she wants to put politicians against
1320980	1325980	the wall with regard to climate change, which Tim and conservative media took to mean she
1325980	1330420	wants to lead a violent revolution putting these politicians against the wall where they'll
1330420	1331420	be executed.
1331420	1334800	Do you know what it means to put someone against the wall in English?
1334800	1339520	It's a reference to, you know, putting someone against the wall and then aiming a weapon
1339520	1344360	at them because you're sentencing them to no longer being alive.
1344360	1346740	But Tim breaks ranks here, surprisingly.
1346740	1350820	He does the unthinkable and gets more input from a Swedish journalist who explained that
1350820	1355800	in Sweden, the phrase, up against the wall, also means being in a tight spot.
1355800	1360720	I reached out to a local journalist and I asked them, what does it mean?
1360720	1365080	And he told me it's a very common phrase that means pushing them up against the wall
1365080	1369400	and likes, it's like basically my understanding is when they don't do what you want to do,
1369400	1372640	you hold them accountable about pushing them to the wall and like, you know, solding them.
1372640	1374000	Like, you know, that's basically it.
1374000	1375000	Here's a fun fact.
1375000	1378800	That's also what it means in English, at least according to the dictionary.
1378800	1382800	But the heart of why Tim doesn't like Greta is that while he agrees with her message,
1382800	1385520	he thinks she's just being too mean.
1385520	1389480	You need to stop propping her up.
1390480	1413720	So leaving aside how gross it is for an adult man telling a teenage girl she should smile
1413720	1417960	more, this is the exact sort of tone policing that's the real enemy of discourse.
1417960	1422800	The idea that if only Greta were nice and polite, climate change would be solved, or
1422800	1425520	at least people would finally listen.
1425520	1429240	Scientists have been politely requesting governments take a moment to do something about emissions
1429240	1430240	for decades.
1430240	1433840	The time for politely asking for change has passed.
1433840	1437600	Throughout the video, Tim keeps pivoting back to Greta needing to convince random people
1437600	1439120	walking down the street.
1439120	1441800	This isn't about asking someone to ride a bike to work.
1441800	1446180	The only way to solve climate change is through action at the highest levels of government.
1446180	1450580	Religious people are precisely who Greta was scolding, and if Tim believes that governments
1450580	1455660	won't take action because the 16-year-old girl wasn't nice enough, he isn't qualified
1455660	1457280	to be speaking on the subject.
1457280	1463420	And before leaving, I do feel like I need to mention that Tim had two videos about UFOs.
1463420	1471100	Massive surge of credible UFO sightings in 2019 theorists think aliens will reveal themselves,
1471100	1473620	and Trump's Space Force is now official.
1473620	1478260	New branch comes conspicuously around the same time as UFOs.
1478260	1483540	I gotta say, I had no idea that Tim Poole was into UFOs, but it's the least surprising
1483540	1486100	new thing I learned while watching a week of his content.
1486100	1490260	Tim buys into some pretty kooky stuff, so sure, why not UFOs?
1490260	1495100	Heck, he even thinks the massive waste of taxpayer money that is the Space Force is
1495100	1497460	Donald Trump's coolest idea.
1497460	1500820	For some reason, there are a lot of people ragging on Trump for wanting a Space Force,
1500820	1503980	and I gotta admit, this is the coolest thing Trump has ever done.
1503980	1507740	And he thinks this is a step towards the Federation, as seen on Star Trek.
1507740	1511140	You know, we have all these shows, you know, you have Starfleet and Star Trek, and you
1511140	1515140	have these sci-fi movies where there's like a fleet in outer space.
1515140	1517100	This is the beginning of that, okay?
1517100	1521460	I'm not sure why the beginning wasn't NASA, the government agency that's dedicated
1521460	1525860	to space travel and has already been to the moon, but I guess they're not training people
1525860	1529900	to blow up aliens, so less cool, I guess.
1529980	1533980	I'm a fan of the Star Trek that's about science and exploration, meeting new aliens
1533980	1536300	to be their friends, not blow them up.
1536300	1537580	But I'm obviously not being fair.
1537580	1541380	Tim isn't here to push conspiracy theories, he says so himself.
1541380	1546140	I am not here to push stupid conspiracies or anything, I'm just here to have a little
1546140	1548060	fun with these UFO stories.
1548060	1551660	And here he is definitely not pushing a conspiracy theory forward.
1551660	1557300	Is something interesting that should be mentioned, that we have an uptick in all of these credible
1557300	1563180	stories about UFOs, Navy pilots, going back years, saying this is real, and then all of
1563180	1566860	a sudden, a space force being signed into law.
1566860	1571820	Is it possible that in reality, it's not about aliens, it's about the fact the U.S. government
1571820	1576380	is recognizing finally, and they are, that there is something happening in space and
1576380	1578100	in the atmosphere we can't understand?
1578100	1580060	He's just having fun, you guys.
1580060	1583020	Perhaps now, the Space Force, in the next few years, they're going to be like, look
1583020	1586940	at this thing we built, even though we've already had the technology for a long time.
1587260	1590620	I don't know, I don't know, I just like the idea, I think it's fun, I'm not telling
1590620	1594260	you it's true, I know all the stupid lefties are going to be like, Tim pushes UFO conspiracies
1594260	1597500	all the time, oh calm down, okay, this story is real, it's from the independent left-wing
1597500	1599100	side, I think it's just fun to talk about.
1599100	1604740	And the sad thing is, if Tim limited his videos to discussions about UFOs and big feet, it
1604740	1606540	would be far less damaging.
1606540	1610940	Believing in stupid conspiracies isn't nearly as harmful as what he does now, disseminating
1610940	1616140	right-wing talking points and actively reframing news of the day to fit right-wing narratives.
1616940	1625500	I don't care about Tim Pool, it's what he represents, that's the problem.
1625500	1630020	People like Tim Pool, who use their supposed status as being on the left-wing and then
1630020	1634940	go on to trash the left-wing with right-wing talking points and narratives, will always
1634940	1635940	exist.
1635940	1640700	When Tim Pool calls it a day in his career, someone else who uses the same techniques
1640700	1642220	will show up and take his place.
1642220	1646340	I'm hoping this exercise in looking at Tim Pool's work will help you see some of the
1646340	1650380	warning signs in the future, and hopefully you'll be able to spot future Tim Pools
1650380	1652060	at first glance.
1652060	1655380	How they'll weigh the benefit of the doubt towards conservatives.
1655380	1657820	How they'll only read stories superficially.
1657820	1663140	How they'll dismiss arguments with personal insults and their general reluctance to ever
1663140	1670020	criticize in any meaningful way, besides someone supposedly disagrees with politically.
1670020	1676180	Before I go, I just can't resist, using some of the random clips I couldn't find
1676180	1680400	a place for in this video that just make Tim look stupid.
1680400	1683420	There is no context for these, I just wanted to dunk on him a little.
1683420	1684980	So let's have fun doing that.
1684980	1688660	Here's Tim saying socialism can't work unless you get rid of money.
1688660	1693180	So the only true socialist or communist system can't have money in it.
1693180	1697740	Here's Tim saying something obviously not true about the president who has the thinnest
1697740	1698740	skin ever.
1698740	1701140	Do you think Trump cares about people calling him bad names?
1701140	1702140	I don't think so.
1702140	1707780	Tim apparently believes entitled college kids expect factories to be handed to them.
1707780	1711260	You look at the factory that someone else put time and energy to build.
1711260	1715120	All of the workers, whatever your opinion is about labor.
1715120	1716420	Somebody made a plan.
1716420	1717700	Somebody worked hard, saved money.
1717700	1718700	Somebody got a loan.
1718700	1719700	They hired people.
1719700	1720700	Everyone contributed to build a factory.
1720700	1727420	Now you deserve that because you took feminist dance at a local college and you were indoctrinated
1727420	1734100	into the idea that people shouldn't be allowed to build a company and own property.
1734100	1735100	Okay, whatever.
1735100	1736100	Have those opinions.
1736100	1738260	Here's Tim offering some survival advice.
1738260	1740020	You can be homeless.
1740020	1741500	You can have no clothes.
1741500	1743140	You can be in the middle of the woods.
1743140	1746620	But you can pick up a rock and congratulations, now you've got something.
1746620	1748540	You can start doing something.
1748540	1750500	Go watch ancient technology on YouTube.
1750500	1751500	I love these channels.
1751500	1752900	He built a mud hut in an oven.
1752900	1753900	He got a house.
1753900	1754900	He builds a house.
1754900	1755900	It's amazing.
1755900	1756900	A lot of dirt.
1757020	1758020	Brilliant.
1758020	1762860	I don't know how a person naked in the woods watches YouTube, but okay.
1762860	1767060	Tim mistakenly thinks a common phrase comes from a card game.
1767060	1770780	There's something I've cited, you know, several times, mostly in the past.
1770780	1772460	I'll bring it back up.
1772460	1773780	It's this Magic the Gathering card.
1773780	1776340	If you're familiar with the game, Magic the Gathering, it's a card game.
1776340	1777340	Swords to plowshares.
1777340	1782180	For the record, the phrase actually originates from the Bible, which predates Magic the Gathering
1782180	1784420	by at least a couple of decades.
1784460	1788140	I didn't get to any of Tim's horrible videos about British politics, but if you want to
1788140	1791380	know the sort of experts he consults, here's who he talks to.
1791380	1792380	I should say this.
1792380	1793380	I'll defer to Sargon.
1793380	1795420	Alright, if you guys watch Sargon's content, because he's from there.
1795420	1796420	He knows better than me.
1796420	1799900	Also, I thought it was funny that he didn't know how the UK House of Lords works or that
1799900	1800900	it existed.
1800900	1803580	Did you know that the UK has a House of Lords?
1803580	1804620	I didn't understand this.
1804620	1806540	I thought it was like the House and the Senate.
1806540	1810620	No, it turns out the House of Lords are like appointees of like land owners from historic
1810620	1811620	times.
1811620	1815820	I'm thinking Bernie Sanders was born nearly 100 years ago.
1815820	1816820	What generation is Bernie in?
1816820	1817820	He's not a boomer.
1817820	1818820	No, he's not a boomer.
1818820	1819820	What is he?
1819820	1820820	Greatest generation?
1820820	1821820	I mean, I don't know.
1821820	1822820	I don't know.
1822820	1823820	What generation is it?
1823820	1824820	It's greatest, right?
1824820	1829340	Bernie is actually a part of the silent generation, but just barely though, he was born in 1942.
1829340	1832300	Just shy of a few years of being a boomer.
1832300	1834620	Thank you all for bearing with me.
1834620	1836620	That was cathartic.
1836620	1842340	Whenever I make videos looking at some noxious conservative dirtbag, it's not as painful
1842340	1843580	for me as people think.
1843580	1848060	And I see all these comments saying, oh, thank you for your sacrifice for suffering through
1848060	1849060	this.
1849060	1852220	And while it's not a painless experience, you get used to it pretty quickly.
1852220	1855900	And when you're only looking at one video or a documentary film, you sort of become
1855900	1858540	numb to the awfulness.
1858540	1865700	This though, this was one week of 42 videos watching six a day from Tim Pool.
1865700	1870300	And ah, this one really, really hurt.
1870300	1872900	His content is just so bad.
1872900	1876700	There is so much rambling, so much nonsense.
1876700	1877820	It was rough.
1877820	1878820	It was rough.
1878820	1880860	But I do it all for you.
1880860	1883580	Those used in particular are my patrons.
1883580	1888300	But even if you're not a patron, I appreciate anyone who takes their time to watch my videos.
1888300	1892940	And if you'd like to show me said appreciation, there is of course the aforementioned Patreon
1892940	1897300	where you could give me a little money to do more videos like this and me or maybe videos
1897300	1901020	where I get to watch things I enjoy and have fun and tell you about them.
1901020	1906300	You can also do the usual YouTube things of liking, commenting, subscribing or sharing
1906300	1907700	this video with friends.
1907700	1908700	That's cool, too.
1908700	1912940	You can also follow me on Twitter, ask me some questions on curious cast.
1912940	1918900	And I'm thinking of doing a new Q&A video probably when I hit my next patron goal, which
1918900	1923300	has a very short, short, short, short bonus video that everyone will be seeing on this
1923300	1924300	channel.
1924300	1925300	And I'll throw in a Q&A.
1925300	1926300	Because why not?
1926300	1927300	It's been a while.
1927300	1930940	I think the last time I did one, I had like 2,500 subscribers.
1930940	1932380	There are a lot more of you now.
1932380	1935660	Look for a community post and that's where the questions will go.
1935660	1939700	Thank you all for watching my video, bye.
