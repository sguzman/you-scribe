00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
In 1993, Boy Meets World debuted, telling the story of Corey Matthews as he navigated

00:04.600 --> 00:07.200
the troubled waters of childhood into adulthood.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.400
Though never a breakout hit, it was a fixture Friday nights, running for seven seasons following

00:11.400 --> 00:13.960
Corey and his friends from middle school to college.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.560
After the show ended, it surprisingly got even more popular through syndication, with

00:17.560 --> 00:21.360
its blend of a classic coming-of-age story and nostalgia for a time when the world seemed

00:21.360 --> 00:22.800
like a much kinder place.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.360
To tell the story of Boy Meets World though, we need to start with the story of TGIF, the

00:27.360 --> 00:30.640
programming block on ABC where Boy Meets World debuted.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.000
ABC had long been a home for comedy on Friday nights, from The Adventures of Ozzy and Harriet

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
to The Brady Bunch.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.400
In the late 1980s, ABC stood in contrast to rival networks NBC and CBS, which had more

00:41.400 --> 00:44.880
dramatic programming on the evening, so they came up with a promotional hook that would

00:44.880 --> 00:48.720
distinguish them from their rival networks, emphasizing the family-friendly nature of

00:48.720 --> 00:49.880
their comedy lineup.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.120
Bob Iger, president of ABC Entertainment at the time, explained,

00:53.480 --> 00:57.760
A lot of families weren't watching TV together as much as when I was growing up, but I thought,

00:57.760 --> 01:01.080
if we could program shows where parents and kids could watch together, we'd be better

01:01.080 --> 01:02.960
off from a ratings perspective.

01:02.960 --> 01:08.080
It would be named TGIF, which stood for Thank Goodness It's Funny, and more than just a

01:08.080 --> 01:11.400
name, what would connect these shows would be a series of promotional spots where the

01:11.400 --> 01:15.560
cast from each respective program would serve as hosts for the night, as if they were sitting

01:15.560 --> 01:18.880
alongside the audience in their home watching the shows with them.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.720
TGIF debuted in 1989, and its first lineup of shows included Full House, Family Matters,

01:24.720 --> 01:27.040
Perfect Strangers, and Just the Ten of Us.

01:27.040 --> 01:31.400
TGIF was a massive hit, particularly with younger audiences, and part of what made it

01:31.400 --> 01:35.600
so successful is that once a family sat down to watch TGIF, they usually stuck around for

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
the whole night.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.680
TGIF's lineup would change over the years.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.640
Its earlier years would include shows such as Step by Step and Dinosaurs, and its later

01:42.640 --> 01:47.520
years with Cianad, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Sister Sister, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.960
All of these shows had a distinct family-friendly feel, they also featured a number of fun crossovers.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.200
Family Matters, for instance, was already a spin-off of Perfect Strangers, so it was

01:56.200 --> 01:58.480
no surprise to see those characters crossover.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.360
But we would also see Steve Urkel show up on Full House and Step by Step, and Michelle

02:02.360 --> 02:05.440
from Full House would pop up on Hangin' with Mr. Cooper.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.480
While all of these shows deserve their place in discussions about TGIF, there is one show

02:09.480 --> 02:14.200
that embodied the spirit of TGIF, and that show is Boy Meets World.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.360
Although Boy Meets World was not the breakout hit of this night, it was the only long-running

02:18.360 --> 02:23.360
show that debuted and ended as part of the TGIF Friday night lineup.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.560
Boy Meets World was destined to be a TGIF show before it was even an idea.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.000
Series creator Michael Jacobs had been working on Dinosaurs for ABC's TGIF before it was

02:32.000 --> 02:36.160
moved to Wednesday Nights, a move, by the way, Jacobs considers the reason that particular

02:36.160 --> 02:38.560
series only ran for four seasons.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.440
Dinosaurs' big numbers with families on Friday nights motivated Disney to task Jacobs

02:42.440 --> 02:45.760
with developing a show for the 12-14-year-old demographic.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.680
He thought of other family shows such as Family Ties and Growing Pains, which focused on the

02:49.680 --> 02:51.240
oldest childhood of family.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.040
Jacobs had another idea, though.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.240
In an interview, he said,

02:54.240 --> 02:56.080
What if we did a different structure?

02:56.080 --> 02:59.680
What if we took a middle child and instead of focusing on the first date aspect of the

02:59.680 --> 03:02.520
older child, he was looking at it as a betrayal?

03:02.520 --> 03:07.080
Jacobs contacted ABC to find out who they had under contract, and the one kid they had available

03:07.080 --> 03:11.800
was Ben Savage, who at the time was only thought of as the younger brother of Fred Savage,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.480
the current star of the TV series The Wonder Years.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.040
Jacobs and Savage immediately hit it off, and the series quickly took shape.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.240
Jacobs describes the series at its beginning.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.440
What if there's a kid who is an everyman who loses his touchstone, his older brother,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.520
and he's lost and confused in the world?

03:26.520 --> 03:30.600
With the premise established, Jacobs teamed with veteran writer April Kelly to pen the

03:30.600 --> 03:34.480
first episode of the series, and it was soon time to cast the show.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.320
Naturally, Ben Savage would play the lead, Corey Matthews, the middle child of the Matthews

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
family.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.960
Corey starts the show in sixth grade.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.160
He's an energetic kid who is less than committed to his schoolwork, and happily sits as the

03:45.160 --> 03:49.560
every kid everyone watching was supposed to identify with as he started taking his first

03:49.560 --> 03:51.480
steps into the big world around him.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.520
Apparently, he'd rather listen to the baseball game on the radio than try to understand the

03:55.520 --> 03:58.160
emotional content of Romeo and Juliet.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.160
Mom, I'm a kid!

03:59.160 --> 04:03.320
I don't understand the emotional content of Full House!

04:03.320 --> 04:07.580
William Daniels played George Feeney, or more commonly, Mr. Feeney, and he was based

04:07.580 --> 04:10.440
on a drama teacher Michael Jacobs had had in high school.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.000
Although Daniels expressed reluctance when he was offered the role, he accepted once

04:14.000 --> 04:18.120
he learned that, in spite of his name, the character of Mr. Feeney would not be mocking

04:18.120 --> 04:22.160
teachers but rather demonstrating the profound impact they have on young minds.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.040
Not only Corey's teacher, Mr. Feeney lived next door to the Matthews home, meaning that,

04:26.040 --> 04:30.320
no matter where Corey went, he could never escape his watchful eye or sage advice.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.920
You know, you're not doing your body any favors loading up on junk like that.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.440
Oh, thanks Mr. Feeney, and please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink you're sucking down.

04:40.520 --> 04:45.680
There's no gravity in space, Mr. Matthews, therefore astronauts suck up.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.680
Learn from them.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.520
Corey's older brother, Eric, was played by Will Friedel.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.600
Although Friedel wasn't the first choice for the role, after the pilot was shot, the

04:53.600 --> 04:55.720
role was recast and given to Friedel instead.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.880
Friedel was given the role because he was taller than the first actor, and they didn't

04:58.880 --> 05:01.400
want Corey growing up to be taller than his older brother.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.920
Eric begins the series as the date-obsessed older brother, that over the years he would

05:04.920 --> 05:07.400
become one of the goofier members of the cast.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.720
Like I don't have anything else in my mind but girls.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.960
Look, I got a lot of other things in my mind besides girls.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
A lot of other things.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.120
There's like, girl, girl, right there, right there!

05:17.120 --> 05:20.120
Ryder Strong was cast to play Corey's best friend, Sean Hunter.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.200
According to Michael Jacobs, Strong was the first and only boy he considered for the role.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.920
Sean is the rebellious best friend with a troubled home life, in stark contrast to the

05:27.920 --> 05:29.680
more wholesome Matthews household.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.040
Stacey says you should have watched it up 45 minutes ago.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
Ahhh!

05:33.040 --> 05:35.720
Stacey says you shouldn't have left it in so long.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.480
Stacey says why didn't you two idiots read the label?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.120
Oh, thanks Stacey.

05:40.120 --> 05:45.240
Lee Norris played class nerd Minkus, a foil and sometimes friend for Corey and Sean.

05:45.240 --> 05:49.160
Minkus would only be around in the first season, though he would have a memorable cameo later

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
in the series.

05:50.160 --> 05:55.200
You are gonna live in the lap of luxury because I am a provider, babe.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.040
Lily Nixay played Morgan, Corey's younger sister.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.440
The Morgan type character was a staple of the family sitcom, being the adorable little

06:01.440 --> 06:04.080
kid who would come in to deliver a few cute one-liners.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.240
Hey, go to the game with my sister and her doll!

06:07.240 --> 06:08.240
Great!

06:08.320 --> 06:11.880
Maybe during the seventh inning stretch, I could run through the stadium in my old Spider-Man

06:11.880 --> 06:12.880
underwear.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.280
Well, you don't have to dress up for me.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.480
Betsy Randall played Amy, Corey's mother.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.320
Randall at the time had appeared on a handful of other sitcoms, most notably with a recurring

06:23.320 --> 06:24.600
role in Home Improvement.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.160
Amy would provide guidance to all of her kids throughout the series' run.

06:28.160 --> 06:33.480
Let's see, when you have your 20th high school reunion, I'll be...

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
44th.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.600
Mom, how can that be possible?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
You're already...

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
It's possible.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.120
It's not only possible, it's the way it's going to be.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.720
William Russ played Corey's father, Alan.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.360
Much like the role of Eric, Alan was also recast after a test pilot.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.920
And much like Amy, Alan would provide words of wisdom to his children, often being highlighted

06:53.920 --> 06:56.560
as the male role model for young Corey.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
Remember before the children?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.120
Before we were married?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.760
Before we knew each other?

07:01.760 --> 07:04.760
Remember how happy we were?

07:04.760 --> 07:08.840
Although she wasn't a part of the original principal cast, it would be impossible not

07:08.840 --> 07:13.240
to mention the season 1 recurring character, Topanga Lawrence, played by Daniel Fischl.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.760
Taking her name from a canyon in California that Michael Jacobs happened upon while on

07:16.760 --> 07:21.460
a drive, Topanga is a free spirit who is in stark contrast to Corey and Sean.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.080
She would be the love interest for Corey when she joined the principal cast in season 2.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.120
Topanga's triple teamed at the timeline.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.400
She breaks the trap, heads to the top of the key and leaps toward the basket, doing a spiraling

07:31.400 --> 07:32.400
Tomahawk 360!

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
Slam dunk!

07:33.400 --> 07:43.760
A number of other characters would be introduced throughout the show's run.

07:43.760 --> 07:50.880
But for season 1, these were the characters Corey would be meeting the world alongside.

07:50.880 --> 07:56.000
On September 24th, 1993, Boy Meets World debuted with its pilot episode, creatively titled

07:56.000 --> 07:57.160
Pilot.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.720
This episode's plot used the very example Michael Jacobs referenced when talking about

08:00.720 --> 08:04.600
his idea for the series, with Corey feeling betrayed when Eric takes a date to a baseball

08:04.600 --> 08:13.320
game instead of his younger brother.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.360
Corey's feeling of betrayal manifests into a skepticism towards love in general.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.080
And in a fitting lesson, his class happens to be learning about Romeo and Juliet.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.200
When he accidentally sees Mr. Feeny was stood up for a date, Corey throws that in his teacher's

08:25.200 --> 08:35.520
face as part of his stand against love.

08:35.520 --> 08:54.080
Feeny gives us the first of many speeches where he tries to impart some wisdom to Corey.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.720
When Eric reveals his date was a failure, Corey applies the lesson he learned from Mr.

08:57.720 --> 09:13.200
Feeny and encourages his older brother not to give up on love.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.120
Corey's understanding of the world around him is expanding, and the first lesson in

09:16.120 --> 09:18.080
the pilot is about the power of love.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.560
In other shows, this would be shown by Corey going on a date, but in this case, it's Corey

09:21.560 --> 09:26.120
seeing his brother go on a date and getting a glimpse of Mr. Feeny having a romantic tryst,

09:26.120 --> 09:28.960
even if the salad dinner was actually going to be with his sister.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.560
Rather than experience the world directly, Corey is in the enviable position of getting

09:32.560 --> 09:34.960
a lesson about the world before diving into it.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.920
This is part of the reason Mr. Feeny has such a big role in the series.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.920
Mr. Feeny is teaching these kids lessons about how the world works before they step into

09:41.920 --> 09:45.520
it themselves, much like the kids who would be watching the series at home would be learning

09:45.520 --> 09:48.980
lessons from seeing Corey learn them on TV.

09:48.980 --> 09:52.820
The pilot episode has a heavy emphasis on Corey's home life, but as the series progressed,

09:52.820 --> 09:55.220
the focus would switch more to school and his friends.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.620
The series was still a few episodes from stepping on that path, but we could see how the theme

09:58.620 --> 10:01.780
of learning about the world was still a core of its identity.

10:01.780 --> 10:05.460
The original script for the pilot didn't impress William Daniels.

10:05.460 --> 10:08.460
Speaking in an interview with People.com, Daniels explained,

10:08.460 --> 10:11.120
"...Michael and I are very close.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.700
He likes to tell the story that we had one read-through of the rehearsal and I went to

10:14.700 --> 10:18.460
his office and I quit, and he said, Bill, that was just a read-through.

10:18.460 --> 10:23.180
I said, yeah, but he said, listen to me, I'm going to rework this tonight and you tell

10:23.180 --> 10:24.180
me tomorrow.

10:24.180 --> 10:27.260
If you want to quit, okay, but wait until I revise it.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.660
So the next day, the whole thing, it was different.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.300
He rewrote the damn thing.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.340
So I stayed."

10:33.340 --> 10:37.380
That adaptability, along with a solid premise, gave Boy Meets World a flexibility that allowed

10:37.380 --> 10:40.660
it to change over the years to adapt its theme to new dynamics.

10:40.660 --> 10:45.100
And a few of those new dynamics were introduced very quickly in season one with the key episode,

10:45.100 --> 10:46.600
Corey's Alternative Friends.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.880
In this episode, we're introduced to Topanga.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.880
"- Give me your hand.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.960
Why?

10:52.960 --> 11:01.240
I want to see if our energies converge.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.920
He's vibrationally acceptable."

11:02.920 --> 11:07.240
Whereas Sean is Corey's partner in crime as the average back row slacker, Topanga is

11:07.240 --> 11:09.000
completely unlike Corey.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.920
She's willing to stand out when Corey would rather blend in.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.360
"- People make fun of you, Topanga.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.600
No, I couldn't take it.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.800
I just want to blend in.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.800
Well, you're sure good at it.

11:21.800 --> 11:27.360
You look like all the other plain-wrapped kids at school, except for your red hat.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.200
Hey, I got that on cat night.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.800
I had to wait an hour in line.

11:32.800 --> 11:40.400
Well, if it's important to you, then it's beautiful."

11:40.400 --> 11:44.280
After a hair styling accident, all part of an attempt by Corey to blend in with the other

11:44.280 --> 11:47.480
kids, he learns the importance of being true to one's inner self.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.960
And he also learns the value of his social conscience when he helps Topanga and her friends

11:50.960 --> 11:54.720
create a blockade to keep the school librarian from being replaced.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.640
Corey also finds out that there might be more to him in Topanga than a passing friendship.

11:58.640 --> 12:02.480
"- Sometimes, the reluctant warrior is the bravest warrior.

12:02.480 --> 12:11.200
You're not gonna, like, kiss me now, are you?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
Would it be your first kiss?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Hey, don't come near me.

12:13.200 --> 12:21.840
Because it would be interesting if all your life you remembered that your first kiss happened

12:21.840 --> 12:23.520
when you thought you looked weird.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.800
I would have to feel I really knew the person and that I liked him.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800
Good.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.800
Good."

12:29.800 --> 12:43.920
Although it would be some time before we saw how this romance would play out, it was

12:43.920 --> 12:48.440
here we first got a glimpse of this key relationship, the Corey and Topanga romance.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.040
And while the kiss at the end is probably most remembered by audiences, the small moment

12:52.040 --> 12:54.840
they share at the end of the episode was also sweet.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.120
What makes this relationship interesting is how the power dynamics are inverted.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.920
It might be because of their age or Topanga just generally having a strong will, but it

13:01.920 --> 13:06.000
is at odds with the more traditional stories where the boy makes the first move.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.640
And the broader lesson for Corey here is how someone can enter his life and turn it completely

13:09.640 --> 13:10.760
upside down.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.520
The show may be titled Boy Meets World, but sometimes it's the world that's meeting

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
the boy.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.160
And while Corey can't control someone such as Topanga, he can control his reaction to

13:19.160 --> 13:22.560
her and use this chance to learn more about himself in the process.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.840
The Topanga character wasn't intended to be a major part of the series, but would be

13:25.840 --> 13:29.520
written into a number of episodes for the first season, one of the producers, Jeff

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
Manal explains.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.520
When their hands touch, there's a spark.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.600
They had chemistry, the two kids, the actors, so we just kept writing storylines and I think

13:36.600 --> 13:38.400
it progressed as a natural thing.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.480
The episode shifted Boy Meets World more towards school life for Corey and his friends, which

13:42.480 --> 13:45.840
is only natural is that this is the setting where change happens in a young person's

13:45.840 --> 13:49.500
life, a safe staging area for the big changes of the real world.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.360
Another key change in this episode was the role of Sean.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.560
In the first few episodes of this series, we see Corey and Sean with a rotating third

13:55.560 --> 13:56.560
friend.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.320
None of these third kids ever quite worked out, and though a third friend was written

13:59.320 --> 14:03.000
for Corey's alternative friends, the actor who was supposed to play him was fired and

14:03.000 --> 14:04.880
all of his lines were given to Sean.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.660
This created space for what would be another of the show's most important relationships,

14:08.660 --> 14:10.260
the Corey and Sean friendship.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.680
There were still a few rough edges this early in the series.

14:12.680 --> 14:17.000
Sean, for instance, makes reference to a sister we will never hear about again, apparently

14:17.000 --> 14:20.840
an artifact from the lines of the third kid in the episode's original script.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.680
We also get a sense of Sean having a similar middle-class life to Corey, only he's a

14:24.680 --> 14:26.600
bit taller with better hair.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.240
Over time we would learn a lot more about Sean and his unique circumstances, but this

14:30.240 --> 14:33.400
episode was about establishing the close friendship that these two have.

14:33.400 --> 14:37.920
There were a few key episodes in season one that would establish who Sean was as a character.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.360
In Santa's Little Helper, we find out that Sean's father has lost his job.

14:41.960 --> 14:53.520
In addition to the financial strain Sean faces at home, we also find out that Sean has his

14:53.520 --> 14:58.000
tendency to be a bit more rebellious than Corey in the episode titled The Fugitive, where

14:58.000 --> 14:59.480
he blows up a mailbox.

15:11.360 --> 15:24.480
Both of these episodes would establish important parts of the Corey and Sean friendship.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.520
They raise questions for Corey on how to best stand by his friend when he needs support

15:28.520 --> 15:31.880
because of his difficult life, and how best to steer him on the right path when something

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
goes wrong.

15:32.880 --> 15:47.880
The importance of this friendship reveals that lesson about how to navigate the world

15:47.880 --> 15:52.280
aren't just imparted to kids from wise adults, such as Mr. Feeney, but also learned from

15:52.280 --> 15:56.480
other kids, such as Corey being a positive influence to Sean, and in some ways, Sean

15:56.480 --> 15:59.760
serving as a lesson on what type of behavior to avoid.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.040
As the series is focusing on that journey to adulthood, it's important to ask how

16:03.040 --> 16:06.440
it plots that route out for its characters, and with something as important as raising

16:06.440 --> 16:10.680
the next generation of adults, in its first season, Boy Meets World plays it safe, and

16:10.680 --> 16:12.720
it takes certain assumptions for granted.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.760
The Matthews family lives in a suburban Philadelphia neighborhood.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.960
The kids have their basics met, their school is well-equipped, and they embody typical

16:19.960 --> 16:22.160
American TV sitcom values.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.600
Their major influences in life are their friends, family, and teachers.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.720
And those influences are all within a greater context of an idealized world for those kids

16:30.720 --> 16:34.840
to grow in without facing any traumatic hardships, at least in the first season.

16:34.840 --> 16:54.720
In the episode Model Family, it opens with a clip from the 1950s sitcom Leave it to Beaver.

16:54.720 --> 16:59.120
This episode offers the kids a chance to roleplay the parts of a model family.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.720
The message of the episode is that family lives are complicated and not the tidy package

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
you see on TV.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.040
Only it doesn't really work as the Matthews family, for all its modern faults, is still

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
ideal.

17:09.040 --> 17:12.800
The parents are happily married, there's no sign of financial strain, and they generally

17:12.800 --> 17:15.260
all have happy, positive lives.

17:15.260 --> 17:19.520
This is the comfy white middle-class family that the America of the 90s treated pretty

17:19.520 --> 17:22.280
well, at least compared to other families.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.780
Leave it to Beaver and the first season of Boy Meets World are both operated in the same

17:25.780 --> 17:30.200
kind of world, one where certain norms keep the Cleavers and the Matthews from facing

17:30.200 --> 17:49.400
financial ruin or other traumas.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.680
While the writing may have changed, the premise is still the same, asking the question of

17:52.680 --> 17:55.200
how children become adults in the modern American world.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.040
In its first season, the show does very little to question the modern American world, instead

17:59.040 --> 18:02.520
taking its assumption of a comfortable middle-class suburbia for granted.

18:02.520 --> 18:07.000
As an example, in the episode Risky Business, Cory and Sean are tasked with starting a business

18:07.000 --> 18:21.400
and instead bet on a horse race.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.140
Cory and Sean learn the positive impact of risks, though the lesson is turned on its

18:25.140 --> 18:35.420
head when Cory risks leaving Morgan at home alone, and she breaks a window.

18:35.420 --> 18:53.460
And they learn an important lesson about taking risks.

18:53.460 --> 18:57.620
This episode reinforces the American cliché of being a self-starter, with Cory and Sean's

18:57.620 --> 19:00.060
business strategy literally being a gamble.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.420
And the reason it isn't necessarily a bad thing is because it was an amount of money

19:03.420 --> 19:04.820
they could afford to lose.

19:04.820 --> 19:08.880
The irreplaceable Morgan, on the other hand, was a very bad thing to risk.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.340
This raises an interesting question, though.

19:11.340 --> 19:14.160
What about people who can't afford to take risks?

19:14.160 --> 19:18.220
This lesson at a larger scale would mean more than gambling on a horse, it would mean gambling

19:18.220 --> 19:22.440
on yourself and risking personal finance chasing business success.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.660
After all, that was the lesson for the kids, how they would turn a small investment into

19:25.660 --> 19:26.980
a thriving business.

19:26.980 --> 19:31.060
But anyone without the resources to start a business doesn't really have access to

19:31.060 --> 19:32.100
this kind of risk.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.820
Or rather, even if they have those resources, they may not be able to afford to lose them

19:35.820 --> 19:36.820
at all.

19:36.820 --> 19:41.300
It reveals this lesson, which seems universal, to rather be a reflection of the class dynamics

19:41.300 --> 19:45.300
that afford some people that have the means to take risks while others don't.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.820
In this way, the first season of Boy Meets World reveals itself to be a deeply conservative

19:48.820 --> 19:53.660
show, taking the status quo of its world for granted to teach lessons that are less universal

19:53.660 --> 19:56.060
when stepping outside of the bubble it creates.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.260
This isn't to say the show didn't at least make some attempts at making contemporary

19:59.260 --> 20:00.260
critiques.

20:00.260 --> 20:04.140
In the episode, Teachers Bet, Mr. Feeny challenges Corey with teaching the rest of the class

20:04.140 --> 20:08.060
ahead of an upcoming test, with the promise of a nude bike if he can get more kids to

20:08.060 --> 20:09.220
pass the test.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.820
As the class spirals out of control, Corey tries to regain some of it, and he's forced

20:12.820 --> 20:16.180
to learn the material more deeply so he can teach it to his fellow students.

20:16.180 --> 20:20.460
And the class's particular lesson for this week is on discrimination.

20:20.460 --> 20:24.380
Corey struggles, as he's under the assumption that discrimination is a thing of the past,

20:24.380 --> 20:38.420
until something happens to Eric's girlfriend Linda.

20:38.420 --> 20:42.380
When Corey tries to teach the class about discrimination, he uses an unconventional

20:42.380 --> 20:43.380
method.

20:43.380 --> 21:07.620
He calls Sean an anti-Italian racial slur.

21:07.620 --> 21:26.620
The number of kids who passed was the same as last time, so Corey doesn't win the bet,

21:26.620 --> 21:30.380
but that's a pretty good result, considering Corey is just a kid and he apparently teaches

21:30.380 --> 21:33.140
just as well as Mr. Feeny, for one test anyway.

21:33.140 --> 21:37.500
Corey's methods are extreme, and the sort that would only work among kids, as a teacher

21:37.500 --> 21:41.140
using a racial slur on a student would take a different tone.

21:41.140 --> 21:44.860
But it does highlight how the show is willing to acknowledge an issue like prejudice, albeit

21:44.860 --> 21:49.340
from the perspective of a group of characters who are largely only talking about it hypothetically

21:49.340 --> 21:50.540
in a classroom setting.

21:50.540 --> 21:55.620
It also at least introduces us to Linda putting a face to an actual victim of discrimination,

21:55.620 --> 21:58.140
though her guest role wouldn't last more than this episode.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.140
And it speaks volumes that the show had to bring in a whole new character to even have

22:01.140 --> 22:04.980
the means of directly approaching the topic of racial discrimination.

22:04.980 --> 22:08.700
In this way, Boy Meets World was able to tackle an important issue, though its work

22:08.700 --> 22:12.900
is really just in uncovering that truth that discrimination still exists in the modern

22:12.900 --> 22:16.060
day, which is, of course, very valuable to know.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.020
But it doesn't take it much further than that, it doesn't explore where these ideas

22:19.020 --> 22:22.540
come from, the systems that uphold them, or how to undermine them.

22:22.540 --> 22:27.700
Though fair enough, perhaps it's worth stepping back and acknowledging that such a deep dive

22:27.700 --> 22:31.420
in discrimination is a bit too much for an 11 year old.

22:31.420 --> 22:34.620
Episodes such as these reveal the series wasn't afraid of varying away from the silly

22:34.620 --> 22:39.060
or comedic associated with sitcoms that focus on kids, and in the future, the series would

22:39.060 --> 22:41.300
more fully embrace weightier subjects.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.940
The first season of Boy Meets World is a bit of an outlier, clearly geared toward a younger

22:44.940 --> 22:48.720
audience and the only season before the teen years of Cory and his friends.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.240
That may be why it played it so safe, taking a very conventional approach to depicting

22:52.240 --> 22:55.260
the precarious journey from childhood to adulthood.

22:55.260 --> 23:00.940
Later seasons would be far more daring.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.440
Season 2 brought with it a number of major changes.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.940
Most importantly, Cory and his friends would be going to high school, although we wouldn't

23:06.940 --> 23:09.220
be watching all of their high school journeys.

23:09.220 --> 23:13.900
The character Stuart Minkus exited the series after season 1, and he would be replaced by

23:13.900 --> 23:14.900
Topanga.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.840
This wasn't based on a competing spot, though.

23:16.840 --> 23:21.460
At the same time, on Family Matters, the character of Steve Urkel was massively popular.

23:21.460 --> 23:25.700
Minkus was considered too similar to Urkel, and so he was cut from the show.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.540
Season 2 also brought a number of new faces as well.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.500
Cory and Sean were confronted by their first bully, Harley Keiner, played by Danny McNulty,

23:33.500 --> 23:39.260
flanked by his henchmen, Joey, played by Blake Soper, and Frankie, played by Ethan Suppley.

23:39.260 --> 23:43.820
Anthony Tyler Quinn joined the principal cast as the high school English teacher, Jonathan

23:43.820 --> 23:48.220
Turner, a young teacher who adopts a different approach from last year's Mr. Feeney.

23:58.540 --> 24:08.620
This doesn't mean Mr. Feeney would be leaving us, though.

24:08.620 --> 24:12.980
Not only was he transferred to the same school Cory and Sean went to, John Adams High School,

24:12.980 --> 24:21.300
but he would be pulling double duty as both history teacher and school principal.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.380
The cast weren't the only ones changing, though.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.660
The audience was starting to change alongside them.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.940
Michael Jacobs explained in an interview.

24:27.940 --> 24:32.580
At the beginning of the series, Sean, Feeney, and Topango all tested higher than Cory Matthews,

24:32.580 --> 24:35.020
because these were the characters that viewers understood.

24:35.020 --> 24:36.820
You understood Sean immediately.

24:36.820 --> 24:40.020
You understood Topanga as odd and lovely and wonderful.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.580
Feeney was the authority figure.

24:41.580 --> 24:46.780
He tested highest, even with kids, but by the second season, Cory eclipsed everybody.

24:46.780 --> 24:50.460
What happened was, the kids wanted to be Sean and wanted to be Topanga.

24:50.460 --> 24:53.060
They don't want to say they want to be what they are.

24:53.060 --> 24:57.900
Cory became a hero for Beat himself, and everybody flocked to the fact that, wait, I have potential

24:58.260 --> 24:59.740
in just being who I am.

24:59.740 --> 25:02.860
And kids were finally honest enough to answer the question correctly.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.460
Who do I associate with?

25:04.460 --> 25:06.860
I am Cory Matthews.

25:06.860 --> 25:10.380
As the audience found its footing, so did the series, and Boy Meets World began to grow

25:10.380 --> 25:14.820
into a more sophisticated show, speaking to the real issues and concerns facing kids who

25:14.820 --> 25:18.700
no longer saw the series as solely aspirational, but rather something that reflected their

25:18.700 --> 25:19.700
own lives.

25:19.700 --> 25:24.420
And the character of Sean Hunter would serve as a lesson in how things can go wrong.

25:24.420 --> 25:28.300
Although he blew up a mailbox and faced some financial hardship in season one, it's

25:28.300 --> 25:32.220
seasons two and three that really establish how Sean's life differs from Cory's.

25:32.220 --> 25:36.020
Actor Ryder Strong explained his interpretation of Sean in an interview, saying,

25:48.020 --> 25:52.820
Obviously, within the confines of a safe family sitcom, so it's not like Sean was shooting

25:52.820 --> 25:54.260
up or killing people.

25:54.260 --> 25:57.660
While Sean wasn't about to blow up a mailbox every week on the show, he did continue to

25:57.660 --> 26:02.300
engage in some low-level hijinks, like changing the school paper's headline to a solid burn

26:02.300 --> 26:03.380
on Mr. Feeny.

26:09.780 --> 26:13.100
The headline is traced to Cory, who decides to cover for Sean, and the episode is about

26:13.100 --> 26:15.780
not writing out your friend when they do something wrong.

26:15.780 --> 26:19.380
And by something wrong, in this case, they mean something totally awesome.

26:19.380 --> 26:23.060
While Cory is the positive influence keeping Sean from screwing up too badly, the limits

26:23.060 --> 26:27.100
of that are tested as the bullies present an alternative in the episode, Wrong Side

26:27.100 --> 26:28.100
of the Tracks.

26:28.100 --> 26:31.060
Look, I just think you're gonna have a problem if you hang out with guys like that.

26:31.060 --> 26:33.140
Yeah, well they happen to be my kind of guys, okay?

26:33.140 --> 26:34.140
We're part of the same circle.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.140
Look, Sean.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.140
Cory.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.540
Let go.

26:37.540 --> 26:41.140
We find out that Sean believes his own future has already been decided.

26:41.140 --> 26:46.140
Cory, you and I are different, and sooner or later we're gonna end up in different places.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.140
Says who?

26:47.140 --> 26:50.420
Why don't we both just do us a favor right now and call it quits, okay?

26:50.420 --> 26:51.820
What has gotten into you?

26:51.820 --> 26:53.700
You just don't get it, do you?

26:53.700 --> 26:54.700
Get what?

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
Look at your house, Cory.

26:55.700 --> 26:56.700
Look at where you live.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.700
Look at where I live.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.700
Look at your parents.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.700
Look at my parents.

26:59.700 --> 27:00.700
I know where I'm gonna end up.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.700
Just let me get there now.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.700
Sean!

27:02.700 --> 27:07.820
Just let me get there now!

27:07.820 --> 27:11.660
What's interesting about Sean's turn away from Cory is not that Cory is a bad friend,

27:11.660 --> 27:15.060
as we just saw Cory willing to take the fall for Sean in an earlier episode.

27:15.060 --> 27:18.900
This is about how Sean sees himself, and how he doesn't consider a guy like him good enough

27:18.900 --> 27:20.940
to be friends with a guy like Cory.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.100
Ironically, Sean wants to stop hanging around Cory because he cares enough to not want to

27:25.100 --> 27:27.720
drag him down with the path he assumes he's on.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.980
For all of Cory's work to help his friend, it's not quite enough to steer Sean in the

27:30.980 --> 27:33.580
right direction, as the influence of the bullies increases.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.500
If you're gonna do this, Sean, then I'm gonna do it.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
This is not your place, okay?

27:36.500 --> 27:37.500
What are you saying?

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
I don't belong here?

27:38.500 --> 27:39.500
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
Look, if you belong here, then I belong here.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.460
Hey, baboon, look, we got some business here, alright?

27:44.460 --> 27:47.500
So I suggest that you walk away while your legs still bend only once.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.860
Listen, Kyle, this is between me and Sean.

27:49.860 --> 28:02.820
Luckily for Sean, and Cory's face, Mr. Turner shows up to talk some sense into Sean.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.860
Can you drag the trailer park trash up the decent society?

28:23.860 --> 28:26.860
Hey, if you don't know that deep down inside, you're alright.

28:27.860 --> 28:29.860
And I haven't taught you anything at all.

28:31.860 --> 28:32.860
You think I'm alright?

28:32.860 --> 28:34.860
I think you need to think you're alright.

28:35.860 --> 28:37.860
You think I'm alright?

28:39.860 --> 28:45.860
I think, if you put your mind to it and get back inside that school, and never, never

28:45.860 --> 28:48.860
go near this Harley, or that Harley.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.860
Yeah, I think you'll be alright.

28:52.860 --> 28:56.860
What was so great about this episode is that it reveals Sean's bad behaviour isn't a

28:56.860 --> 29:01.860
product of some inner drive to be a bad kid, but rather a reflection of how Sean sees himself

29:01.860 --> 29:02.860
through the world around him.

29:02.860 --> 29:06.860
All the jokes and comments about being poor and not getting good grades reinforce the

29:06.860 --> 29:09.860
idea that Sean's not someone who's going to succeed in life.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.860
And as his performance worsens, those messages get louder and louder.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.860
And the only way to break the cycle is for people in his life to show him that he's

29:16.860 --> 29:18.860
worth more than what the world is telling him.

29:18.860 --> 29:23.860
Implicit in this is a condemnation of a society that lets any kid feel lesser than some social

29:23.860 --> 29:27.860
standard because they may not be excelling at school, or they come from a less privileged

29:27.860 --> 29:28.860
background.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.860
Although the series doesn't explore these topics directly in this episode, it does become

29:31.860 --> 29:33.860
more explicit as the show progresses.

29:33.860 --> 29:37.860
And the pensive expression on Mr. Turner's face at the end of the episode reveals that

29:37.860 --> 29:40.860
this issue hasn't been entirely settled.

29:40.860 --> 29:44.860
The two episodes at the end of season 2, Career Day and Home, further emphasize the unfolding

29:44.860 --> 29:48.860
tragedy of Sean's life when his mother runs off with the family's mobile home,

29:48.860 --> 29:51.860
and Chet's father chases after her, leaving Sean behind.

29:51.860 --> 29:54.860
Chet Hunter is played by Blake Clark.

29:54.860 --> 30:14.860
Sean ends up staying with the Matthews family, and we quickly find out that situation is not ideal.

30:24.860 --> 30:30.860
With hospitality wearing thin at the Matthews home, Sean decides to take up Mr. Turner's

30:30.860 --> 30:34.860
offer for a place to stay, and when Sean finds out that his father isn't coming back any

30:34.860 --> 30:37.860
time soon, that offer becomes more permanent.

30:55.860 --> 31:02.860
This episode completes the second season's arc for Mr. Turner and Sean, as the two branch

31:02.860 --> 31:04.860
off into some of their own stories for the third season.

31:04.860 --> 31:08.860
But what's worth highlighting here is how the characters of Mr. Turner and Sean are

31:08.860 --> 31:11.860
wildly different in what they represent in the real world.

31:11.860 --> 31:15.860
Sean's experience is common enough that we could expect to see it in the real world today.

31:15.860 --> 31:19.860
A kid who's told he'll never amount to anything because he's poorer then goes on to

31:19.860 --> 31:21.860
live down to those expectations.

31:21.860 --> 31:25.860
Mr. Turner is a teacher who takes an interest in helping that kid, which does certainly

31:25.860 --> 31:29.860
happen in the real world, though he goes a lot farther than you would normally see, going

31:29.860 --> 31:33.860
so far as to open his home to this kid so he'll have a safe place to stay.

31:33.860 --> 31:37.860
When Sean's circumstances start getting bad, it's this extraordinarily uncommon

31:37.860 --> 31:41.860
step that keeps him from running away into the unknown, away even from his friend Cory

31:41.860 --> 31:44.860
and what little security he might have with the Matthews.

31:44.860 --> 31:48.860
The contrast here reveals that Sean's ordinary life, with the destiny of failure

31:48.860 --> 31:53.860
impressed upon him by society, requires extraordinary effort from a teacher to fix.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.860
And what about the kids who aren't as lucky as Sean to have a teacher like Mr. Turner,

31:56.860 --> 31:58.860
or even a friend like Cory?

31:58.860 --> 32:02.860
The relationship between Sean and Mr. Turner continues to be explored in the third season

32:02.860 --> 32:03.860
as the two bond.

32:03.860 --> 32:07.860
We even get sweet moments like these where Sean tries to run away for the third time in the series.

32:18.860 --> 32:33.860
By the end of the third season, it appeared as though Mr. Turner was finally going to

32:33.860 --> 32:37.860
adopt Sean, but Sean can't turn his back on his father, and the two of them run style

32:37.860 --> 32:39.860
and move back to the trailer park.

32:48.860 --> 32:57.860
And so, the Mr. Turner experiment, at least when it came to taking care of Sean, came

32:57.860 --> 32:58.860
to an end.

32:58.860 --> 33:11.860
But there was more to the Mr. Turner character than taking care of Sean.

33:11.860 --> 33:15.860
When he was first introduced in season 2, he also asked it as a foil to the more traditional

33:15.860 --> 33:16.860
Mr. Feeney.

33:16.860 --> 33:42.220
The season 2 premiere helped establish that dynamic in this moment.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.820
This exchange raises an interesting question.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.980
What is the best way to improve a person's understanding of the world?

33:47.980 --> 33:51.500
Do we go to them on their own level, or do we demand that they come up to ours?

33:51.500 --> 33:54.820
If you start low, you might not provide them with the supports they can pull themselves

33:54.820 --> 33:58.620
up higher, but if you start high, they might not try to reach up at all.

33:58.620 --> 34:02.580
One of the more interesting clashes between Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner is in the episode

34:02.580 --> 34:07.300
Wake Up, Little Cory, where Mr. Turner assigns his class to videotape each other talking

34:07.300 --> 34:31.740
about love and sex.

34:31.740 --> 34:34.060
Cory and Topanga partner up for this assignment.

34:34.060 --> 34:37.140
After telling their parents they're staying at each other's homes, Cory and Topanga

34:37.140 --> 34:41.620
spend the whole night editing footage at school, and then they fall asleep together, only to

34:41.620 --> 34:43.380
be discovered later on.

34:43.380 --> 34:55.980
Cory soon becomes a legend at school.

34:55.980 --> 35:17.100
On the other hand, Topanga's reputation is not so esteemed.

35:17.100 --> 35:39.060
Meanwhile the two teachers discuss the fallout.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.780
Cory then cuts together a version of their assignment that's more about love and sex,

35:42.780 --> 36:11.940
and includes a confession from him.

36:11.940 --> 36:16.060
Cory and Topanga make up, but also important is how Mr. Feeney admits he might have been

36:16.060 --> 36:22.580
wrong.

36:22.580 --> 36:26.620
What makes this dynamic particularly interesting is that both teachers have a point.

36:26.620 --> 36:30.620
The assignment did spiral out of control, and for a little while it made Topanga's

36:30.620 --> 36:35.380
life horrible, but it was also in that diversity that Cory was able to rise to the occasion,

36:35.380 --> 36:39.460
though it seems a bit unfair for him to have learned a lesson at the expense of someone

36:39.460 --> 36:40.460
else.

36:40.460 --> 36:43.820
It did reveal an important gender dynamic when it comes to sex and gossip, though, and

36:43.820 --> 36:47.660
how it benefits the boys while hurting the girls, and that it was the side in power that

36:47.660 --> 36:50.860
needed to learn the lesson, not the side that's victimized.

36:50.860 --> 36:54.060
But above all the lessons learned in this episode, what caught my eye was how the clashing

36:54.060 --> 36:58.340
styles of Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner reveal that neither one is entirely right.

36:58.340 --> 37:03.120
Mr. Turner overestimated how well the kids would handle talking about sex, and Mr. Feeney

37:03.120 --> 37:04.620
underestimated them.

37:04.620 --> 37:08.820
In these seasons, the series is very much about replacing the idea of the always wise

37:08.820 --> 37:13.260
and unerring Mr. Feeney with an alternative to that style of teaching, suggesting that

37:13.260 --> 37:17.180
it's not that kids can only learn through classic methods, but also the question on

37:17.180 --> 37:21.940
how to educate kids is a negotiation between old and new techniques, ideally finding the

37:21.940 --> 37:26.140
optimal may of moving forward by experimenting with what new stuff might work while holding

37:26.140 --> 37:28.300
onto the old stuff that still does.

37:28.300 --> 37:32.620
This episode also marks part of the small drift Cory and Topanga had towards one another

37:32.620 --> 37:34.300
throughout the second season.

37:34.300 --> 37:37.660
It wouldn't be happening all at once, but series creator Michael Jacobs explained this

37:37.660 --> 37:40.140
was an idea he had early on.

37:40.140 --> 37:43.300
I thought, what's going to happen with this boy confused by life?

37:43.300 --> 37:45.660
What would be the stabilizing influences?

37:45.660 --> 37:49.300
And I thought he would want to discover and find love forever, and we pretty much decided

37:49.300 --> 37:52.660
early on that, wouldn't it be great if we could do a show about a kid who knew what

37:52.660 --> 37:53.660
he wanted?

37:53.660 --> 37:57.020
Fell in absolute love with somebody, and against every conceivable storyline we could come

37:57.020 --> 37:58.860
up, they would make it work.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.160
And that was something that we wanted early on.

38:01.160 --> 38:05.300
The second season's second episode, pairing off, introduces the world of dating to the

38:05.300 --> 38:08.420
series, and it would be a major focal point for the rest of its run.

38:08.420 --> 38:12.140
It also signified that this show would be growing up alongside its characters and its

38:12.140 --> 38:13.140
audience.

38:13.140 --> 38:22.700
Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend, believe me, I don't want this any more than

38:22.700 --> 38:26.940
you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves

38:26.940 --> 38:29.940
a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.060
Cory and Topanga aren't quite ready to be a thing just yet.

38:33.060 --> 38:38.820
Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love, then after a week

38:38.820 --> 38:43.020
they hate each other, so for one great passionate week we lose a friendship that could last

38:43.020 --> 38:44.020
a lifetime.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.020
I'm in if you are.

38:46.020 --> 38:52.260
Cory, don't worry, I'm sure there's someone out there for you.

38:52.260 --> 38:54.700
Give me a name!

38:54.700 --> 38:58.420
Cory steps out in the world and has a few dates with other girls, though none of them lasts

38:58.420 --> 38:59.420
for very long.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.620
Although maybe he should have worked on his fashion sense a bit more, I'm not sure the

39:02.620 --> 39:06.740
plaid shirt on top of another plaid shirt on top of a third shirt was really working

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
for him.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.880
But while these other girls give Cory a taste of dating life, he's consistently drawn closer

39:11.880 --> 39:13.280
to Topanga.

39:13.280 --> 39:17.420
And it's in season 3 that we see Cory and Topanga get closer in the episode by best

39:17.420 --> 39:43.180
friend's girl, where Shawn decides to push things along.

39:43.180 --> 40:05.180
Driven by jealousy, Cory finally asks out Topanga.

40:05.180 --> 40:18.000
And of course Cory and Shawn remain bros.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.540
As the Cory and Topanga relationship develops, we learn more about their history with one

40:21.540 --> 40:36.340
another.

40:36.340 --> 40:39.500
Cory and Topanga's history before the start of the show changes throughout the years,

40:39.500 --> 40:43.700
but more important than the messy continuity is how these changing stories establish their

40:43.700 --> 40:47.940
deep romantic connection, presenting young love as something eternally true.

40:47.940 --> 40:51.660
A love story like this sticks out like a sore thumb, particularly in the present day

40:51.660 --> 40:55.260
where most relationships have traded romanticism for realism.

40:55.260 --> 40:58.380
It's probably here that the series feels most unreal, although it's done in a way

40:58.380 --> 41:02.220
that isn't quite as simple as the fairy tale it's often remembered as.

41:02.220 --> 41:07.180
Aside from Cory and Topanga needing two seasons to even start dating, they break up very quickly,

41:07.180 --> 41:10.220
11 episodes later, and the grass is always greener.

41:10.220 --> 41:36.740
It would be another 9 episodes before we see them reconcile when they go to Disney

41:36.740 --> 41:56.060
World in The Happiest Show on Earth.

41:56.060 --> 41:59.940
A cynical reading of an episode like this would be how Cory and Topanga are meant to

41:59.940 --> 42:04.400
be together in so far that they are brought together by the corporate-fix simile of magic.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.480
The needs for sitcom romances to end happily, and they reconcile in another corporate-fix

42:08.480 --> 42:10.680
simile of magic, Disney World.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.760
But I think it would be unfair to write this romance off entirely.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.700
It took Cory and Topanga nearly two seasons to reach this point after all, struggling

42:17.700 --> 42:21.040
to come to terms with their feelings and then making an effort to stay together.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.240
And this would hardly be the storybook ending for the couple as they had more challenges

42:24.240 --> 42:25.600
to come in the future.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.480
The romanticism of this pairing confronts the harsh reality of the real world.

42:29.480 --> 42:33.040
It's a small example of how idealism can survive the crushing weight of the cynical

42:33.040 --> 42:37.160
world, but only if the people involved are willing to do the work to stay together.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.840
And far from being perfect, they stumble and fall along the way.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
That's what helps make this couple feel relatable.

42:41.840 --> 42:45.880
They represent the good of the old that overcomes the challenges of the new.

42:45.880 --> 42:49.920
The idea that love, when it's real, can overcome anything so long as you don't give

42:49.920 --> 42:50.920
up on it.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.520
A few notes before leaving these seasons.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.040
There were several changes to the cast.

42:54.040 --> 42:59.360
When the character Harley exits the series, he's briefly replaced by Adam Scott as Griff.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.600
Griff wouldn't last long, and the bullies would be phased out of the series in later

43:02.600 --> 43:03.600
seasons.

43:03.600 --> 43:07.160
Season 3 also introduced the character Eli Williams to the principal cast, played by

43:07.160 --> 43:08.400
Alex Dazer.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.720
He was a friend of Mr. Turner and briefly a teacher at John Adams High School.

43:11.720 --> 43:15.520
Though with Mr. Turner playing less of a role in Season 4, his friend exited the series

43:15.520 --> 43:17.880
entirely at the end of Season 3.

43:17.880 --> 43:21.560
The biggest departure was saying goodbye to the original Morgan in Season 2.

43:21.560 --> 43:26.000
Lily Nixay was not terribly happy being on the show, so it was decided she would leave.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.580
She would be replaced halfway through Season 3 by Lindsay Ridgeway.

43:29.580 --> 43:33.460
As for why we didn't see Morgan for so long, she explained that it was a very long

43:33.460 --> 43:34.460
time out.

43:34.460 --> 43:54.100
And later in Season 3, we find out why she got that time out.

43:54.100 --> 43:57.560
As Boy Meets World matured, so too did the type of stories it told.

43:57.560 --> 44:01.560
The simpler ideas of listening to your teacher in the first season gave way to more complicated

44:01.560 --> 44:04.040
relationships with authority in the second and third.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.160
And through the character of Sean, class dynamics and expectations began to make their way through

44:08.160 --> 44:10.920
the safe middle-class bubble we had first met him in.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.280
In Season 4 and 5, this became increasingly more pronounced.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.360
In particular, as more of Sean's family became part of the story.

44:17.360 --> 44:21.720
With Mr. Turner out and Chet Hunter in, as Sean's father figure, we get a better sense

44:21.720 --> 44:24.560
of where Sean came from and how that shaped him.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.720
In Fishing for Verna, we meet Sean's mother Verna, played by Shireen Mitchell, ready to

44:28.720 --> 44:53.920
try being a family again with the Hunter men.

44:53.920 --> 45:06.200
Chet tries to be a better father by getting a stable job as the school janitor.

45:06.200 --> 45:09.280
Sean is eventually drawn into a fight with a kid mocking his father.

45:09.280 --> 45:13.360
When Sean makes a trip to the principal's office, Mr. Feeny offers to fire Chet, knowing

45:13.360 --> 45:17.240
Sean would eventually realize he doesn't want to take away his father's first steady

45:17.240 --> 45:25.120
paycheck.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.460
In addition to Sean learning an important lesson, what was particularly nice about this

45:28.460 --> 45:33.200
episode was featuring someone working a janitorial job who doesn't, and shouldn't, feel any

45:33.200 --> 45:41.960
shame about it.

45:41.960 --> 45:45.640
That may not have been the best dad, but in the fourth season, he makes an effort to

45:45.640 --> 45:49.560
be better, and that happens to start with working a job to support his family.

45:49.560 --> 45:53.040
And it serves as a reminder that people's lives can take a number of turns for a variety

45:53.040 --> 45:56.640
of reasons, whether it be a few bad choices or just some bad luck.

45:56.640 --> 46:00.160
It doesn't matter nearly as much as treating them with respect and acknowledging the hard

46:00.160 --> 46:01.240
work they do.

46:01.240 --> 46:04.920
This job isn't a punishment for Chet's mistakes, but an opportunity to start making

46:04.920 --> 46:06.160
things right.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.880
It also shows us that these are people with lives and families who take some pride in

46:09.880 --> 46:11.120
enjoying their work.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.960
The episode where Verna returned similarly took a moment to acknowledge the school cafeteria

46:14.960 --> 46:19.560
lunch server as well, revealing how the Hunter family is strongly connected to working class

46:19.560 --> 46:20.560
characters.

46:20.560 --> 46:24.840
Although these are small gestures in the grand scheme of things, they are appreciated nonetheless.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.840
Sean's family also offers a glimpse into more class dynamics when his parents depart,

46:29.840 --> 46:33.960
and in the fifth season we meet Sean's half-brother, Jack, played by Matthew Lawrence.

46:33.960 --> 46:38.280
Jack is not to be confused with Sean's other brother Eddie, who we briefly meet and then

46:38.280 --> 46:42.280
never hear about again in the season 3 episode, The Pink Flamingo Kid.

46:42.280 --> 46:46.820
Jack joins Boy Meets World in season 5 opener, Brothers, whereas Sean grew up in poverty

46:46.820 --> 46:50.400
with their father, Jack lived comfortably with his mother and her new husband.

46:50.400 --> 46:54.080
Although they have trouble getting along because of their time apart, they do at least partially

46:54.080 --> 47:04.720
reconcile by the end of the episode and move in together as Chet takes off once again.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.920
And their other roommate is Cory's brother Eric.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.360
Throughout the series, Jack's posh upbringing would create a divide between the two and

47:11.360 --> 47:14.920
serve as a constant reminder of where these two characters came from.

47:14.920 --> 47:18.360
Michael Jacobs explained the decision to include Jack in an interview saying,

47:18.360 --> 47:22.160
"...Tony's character and Alex Dazer, who played Eli Williams, all of these wonderful

47:22.160 --> 47:26.080
teachers were very beneficial to us, but it was always a coming-of-age comedy, and these

47:26.080 --> 47:28.200
teachers had long since come-of-age.

47:28.200 --> 47:32.200
But we felt that where the magnifying glass needed to be was on the generation that was

47:32.200 --> 47:34.480
coming-of-age, and that's why we added Jack."

47:34.800 --> 47:38.600
Over time, we would see less of these class dynamics as part of Sean's stories, as another

47:38.600 --> 47:42.280
plotline would dominate his stories in later seasons, and Jack would appear more often

47:42.280 --> 47:43.820
in stories with Eric.

47:43.820 --> 47:47.640
But in these seasons, it was established that in the comfy middle-class space of Boy Meets

47:47.640 --> 47:52.360
World, Sean would sometimes take the role of an outsider, his lower-class past and absent

47:52.360 --> 47:55.520
parents reminding him that he doesn't quite fit in.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.400
Another important addition to Sean's side of the stories was the arrival of Angela Moore,

47:59.400 --> 48:00.800
played by Trina McGee.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.960
Although just a random student in her first appearance, she would play a much bigger role

48:03.960 --> 48:08.760
in the episode, I Love You Donna Karen, where Sean, growing dissatisfied with his two-week

48:08.760 --> 48:12.080
limit dating life, falls for the owner of a lost purse.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.680
"- And what if it's not as good as what I have now?"

48:16.280 --> 48:17.480
"- With a purse?"

48:18.840 --> 48:20.600
"- Just draw a bit, Corey.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.040
Listen, what are you so afraid of?"

48:22.040 --> 48:24.560
"- I'm afraid of getting hurt, okay?

48:24.560 --> 48:28.360
I mean, I've seen the pain on my father's face every time a woman walks out because

48:28.360 --> 48:29.920
he's not good enough."

48:29.920 --> 48:33.440
"- Sean, you are not your father."

48:33.440 --> 48:37.520
Sean later finds out the items in the purse belong to Angela, who he had just broken up

48:37.520 --> 48:39.760
with, and he's suddenly filled with regrets.

48:39.760 --> 48:43.680
And after a bit of back and forth on the subject, the two eventually begin dating once again,

48:43.680 --> 48:46.560
only this time for longer than two weeks.

48:46.560 --> 48:50.160
The relationship would be a part of the rest of season five, but it was later seasons that

48:50.160 --> 48:52.560
we would more fully explore this dynamic.

48:52.560 --> 48:56.640
As the series matured, it began tackling bigger social issues, so much so that a number of

48:56.640 --> 48:59.200
episodes would be devoted to challenging topics.

48:59.200 --> 49:03.520
In the episode, Dangerous Secret, Corey suspects Sean is hooking up with Claire, a girl in

49:03.520 --> 49:07.400
her class, only to find out that Claire has been staying with Sean to get away from her

49:07.400 --> 49:08.400
abusive father.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.400
"- Okay, Claire and I aren't doing anything.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.520
We never have.

49:11.520 --> 49:15.520
The reason she's been staying at my place, her dad hits her.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.200
What do you mean he hits her?

49:18.200 --> 49:19.200
At night sometimes.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.760
He yells a lot and beats her up."

49:21.760 --> 49:25.680
Claire fears her father is untouchable, as he happens to be a bank vice president.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.320
And even though the episode ends with Claire going to the police, it only holds the vague

49:29.320 --> 49:32.440
hope that something might improve with her father going to therapy.

49:32.440 --> 49:35.160
The story related back to the main cast in a more roundabout way.

49:35.160 --> 49:38.880
When Corey thought Sean was having sex, he started pushing that line with Topanga, only

49:38.880 --> 49:42.840
to realize he shouldn't base his decision on social pressure, but instead on whether

49:42.840 --> 49:44.880
he and Topanga were both ready.

49:44.880 --> 49:49.520
In cult fiction, feeling disconnected from the world, Sean decides to join a cult.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
"- Do you believe in a mother and a father?

49:51.520 --> 49:53.560
And a comfortable house and a comfortable street?

49:53.560 --> 49:54.560
Because that's what you have?

49:54.960 --> 49:56.520
Well, I don't have that.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.000
So I found something with these people.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.680
Yeah, but who are these people?

49:59.680 --> 50:01.200
Stop trying to take away what I have.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.440
I don't do that to you."

50:02.440 --> 50:06.600
Eventually, when Mr. Turner is in a motorcycle accident, Corey talks some sense into Sean.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.720
"- Turner took care of you.

50:07.720 --> 50:08.800
He loves you.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.040
And you love him.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.680
Is that real?

50:12.680 --> 50:15.240
Or are Mr. Mack in the center real?

50:15.240 --> 50:18.040
You decide, but you cannot go."

50:18.040 --> 50:21.640
This episode hits on the familiar Sean theme of feeling disconnected from the world and

50:21.640 --> 50:22.980
the need for a home.

50:22.980 --> 50:28.100
This episode is also, weirdly, the last time we see Mr. Turner in Boy Meets World.

50:28.100 --> 50:32.860
And in If You Can't Be With The One You Love, Sean develops a drinking problem.

50:32.860 --> 50:36.100
"- Nobody's listening to me, okay?

50:36.100 --> 50:40.300
I drink this stuff because I like it.

50:40.300 --> 50:42.460
It makes me feel good.

50:42.460 --> 50:43.460
Hello?

50:43.460 --> 50:44.460
Hello?

50:44.460 --> 50:47.540
Is this thing on?

50:47.540 --> 50:49.340
I have no problem."

50:49.340 --> 50:55.780
"- Okay, maybe we don't have to talk about this in front of everybody.

50:55.780 --> 50:57.540
Let's just go out into the hall-"

50:57.540 --> 50:58.540
"- Go."

50:58.540 --> 51:06.100
"- I don't like that you drink.

51:06.100 --> 51:11.060
Call me when you don't."

51:11.060 --> 51:16.540
Aside from one relapse in a later season, Sean's alcoholism is largely wrapped up in this episode.

51:16.540 --> 51:20.260
Most sitcoms have a small collection of very special episodes.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.580
Very special episodes being particularly dramatic episodes that tackle social issues.

51:24.580 --> 51:28.380
But Boy Meets World seemed to have multiple very special episodes every season.

51:28.380 --> 51:31.660
For a family sitcom, it very aggressively went after these serious topics.

51:31.660 --> 51:34.820
I might speak to why it continued to resonate over the years.

51:34.820 --> 51:38.300
Boy Meets World did have a tendency to wrap these stories up a bit quickly.

51:38.300 --> 51:43.260
Sean joining an escaping occult really leaps to mind as I wonder how such a traumatic event

51:43.260 --> 51:45.900
could be encapsulated in a little over 20 minutes.

51:45.900 --> 51:49.180
It's helped by playing to common themes of the character, but it still feels like

51:49.180 --> 51:50.180
a stretch.

51:50.180 --> 51:54.140
What these episodes reveal are a lot of good intentions beyond the capacity of a 20-minute

51:54.140 --> 51:58.220
family sitcom, even one that's relatively well put together like Boy Meets World.

51:58.220 --> 52:00.500
It also reveals the limitations of its themes.

52:00.500 --> 52:04.340
Unless the problem was simple and relatable, it didn't fit the format particularly well

52:04.340 --> 52:07.820
and the ones that reached across multiple episodes tended to be more broad and less

52:07.820 --> 52:09.900
specific than a drinking disorder.

52:09.900 --> 52:13.300
It's also worth thinking about how these series began with the idea of school and other

52:13.300 --> 52:16.320
places being safe staging grounds for these short lessons.

52:16.320 --> 52:19.820
If these traumas persisted, it would change the tone of the show and make Boy Meets World

52:19.820 --> 52:24.100
a very different experience, one that might have been too intense for its younger audience,

52:24.100 --> 52:26.820
meaning they wouldn't see depictions of these issues at all.

52:26.820 --> 52:31.540
There is no right or wrong answer in the best approach to very special episodes, just varying

52:31.540 --> 52:35.220
degrees of success or failure based on the premise, characters, and theme a show has

52:35.220 --> 52:36.560
to work with.

52:36.560 --> 52:40.420
In these seasons, the show also started to drift towards more high-concept episodes,

52:40.420 --> 52:44.260
that is, single episodes with a unique premise that allow the characters to be placed in

52:44.260 --> 52:45.880
some strange contexts.

52:45.880 --> 52:51.060
An early example from season 3 is I Was a Teenage Spy, where Cory is shocked by a microwave

52:51.060 --> 52:53.380
and sent back to the 1950s.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.820
Do me a favor, would ya?

52:55.820 --> 52:56.820
Anything you want.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.820
Would ya look at me that way I don't like?

52:58.820 --> 53:02.380
I thought you said it scared you.

53:02.380 --> 53:04.380
It does.

53:04.380 --> 53:10.940
It was a cute episode that foreshadowed Cory and Topanga getting back together during their

53:10.940 --> 53:12.360
third season breakup.

53:12.360 --> 53:17.520
In season 4's Sixteen Candles and Four Hundred Pound Men, Cory and Sean offer advice to Frankie

53:17.520 --> 53:23.640
to better connect with his father, who happens to be WWF slash WWE wrestler Vader.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.600
And they end up at a wrestling match.

53:25.600 --> 53:30.400
And in Eric Hollywood, Eric is invited to join the cast of a sitcom called Kid Gets

53:30.400 --> 53:34.840
Acquainted with Universe, where he meets a fictionalized version of the cast of the

53:34.840 --> 53:55.600
show.

53:55.600 --> 53:59.600
But the most popular high-concept episode of the series, and maybe the most popular episode

53:59.600 --> 54:03.080
of the series, is season 5's And Then There Was Sean.

54:03.080 --> 54:06.860
Loosely inspired by the Scream movies, this episode sees everyone trapped in the school

54:06.860 --> 54:11.120
at night, with the murderer slowly picking them off, while Sean recounts various horror

54:11.120 --> 54:30.440
movie tropes.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.960
The episode isn't just unique in its premise, it's also shot to look more like a horror

54:34.960 --> 54:35.960
movie.

54:35.960 --> 54:39.520
With camera angles and movements you wouldn't usually see in a sitcom, it even had the gall

54:39.520 --> 54:49.160
to murder Mr. Feeney.

54:49.160 --> 54:52.840
The episode does a great job of playing with horror movie tropes and delivering some solid

54:52.840 --> 55:07.600
jokes.

55:07.600 --> 55:11.340
It also included a special guest appearance from Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was seen in

55:11.340 --> 55:13.960
I Know What You Did Last Summer a few months prior.

55:13.960 --> 55:18.440
The episode was notoriously difficult to film because the cast broke down laughing for hours

55:18.440 --> 55:22.280
at a time, but in spite of those difficulties, the finished product came together so well

55:22.280 --> 55:24.040
that it became a fan favorite.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.720
Part of the reason for Boy Meets World's success, and why the show is so often able

55:27.720 --> 55:31.720
to take these kinds of chances, was because of its below-the-radar status.

55:31.720 --> 55:35.560
Michael Jacobs was fairly protective of his show, and the network, rather than deal with

55:35.560 --> 55:39.320
lengthy conversations about what the show was doing, let him do as he pleased so long

55:39.320 --> 55:40.920
as the numbers were stable.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.540
Ryder Strong describes how that influenced the audience.

55:43.540 --> 55:47.240
When we stepped out of the box with an episode like this, it kind of felt like we were in

55:47.240 --> 55:50.480
our own little corner of the playground, and no one was paying attention.

55:50.480 --> 55:55.440
Which means, in a way, we were thumbing our nose at expanding our audience, and by definition,

55:55.440 --> 55:57.000
building a cult following.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.520
Even though, and then there was Sean was a bit of fun, it's still connected back to

56:00.520 --> 56:03.520
one of the main through lines of the series in an important way.

56:03.560 --> 56:07.200
By the end of the episode, the whole experience is revealed to be a bad dream of Sean's,

56:07.200 --> 56:10.600
though in the dream, the killer is revealed to be Sean himself.

56:10.600 --> 56:13.560
As for why he's killing his friends, it's revealed in this moment.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.400
Why are you doing this to us?

56:19.120 --> 56:23.040
Sean is tearing the world apart because he can't stand that Cory and Topanga have broken

56:23.040 --> 56:24.040
up again.

56:24.040 --> 56:28.080
Yes, broken up again, and that's as good a transition as any to give us a brief rundown

56:28.080 --> 56:32.280
of what the fated couple of Cory and Topanga were doing in seasons 4 and 5.

56:32.280 --> 56:35.440
At the end of season 3, our happy couple was still together, but they started facing

56:35.440 --> 56:38.520
more hardships, part of the way through season 4.

56:38.520 --> 56:43.080
In the two-parter, A Long Walk to Pittsburgh, Topanga is devastated to learn that her family

56:43.080 --> 56:47.400
is moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, putting her relationship with Cory in jeopardy.

56:47.400 --> 56:51.320
Okay, I don't care if I have to walk to Pittsburgh, nothing is going to come between us, alright?

56:51.320 --> 56:53.600
We're going to be together for the rest of our lives.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
Okay.

56:58.600 --> 56:59.600
So there.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.600
Cory's refusal to acknowledge the truth is tough to watch.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.520
We're leaving for Pittsburgh.

57:05.520 --> 57:10.360
No, you're not moving because we're supposed to be together like we've always talked about,

57:10.360 --> 57:12.320
so you can't move.

57:12.320 --> 57:14.280
Because we don't deserve that kind of pain.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.400
Cory, will you just give me a hug and a kiss and say goodbye to me?

57:17.400 --> 57:18.400
No.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
Goodbye, Cory.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.400
I love you.

57:32.560 --> 57:36.800
As the weeks drag on and Cory's loved ones try to help him move on, he gets increasingly

57:36.800 --> 57:40.240
frustrated not hearing from Topanga, and he's about ready to give up.

57:40.240 --> 57:44.240
I'm sure you'll be real happy to know that I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh, okay?

57:44.880 --> 57:45.880
Why not?

57:45.880 --> 57:46.880
You and Topanga have a fight?

57:46.880 --> 57:47.880
No, no fight.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.400
I just realized that I'm the one making all the phone calls, I'm the one writing all

57:50.400 --> 57:54.560
the letters, but I will not be the one who travels 300 miles to be rejected and look

57:54.560 --> 57:55.560
like a fool.

57:55.560 --> 57:59.240
So if life doesn't want me and Topanga together, then you can't fight life, can you?

58:01.240 --> 58:02.240
Cory.

58:03.240 --> 58:04.240
Amy.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.880
This might be my favorite moment in the whole series.

58:06.880 --> 58:10.600
Part of it is the reaction from the audience, and part of it is seeing how passionate young

58:10.600 --> 58:11.600
love can be.

58:11.600 --> 58:15.560
Topanga has run away from home, and even though Cory's parents aren't thrilled,

58:15.560 --> 58:19.640
he offers his own definition of loved in an effort to keep them together.

58:19.640 --> 58:27.080
When I'm better because she's here, now she won't be.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.560
In other shows, this wouldn't be working.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.640
It's so sweet, it's practically dripping honey.

58:32.640 --> 58:36.880
But somehow Boy Meets World manages to walk this line without falling on its face.

58:36.880 --> 58:40.520
It does require the audience to be willing to believe in Cory and Topanga, believe in

58:40.520 --> 58:44.880
the idea of young love being something special that can last the test of time.

58:44.880 --> 58:48.720
This feeling is only underscored when Topanga's aunt Prudence arrives, as she is played by

58:48.720 --> 58:54.600
Olivia Hussie, who famously played Juliette, in 1968, Franco Ziffirelli's film adaptation

58:54.600 --> 58:55.800
of Romeo and Juliette.

58:55.800 --> 58:59.840
It's Topanga's aunt who offers her a place to stay in Philadelphia so she can spend

58:59.840 --> 59:03.720
her last year of high school in the place she's familiar with, among her friends,

59:03.720 --> 59:06.140
and most importantly, with Cory.

59:06.140 --> 59:09.320
This might have been the best episode for the Cory and Topanga relationship, even though

59:09.320 --> 59:14.040
it's complete fantasy, unbearably sentimental, and still somehow works.

59:14.040 --> 59:18.000
It's the comfort you don't get with the more cynical TV that was popularized in later

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
years.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.480
Maybe this is why it's such a strong symbol of youth and nostalgia, when we believe true

59:22.480 --> 59:26.480
life could happen at 16, and nothing was more important than being with the person you cared

59:26.480 --> 59:27.880
the most about.

59:27.880 --> 59:32.080
Cory and Topanga are see-sawing between fantasy and reality, and after a bit of fantasy in

59:32.080 --> 59:35.960
season 4, it would swing back to reality in season 5.

59:35.960 --> 59:41.200
In Heartbreak Cory, the senior class goes on a ski trip to Mount Sun Lodge, where Cory

59:41.200 --> 59:45.040
sprains his ankle getting off the bus, leaving him at the lodge while everyone else goes

59:45.040 --> 59:46.040
skiing.

59:46.040 --> 59:57.040
Keeping him company is Lauren, played by Linda Cardellini, an employee at the lodge.

59:57.040 --> 59:59.960
Cory ends up talking with Lauren throughout the night, and on the next day lies about

59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.160
his ankle still being sore, so he's once again trapped at the lodge.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160
With Lauren.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:20.240
I wasn't expecting you, but sometimes people take you by surprise.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.360
Cory tells the truth to Topanga about having spent the night talking to Lauren, but he

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.520
leaves out the part about the kiss.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.840
Cory says goodbye to Lauren, though she leaves him with a letter, which Topanga finds at

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.120
the end of the episode.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.720
Topanga confronts Cory about the letter in the next episode, and in the episode after

01:00:35.720 --> 01:01:01.560
that one, torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool, Lauren shows up in Philadelphia.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.000
Topanga tells Cory that if he isn't 100% sure about the two of them, he should spend

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.320
some time with Lauren.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.120
So he does, and he spends the day talking to Lauren.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.320
Later on, Cory makes his decision.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.600
I like Lauren.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.280
I like spending time with her.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.840
But I can live without her.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:30.560
I can't live without Topanga.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.320
It's no contest.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.000
And then he talks to Topanga about the experience.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.760
Cory, I can't see you anymore.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.760
What?

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:46.280
Do you have any idea how many guys sit on me?

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:52.200
What are you talking about?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.840
I never needed to test my feelings for you.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.680
I moved away from my parents in Pittsburgh to be close to you, but that you needed to

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.000
see her to test how you felt about me.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.280
I don't forgive you for that, Cory.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280
No.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.280
No.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280
You told me to see her, Topanga.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:18.840
You told me to see how I felt.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:26.640
And you listened.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:41.600
It's going to be okay.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.360
No, I won't.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.360
What made this breakup so powerful was that it was a slow build over three episodes.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.840
A couple like Cory and Topanga can't end things with a single fight.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.860
It took time, and a series of bad choices, and when it ends, it feels like a real ending.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.840
This is the episode that proceeded, and then there was Sean.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.520
Episodes like these are in stark contrast to the more idyllic ones where Topanga goes

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.160
to Cory in the rain, or the heartfelt moment in Topanga's room.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.240
It's a reminder that even supposedly perfect relationships are a lot of work, and that

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.000
it's better to be honest than hide something from your partner.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.040
It'll also reflect how the series has changed the lessons it was teaching, moving from stories

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.800
about fitting into the wider world to how people fit into each other's lives.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.480
And the lessons are getting more complex and messy.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.520
That's why the stories have drifted away from the nice, tidy lessons learned at the

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.600
close of each episode to lingering doubts and confusion.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.580
It reflects how some parts of the world aren't so easily learned from a speech delivered

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.080
by Mr. Feeney.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.560
But the Cory and Topanga story didn't end here.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.880
In Story Night, Topanga meets a guy named Ricky, played by Jonathan Jackson, and is

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.440
taken by his deep love of art.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.400
Unsure of whether or not she's ready to move on, she tries taking Cory to see Van Gogh's

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400
story night to get his impression of the piece.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:38.840
Topanga isn't satisfied with Cory's answer.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:05:03.080
Topanga decides to go out with Ricky, and when they kiss, she learns something.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:32.200
And

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:51.160
all that's left is for them to get back together.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.840
With Cory and Topanga reconciled, the rest of the season will supposedly play out just

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.080
fine until they're faced with one more challenge.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.160
When things change, Topanga's offers a spot at Yale, which dashed the plans she's made

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:18.400
with Cory to attend Penbrook University together.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.440
Cory tells Topanga she should take the chance to go to Yale.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.100
And in the season 5 finale, Graduation, Cory and his friends prepare to end their high

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:49.340
school lives, and we get a cute cameo for Minkus.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:07:10.140
More importantly, though, we find out what Topanga's decision is regarding Yale.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:23.740
As far as sitcom cliffhangers go, the unanswered proposal is a classic.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.460
And had this couple not just been put through the wringer for the last 10 episodes, it might

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.260
have felt like it was coming out of nowhere.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.820
But in this case, it felt entirely natural.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.820
Part of that reason is because Cory and Topanga's relationship has always been too idyllic,

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.780
so said in a romantic fantasy that it was hard to take seriously.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.940
But in seasons 4 and 5, it started to feel more real.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.580
The challenges were more difficult, and the answers were less obvious or certain.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.820
These were the seasons that pulled that relationship into the real world, to test its ability to

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.820
survive.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.560
And after going through some tough trials, it proved that it was the real thing.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.260
But this is a relationship built on an amorphous past, one that seemed destined.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.060
But the only reason it was destined is because of the traditional sentimentality that went

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.060
into making the show.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:08.300
Boy Meets World is a very earnest series, not shined away from sensitive issues or social

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.300
commentary.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.380
But at its heart, it's still a very traditional family sitcom.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.340
It has one foot in the present and another in the past.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:19.580
The show itself manifests this in the dynamic between Mr. Feeny and Mr. Turner in season

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.580
2.

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:24.700
This show is about how children become adults, and the forces of constancy and change that

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.780
shape them.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.260
And in this maelstrom of forces, Cory and Topanga make it through, with their romanticized

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:35.180
version of love staying intact, now hardened by the harsh winds of reality.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.260
And ultimately, this might be the perfect symbol as to why this show became such a

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.660
comforting favorite.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.900
Because it tells you that through all the noise and fury, so long as you really work

01:08:42.900 --> 01:09:02.500
at it, everything is going to be okay.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.660
To then keep everyone hanging, let's make one thing perfectly clear.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:27.580
Here is Cory's answer to Topanga's proposal.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.980
That's a yes, by the way.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.580
While I tease a quick wedding afterwards, ultimately Cory and Topanga decide to have

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.420
a long engagement instead.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.500
There are plenty of other changes in store for the cast in these final two seasons, aside

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.460
from the impending nuptials.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:47.180
Most obviously, we see Cory, Topanga, Sean, and Angela all heading off to Penbrook University.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:51.740
Cory and Sean become roommates in their dorm while Topanga and Angela do the same in their

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.740
dorm.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.460
And this might be a good time to look at some of the other characters that are joining at

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.460
Penbrook.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.460
In the last five seasons, Eric Matthews has gone through a bit of a transformation.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.980
In earlier seasons, he was the cool order brother who always had a new date every week,

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:09.500
but as the seasons progressed, that changed as the character became increasingly more

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500
silly.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:14.380
According to Will Friedle, the first sign of this was in the first season, when he got

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.100
the chance to be in a scene with William Daniels.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:35.420
And he had to think of a funny way of throwing down a bag of fertilizer.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.900
The lesson learned was to always go big in comedy, and over the years we would see Eric

01:10:39.900 --> 01:11:08.100
going further and further over the top.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.780
One fan theory as to why this is happening is because the series is told through the

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:16.260
eyes of Cory, and part of growing up is seeing your cool, hip, older brother for the goofball

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.500
he really is.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.220
And while I would never rob someone of their interpretation, according to Friedle, behind

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:25.500
the scenes it was about the writers and Will Friedle challenging each other to get increasingly

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.900
ridiculous with the character, making him more akin to Friedle in real life, albeit

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.140
amped up some.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:35.380
So in the final seasons, he would be completely off the wall, like coughing out winning lottery

01:11:35.380 --> 01:12:03.620
numbers or disguising himself as a couch, but Eric not always being a perfect fit in

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.260
the Cory, Shawn, Topanga, and eventually Angela dynamic.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:11.700
Eric was given his own supporting cast, first with the arrival of Shawn's brother Jack,

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.580
who became Eric's roommate, along with Shawn, and then in season 6, when Shawn moved out,

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:20.980
a new roommate replaced him, Rachel McGuire, played by Maitland Ward.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.220
Michael Jacobs explains this evolution.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.660
We knew that Eric was succeeding beautifully as a character, but we also knew that Eric

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.320
only involved with Shawn and Cory seemed odd.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.420
We knew that what Eric really needed was something to play off of, and Matthew Lawrence was available

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.860
and it was a no-brainer to me.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.420
And we put them together and then decided to add Maitland Ward, and all of a sudden

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.340
we had these wonderful secondary stories.

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.580
The typical dynamic here was Eric and Jack fighting over the beautiful Rachel, though

01:12:45.580 --> 01:13:01.780
ultimately it was Jack who got the upper hand because it was funnier to see Eric fail.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.760
Many of the beeplaws were basic stories and thinly-veiled excuses to give Will Friedel

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.560
something funny to do on camera.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.380
Occasionally we would see Eric in some more mysterious stories, such as when he nearly

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.980
adopted a young boy named Tommy he was mentoring.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.920
But generally speaking, Eric's stories were fun college adventures.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.080
What Eric best represents, though, is the persistence of friendship.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.540
Although his friendships with Jack and Rachel aren't as pronounced as, say, the Cory and

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:29.640
Shawn friendship, Eric is unusually talented when it comes to understanding people and

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640
friendships.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.400
As a 7-2 parter, the first episode titled The War, we see the bonds of this group tested

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.340
during a series of increasingly harsh pranks – Jack, Rachel, and Angela make up one team

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:43.360
with Cory, Shawn, and Topanga on the other team.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.920
Eric is left out because no one wants him on their team.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.720
Eventually, things get taken too far when Cory and Shawn put up a revealing picture

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.000
of Rachel in the Student Union.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:14.320
The prank war turns into a fight, and Cory makes an unfortunate comment.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:37.280
And things ripple out from there.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:50.000
Eric tries to make peace between everyone, and then finds out the truth.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.620
In the second part, titled Seven the Hard Way, Eric puts aside his bruised ego to work

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.820
with Mr. Feeny to try and mend these broken friendships.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:45.900
Even the closest to friends, Cory and Shawn, might not be able to hold it together.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:16:02.140
The episode flashes forward seven years to Mr. Feeny's retirement party to reveal that

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:29.100
this fight shattered the group.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:48.900
And then Eric arrives.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:17:07.260
And Plays with Squirrels has some words of wisdom.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.020
When the episode goes back to the present day, it moves to a few moments after Rachel

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:36.300
is left, and Eric drags her back to read those same words of wisdom.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.900
And it inspires everyone to reconcile.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.140
Although Eric can never escape being the goofball, he holds together people much in

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.620
the same way he holds together the series itself.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.420
If Boy Meets World was a series of tragedies, the characters would likely not be able to

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:52.140
keep their connection to one another, and the series itself could never maintain its

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.300
premise as a family-friendly sitcom.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:58.060
Eric is the glue for all of these things, providing consistent comedic relief, and also

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.420
providing the wisdom needed to hold these characters together in the context of the

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.420
show.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.900
For all the troubles that visit these characters, Eric is the Oasis in the Desert, a place to

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.660
enjoy a break from the heat, and he's an oasis for characters and audiences alike.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.460
And in that calm, a simple truth can come from an unexpected place.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:19.760
A character like Eric is particularly necessary when Boy Meets World gets heavy, and the heaviest

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.040
season was, almost certainly, season 6.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.280
When Sean and Jack's father Chet returns in the episode, We'll Have a Good Time Then,

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.640
he announces that this time, he's staying for good.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.200
From now on, there'll be lots and lots of time for us to play in pool.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.000
So you're really staying for good?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
That's the plan, son.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.640
Sean is skeptical that Chet is going to be a run for the long haul, and in many ways

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.960
sees himself in Chet's lack of commitment.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.040
Chet doesn't get the chance to prove himself, though, as he soon has a heart attack.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.720
Sean and Jack don't handle it particularly well.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:43.200
Sean and Chet do get a moment to reconcile, though.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:20:02.040
But sadly, it's a little too late to make things right, as Chet has a second heart attack

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:09.200
and passes away.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.780
Nothing is really resolved in this episode, and in some ways that might be an incredibly

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:17.460
realistic depiction of death, it doesn't solve problems or end a chapter.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.300
Even if people reconcile, there's no time to enjoy that peace.

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:24.900
It's a sudden departure that comes too soon, no matter how late it may be.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:38.820
Feeling lost, Sean once again takes off on a journey to discover himself.

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:42.760
What eventually brings Sean back two episodes later is the need to comfort his friend Corey

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.960
during a difficult time.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.240
Before we begin, a quick content warning for anyone with a challenging pregnancy or infancy,

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.360
you can skip ahead to the timestamp below.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.640
Amy Matthews revealed she was pregnant at the end of season 5, and in season 6, that

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.200
pregnancy was coming to an early end.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:18.040
The baby was delivered early and is left in critical condition.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.840
The next episode pulls no punches with several trips to the infant intensive care unit, and

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.080
it doesn't just highlight the struggle of the young Matthews baby.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.880
Someone speaks to and gets to know the other parents who are going through the same thing,

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:50.440
including an uncredited cameo by series creator Michael Jacobs.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.560
What I appreciate in this scene is how it acknowledges that many parents struggle with

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.040
this reality every day.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.640
It isn't just a thing that the Matthews family come across one day to be conveniently

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.040
forgotten about when the show moves on.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.440
The presence of the other families also carries with them in the awful suggestion that not

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.000
all babies can make it.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.880
This is particularly clear in the revelation that, at least in this case, Joshua Matthews

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:37.280
is going to make it.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.400
For all the difficulties the characters face in Boy Meets World, this one was probably

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.720
the most grueling and difficult to watch.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:53.040
And it makes moments of levity even more of a relief.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.300
What these heavy episodes also reveal is the greater dynamic for the series and its approach

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.760
to teaching its young audience about the world.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.840
It began with familiar, well-known things that were taught to the kids, moved on to

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.400
things that were mysterious and a little uncertain, and then began moving towards the unexpected

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400
unknown.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.360
And it's a subject people never see coming, like the sudden early death of a parent or

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.920
a child being born in critical condition.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.440
The stakes continuously go up in the series, revealing that the world is an increasingly

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.080
challenging place, and it can throw anything at you and you'll have to learn how to deal

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.520
with it, and hopefully learn from the experience.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.600
The learning area isn't the safe space of the classroom anymore.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.640
Although Boy Meets World had gotten incredibly heavy in these later seasons, it wasn't just

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.680
a series of unending traumas.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.360
One bright spot was the impending marriage of Kori and Topanga, albeit with a few more

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.640
bumps along the way.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.960
By the end of the perpetually-heavy season 6, we got to see the blossoming relationship

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.720
between Mr. Feeny and Dean Bolander.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.560
Mr. Feeny having gone from fellow student at Penbrook University to one of the professors.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.720
Because of course, Kori and his friends need Mr. Feeny to teach them through every year

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720
of their education.

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:02.280
Dean Bolander was also played by William Daniels' real-life wife, Bonnie Bartlett.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.040
Ahead of their marriage, Topanga finds out her parents are getting divorced, leading

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.560
Topanga devout her own engagement.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.880
Season 7 opens with a two-parter where Kori tries to repair the relationship between

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.480
Topanga's parents, only to realize that sometimes love does die.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.840
And while once again it may seem like this relationship is over, Kori and Topanga manage

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.360
to reconcile, when Topanga's mother tells her that even with the tragic end, love is

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.560
still worth it.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.920
What can I do to make it up to you?

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.760
You could move your knee.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760
Sorry.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:33.560
Whatever life takes us, I want it to be with you.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.560
Forever.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.560
Of all the breakups Kori and Topanga went through, this one was perhaps the least believable.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.760
Largely because they had already called things quits three times before, and the appearance

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.660
of Lauren was a far more convincing threat than Topanga losing faith in love.

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:49.360
With their relationship so obviously solid, a wedding was the only place this story could

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360
go.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.240
And go there it did, albeit with some resistance from the network.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.080
Michael Jacobs tells the story of how he convinced the network to let this happen.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.840
The head of ABC, when I told them we were going to marry them at 19, said it was a very

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.040
irresponsible thing to do and that the audience didn't want it.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.460
And I said to him, listen, you have this thing called abc.com.

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.460
It was brand new.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.680
Why don't you run a graphic and find out how many people are waiting for Kori and Topanga

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.680
to marry?

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.240
And so he said, it's ridiculous, we'll get maybe 20,000 hits and that's it.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.900
And who can tell anything from that?

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.480
And I said, why don't we try it?

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.380
And in the first seven minutes, they got about 280,000 hits and then the thing broke.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:29.840
And out of the 280,000 hits, 280,000 people said, what do you think we're waiting for?

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.720
I got a call from the president of the network the next day who said, could you please marry

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.180
them in sweeps?

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.440
The week before the wedding, there was a cute tie-in during the credits for that week's

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.440
episode.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.080
Kori and Topanga spoke about a website set up to celebrate their upcoming nuptials.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.440
There's something very charming about how simple and quaint a website like this is.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.200
And finally, in an episode titled, It's About Time, we see Kori and Topanga married.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.320
Even though it's Kori and Topanga's wedding, the episode is actually about another important

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.760
relationship, Kori and Sean.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.800
As far as you and me go, today is the last day that we're ever going to be Kori and Sean.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.360
You know, Sean and Kori?

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.760
The fight runs into the wedding.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.640
We have to talk about it.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.560
I don't want to.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.200
We have to.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.280
Now?

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.960
Kori, after you get married, things are going to be different.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:31.840
And I don't have a lot of friends, you know?

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.840
Do you really like her?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:40.400
Yeah, I really do.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.240
You sure?

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.080
John, I really think I've been very tolerant here.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.760
Kori and Sean talk it out, and the wedding moves forward.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.040
It's very strange that this wedding episode is about the guys.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.960
It also highlights how important this friendship is to Kori, and how a marriage would change

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960
that dynamic.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.000
They're still best friends, but it's not quite the same anymore.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.800
The Kori and Sean friendship can't really be understated, though it relies perhaps on

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:09.960
a few too many gay jokes about them, clearly written before the writers knew what the internet

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.720
did with that kind of bait.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.480
It's still nice to see a male relationship that's not just about broing down and watching

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.880
the game together.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.240
Kori and Sean support each other emotionally through some of the toughest parts of their

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.920
lives, and anyone would be lucky to have a friend like either one of them.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.680
And it's a simple yet true lesson.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.800
If you find a good friend who will stick with you during those tough times, hold on

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.360
to them as best you can.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.640
It's one of the bittersweet moments of a wedding, knowing that this is the end of one

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.400
era and the beginning of another.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.200
The series could have easily ended on this note, but it kept moving forward into a wider

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.480
unknown, the life of a married couple.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.840
In The Honeymoon is Over, Kori and Topanga struggle to find housing.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.520
They realize they don't have a place to live, with Topanga's apartment and Kori's

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.160
dorm conveniently occupied.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.000
They go to Alan and Amy for help.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Amy?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.800
They can't stay here.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.920
They're married now.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.760
It's Kori and Topanga, not Kori and us.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760
Remember?

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760
Ma?

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.600
You can't stay here, Kori.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.560
It seems pretty harsh for Kori's parents not to offer any kind of assistance here,

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.400
even a roof over their heads for a few days, especially when the alternative is for Kori

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.360
and Topanga to live in the dorm for married couples, which looks like this.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.920
Why a university dorm is in shambles, I'm not entirely sure, but it clearly doesn't

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:28.320
matter for us, so Kori goes back to his father to once again ask for help.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.880
You decided that you were old enough to get married.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.080
You decided to take on the responsibility of a new life because you believed you could

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.520
handle it.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:46.480
And this family supported that decision after we told you that it was going to be very difficult.

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.680
What did you think we were kidding?

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.120
I had many thoughts while watching this episode, but it would be unfair to discuss without

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.080
quickly running down the next one – picket fences.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.360
The method to Alan's madness is explained in a later scene where Sean thinks the place

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:13.880
is nice, just in need of some work to fix it up a bit.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.480
When Kori makes an effort to fix things up, he and Topanga gradually start to think they

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.200
can turn this rundown apartment into a home.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.520
And a lesson is learned.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.720
Topanga and I are going to pay in our place, we're going to put up a bookshelf, and

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.320
someday when we can afford it, we are going to buy that house with a nook without your

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320
help.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.400
Now, what do you have to say to that?

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.920
I'd say you finally figured it out.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.880
Welcome to being an adult.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.760
When your mother and I got married, we had nothing.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.280
Nobody would help us, we did fine.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.840
We didn't know it then, but it was the sweetest time in our lives.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.780
We bonded together forever.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:56.120
We felt completely in love because we knew we made a life for ourselves with nobody's

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.800
help but our own.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.640
I would never take that away from you, son.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.440
These two episodes are ridiculous.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.120
In the first one, we find out what was fairly obvious throughout the series' run.

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.040
Kori and Topanga are upper middle class.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.680
We're upper middle class, homeless college students.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.680
And this lesson makes it abundantly clear.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.800
The idea that suffering together through poverty is some kind of bonding ritual is

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.520
unbelievably privileged.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.240
I want to look at how these episodes don't actually work.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:29.080
The first question we should be asking is, who's paying for this dorm?

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.360
And who was paying for their previous dorm?

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.200
Neither Kory nor Topanga seem to have jobs, though they would in a few episodes.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:39.080
They're also attending universities, something I imagine they aren't paying for with whatever

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080
savings they have.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.720
So it sounds like their parents are still taking care of at least some of those expenses.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:47.840
For this story to be true to the message it's trying to present, Kori and Topanga

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.080
would be moving to their own place and having to get jobs to pay for everything, including

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.160
school, while attending.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:58.520
This is a very hefty burden to put on someone, and expecting them to fix up their rundown

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.080
apartment on top of that.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:04.640
How is this episode not about the absurd financial demands of obtaining a higher education, or

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.720
even just surviving in the modern world when you reach 20?

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.660
Clearly this real world experience isn't entirely real.

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:16.340
It seems more like a game for an upper-middle-class family to play at what it means to be poor,

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.580
and this little exercise is supposed to build character.

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:23.980
Except, there are people who live just the way Kory and Topanga would have to, working

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:28.380
and going to school while trying to keep a crummy apartment from collapsing in on itself.

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.880
And not because their parents want to teach them a lesson, it's because it's simply

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.900
a fact of their life, they don't have the means of affording anything better.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:39.820
The biggest failure of this episode is to only fleetingly acknowledge that there are

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.360
people in situations such as Kory and Topanga.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:46.540
Their neighbors are in rough spots, and they're at least depicted with some sensitivity, but

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.060
we don't get much acknowledgement from Kory and Topanga of how there seems to be something

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.660
wrong in a world where people are forced to live in rough conditions, because society

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:58.000
has made education a commodity easily purchased by the wealthy, and only attainable through

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.060
back-breaking effort for the poor.

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.020
If Allen and Amy's Grand Lesson had been instead to teach their kids about the injustice

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.800
in the world they had been sheltering them from, they would have made more sense.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.240
It would still be harsh, of course, but it would be wisdom worth having.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:16.080
The bonding exercise excuse seems like, at best, a rationalization, and the better lesson

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.960
learned from this episode is the unspoken one.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:22.600
The seventh season was halfway through at this point, and while we'd see more of Kory

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.040
and Topanga's married life, including their first fight, there is another couple that

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.920
should be visited instead.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:32.520
Angela and Sean's relationship is, much like Kory and Topanga's, a turbulent one.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.040
Although unlike Kory and Topanga, their time apart is much longer.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:40.560
At the beginning of season six, Angela and Sean break up, and manage to stay broken up

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.920
for the rest of the season, in spite of the fact that they clearly still have feelings

01:32:43.920 --> 01:33:04.880
for one another, and in spite of the efforts of Kory and Topanga to get them back together.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.680
The relationship between Sean and Angela is in direct contrast to Kory and Topanga.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:20.040
Even Sean himself notices that.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.000
Kory and Topanga are nice enough to point out that their romance is abnormal, but it's

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.280
clearly affected how Sean views relationships.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:30.480
In a way, this puts the audience in Sean's shoes, seeing this ideal couple in Kory and

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.260
Topanga and wanting to live that themselves, but coming up short.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.620
It isn't until season seven that Sean and Angela reconcile, bonding over having both

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:42.020
been abandoned by their parents, and the fear of growing up to be just like them, running

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:58.180
out on someone.

01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:02.240
The relationship offers a nice lesson that it would only succeed if Angela and Sean were

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:06.100
able to relate to one another directly, and not trying to live up to the expectations

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.000
or example of their friends.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.080
The relationship is also notable for being a very rare interracial pairing on 90s television.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.500
Although the topic is never addressed in the show directly, and Angela's race is rarely

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.720
mentioned at all, it was a deliberate choice by the show's creators.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.460
During an interview, Ryder Strong described the casting for Angela as exclusively looking

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.860
for Black or Latina actresses.

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.460
The pairing was meant to be the colorblind ideal where the race of the two characters

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.260
was entirely arbitrary.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:36.140
This was something that Trina McGee appreciated, so much so that she wrote an op-ed in the

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:40.620
Los Angeles Times describing how she thought the relationship provided a positive example.

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.220
Here is an excerpt from that op-ed.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.420
I get lots of positive reactions from both Black and white teenagers wanting to know

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.680
when Sean and I are getting back together.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.740
The Black kids are not asking, why are you with that white boy?

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.620
When I intended the NAACP Image Awards, a Black girl lamented to me that Sean and Angela

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.840
are a perfect couple and should be back together.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:03.080
The next day, a white girl in a mall begged to know if Sean and Angela are still in love.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.280
One was nine, one pre-teen.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.480
They are the new face of tolerance.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.160
These kids are not looking at race, they're absorbing the love story.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.800
To this day, Trina McGee still talks fondly about her experience on the show and how she

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.120
didn't really face many negative responses.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.560
I think it's important to acknowledge that her op-ed was in response to outcry over a

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:25.520
scene in the series Allie McBeal where Callista Flockhart and Jesse L. Martin exchange a kiss

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.200
and that the series never broaches the topic of race.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.000
A criticism never directed at Boy Meets World.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.680
Part of that might be because the profile of Allie McBeal was higher, but it also may

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:38.200
be that Boy Meets World's younger audience wasn't expected to deal with a topic such

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.320
as race, and the fact that they weren't bothered by Angela and Sean, at least in Trina

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.680
McGee's experience, speaks to the fact of how racism is a learned behavior, that kids

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.000
aren't really born with this prejudice in their mind, but learn it through the examples

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
around them.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.040
And from that perspective, Angela and Sean offer a positive example of an interracial

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.360
relationship.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.000
But does that represent reality, a reality that a younger audience needs to learn about?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.540
Those are big questions I'm not sure this video can really tackle, aside from acknowledging

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.480
that interracial relationships have faced a lot of social pressure and continue to do

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.480
so today.

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.840
I don't think a show is weaker for not reflecting reality though, it's just taking a different

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.480
approach to tackle the same problem.

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.400
I can't cover every single topic that comes up in one of these shows, so thankfully I

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.000
have a little help this time.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.240
Hey, T1J here.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:29.000
Just like Jose, I'm a huge fan of sitcoms, and I have a lot of nostalgic fondness for

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.680
Boy Meets World in particular.

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.240
So I actually also made a video about the show, except my video is focused around the

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:43.400
roller coaster relationship between Sean and Angela, which is maybe my favorite sitcom

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.160
couple story of all time, for various reasons, which you'll have to watch my video to learn.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.760
Come check it out when you're done with Jose's video.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.080
Sadly for Sean and Angela, the reunion only lasted until the end of season 7, as a few

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.960
episodes before the finale, we see Angela leave for Europe to spend some time reconnecting

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:13.520
with her father.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.080
The episode also revealed another departure might be happening soon, with Tepanga getting

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:29.720
an offer from NYU.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.840
And that brings us to the two-part series finale, Brave New World.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.440
There isn't too much in the way of plot, as these episodes offer more a chance for

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.640
the characters to reflect on how their lives have brought them to this point, complete

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.760
with a number of clips from throughout the show's seven seasons.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.700
Tepanga briefly considers not going to New York, but instead is convinced to go after

01:37:48.700 --> 01:38:08.680
some words of wisdom from Mr. Feeney and some encouragement from Corey.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:19.800
Eric decides to go along with Corey and Tepanga to New York City.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.160
Sean and Corey are in the midst of saying goodbye, when Tepanga reveals, Sean is apparently

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:43.680
going with them too.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.480
Jack and Rachel decide to go in the Peace Corps together, with Jack giving up his stepfather's

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:59.240
money.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.320
And Corey has a moment with his new brother Joshua, who seems to have aged pretty quickly

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:29.560
in the last season.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.840
And everyone says goodbye.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:14.160
And the final line of the series is…

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.940
The series ends hitting the themes that ran through it, that those formative years are

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.320
called that for a reason, and those early relationships you forge can sit with you for

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.320
a lifetime.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.280
Childhood isn't something to be frivolously forgotten as you age, but something to be

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.480
cherished and remembered as you grow older.

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.840
It's when the world begins to imprint itself on you, shaping your beliefs and relationships

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.640
for the rest of your life.

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.420
In an interview Michael Jacobs described it, what I think launched a sustained run for

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:45.760
Boy was an incredible evolution of what you knew, thought you know, to what you never

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.200
really knew at all.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.920
And this final episode highlights that journey, from the world of the first season where the

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.080
lessons and stories are simple, to the more turbulent high school seasons where the world

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.000
of the characters is turned upside down, and then finally in the college years, it's

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.880
a whole new space where you realize how much more of the world there is to know.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.360
The overarching story does reveal that this sitcom is coming from a very specific perspective,

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.920
one of the comfortable life of an upper middle class family.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.760
Corey's life is challenging, but it doesn't feature hardships that outskied the scope

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.960
of a typical journey to adolescence.

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.680
That might be why the series doesn't feel dated, since the only troubles it tackles

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.480
are the ones kids have been facing for a long time and will continue to face into the future.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.960
This show is ultimately about finding a place in the world, changing it where you can, but

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:31.560
still trusting that it is a place for you.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.620
But the story of the Matthews family wasn't over here.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.120
We get a glimpse of Corey and Topanga in New York, 14 years later, in a Boy Meets World

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.320
spinoff.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.760
After Boy Meets World went off the air, it moved into syndication, and while most shows

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:50.400
have a few years there before fading away, something strange happened.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.300
Boy Meets World did very well on the Disney Channel.

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:57.000
So well that the show's profile actually went up, with its old audience returning to

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.040
it and a new audience discovering it for the first time.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.480
The growing popularity led to the possibility of a reboot, and after much urging from Disney,

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:09.240
Michael Jacobs would return to these characters in 2014 with Girl Meets World.

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.680
Starring Rowan Blanchard as Riley Matthews, Corey and Topanga's daughter, and Sabrina

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.840
Carpenter, her best friend Maya Hart, the series is set in New York City and tells the

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.640
story of a girl meeting the world.

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:23.360
Only the Mr. Feeny role this time is played by Corey Matthews.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.080
In addition to telling the stories of Riley and Maya, and their group of friends, the

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.440
series also featured a number of cameos of Boy Meets World favorites, tying up several

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.120
loose ends and offering a few moments of closure.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.380
Although the series stands well enough on its own, it's definitely enhanced by having

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.000
watched Boy Meets World.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.120
Episode 16 in the first season, Girl Meets Home for the Holidays, is a particularly great

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:52.280
episode as it features the return of Sean Hunter.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.360
What makes this episode work so well is how it builds on the original series, with Wayward

01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:00.600
Sean constantly looking for a home and integrates him into the story of Maya who's struggling

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.760
to find a place for herself, and it speaks to the show's theme of how people change

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:09.520
people, how Corey changed Sean, Riley changed Maya, and how Sean and Maya can change one

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.520
another.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:15.000
It ran for three seasons on the Disney Channel, totaling 72 episodes, before being canceled

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.360
in 2017.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.000
The cancellation of the series was a bit surprising as its ratings had only slightly dipped over

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.040
three seasons, and Michael Jacobs had fought to keep the show on the air, whether at Disney

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.420
or somewhere else.

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.720
But it had a solid send-off, and while it might not have been as consistent as Boy Meets

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:37.640
World, Girl Meets World's highest points might have been a few notches higher.

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.040
After finishing Boy Meets World, Ben Savage would go to Stanford, where he majored in

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.360
political science.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.840
After completing his education, he returned to the world of entertainment, acting and

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.760
directing, and a number of different projects.

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.880
He's also been cast to play younger versions of Mandy Patinkin on two different shows,

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.040
which I think is a fun fact.

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.120
Ryder Strong also took some time off from acting after Boy Meets World to attend Columbia

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.920
University, though he did take a semester off to appear on the movie Cabin Fever.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.920
More recently, he's done less acting as he's instead chosen to focus on writing and directing.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:11.400
Daniel Fischl went on to appear in a number of movies and worked as a TV presenter following

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.680
the end of Boy Meets World.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.280
Eventually, she decided to go back to school attending California State University Fullerton,

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.160
attaining a degree in psychology.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.800
More recently, she has been working as a director.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.680
Will Friedle landed another major role while working on Boy Meets World, becoming the voice

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.920
of Terry McGinnis in the animated series Batman Beyond.

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.520
In a strange coincidence, that series finished its last recording on the same day that Boy

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.360
Meets World wrapped filming.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.440
Since then though, Friedle has become a prolific voice actor, appearing in numerous series

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.200
from Kim Possible to a slew of other TV shows and video games.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.560
In his personal life, he's also learned to manage anxiety issues that affected him

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.560
during and after the end of Boy Meets World, and happily he now seems to be in a much better

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.080
place in his life.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.960
Betsy Randall took some time off from acting a few years after the end of Boy Meets World,

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.520
but she has been working continuously since returning in 2014.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.400
She's most recently appeared in the movie Painter, and in 2013, she celebrated the

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.360
birth of her first grandchild.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.840
William Russ has been acting consistently since the end of Boy Meets World, appearing

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.920
in countless TV shows and movies.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.680
Most notably he appeared in Deadwood as Otis Russell.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.400
He also has the unique distinction of being the only actor to direct episodes of Boy Meets

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.480
World and Girl Meets World.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.880
Trina McGee continued to act following the end of Boy Meets World, appearing in movies

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:28.640
and television, including movies Friday after Next, and the excellently titled movie Da

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.240
Booty Shop.

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.400
Just recently she wrote and directed the film Detainment.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.160
Matthew Lawrence continued to act in movies and television after finishing up on Boy Meets

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.160
World.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.560
He's done less acting over the years, but he has continued singing on occasion, having

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.320
been a singer since his childhood.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:48.720
He recently performed in the 2021 movie Mistletoe Mix-Up, singing alongside his brothers Joey

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.320
and Andrew.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.080
After Boy Meets World, Maitland Ward continued to act for a few years, notably appearing

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.760
in the movie White Chicks.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.200
Over the years she has moved away from the mainstream acting world and in 2019, she began

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.680
working in adult films.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.360
She seems to be quite happy in her new field and is enjoying exploring this new career

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.480
path.

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.600
Even after such a long and prolific career, William Daniels continued to act in a number

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.800
of roles following the end of Boy Meets World, including a recent reprisal as the card Kit

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.840
from Knight Rider in the 2020 movie Super Intelligence.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.480
Daniels has become more selective with his projects in recent years, and at 95 years

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.560
of age, he's mostly taking life easy these days.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.600
He is still married to his wife of 70 years, Bonnie Bartlett, and they are still adorable

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.800
together.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.680
While researching this video, I watched over a dozen different panels at band conventions

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:40.520
where the cast shared memories of working on the series, and what was particularly surprising

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.800
was how many of these panels were in the last five years.

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.680
And while there were always Girl Meets World fans who found the show later in life, there

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.160
are also a number of older fans who fondly remember it from their childhood, talking

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.800
about how comforting it was to watch these characters, who remind them of the more carefree

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.400
days of the 90s.

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.280
These are the childhood memories of when everything was going to turn out alright if

01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:02.640
we just followed the rules, and we did, yet here we are.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.240
Things aren't alright at all.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.720
The world and television in general has become a more cynical place in the 22 years since

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.120
the last episode of Boy Meets World aired, and I don't think there's any shame in

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.040
watching a few episodes of a TV series that carried some optimism and hope about how in

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.160
this big scary world, there was still a place for you.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.560
It's comfort without being completely overwhelmed by fantasy.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.480
Boy Meets World isn't blind to the suffering of the world, and goes out of its way to explore

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.240
these topics, but it can never escape the family-friendly TGIF dynamic it was born into,

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.480
and while that doesn't make it a bad show, I think it's important to acknowledge its

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.880
perspective.

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.080
That comfort, with a dose of reality, might be the key to its longevity.

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.000
It saw the world, at least part of it, as something flawed, yet held out some hope that

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.600
it could be made better, which is why the series ended with a final lesson from Mr.

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:52.840
Feeney to dream, try, and do good.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.600
With the safe lesson of Boy Meets World over, offering a hint of the trials ahead of us,

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.200
the lesson is not to wish for the fantasies it presented, or cynically sneer at its limited

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.400
scope, but to instead take to heart the idea that we make the most of the only world we've

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.320
got, and hopefully the next generation will be making a better one.

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:15.720
When I first started doing these retrospectives, Boy Meets World was one of the first shows

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.000
I saw requested.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.480
I remember thinking to myself, probably not likely.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.440
I was never a huge fan, I don't know if I necessarily want to revisit that one, but

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.660
over time the requests kept coming, and eventually I was worn down, and I was happily surprised.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:32.280
It held up pretty well, and while it doesn't resonate as strongly as it probably does for

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.360
the more die-hard Boy Meets World fans out there who might be watching this, I hope you

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:42.080
still enjoyed this trip down memory line, and this revisiting of a beloved series.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.880
This video would not have been possible without the lovely names you see floating up the screen

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:47.880

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.680
