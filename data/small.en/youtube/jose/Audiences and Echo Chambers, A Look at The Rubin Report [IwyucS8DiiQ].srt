1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Let me first get something out of the way. This video is not going to be a takedown or

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,120
demolition of Dave Rubin. Ideally, Dave Rubin could watch this video himself and understand

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,520
a carefully constructed critique when he sees it. But in the land of the internet,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,080
that might be asking for far too much.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,240
Dave Rubin began his career as a bushy-tailed comedian performing in New York City. His early

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
career had him immediately touching on the world of political comedy when he interned

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,320
at The Daily Show. Rubin displayed some affinity towards creating his own platforms by starting

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,640
The Anti-Show, a short-lived comedy program filmed at NBC Studios that aired on Manhattan

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Neighborhood Network in the fall of 2001. It was basically a daily show rip-off that

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
never really got off the ground. Speaking of not getting off the ground, Rubin also started two

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,000
different comedy clubs in New York City in the mid-2000s. The first, Joe Franklin's Comedy Club,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
closed some time after 2009. I couldn't quite find the exact date on that one. And the second

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
club, I couldn't really find any information at all. The comedy company closed down, but its

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,000
former address is now occupied by a TGI Friday's, so at least it went out with a laugh. Rubin went

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
on to start several podcasts including Hot Gay Comics and The Ben and Dave Show, both of which

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,200
ended up being TV shows on the Here Network. But it was Rubin's The Six Pack, which was eventually

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
picked up by Sirius, that became a big hit. Rubin gave up the podcasting world and eventually moved

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,200
to Los Angeles where he began working at the progressive YouTube channel The Young Turks,

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,960
and so the Rubin Report was born. However, this was a far cry from the show we know of today.

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,280
It consisted of short clips touching on news stories of the day with Rubin's brand of humor thrown in.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Rubin also made the occasional appearance on cable news programs such as The O'Reilly Factor.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,960
Here he is briefly commenting on what would later be a major cause for him. On the base of this,

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,240
I believe in free speech and I believe that Dan Cathy is welcome to say what he wants. And I

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,280
believe that the gay community at the same point is welcome to say what they want. Rubin eventually

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,200
broke with The Young Turks during what he would later refer to as his awakening. It began in

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,760
October of 2014 when Rubin saw the infamous confrontation between Sam Harris and Batman

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
on Real Time with Bill Maher, where some noise was made after Sam Harris called Islam,

28
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,680
some heated words were exchanged, and a wide-eyed Dave Rubin was sent on a voyage of self-discovery.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
It was a voyage that he was on with a lot of other people who were regular viewers of

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,960
Rubin's current employer, The Young Turks. Shortly after the real-time confrontation,

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,600
Sam Harris sat down with Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks for a three-hour discussion. Although the

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,200
discussion was less a debate and more an exercise in masochism, Rubin, and many of the viewers,

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
felt some affinity with Harris's exasperation with the left. Rubin felt that exasperation so

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
strongly that he decided to break from The Young Turks and immediately take the Rubin report into

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,680
his own hands. And by immediately into his own hands, I mean taking a job with Riot five months

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:36,400
later. Although recently, most of TYT's audience tends to generally enjoy the content they put out,

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,280
there was a period around 2014 and 2015 where whenever there was any mention of Islam or a few

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,520
other hot-button topics in one of their videos, there would be an intense negative reaction.

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,360
Here's an illustrative comment. A significant segment of TYT's audience had strongly held

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
beliefs about Islam, feminism, and race, and they strongly disagreed with TYT's coverage of those

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
issues. This resentment towards discussion centered on identity politics was creating

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,520
a growing sense of outrage from those who thought the accusations of racism and sexism were getting

43
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,200
out of hand. This anger was coalescing into a general anti-left sentiment and can be seen in

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,480
comments like the ones on screen. The mere mention of terms like racism and sexism were enough to

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,680
trigger an outrage. While I don't speak to the personal motivations of those who share this anger,

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,880
it is one that can be found quite easily throughout YouTube, particularly in circles that disseminate

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,360
videos in which there is much gnashing of teeth about the SJW menace.

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,840
Ruben's YouTube career up to this point had mostly been mixed. His videos while working

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,320
under the Young Turks varied widely in their results. Some struggled to crack 10,000 viewers

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,480
while others reached millions. His time at Riot gave him some consistency but in the wrong

51
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,160
direction, with most videos struggling to break that 10,000 view barrier. Much of the content of

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,920
this time followed Ruben's earlier formula of commenting on News of the Day. Yes robots are

53
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,240
coming to destroy this and that's why I do it so that years from now on a cracked tv screen in a

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,480
room after the robotic overtake you'll see this and people go oh he knew what he was saying. But

55
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,240
being his own version of what a channel like TOIT was already doing wasn't cutting it so Ruben made

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,920
another change. Ruben's time with Riot came to an end when Ruben made the move to Larry King's Aura

57
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,920
TV in September of 2015. With this came a format change from brief commentary clips to long

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,960
one-on-one interviews. Ruben's first major interview just happened to be with the man who

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,040
inspired his awakening Sam Harris. The Ruben report we know of today was born during that

60
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,560
interview with Harris as Ruben not only found a format he enjoyed but he also found a particular

61
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,360
audience. One that would shape his show in the years to come. Ruben began his new format by

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
immediately addressing his audience with a series of rules. You can see them on screen and by and

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,960
large they're pretty straightforward for a left-leaning YouTube personality. I say left-leaning

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,560
because that's how Ruben describes himself at this point. Is seeing my side the people on the left

65
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
cherry picking facts stifling debate and labeling everyone they disagree with a racist, a bigot,

66
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,880
a homophobe or worse. From here we can see Ruben had some ideas of how his show was going to go

67
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,280
down. He was presenting himself not just as a person on the left though but rather someone

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,120
disaffected with the left. By choosing Sam Harris as his first interview subject he was courting the

69
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
same faction on the left that's dissatisfied with the content on channels like the Young Turks

70
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,280
particularly its commentary on social issues. One of the big promises early on in the Ruben report

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
was to speak with people from across the political spectrum. Ruben wanted to prove his

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,360
earnestness in exploring ideas by inviting a wide range of opinions and this is evidenced by many

73
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,040
of his earliest guests including the likes of Don Lemon, Larry Elder, Jimmy Dore and Douglas Murray.

74
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
But it was one guest in particular that really resonated with Ruben's new audience and that was

75
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,360
Milo Yiannopoulos. For those who may not remember Milo Yiannopoulos was a writer for the right-wing

76
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,960
media outlet Breitbart and he shot to fame championing the Gamergate controversy. After

77
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
outraging activists on the left for a few years he fell from grace after some old comments of him

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,800
came out that sound an awful lot like him defending pedophilia. Now he sells dick pills on crackpot

79
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
outlet InfoWars. While the Harris interview did well a few months earlier ratcheting up nearly

80
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,480
one million views at the time of writing this it was several small clips with the

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Yiannopoulos that really excited the viewership of Ruben's channel. All three of these videos did

82
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,000
extremely well with the combined total of nearly five million views and leading to a spike in

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
subscriptions and views for Ruben's channel in October of 2015. I need to talk about Dave Ruben's

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,280
interview style for a moment. Ruben describes his own style in one of his early videos. I talked to

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Mike Huckabee's campaign manager about gay marriage and she basically just danced around it.

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Had I pushed her to the breaking point I probably would have never gotten access to her again

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,480
and then word would have traveled fast that I'm someone that they shouldn't talk to. So with that

88
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,800
in mind I tried my best to navigate all the interviews with some basic questions and then

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,520
some deeper probing. And this will be a theme in many of his interviews in the future. His approach

90
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,640
is so gentle so concerned with offending his guest that he would sooner let his guests walk

91
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,600
all over him and use his show as a convenient platform rather than strongly counter their

92
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,560
arguments. And that's precisely what Milo Yiannopoulos did. In 2015, Yiannopoulos was a darling

93
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,960
of the alt-right and gamergate crowds and the gentle interview Ruben had with him pleased

94
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Yiannopoulos's fans so much that many of them decided to stick around. While some might argue

95
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,520
the interview helped put Yiannopoulos on the map, I would sooner say that it helped put the new

96
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,560
Ruben report on the map with a particular audience. Ruben had the audience of disaffected leftists

97
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,680
but Yiannopoulos brought with him a bunch of people from the extreme right who came to see someone on

98
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,200
the left play second banana to their idol. It wouldn't be the last time Ruben found himself

99
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,760
in this position. It should also be noted that Yiannopoulos was a guest that was recommended to

100
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Ruben by his audience beforehand and as already evidenced, the disaffected left that was Ruben's

101
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,840
new base enjoyed hearing the likes of Yiannopoulos complain about the SJWs. Ruben's initial audience

102
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,800
were curious about this anti-left rhetoric coming from the right and while they may have seen

103
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,080
themselves as either on the left or center, they were willing to put any disagreements on hold to

104
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
enjoy a good bashing of those on the left they disliked. And in time, the lines between these

105
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,560
audiences would only get blurrier. The booking of Yiannopoulos was a small step in what Ruben was

106
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,040
trying to do with his show. He was hoping to engineer an audience that was not only enjoying

107
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,480
his content but also engaged online. There are numerous examples of Ruben encouraging his viewers

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
to become more engaged on Twitter and to call out misdeeds wherever they saw them, essentially

109
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
turning his audience into a group of online activists that the discussions we're having here

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,080
on the show as well as the ones that you guys are having on Twitter and YouTube are actually making

111
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,120
a difference. That's the beauty of the internet. You can get issues to actually bubble up until

112
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,840
mainstream takes notice. There's evidence of the awakening that I've been talking about all over

113
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,080
the place right now. The point of all this is that every week, actually every day that I've been

114
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,480
doing this show, I see this movement getting stronger. You guys are not only connecting with

115
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
me but with each other. And now when I see the usual regressives spout off their nonsense,

116
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,120
there's an army of people calling them out on it. That is literally as important as anything that I do.

117
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
In return, Ruben took booking suggestions and reading advice from his audience.

118
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,040
He wasn't so much the leader of a movement as he was a part of it.

119
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,960
The next indicator of the state of the Ruben Report audience was its reaction to his interview

120
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,600
with civil rights attorney Areva Martin in January of 2016. To date, it is by far his

121
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,960
least popular interview with the full interview in clipped sections, not getting close to 100,000

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,400
views. As an unambiguous voice from the left, the Ruben Report's audience decided Martin's

123
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,080
perspective wasn't a part of the battle of ideas that interested them. Of the few that watched the

124
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,120
Martin interview, the reaction was fierce. A large number of dislikes and comments like this one.

125
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
In fact, of all of Ruben's full-length feature interviews, this is the only one where the dislikes

126
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
don't number the likes. I don't suspect this is because of Ruben's performance.

127
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,400
Although Ruben trumpeted his platform as a place for voices from across the political spectrum,

128
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,120
it appeared as though the Ruben Report's audience was less interested in voices like Martin and more

129
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,080
interested in voices from the right, like Yiannopoulos. The next few months brought with

130
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,920
it feature interviews with Tommy Robinson, Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, again, and perhaps

131
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,680
most notably, Ben Shapiro. Shapiro, editor for the conservative outlet The Daily Wire,

132
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
is a fairly prominent conservative voice who is best known for challenging teenagers on Twitter

133
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,520
and breaking them on the wheel of logic. A little under a year after having him on his show,

134
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,880
Dave Ruben would cite Ben Shapiro, along with earlier guests Sam Harris and Larry Elder,

135
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,680
along with future guest Eric Weinstein, as trusted guides to the world of politics.

136
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Even more telling is that interviews with Harris, Elder, and Shapiro go on to be the most popular

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,600
on the channel. Ruben's tastes and his audiences were beginning to align. I want to look at this

138
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,040
comment under the first Shapiro interview from Alex Jones. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, well,

139
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,680
damn, maybe it is Alex Jones, shit. Ruben's style is lauded here as presenting ideas an audience

140
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
might not be comfortable with, along with some self-congratulations for being willing to listen

141
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
to them. This charity and open-mindedness is something that often accompanies many of the

142
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,600
interviews Ruben has with right-wing guests. The same level of charity never seems to meet the

143
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,280
left-wing guests. They're more likely to meet the fate of Areva Martin, either being ignored or

144
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,000
fiercely disagreed with. The Ruben Report is becoming a place welcoming to voices from the

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
right while shunning voices from the left. But before leaving season one entirely, there are

146
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
two curious direct messages I want to point out first. The real threat of a Donald Trump presidency

147
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,960
and how to stop Trump. Of all of Dave Ruben's direct messages, these two have the worst like

148
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,440
to dislike ratio. Aside from Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee from later in

149
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,480
the year. Gee, I wonder why that one got so much hate. The Trump videos feature Dave opining the

150
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
divisiveness in politics, and he takes the time to criticize the left for the rise of Trump.

151
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,480
Why he doesn't blame the right for the rise of the progressives is a mystery. In spite of the

152
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
name of the video, Ruben only offers a mild criticism of Trump instead falling back on a

153
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,680
common talking point of the time of Trump being some kind of unknowable wildcard. Ruben's advice

154
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,200
to stop Trump is less about what to do to stop him and more about what not to do if you want to

155
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,760
stop him. In other words, his advice for stopping Trump is to admonish the left for behaving badly.

156
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
This encapsulates what his channel is often about and what binds the Ruben Report's audience

157
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,120
together. Anger towards the left. Ruben in these videos has demonstrated either consciously or

158
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,640
unconsciously that he knows how to tap into that audience, and that makes all commentary either

159
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:43,680
explicitly or partially anti-left. Or at this point in the Ruben Report, it would still be considered

160
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,160
anti-regressive. The distinction between regressive and left wouldn't fade until sometime later.

161
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,160
To complete his critical look at Trump, Ruben's guest following these two direct messages were

162
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,400
Mike Cernovich, a Trump operative, and Milo Yiannopoulos. He had famously called Trump his

163
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:09,040
daddy. This comment from a Dale Gribble alias under how to stop Trump sums up a significant

164
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,880
portion of the Ruben Report's audience. Trump is the anti-left candidate they've all been waiting

165
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,080
for. This was the state of affairs of the Ruben Report heading into the relaunch of the show in

166
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,680
June of 2016. The project had rare fruit for Ruben, and he was getting ready to take it to the next level.

167
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,680
At what can be thought of as season two of the Ruben Report, some major changes happened behind

168
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,960
the scenes. Ruben left Aura TV when they decided to move away from YouTube as a platform for its

169
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,680
videos, and Ruben felt like he needed to be loyal to the audience on YouTube he had helped build.

170
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,200
Ruben moved the show from the Aura Studios to his own home. Now Ruben was faced with the new

171
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,760
challenge. He had to finance the whole thing. Enter every YouTuber's favorite crowdfunding platform,

172
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,560
Patreon. As a side note, the Ruben Report's Patreon was actually started in November of 2015,

173
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,320
over half a year earlier. It only had about a few dozen supporters back then though. It didn't

174
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,760
really pick up any momentum until this season two push in July of 2016 where Ruben asked the

175
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,840
Ruben Report audience to dig deep. And dig deep they did with the number of backers jumping up to

176
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:34,400
$2,354 and Ruben earning $21,402 a month. The audience who had shaped the Ruben Report had

177
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,600
bought in. Dave Ruben had often equated what he did on the show as being just as important as the

178
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,640
activism of the audience. He lavished them with praise for their activity on social media and

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,240
sometimes jumped into the middle of Twitter fights himself. Assuming you haven't had an intense

180
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,400
hypnotherapy session to block this out of your memory, you probably remember there was an election

181
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,760
in the fall of 2016. Shortly after Ruben returned from his break, Hillary Clinton was declared the

182
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,520
nominee for the Democratic Party and this direct message is easily his least popular. It can't

183
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,240
really be compared to any direct message he put together for Trump's nomination though as he

184
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,320
never made one of those. But the comments from the Ruben Report's audience make it quite clear who

185
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,920
they prefer in this upcoming race. To cap it off, Ruben's guest following this direct message was

186
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,160
none other than Clinton critic and felon Dinesh D'Souza. The second DM I want to talk about is

187
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,720
Ruben's discussion of the alt-right. Although he doesn't identify with the group himself,

188
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,760
he largely excuses their actions as antics by ironic Nazis. Ruben is very gentle with his

189
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,960
criticism of the alt-right, noting that while real racist and Nazis exist in their ranks,

190
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,920
what the alt-right really is though is a band of meme posters, anime avatars, and Twitter eggs

191
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,160
vying for attention from people in power. They post Nazi memes, racist pictures, and offensive

192
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,400
tweets with the express intent of getting powerful people to react, respond, and thus

193
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,320
amplify their message. They are keyboard warriors and professional trolls trying to get attention

194
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
from the sold out and corrupt media and political elite that we have. Some true racists mixed with

195
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,080
a bunch of people who just want to mess with those in power. How many of each of them are there? We

196
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,360
have no idea. What we do know though is that these people wield very little real world power.

197
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,400
He doesn't see the group as completely despicable, and for good measure he blames Hillary Clinton

198
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,280
for their rise. In this instance though, he doesn't try to take the middle route balancing

199
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,960
right and left. He explicitly says he believes the alt-right is better than the regressive left,

200
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,160
and he believes this to be true because of how he's been informed by the Ruben report audience.

201
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,880
Personally, I think that the regressive left is more of a threat to our democracy than the

202
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,880
alt-right. The regressive left with its tactics of stifling debate and silencing critics

203
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,720
has gained mainstream traction in our media and in our universities. These regressive,

204
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,440
not progressive ideas, have become all too common on the left and they've actually given birth

205
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,240
to the natural response, the alt-right. I know this firsthand not only from the emails that you

206
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,760
guys send me, but also from all the students at UCLA who came up to me after my event with Milo

207
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,720
Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to tell me that they're supporting Trump just because they can't

208
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,920
take the culture of fear around speech anymore. In the eye of this storm still exists some people

209
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,200
in the Ruben report audience who don't share these increasingly anti-left views and no trouble when

210
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
they see it. A few comments like these pop up on Ruben's videos expressing dismay and concern,

211
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,080
but they become less common as the months drag on. Ruben gives up on being completely independent

212
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,600
as he announces a partnership with Learn Liberty. Learn Liberty is a project by the Institute for

213
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,400
Humane Studies which is notably funded by billionaire Charles Koch, who is by far its

214
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:16,160
biggest contributor, having from 1999 to 2014 donated $14,963,318. IHS and by extension

215
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,080
Learn Liberty have been pushing forward a libertarian message across a number of projects

216
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,400
over the years, frequently from a right-wing perspective. Their partnership with the Ruben

217
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,560
report is doing much of the same. Although Dave Rubin, as far as I've been able to discover,

218
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,040
has never gone into the specifics of what his partnership with Learn Liberty entails,

219
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,600
we know at least one part of this deal includes having guests selected by Learn Liberty appear

220
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,640
on the Ruben report. This has, in effect, given Learn Liberty some editorial control over the show.

221
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,680
Much like ceding control to the audience, this is another example of Rubin bargaining away

222
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,840
control over the show that bears his name. Now I don't point this out as a direct criticism,

223
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,800
but would rather refer back to Rubin's stated goals in starting this show. He expressed a desire

224
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,960
to speak to people from across the political spectrum, and he's given significant control

225
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,000
over the booking of his show to his audience, which has a strong anti-left bias, and Learn Liberty,

226
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,720
whose libertarian perspective often put it at odds with the left. If Rubin wants balance on his show,

227
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,320
that is, exploring ideas from across the spectrum, it's at this point he should be wondering where

228
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,600
voices from the left will be coming from. And it's from here that the election kicks into high

229
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,600
gear, and we get a barrage of election-themed content. Rubin's commentary about the election,

230
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,440
as is usual for him, takes the center route, advocating for a nonspecific diversity of voices.

231
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,600
He interviews transhumanist candidate Zoltan Istvan. The audience is less interested in this interview,

232
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,640
or most of the alternative voices that don't support an anti-left stance. The Istvan interview

233
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,320
netted less than 100,000 views across all four clips, whereas, at roughly the same time,

234
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,160
the Rubin reportings lapped up an interview with filmmaker Cassie Jay about her sympathetic look

235
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,160
at men's rights activism. In the interest of presenting some concerns from the Rubin Report

236
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,400
channel, though, regarding its view count, I should point out to this comment where it's

237
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,520
suspected or hypothesized by the Rubin Report that view counts aren't being

238
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,680
accurately reported by YouTube, and people are being unsubscribed from the channel.

239
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,960
This is one of many claims that have come from Dave Rubin over the years about YouTube

240
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,080
interfering with his channel, often based on hearsay or random comments from his audience.

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,880
I would love to dive into this YouTube conspiracy, but that will have to be a topic for another day.

242
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,160
Rubin's audience continued to make its feelings clear as the 2016 election continued. In an

243
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,160
interview of October of 2016 with scientist and secular activist Lawrence Krauss, a slightly

244
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,000
unfavorably received section criticizing Trump includes this comment. It illustrates so very

245
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,240
clearly what matters more to the Rubin Report audience, whether Clinton or Trump will be more

246
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,680
sensitive to the concerns of, from their perspective, the SJW menace. That's why they

247
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,240
would sooner watch a video about a female filmmaker being red-pilled over a discussion

248
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,720
of alternative candidates, or even the alternative candidates themselves.

249
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,400
Rubin had on a pro-Clinton guest in Hilary Rosen, and the response from the audience was

250
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,400
predictable. A comment like this, while seeming to represent the thirst for diversity within the

251
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,120
Rubin Report audience, is betrayed by the complete disinterest of the majority of the

252
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,680
actual audience. Much like the voices in the audience asking for more left-leaning guests,

253
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,800
this one is a minority within an increasingly anti-left group. As a brief exception,

254
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,000
with some people on the left, such as David Sirota, the Rubin Report audience can be quite

255
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,520
kind if that person is on to criticize the left. So what matters most is not if the guests are

256
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,200
right or left-wing, but will at least pay lip service to anti-left rhetoric. This all

257
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,800
translates to an audience that was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, a candidate who unabashedly appealed

258
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,840
to the American right, and was seen as taking on those bastards on the left. Well, you know,

259
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,440
from his perspective. After the election of Donald Trump,

260
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,160
Dave Rubin was quick to issue a direct message titled, Don't Freak Out About Donald Trump.

261
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
This direct message includes Rubin calling Trump's election.

262
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
This was a win for us, right? Because if you think about it, the elite, the media, everybody,

263
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,240
the establishment all wanted one thing to happen. And what happened? The people actually use their

264
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,280
voting power to stop that very thing from happening. That's actually beautiful. I think

265
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,120
he's going to have to govern really from the center. And I think that will be really good

266
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,280
for classical liberals, basic liberal people. I think it'll be really good

267
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,000
for mainstream conservatives. And then maybe the people that are better on the fringes of

268
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,600
all of this thing will so slowly be silenced. That's my suspicion at the moment. And maybe

269
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
I have a slight sense of what I'm talking about because I kind of saw this whole thing unfolding

270
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,280
the way it did. Although the prediction has fallen on its face, the win comment in particular

271
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,440
is interesting as it perfectly describes what much of the Rubin report audience celebrates

272
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,760
in Trump. And that's a win against the SJW crowd, who at this point are being conflated with the left

273
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,960
in general. When Dave Rubin describes the Democratic Party as being the identity politics driven

274
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,120
Democratic Party. After nominating Hillary Clinton, a woman who has very little support

275
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,960
in more progressive circles, it shows how anti-regressive has really shifted to just being

276
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,240
anti-left. And it shows how Rubin's perspective has shifted quite a bit to the right.

277
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,000
With Rubin's perspective being informed by his audience, it's safe to assume that they're all

278
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,520
on the same page. This is also the direct message where Rubin infamously mentions holding Trump's

279
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:04,480
feet to the fire. Yeah, another one that didn't age too well. This direct message also preceded

280
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,800
what would become the Rubin report's highest rated full-length feature interview, Rubin's

281
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,840
discussion with Jordan Peterson. This interview I really only mentioned because it's one of our

282
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,560
earliest instances of Peterson crying over a children's cartoon. Most of your viewers will

283
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,760
have watched Pinocchio. Probably. There's a scene in Pinocchio where Geppetta wishes on a star,

284
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,400
right? And what it means is he lifts up his eyes beyond the horizon to something transcendent,

285
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,760
to something ultimate, because that's what a star is. It's part of the of the eternity of the night

286
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,720
sky. And so he lifts his eyes up above his daily concerns and he says, what I want,

287
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:57,760
what I want more than anything else is that my creation will become a genuine individual.

288
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
A phrase Rubin has been using a lot at this point, referring to people he speaks with is,

289
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,600
whether I agreed with them or not, it doesn't matter whether Rubin agrees with his guests

290
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,680
or not. Rubin's views have become far less important to this discussion and far less important

291
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,360
to this show. The Rubin report has always been a platform for Rubin's guests to deliver their

292
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,560
views without a serious challenge or debate. And when that platform is being heavily influenced

293
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,400
by an anti-left audience and libertarian advocacy group, it's going to privilege certain viewpoints

294
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,320
over others. Although Rubin frequently talks about a new center, and he's been doing this

295
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,480
as early as the end of 2015, having borrowed the phrase from a former guest, Ali Rizvi,

296
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,760
the term really comes into prominence here as he ties it to the Trump presidency and the guests on

297
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,920
his show. If his show is in essence the center, why is it skewing so heavily in favor to guests

298
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,000
from the right? In 2017, big things started happening with the Rubin report. An interview

299
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,720
with conservative commentator Dennis Prager in January did especially well, and it was followed

300
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,280
a few weeks later by Dave Rubin essentially announcing what many had already suspected,

301
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,960
that he was no longer a member of the left. His Why I Left the Left video for PragerU,

302
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,680
which I should mention is not a real university, was widely disseminated,

303
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,840
and as of this writing it's sitting slightly under 6.5 million views. To date, it's one of

304
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,240
the most popular on the PragerU channel, ranking right up there with videos such as

305
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,520
The War on Boys and Don't Follow Your Passion. Really inspiring stuff.

306
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,360
The momentum built through early 2017 with big subscriber and Patreon jumps in the first five

307
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,320
months of the year. The big draws and interviews were former Fox News personality Glenn Beck,

308
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,840
conservative commentator Clary Elder, and failed Canadian asylum seeker Lauren Southern. It was also

309
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,040
when the free speech wars broke out. A time of great suffering and hardship for all.

310
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,600
But perhaps most remembered for its great victories, immortalized by Dave Rubin and his

311
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,800
direct message, huge win in the battle of ideas. In March of 2017, video commentator Colin Moriarty,

312
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,520
who had recently appeared on the Rubin report as a guest, made a hackney joke on Twitter.

313
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,320
In Moriarty's estimation, he was then the victim of a concentrated attack from opportunists in

314
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,360
the gaming press. There's plenty of discussions on this on how accurate that assessment is on the

315
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,640
internet, but the controversy led to Moriarty starting a Patreon that netted him $40,000

316
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,360
a month when it opened, although it's dropped considerably since. Moriarty is only worth

317
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,120
mentioning because of how he relates to the Rubin report. Rubin brought him on for a live

318
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,280
discussion following the tweet, where they answered questions to the tune of Super Chats,

319
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,880
and the Moriarty story led to, according to Rubin himself, a jump of nearly $2,000 a month

320
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,360
in the Rubin report's Patreon support. The direct message declaring the huge win in the battle of

321
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,480
ideas encapsulates much of what makes the Rubin report's audience tick. It's a victory parade

322
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,000
of sorts, where victory is measured in Patreon dollars and Moriarty is championed as a martyr,

323
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,760
although instead of 40 virgins, he got 40 grand in Patreon dollars.

324
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,800
Support for Moriarty is best understood as him being a new hero for the audience.

325
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Much like Rubin, he took a stand against the SJWs, the Left, the Regressives, or whatever

326
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,360
pejorative label that animates the Rubin report audience. And so long as Rubin and people like

327
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,880
Moriarty make similar sounds, the audience is ready to reward them. The next few months,

328
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,760
leading to the end of what Rubin colorfully referred to as Season 2 of the Rubin report,

329
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,720
reintroduced an ambivalence to current affairs outside of stories like the Moriarty one.

330
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,960
While the first half of 2017 wasn't devoid of news stories in the world, Rubin seemed

331
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,600
less curious in holding Trump's feet to the fire and more concerned with stories surrounding Ann

332
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,360
Coulter being deplatformed and Bill Maher using a racial slur. If the first year of the Rubin report

333
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,240
was about finding his audience, the second was about the audience finding its host, as the

334
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,520
anti-left sentiment cemented in Dave Rubin himself and the audience had the conservative-friendly

335
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,400
voice wrapped in a left-wing package they were looking for. In a discussion with Dennis Prager,

336
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
it was summed up quite nicely here.

337
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,280
The third season of the Rubin report started in September of 2017 with the fiddently titled

338
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,800
Season 3 of the Rubin report starts now. No mistakes on timing there. In the direct message,

339
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,840
we get more of the usual platitudes Rubin extends to the audience and another appeal to them for

340
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:11,840
booking suggestions for the new season of the show. The responses are telling.

341
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,760
They range from libertarian poster boy Ron Paul to diluted crackpot poster boy Mark Dice.

342
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,280
One of the few genuine voices from the left recommended is YouTuber and Dark Mother

343
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,320
Disciple ContraPoints, but the reaction by some of the Rubin report's audience demonstrates how

344
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,120
interested they are in voices from the left with a bit of transphobia thrown in for good measure.

345
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,160
But the Rubin report's audience isn't the only thing moving increasingly to the right.

346
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,240
In a direct message covering the NFL players taking a knee, which was a story about protesting

347
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,600
police violence against black men, there was much rage amidst conservatives and it led to Donald

348
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,800
Trump instructing owners to fire the players. Free speech defender Dave Rubin defended the

349
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,400
players' rights while simultaneously defending the owners' right to fire the players. For a man

350
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,680
who has spoken up so extensively about the chilling effect of being called a racist or sexist,

351
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,960
his defense of people literally losing their job while exercising their right to free speech

352
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,720
is a serious break from his usual fawning over the First Amendment. Looking at the comments,

353
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,000
though, it's not the least bit surprising that the Rubin report's audience shares this sentiment,

354
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,720
and it really demonstrates how paper thin their commitment to free speech actually is.

355
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,040
On the week of that taking the knee direct message, Rubin's guess was Candace Owens,

356
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,960
a commentator who operates under the label Red Pill Black. No extra points for guessing

357
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,520
where she came down on the issue of taking the knee, and naturally the Rubin report's audience

358
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,960
was thrilled to hear from her. The last direct message from 2017 I want to mention is from

359
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,800
October, and it discusses the Las Vegas shooting. In contrast to the previous direct message, where

360
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,840
Rubin very much toed the line with his audience, this one took a slightly different tactic. It's

361
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,520
also the fourth least popular direct message on the channel. This direct message includes Rubin

362
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,240
bucking the majority of his audience and advocating for gun control. Of course, in the message,

363
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,400
he equivocates this by speaking at length about mental health, but to discuss gun control at all

364
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,160
is a position the Rubin report audience have little interest in. The comments are universal

365
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,720
in their distaste for gun control, and Rubin's crowdsourcing through the Rubin report audience

366
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,240
for a guest to educate him on gun laws likely have the obvious effect of pushing Rubin further

367
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,440
to the right. This is a microcosm of how the Rubin report works. It starts with a flimsily held

368
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,600
centrist position. Rubin sources guests based on the recommendation from his anti-left crowd.

369
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,200
An inevitable conservative comes to educate Rubin and any outliers in the audience on how to think,

370
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,880
and everyone nodding along with the channel takes another step to the right.

371
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,360
And those right-wing voices make the show a beacon for more right-wing viewers too.

372
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,680
The next time Rubin introduces a topic and states his position, it'll be a little further to the

373
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,600
right. And the next time his audience suggests or reacts to a guest, there will be more voices

374
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,120
from the right-making comments. And the cycle continues, all while the channel keeps racking

375
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,520
up subs and Patreon keeps racking up dollars. In that theoretical model of how the Rubin report

376
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,600
functions, the political leanings of Dave Rubin is one of the least important variables. This is

377
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,880
one thing I think most criticisms of the Rubin report get wrong, or at least get far too hung

378
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,640
up on. Whatever Dave Rubin might call himself doesn't matter as much as the system he oversees.

379
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,600
He can be a classical liberal, a secret conservative, or a clueless progressive,

380
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,240
and it wouldn't matter. The positions of the Rubin report guests and its audience are what

381
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,680
animate this conveyor belt that moves viewers, and Rubin himself, from the left to the right.

382
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,120
It's possible something could disrupt this model, and perhaps an audience can only be pulled so far

383
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,560
to the right before they check out or demand more moderate voices, but I'm not sure the Rubin report

384
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,560
has hit that limit just yet. As I write this in early 2018, very little has changed in the land

385
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,680
of Rubin. Dave Rubin continues to make increasingly right-wing claims, going so far as to say he would

386
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,480
support Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders. If everything basically says like it is right now,

387
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
and my choice in 2020 is either Trump, or Bernie, or Elizabeth Warren, or Gavin Newsom, or one of

388
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,680
these crazy progressives, I'm voting Trump, and I won't have a problem doing it. And the audience

389
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,680
is still ravenous for conversations between the likes of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. And

390
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,800
with over 2 million views and 40 times the number of likes to dislikes, there's a clear sign here

391
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,520
that the Rubin report audience has an insatiable hunger for this type of content. Compare that to

392
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,680
the recent interview with David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and certainly

393
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,160
nobody's progressive, and we see the views drop down to 60,000 for the main interview, and a huge

394
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,600
outpouring of dislikes. At this point, the Rubin report's audience is reliably on the right, if

395
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,720
not far right. Whatever labels they wish to champion, when they have warmer reactions for

396
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,040
the likes of Stefan Molyneux or Lauren Southern instead of David Frum, this is not traditional

397
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,960
conservative politics. While I don't have any real data to accurately measure the political alignment

398
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,840
of the Rubin report audience, here is some spontaneous polling of the audience at a Dave

399
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,720
Rubin comedy show to give us a worthless anecdote. How many of you would say that you're conservatives

400
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:44,400
by a round of applause? How many conservatives, how many of you, how many of you are libertarians,

401
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:55,680
libertarians? All right, we did conservatives, we did libertarians. How many of you, how many

402
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:05,760
progressives, how many progressives? So we got, not one, no one will say it, I mean we're not going

403
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,960
to take, shoot you. I mean, oh we have one, we have one, please take them outside.

404
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,360
So we did conservatives, we did libertarians, we did, how many classical liberals?

405
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:28,800
Some selection biases at play here, because anyone going to a Dave Rubin comedy show must

406
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,600
really love the guy, or pay themselves.

407
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,200
Ultimately, I think Dave Rubin isn't just a supporter of the free marketplace of ideas,

408
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,640
he's also a victim. By throwing the reins of his show to the audience and following the money,

409
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,920
whatever vision he had of a show that spanned the political spectrum was co-opted by anti-left and

410
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,040
conservative voices. The free market was never going to protect Rubin's ideal platform. How could it?

411
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,920
As much as we might like to think everyone has a spot in the marketplace, we're limited by the

412
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,880
people we can reach and the people who will listen to us. As much as we like to think a strong idea

413
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,320
can survive any onslaught, it can never be heard if it's never given a platform, and a platform

414
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,960
that refuses to engage with one side of the political spectrum, or at least grows increasingly

415
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,400
hostile towards it, will never be a place where ideas can be fairly compared. In an ideal world,

416
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,880
the free marketplace of ideas would truly let every idea have a shot at expressing itself,

417
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,080
and be presented to a diverse audience capable of making a reasonable consideration of the evidence.

418
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,280
But, in the world we've got, the ideas that get championed or platformed are often the ones coming

419
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,800
from people with resources to make that happen. A libertarian think tank funded by wealthy people

420
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,320
can spread its ideas of classical liberalism more easily than a trans activist with a blog.

421
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,080
If you claim to be a space where all ideas can be discussed and then deliberately host one side

422
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,600
far more than the other on just about every issue, you aren't the free market you pretend to be.

423
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,560
You're an opportunist platform fighting for the status quo.

424
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,720
I think you know what one of those places is called.
