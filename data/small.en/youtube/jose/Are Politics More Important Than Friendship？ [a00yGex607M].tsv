0	4660	Two taboos in polite conversation have traditionally been talking about religion and talking about
4660	5660	politics.
5660	9860	People get immediately heated, and it often isn't conducive to a pleasant, conflict-free
9860	13660	encounter, so it's easy to make a new friend and have no idea there's some kind of political
13660	15440	disagreement between the two of you.
15440	18960	But if you take an interest in politics, and if you clicked on this video, odds are you
18960	22020	do, it's something that will likely come up eventually.
22020	25340	And suddenly, this blissful ignorance of your friendship fades away, and you have to look
25340	27820	at the reality of your friendship in the eye.
27820	31500	In the past few years, friendships being damaged by political differences has become a recurring
31500	35960	topic in news media, and we often see media figures opining about political opinions costing
35960	36960	them friends.
36960	41600	In many cases, it's easy to feel sympathy for someone who has lost a friend, or understanding
41600	46200	when a person expresses anxiety as to why they keep their political affiliations hidden.
46200	50100	But not all complaints about friendships being affected by politics are the same.
50100	54520	The rules for friendships vary, and I want to look at how these dynamics shift, both
54520	59480	for friendships in private, and for those of us who have friendships in public.
59480	62460	In recent years, polling has shown people are increasingly less likely to have friends
62460	65000	with different political persuasions.
65000	69360	According to a YouGov poll of American citizens, all three categories of voters – Democrats,
69360	72820	Republicans, and Independents – have become less likely to be friends with anyone who
72820	77840	has different political opinions, with Democrats showing the biggest change from 2016 to 2020.
77840	82080	A Pew Research poll changed the question slightly, instead asking supporters from each respective
82080	86200	side in the previous federal election if they have a few or no friends who supported
86200	87680	the opposite candidate.
87680	91680	Once again, both sides revealed very few of their friends supported the other's candidate,
91680	92680	if any at all.
92680	97200	In the UK, a similar poll was conducted by Ipsos, and the results were similar, although
97200	98560	this one dug a little deeper.
98560	101720	Much like the American polls, it showed that both the left and right found it difficult
101720	105080	to be friends with someone who had a different political affiliation, with those supporting
105080	108760	the left-wing Labour Party having more difficulty in being friends with those in the right-wing
108760	110000	Conservative Party.
110000	113560	When digging into this particular poll, though, the numbers reveal something interesting.
113560	117800	The propositions asked on specific issues revealed that these divides are on significant
117800	121040	issues that are more than mere disagreements on public policy.
121040	126160	For example, participants were asked to agree or disagree with these two propositions.
126160	129680	It would be hard to be friends with someone who supports the expansion of transgender
129680	134920	rights in the UK, and it would be hard to be friends with someone who thinks transgender
134920	137080	rights have gone too far in the UK.
137080	141040	It's a much deeper question than asking what someone thinks is the appropriate tax
141040	142040	rate.
142040	146400	Since 2015, reports of transphobic hate crimes have quadrupled.
146400	150800	According to Gallup, 1 in 4 trans people have been threatened with or experienced transphobic
150800	151800	violence.
151800	155320	1 in 3 UK employers are less likely to employ a trans person.
155320	158560	Almost half of trans people have a suicide attempt in their past.
158560	163840	So the state of trans rights in the UK are not great.
163920	167160	Hearing that the question in the Ipsos poll reveals not just someone's attitude towards
167160	171320	friendships across political lines, but how the assumption of political affiliation carries
171320	173960	with it an attitude towards the rights of trans people.
173960	178280	If someone believes trans rights have gone too far, it's a question that goes beyond
178280	181280	politics and it's the realm of whether or not you believe someone has the right to
181280	185240	publicly identify as the gender they understand themselves to be.
185240	189120	We can try to intellectualize this in terms of it being a debate, and some people might
189120	190120	enjoy doing that.
190120	193040	It may be easy enough for a cis person to be friends with someone who believes trans
193040	196720	rights have gone too far, even if it means constantly getting into arguments.
196720	200200	But for a trans person, these arguments can hit a lot harder when it's your own rights
200200	201200	being debated.
201200	204800	And there's so many other degrees of differences, such as a cis person who might be more passionate
204800	208600	about trans rights because a sister or brother is trans, or perhaps a trans person who can
208600	211280	compartmentalize well enough to engage in that debate.
211280	214640	But in the midst of all this rhetorical exercise, it should be understood that what's being
214640	218840	debated here are the rights of human beings, and that this debate being politicized doesn't
218840	221920	make it the same as other debates on policy issues.
221920	226000	This is much like debates around marriage equality, civil rights, voting rights, and
226000	229920	an endless number of issues that have been politicized, both in the past and present.
229920	233800	Someone who advocates against trans rights is, whether they know it or not, advocating
233800	234800	for bigotry.
234800	238180	While someone can choose to be friends with a bigot in their personal life, reducing this
238180	242020	disagreement to a political one is disingenuous.
242020	247760	That isn't to say all disagreements across political affiliations are questions of personal
247760	248760	rights.
248760	252560	Considering what sort of issues get politicized, I think it's an important distinction to
252560	253560	make.
253560	256700	Amidst all these discussions about friendships being affected by politics, disagreements
256700	259440	on issues like this reveal something far deeper as at play.
259440	263200	In late 2020, the New York Times asked students about relationships with people who have differing
263200	264640	political opinions.
264640	266520	Here are a few of the responses.
266520	269720	Some people that believe that politics shouldn't ruin relationships don't realize that at
269720	272360	times not caring about politics is a privilege.
272360	276920	If my friends or family members have huge differences in opinions from me, for example,
276920	281560	if they don't support Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+, and women's rights, etc., then I
281560	283980	don't want to associate myself with them at all.
283980	287320	That is more than just politics, it's about people's basic human rights.
287320	290040	People's lives are more important than relationships.
290040	293680	As a queer woman, hearing that one of my friends supports Trump means that they support all
293680	298660	the discrimination and laws he has enacted against the LGBTQIA plus community, as well
298660	302800	as women, people of color, Native Americans, disabled people, etc.
302800	306800	Usually if they're a friend, I open a dialogue and talk about my beliefs often with them,
306800	309940	trying to get them to understand what the facts are, what the other side is, and why
309940	311020	I feel that way.
311020	313360	If they're family, I tend to avoid them when I can.
313360	316980	If they change their mind and admit that supporting someone who doesn't see me as a human being
316980	320120	is wrong, then I will continue to have that relationship with them.
320120	323320	If they can't or refuse to listen, then our relationship will die.
323320	325520	I can't respect someone who doesn't respect me.
325520	329400	Whatever the response is determines how our relationship changes, whether we drift apart
329400	331080	or go closer together.
331080	333760	What I liked about these particular quotes is how they establish the importance of the
333760	335900	type of relationship being considered.
335900	340060	Not all friendships are equal, and a relationship with a family member is often much more meaningful
340060	341100	than a friendship.
341100	345020	In those cases, it becomes a real test as to how to maintain that relationship.
345020	346740	Opinions like these certainly aren't universal.
346740	349420	In the same article, some students offer different responses.
349420	353900	In my family, my father was a Republican and my mother is a Democrat, but my parents have
353900	357580	learned to not judge each other because of their political beliefs, but to accept each
357580	361240	other's opinions and be grateful they are able to agree to disagree.
361240	363780	This election was a great test for this way of thinking.
363780	365060	Writing came out victorious.
365060	366920	My father accepts that and moves on.
366920	370340	As simple as that sounded, it taught me something that I will use when I start to build important
370340	371860	relationships with people.
371860	375260	Don't judge people based on their political opinions or their opposing opinions.
375260	376900	Judge them for what they mean to you.
376900	380580	I actually think it's not important in the slightest to have similar political beliefs
380580	381580	to your friends and family.
381580	385260	Rather, I think it's important to have different beliefs and opinions in order to gain perspective
385260	386260	and educate yourself.
386260	390420	I come from an extremely divided family, where my parents are extremely Republican.
390420	392160	One sister is extremely liberal.
392160	395760	The other is fairly moderate, and I am moderate, leaning towards the left side.
395760	399200	Although our disagreements can get frustrating and feelings can be hurt, I am thankful that
399200	403480	I am able to have all perspectives and educate myself to the best of my ability in order
403480	407400	to create my own political beliefs and not just choose my position based on those who
407400	408400	surround me.
408400	411800	The real disparity between these attitudes regarding the intersection of friendship and
411800	416360	politics is not so much the idea valuing one over the other, but rather what someone considers
416360	418120	a political question.
418120	422120	Speaking to The Atlantic, Emily Van Dyne, a communication professor at the University
422120	423120	of Illinois, said,
423120	425860	"'Politics isn't just politics anymore.
425860	428280	Political identity now encompasses so many other things.
428280	431200	Our social identity, our morals, our values."
431200	434800	A casual friend whose incessant political rants may be easy enough to cut out of your
434800	438660	life, but it's a bit tougher when it's a parent who regularly complains about immigrants.
438660	442640	Some relationships can be formed around disagreement or argument, though this can sometimes reflect
442640	444360	the stakes in the relationship.
444360	447840	If politics are impacting how we form friendships, it might be worth stepping back to take a
447840	451360	look at how much value one places in that particular friendship.
451360	455280	Writing for Psychology Today, professor of psychology at George Mason University, Todd
455280	458360	B. Kashtan, outlined some basics of friendship.
458360	459360	1.
459360	460360	There is a goal of pleasure.
460360	463720	There is an expectation that both parties enjoy each other's company and show relatively
463720	466240	equal amounts of appreciation and enjoyment.
466240	467240	2.
467240	468240	There is a sense of duty.
468240	471400	There is an expectation that you will act in your friend's interests without being
471400	474600	forced to, without being told to, without being accountable.
474600	475600	3.
475600	477320	There is a high level of empathy.
477320	480840	There is an expectation that both parties will try to understand each other's perspective.
480840	483840	You will not always agree, but you put in the work to understand who they are, where
483840	487440	their motivations lie, and attempt to seek agreement when discord arises.
487440	492160	When all friendships possess all three qualities, they typically have at least two.
492160	493160	He then goes on.
493160	494160	4.
494160	496680	If you fear losing a friend or creating a turmoil in a relationship when being true
496680	501120	to yourself, then your relationship lacks two of the three features of a firm foundation.
501120	502120	Duty is missing.
502120	503120	Empathy is missing.
503120	505400	A solid friendship does not exist.
505400	508920	When you are unable to reveal honest thoughts and feelings, then it becomes increasingly
508920	511640	improbable that a solid friendship could even form.
511640	516040	Although the article goes on to decry outspoken political testing as a means of determining
516040	520400	one's friends, the passage above does suggest that friendships, at least the more meaningful
520400	525080	ones, typically have an openness and honesty that would include not hiding one's politics.
525080	529200	So how does one navigate a friendship with someone who has different politics?
529200	532200	A number of articles have been produced exploring this very question.
532200	535640	If you've decided that this relationship is one you want to maintain, a recurring
535640	539880	theme is to engage calmly and with an attempt to understand the other side.
539880	543360	Research has shown that taking the perspective of the person you're talking to can lead
543360	545640	to a greater understanding of their position.
545640	549240	One exercise that's recommended is trying to write a narrative from the perspective
549240	550440	of the other person.
550440	554400	This can help create some empathy and lead to more productive conversations.
554400	557160	Listening and keeping a calm head can have a similar impact.
557160	559500	It also helps to give someone room to be more complex.
559500	563980	One bad political take may not mean someone can be easily slotted into a disastrous political
563980	564980	position.
564980	569820	There's also the very simple solution of just not talking about politics.
569820	573180	Making it one of those topics you simply don't touch with that person.
573180	577260	Like avoiding mentioning multi-level marketing scams around your Uncle Kevin so you can avoid
577260	578820	another sales pitch.
578820	581780	Everyone has to make choices for themselves as to what political lines they're okay
581780	582780	with their friends being on.
582780	586340	And while I encourage people to consider their choices carefully and not let themselves be
586340	590300	trapped in a friendship that harms them or discard one based on minor differences, I
590300	594140	think it's better to reserve judgment when it comes to who anyone chooses to be friends
594140	597740	with in private, particularly if that person is a stranger.
597740	600980	So if you're someone in that position, I don't think it's fair for anyone who doesn't
600980	603700	know you to judge you on who you choose to be friends with.
603700	608540	I would just express that I hope this friendship is something that makes you a more fulfilled
608540	609540	person.
609540	612340	This same outlook does not hold for public figures though.
612340	616300	With all the groundwork of discussing star-crossed political friendships in the real world, let's
616300	618580	now shift to something completely ridiculous.
618580	619940	The world of online personalities.
619940	624740	I'm sure everyone watching this has seen at least one video about parasocial relationships.
624740	629540	That is, the relationship between a content creator, like me, and my audience.
629540	632820	But what about the interplay between two different content creators?
632820	636940	Or for our purposes, two content creators who engage in political commentary on different
636940	639060	sides of the political spectrum?
639060	642220	There are a couple of different ways political commentators strictly interact with one another
642220	643340	here on YouTube.
643340	647980	For video essayists, such as myself, you often see other commentators make guest appearances,
647980	650580	typically reading quotes or excerpts from source material.
650580	653740	I've had people do them for me, and I've done more of them than I can count for other
653740	654740	people.
654740	656740	Attention all trespassers!
656740	660820	I am the supreme serpent!
660820	662900	Less common is the collaboration.
662900	667220	Two or more creators work on a video or videos that are available for one or more of their
667220	668380	respective channels.
668380	672700	I don't do much of these myself, though I recently worked on one with Mexie about a
672700	687100	very special babysitting club.
687100	690300	You might also see two creators interacting on a stream.
690300	695020	This is where things get a bit more complicated, as there are a lot of ways this can go down.
695020	698660	Someone might appear as part of a panel, it might be a one-on-one chat, sometimes it can
698660	699660	be confrontational.
699660	703340	I don't stream too much myself, so I have less experience with this one, but here is
703340	721820	an example of what streams are like.
721820	725260	Outside of YouTube, you might see creators interact in other mediums, like Twitter, like
725260	728180	when I make a sick dunk and people acknowledge my brilliance.
728180	732460	There are even some very rare moments when content creators beat in the real world as
732460	734300	part of a public-facing event.
734300	737980	As an example, in Toronto, myself and some other political content creators have hosted
737980	740700	meetups where we interact with members of our audience.
740700	745620	A fun bit of Jose trivia is that at the last one we did, that was in February 29th of 2020,
745620	749060	I recorded the opening moments to my Married with Children video.
749060	753260	Friends, I'm gonna need a boost to get through this video.
753260	755260	Can I get a Whoa Jose?
755260	762420	Okay, so those are five different examples of how content creators on YouTube interact.
762420	765220	And there's one thing, to varying degrees, they all have in common.
765220	767620	They are all performative.
767620	770300	Let me clarify what I mean by performative.
770300	772940	I don't mean presenting some kind of false front.
772940	774620	Many of these moments can be authentic.
774620	778340	Rather, I mean these appearances are done very much with the knowledge that they are
778340	780200	in front of an audience.
780200	784300	Some of these may or may not be actual friendships people are witnessing.
784340	787620	What they do have the appearance, though, is of a friendly relationship between the
787620	788620	people in question.
788620	792220	To someone in the audience, they are watching a performance of friendship.
792220	796020	When someone makes a decision to appear on another person's video or stream, or engages
796020	799860	with them on social media or in the real world, it's with the awareness that people are paying
799860	801540	attention to how they interact.
801540	805300	Displays of kindness or hostility signal to the audience what sort of relationship these
805300	806300	people have.
806300	810100	And to some degree, will inform that audience on how to engage with this other creator's
810100	811100	content.
811100	815420	If I ask someone to a guest voice on my channel, it signifies to my audience that this is another
815420	820200	creator I approve of, and that perhaps they should give this person's content a chance.
820200	823740	On the other hand, if I reply to a tweet telling someone that they're clueless and should
823740	827660	try washing their disgusting beanie, it signals to my audience that this is a person you probably
827660	828660	shouldn't listen to.
828660	833020	A lot of this plays on the parasocial relationships that are formed by people watching online
833020	834020	content.
834020	837660	Just to quickly sum up, a parasocial relationship is a one-way relationship in which a viewer
837660	841540	feels attached to a presenter who has no knowledge of the viewer's personal life.
841540	845460	Even though it's only one-way to someone watching, it can feel like they have a virtual
845460	846460	friend.
846460	850180	When it comes to a viewer watching these performative friendships, it gets more complicated.
850180	853040	It's like being in a parasocial relationship with multiple people.
853040	856360	Or in other words, it's like being in a parasocial friend group.
856360	859060	This is a pattern we've already seen on the right wing on YouTube.
859060	862900	Rebecca Lewis's alternative influence paper demonstrated how different creators appearing
862900	865560	on different platforms can create a shared audience.
865560	869340	With the assistance of the U2 algorithm, the impact becomes even greater.
869340	873820	As much as we might like to pretend we as content creators exist on our soul little
873820	878540	islands not connected to anyone else, we all have audiences that overlap.
878540	882960	And a paper like this is a reminder that we exist in community structures, and that there
882960	888060	are very real risks of radicalization not just of our audiences, but of our own content.
888060	892520	And who you choose to befriend on your channel pushes your audience, and sometimes your content,
892520	894560	in certain political directions.
894560	899440	While not all creators are necessarily conscious of this performance, although some certainly
899440	902000	are, the results to the audience are the same.
902000	905600	Positive interactions encourage an audience to be more positive to the person being interacted
905600	907920	with, and negative ones do the opposite.
907920	911040	When we step into the world of friendships across the political aisle, we can see how
911040	915200	this becomes more complicated for anyone engaging in political commentary online.
915200	919800	If someone is on the left, and supposedly championing left-wing ideas or policies, and
919800	924200	then publicly engages in a friendly way with someone on the right, a performance of friendship,
924200	927480	it's considerable to their audience that this person should be considered positively
927480	931480	as well, and if this behavior becomes a pattern, it can be counterproductive to whatever left-wing
931480	933520	goals the commentator has in mind.
933520	937240	This isn't to say someone on the left should never be friendly with someone on the right,
937240	940960	but it's important to consider the broadest social context of these interactions.
940960	944520	If I were to appear on the channel of someone I disagree with, that could present a shift
944520	947720	in the algorithm, one that's more powerful than the luck of one of my videos showing
947720	948720	up as a recommendation.
948720	952840	But as lovely as it may be for everyone to stop watching PragerU and instead one of my
952840	955000	videos, it can backfire as well.
955000	957120	Let's use a recent example.
957120	961540	Figures supposedly on the left, such as Jimmy Dore and Glenn Greenwald, have regularly appeared
961540	965760	on Tucker Carlson's program over the years having friendly, cordial interviews.
965760	969440	This type of interaction is complicated as there is value in grabbing the attention of
969440	973160	a right-wing audience and steering them towards your left-wing content, but when your supposed
973160	977280	loving content largely consists of ignoring the right and attacking the party, that's
977280	978280	to the left of them.
978280	982320	Perhaps, in an effort to satisfy this right-wing audience that has been introduced to you in
982320	986920	a friendly manner, you have to ask the question what sort of project this is furthering.
986920	989880	You can claim you're not trying to help the right, but this display of friendship
989880	993360	and absence of right-wing critique ends up with clips like these.
993360	1015280	Well, I can't say I know the metrics of Jimmy Dore's channel.
1015280	1019320	I'd wager he has a higher percentage of people who enjoy Tucker Carlson than mine, or most
1019320	1020740	other left-wing channels.
1020740	1024940	And I suspect they aren't going there to hear Jimmy Dore's left-wing ideals, but
1024940	1028860	rather to see him beat up on their political rivals, the Democrats.
1028860	1032460	Being friendly on someone else's platform, while still producing content that makes clear
1032460	1036540	that someone is not a part of the right, would complicate someone's public profile.
1036540	1040060	And I'm not going to pretend I understand the most effective way to thread that political
1040060	1041060	needle.
1041060	1045100	But in many cases, if someone is invited onto another platform, friendly conversation typically
1045100	1046700	implies friendly content.
1046700	1050620	Frequently, you might see a commentator lament that they are being critiqued for their
1050620	1054860	associations and no one should ever be written off for one association or appearance or
1054860	1058080	other incident without comparing it to their full body of work.
1058080	1061700	But when it becomes a pattern and is reflected in their content, it brings into question
1061700	1065340	how committed someone is to whatever political affiliation they claim to have.
1065340	1070220	It also displays a stunning ignorance, as if this is just a question about private friendships.
1070220	1073740	The details about cross-political friendships I outlined for private people is still true
1073740	1076000	for anyone with a public profile.
1076000	1079040	Just because someone has a YouTube channel doesn't give anyone the right to judge or
1079040	1080380	police their private life.
1080380	1084640	But when those relationships are with a content creator who has a public profile, they need
1084640	1089220	to be aware that who they engage with on friendly terms sends a message to their audience, whether
1089220	1092300	they want it to or not, and whether they think it should or not.
1092300	1097060	If I started live-strafing with, for example, Alex Jones, and we were chummy and cordial,
1097060	1100860	or if I had him read some quotations for one of my videos and never challenged him on his
1100860	1105140	ridiculous conspiracy theories, it would, to varying degrees, signal to my audience
1105140	1108900	that I think Alex Jones is someone who can be welcomed into public discourse, and that
1108900	1112000	his ideas may not be as toxic to the public square as they are.
1112000	1115820	And that would work directly against my own goals of pointing out how certain commentators
1115820	1117380	should never be taken seriously.
1117380	1120500	And in the case of Alex Jones, listening to him to learn about the world is a waste of
1120500	1122100	time and brain cells.
1122100	1125760	And I feel like I have to say this again, I'm not saying one should never be friendly
1125760	1127860	with someone who disagrees with you politically.
1127860	1131860	If there was a moderate conservative who disagreed with me on some issues, such as whether or
1131860	1135260	not healthcare should cover dental, that's someone I wouldn't be too bothered being
1135260	1137540	friendly with in public in a performative way.
1137540	1142220	But by being friendly with someone who spreads racist pseudoscience or climate change denialism,
1142220	1145860	or is just a complete asshole, I would be signaling to my audience that their presence
1145860	1150380	in the political discourse, and by extension their extreme content, should be considered,
1150380	1152420	to some degree, acceptable.
1152420	1155780	And that's not something I'm going to do.
