00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.360
Time to have a critical reading about a sitcom from the 90s.

00:10.360 --> 00:17.360
At least I get to talk about it with Jose.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.160
Back in the 90s, one of TV's most successful sitcoms was Home Improvement.

00:22.160 --> 00:28.080
Debuting on September 17, 1991, Home Improvement was an instant hit with audiences, although

00:28.080 --> 00:29.440
never a critical darling.

00:29.440 --> 00:35.160
Throughout its eight-season run, it remained one of the top ten most watched shows on television.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.180
In spite of its broad appeal, or perhaps because of it, the show only received a handful of

00:39.180 --> 00:42.320
award nominations, including eight prime-time Emmys.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.480
The series didn't win a single one, though it did win five technical Emmys for lighting.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.280
With a grunt and a few explosions, Home Improvement found its way into the hearts of millions

00:52.280 --> 00:57.080
of Americans, all tuning in to see what the toolman would do next.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.960
But before this show hit it big, it started with one man in particular, a stand-up comic

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
named Tim Allen.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.140
Allen began performing stand-up in 1978 after he was dared into it by a friend.

01:07.140 --> 01:11.400
He honed his craft over the next decade, including a brief stay in prison where he served just

01:11.400 --> 01:13.760
over two years for possession of cocaine.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.640
He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he became a regular at the comedy store, and

01:17.640 --> 01:20.280
eventually he had a pair of specials on Showtime.

01:20.280 --> 01:24.320
He rose to fame using his signature theme of men struggling to cope with the modern

01:24.320 --> 01:39.360
world, often with grunting.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.720
After being scouted by the heads of ABC, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, Allen was chosen

01:44.720 --> 01:46.920
to be the lead for a sitcom pilot.

01:46.920 --> 01:52.960
He was teamed with TV producers Carmen Finestra, David McFadzian, and Matt Williams.

01:52.960 --> 01:58.360
Williams and McFadzian had recently left the hit sitcom Roseanne, and in spite of past

01:58.360 --> 02:02.960
difficulties working with a stand-up, Williams was won over by talking to Tim Allen about

02:02.960 --> 02:05.480
their days growing up in the Midwest.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.080
Tim Allen's ideas heavily shaped the early concept of the sitcom under its original title,

02:10.080 --> 02:11.320
Hammer Time.

02:11.320 --> 02:17.760
This title, for reasons too legit to quit, had to be dropped, so they stopped Hammer Time

02:17.760 --> 02:19.680
and went with Home Improvement.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.800
Home Improvement is one of those rare sitcoms that seemed to be fully formed from its first

02:23.800 --> 02:28.120
episode, although there was a bit more turbulence getting there than you might imagine.

02:28.120 --> 02:33.240
It would star Tim Allen as Tim Taylor, the host of a local TV home repair show in Detroit,

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
Michigan.

02:34.240 --> 02:48.880
Tim's wife Jill was originally cast to be Frances Fisher.

02:48.880 --> 02:53.400
The producers didn't find her to be a great fit, so she was replaced by Patricia Richardson

02:53.400 --> 02:54.840
while filming the pilot.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.520
Jill's role is to hold the family together at home, all while trying to make a life for

02:58.520 --> 03:10.200
herself that's more than being a homemaker.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.000
She and Tim also have the timeless struggle of holding a marriage together.

03:14.000 --> 03:29.320
Brad, played by Zachary Tybrian, is their oldest son.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.080
Much like his dad, he's into cars and working with his hands, but he's also an athlete.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.280
And in earlier seasons, you can see him with this hair crime.

03:37.280 --> 03:55.600
Brad also inherited Tim's sharp intellect.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.360
Randy is played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the wisecracker of the Taylor boys.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.720
Randy is more into the arts, and in later seasons he has a budding social conscience.

04:04.720 --> 04:18.520
Mark, played by Taron Noah-Smith, is the youngest, and grows from being a small boy

04:18.520 --> 04:22.640
who idolizes his father to being a TV version of a goth.

04:22.640 --> 04:35.920
Also, he's kind of into films towards the end.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.840
Living next door to the Taylor's is their eccentric neighbor, Wilson Wilson.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.840
Although originally played by John Bedford Lloyd, he backed out of the role after learning

04:43.840 --> 04:47.560
he would spend the whole series with his face obscured by a fence.

04:47.560 --> 05:00.280
He was replaced by Earl Hindman.

05:00.280 --> 05:05.200
On the set of Tool Time, Tim was joined by Al Borland, played by Richard Karn.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.920
Originally a completely different character named Glenn, the actor slated to play Tim

05:08.920 --> 05:13.400
Taylor's sidekick, Steven Tobolowsky, was booked on a movie and couldn't make time

05:13.400 --> 05:14.700
to appear on the pilot.

05:14.700 --> 05:19.400
The character of Al was only supposed to be temporary, a one-off character in the pilot,

05:19.400 --> 05:24.780
but Alan liked him so much that Karn became a regular on the series, replacing Tobolowsky.

05:24.780 --> 05:30.220
Al is the competent, sensitive, and kind yin to Tim's incompetent, manic, and abrasive

05:30.220 --> 05:31.220
yang.

05:31.220 --> 05:42.100
He's also a bit of a softy.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.140
That's one hell of a first dateline.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.860
Al's a bit clingy when it comes to women.

05:45.860 --> 05:50.540
The final character was Tool Time's Tool Girl, Lisa, originally to be played by Ashley

05:50.540 --> 05:51.580
Judd.

05:51.580 --> 05:55.980
She was initially a modern girl who would be a foil to Tim's old-fashioned ideas, but

05:55.980 --> 06:00.660
when Judd backed out of the series for a movie career instead, the role of Lisa was dramatically

06:00.660 --> 06:04.460
reduced, and it was given to first-time actress Pamela Anderson.

06:04.460 --> 06:08.820
With the cast assembled, the show was ready to debut, tackling how masculinity would define

06:08.820 --> 06:10.060
itself in the 90s.

06:10.060 --> 06:20.240
It's not the most original premise, but hey, this version has grunting.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.340
The series opens with an introduction to the show within a show, as we see Tim watching

06:24.340 --> 06:25.620
himself on Tool Time.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.660
You know, men, we want a job done right, and we want it done quick.

06:28.660 --> 06:29.660
What do we need?

06:29.660 --> 06:30.660
More power!

06:30.660 --> 06:32.620
Turn right, more power.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.500
We're quickly introduced to our first crisis.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.380
Stay-at-home mother Jill has a job interview.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.100
Tim, this job is important to me.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.460
Aren't you excited about me going back to work?

06:43.460 --> 06:47.860
Yeah, sure, yeah, sure.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.620
Could you maybe work up a little enthusiasm?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.020
I'm sorry, honey.

06:51.020 --> 06:55.060
Gosh, I'm excited that you won't be laying around the house mooching off the boys and

06:55.060 --> 06:56.060
me!

06:56.060 --> 07:00.900
The introduction to Wilson establishes his role as the sage neighbor who offers Tim advice,

07:00.900 --> 07:03.980
most often through the lens of a male-centric reading of history.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.580
The reason you're having problems with your wife is because you don't know who you are

07:08.580 --> 07:09.580
as a man.

07:09.580 --> 07:12.620
I don't have a problem in that area, Wilson.

07:12.620 --> 07:15.620
Not what I mean, Tim.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.100
A lot of men feel lost, confused.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.940
You see, Tim, the Industrial Revolution took the adult male out of the home.

07:22.940 --> 07:27.340
Boys were left without an older man to teach them how to be men.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.740
We need to get back to something more primitive.

07:29.740 --> 07:34.900
You don't need testosterone to be a handyman, but what this show does so well is show us

07:34.900 --> 07:38.900
how mythology can be selectively read to reinforce certain worldviews.

07:38.900 --> 07:43.940
Wilson's job is to cherry-pick parts of history to fit that masculine stereotype.

07:43.940 --> 07:48.460
Although his ideology and personality are often inconsistent, sometimes Wilson will

07:48.460 --> 07:50.060
have a really good take.

07:50.060 --> 07:54.460
But other times, like this episode, not so much.

07:54.460 --> 07:59.340
You see, Tim, it's time for men to reclaim the male's spirit.

07:59.340 --> 08:03.540
The idea of an inherent male-ness that's being trampled on by a modern society is at

08:03.540 --> 08:05.420
the heart of home improvement.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.940
It's early seasons in particular.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.940
You don't have to feel bad.

08:08.940 --> 08:09.940
Don't.

08:09.940 --> 08:10.940
Tell me how to feel.

08:10.940 --> 08:11.940
I'm just saying, if it were me, well, I wouldâ€¦

08:11.940 --> 08:12.940
It's not you, Tim, it's me.

08:12.940 --> 08:17.180
What I mean is you don't have to work.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.860
You don't really want me to work.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.460
I make enough money for both of us.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.300
No, this is not about money.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.340
This is about me having a life outside of this house.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.340
My autonomy.

08:29.340 --> 08:30.340
Your autonomy?

08:30.340 --> 08:31.340
Yeah.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.340
How do you spell that?

08:32.340 --> 08:33.340
Don't start.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.540
While Tim is presented as the prototypical man, a constant through history confronted

08:36.540 --> 08:40.860
by this strange new reality, he's really just an American man whose attitudes are

08:40.860 --> 08:42.380
a few decades out of date.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.340
He's bound to a very specific time and culture.

08:45.340 --> 08:50.300
When Tim grunts, he's signaling that his masculinity is imbued into our DNA, something

08:50.300 --> 08:52.660
primal, something primitive.

08:52.660 --> 08:56.380
The grunting is actually a facade, and that facade will be challenged throughout this

08:56.380 --> 08:57.380
series.

08:57.900 --> 09:02.100
And it's worth noting, as the series goes along, Tim grunts less and less.

09:02.100 --> 09:07.100
I just, I can't tell you how impressed I am by the emotional debt that I've seen

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
in you likeâ€¦

09:08.100 --> 09:13.500
Oh, you know, I've always had this sneaky yet slightly disturbing suspicion that there

09:13.500 --> 09:15.820
actually might be something to me.

09:15.820 --> 09:20.900
Oh, come on, bring me back my old Tim.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
Grunt for me.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.900
Give it a shot.

09:25.900 --> 09:30.900
Oh, I don't know.

09:30.900 --> 09:35.900
Argra, Argra, I don't think it's happening.

09:35.900 --> 09:40.900
It's not happening, honey.

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
Mmm.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.900
Oh, yeah.

09:44.900 --> 09:50.460
The reaction of critics to the first episode wasn't particularly favorable, as Tim Allen

09:50.460 --> 09:52.900
himself would note a decade later.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.900
Critics didn't really like the show that much.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.900
As a matter of fact, I mean, there's a bunch of critics that, you know, it just won't

09:58.900 --> 09:59.900
last.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.900
There was one newspaper, I'm not going to mention the New York Times by name, but theyâ€¦

10:03.900 --> 10:06.900
Oh, that was really weird.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.900
I mean, that's just slipped out.

10:08.900 --> 10:09.900
I'm sorry.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.900
They said the show couldn't go three episodes.

10:12.900 --> 10:17.900
I mean, how many things can this meathead blow up?

10:18.900 --> 10:22.900
But the show was an instant hit with viewers, and would be popular with TV audiences throughout

10:22.900 --> 10:23.900
its entire run.

10:23.900 --> 10:28.900
The idea of women living independently from men comes up a lot in the early seasons, and

10:28.900 --> 10:32.900
since Tim is our focal point for this series, this is presented as a threat to his traditional

10:32.900 --> 10:34.900
role as the grunting patriarch.

10:34.900 --> 10:40.900
In the first season episode, Forever Young, young spelled J-U-N-G, we meet Jill's friend

10:40.900 --> 10:45.900
Karen, played by Betsy Randall, who knows just how to get under Tim's skin.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.900
Oh, well, Tim, I mean, it is a very big, powerful tool.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.900
I see.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.900
You think I've got to have this just to prove my manhood.

10:53.900 --> 10:54.900
You said it.

10:54.900 --> 10:55.900
I didn't say that.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.900
There's one question in particular that makes him squirm, though.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.900
We're a 90s couple.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.900
We share everything 50-50 right down the middle.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.900
Come sit down.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.900
Okay, let me give you a little test.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.900
Jill gets a high-paying executive position.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.900
I like this test already.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.900
Do I get to have a male secretary?

11:12.900 --> 11:13.900
You got him.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.900
That's right, but he looks really cute in jeans.

11:15.900 --> 11:16.900
Perfect.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.900
Okay, so, Tim, should she take this job?

11:19.900 --> 11:20.900
If he's gay.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, absolutely.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.900
The job's in Seattle.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.900
So, it's fine, it's fine.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.900
Well, maybe Jill doesn't want to uproot the kids.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.900
No, no, no, the kids love the idea.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.900
Do we move, Tim?

11:40.900 --> 11:41.900
Karen, this is stupid.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.900
Okay, okay, let me ask you another question.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.900
Tool time goes national, but you have to move to New York.

11:47.900 --> 11:48.900
Do you go?

11:48.900 --> 11:49.900
Yeah, it's my job.

11:49.900 --> 11:54.900
It'd be perfectâ€”if it's okay with Jill.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.900
Oh, so you're saying that your job is more important than hers?

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
She didn't have a job.

11:59.900 --> 12:00.900
Answer the question, Tim.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.900
Do you move to New York or Seattle?

12:02.900 --> 12:05.900
I think a lot depends on where you'll be living.

12:05.900 --> 12:10.900
Unlike most encounters with Wilson where Tim struggles to understand tough concepts,

12:10.900 --> 12:12.900
he gets this episode's theme right away.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.900
Well, Tim, that's just the burden you bear for living in a patriarchal society.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.900
Yeah, patriarchal.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.900
Dominated by men.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.900
Well, I don't know, Tim.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.900
Maybe one day, men and women will learn to share the power.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.900
To cooperate rather than dominate.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.900
Wilson's take here is surprisingly good,

12:32.900 --> 12:35.900
and one that leads to a decent conclusion for the episode,

12:35.900 --> 12:37.900
as Brad is heading out to his first dance,

12:37.900 --> 12:39.900
and Tim offers some botherly advice.

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
Yeah.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.900
But what if I lead with the wrong foot or step on her toes?

12:45.900 --> 12:47.900
Dancing's not about who's leading.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.900
Mom says the man always leads.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.900
Well, when men and women are dancing correctly, no one's leading.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.900
You just move with the music.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.900
You don't know how you get there, but you just get there.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.900
There's no easy solution for how men and women will live together,

13:01.900 --> 13:03.900
but it ends with Brad going on his first date

13:03.900 --> 13:08.900
where his gruff or masculine side is made tamer by his attraction to Jennifer.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.900
You're not down here, will you?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.900
I'll be here in a minute, father!

13:15.900 --> 13:16.900
Father?

13:16.900 --> 13:19.900
The idea here is that men and women can bring out the best in each other,

13:19.900 --> 13:23.900
so it's better that we work together instead of one side dominating the other,

13:23.900 --> 13:27.900
like dancing together and not pretending we know who leads.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.900
The show doesn't pretend it'll be easy, but part of an ongoing process.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.900
There's still problems of men and women

13:34.900 --> 13:36.900
used to their static, essential characteristics,

13:36.900 --> 13:40.900
but offering an opportunity of growth is where the show offers a glimpse of promise.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.900
Older viewers might be thinking,

13:42.900 --> 13:45.900
even for the 90s, this isn't exactly cutting edge.

13:45.900 --> 13:50.900
We saw vestiges of old masculinity being challenged as far back as all in the family.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.900
I'm sure we can all point to shows doing the exact same thing, airing right now.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.900
That's because this discussion about how men and women can share power

13:57.900 --> 14:01.900
isn't something that's gone away, and it won't go away until we figure it out.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.900
It's one of the few parts of home improvement that still has some relevance,

14:04.900 --> 14:06.900
and can still speak to what's happening today,

14:06.900 --> 14:10.900
because in spite of all the progress we've made, misogyny is still a thing,

14:10.900 --> 14:15.900
and we're still trying to build a world where men and women can actually be seen as equal.

14:15.900 --> 14:19.900
But even in episodes where it felt like Tim's character was making some kind of progress,

14:19.900 --> 14:22.900
some of them were like the season 3 episode,

14:22.900 --> 14:24.900
What You See Is What You Get,

14:24.900 --> 14:27.900
where he starts so far back that he comes off as a complete jerk.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.900
You know, I've been researching that article on plastic surgery.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.900
I just interviewed a woman who bought herself a whole new body,

14:34.900 --> 14:38.900
because her husband left her for a younger woman.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.900
They were married 12 years, had four kids.

14:44.900 --> 14:45.900
She made a big mistake.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.900
I'm glad you feel that way.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.900
Yeah.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.900
Had she had this surgery some time ago, she could have saved the marriage.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.900
Tim has another bad reaction when he sees Jill messing around

14:55.900 --> 14:59.900
with a computerized version of herself that would show what she looks like

14:59.900 --> 15:01.900
should she have plastic surgery.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.900
Wow.

15:04.900 --> 15:05.900
What?

15:05.900 --> 15:06.900
Wow.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.900
Are you saying you think I look good like that?

15:14.900 --> 15:16.900
And he keeps digging himself deeper.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
Jill, you gotta see this.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.900
Now I know why they call it the boob tube.

15:25.900 --> 15:26.900
Look at this.

15:27.900 --> 15:33.900
The resolution for this episode is Tim acknowledging that he would like to be with his wife no matter how old she gets.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.900
It's simple, bland, and uninteresting.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.900
Tim's personality seems harsher overall in this episode,

15:40.900 --> 15:46.900
but maybe it's because I went into this episode knowing it was the only one in the entire series where Tim Allen had a writing credit.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.900
It makes me think that if Tim Allen had had a stronger influence on the scripts earlier on,

15:50.900 --> 15:54.900
perhaps writing them himself, he may not have come off so likeable.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.900
We need to take a slight detour from our discussion about the early seasons

15:57.900 --> 16:01.900
to talk about the big change in the show between seasons 2 and 3.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.900
And that's the passing of the Tool Girl tool belt.

16:03.900 --> 16:09.900
Not satisfied with her role on the show, which usually involved a thought-provoking line about temporality.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
Does everybody know what time it is?

16:12.900 --> 16:13.900
Tool time!

16:13.900 --> 16:19.900
Pamela Anderson left home improvement after the second season in pursuit of a more challenging acting role on Baywatch.

16:19.900 --> 16:26.900
The show gave her an increase in lines and plot threads, along with an even bigger increase in time spent running in slow motion.

16:26.900 --> 16:31.900
Anderson would be replaced by Debbie Dunning in the first episode of season 3.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.900
Our new Tool Girl would be named Heidi.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.900
This wasn't Dunning's first appearance on the show, though,

16:37.900 --> 16:43.900
as she played a completely different character in the episode Overactive Glance in the second season.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.900
In that episode, her name was, uh...

16:48.900 --> 16:51.900
Yeah, that.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.900
Dunning would have a larger role than Anderson as the series progressed,

16:55.900 --> 17:00.900
having a handful of plot lines dedicated to her character and more lines throughout the episodes.

17:00.900 --> 17:06.900
And we also got a neat little Tool Girl crossover in season 6 when Pamela Anderson came back for an episode.

17:06.900 --> 17:11.900
I think Pamela Anderson had more lines in this episode than the entirety of the first two seasons.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.900
In the seventh season, Dunning would finally get her name in the opening credits of the series,

17:15.900 --> 17:19.900
but her role was never as expansive as any of the other regular characters on the series.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.900
All that being said, she does a good job with what she's given,

17:22.900 --> 17:27.900
and if they were looking to replace one gorgeous woman with another, they definitely succeeded.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.900
Back to the early seasons.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.900
A major concern for the early seasons is how Tim struggles with raising his three sons.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.900
There are a number of episodes that deal with this,

17:36.900 --> 17:42.900
though one of the more notable ones is rights and wrongs of passage in which Brad enters a rebellious phase.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.900
You are beyond grounded. No TV, no seeing your friends, no talking on the phone.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.900
No monster truck rally.

17:48.900 --> 17:49.900
That's not fair.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.900
What do you mean it's not fair? I stick up for you so you can go,

17:51.900 --> 17:53.900
and what do you end up doing coming on with a cop?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.900
I'm going to the truck rally.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.900
You're going to bed.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.900
You can't tell me what to do.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.900
Yes, I can tell you what to do. That's my job.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.900
Now go on upstairs.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.900
And you can forget about those Fordzilla tickets because I've given him somebody else.

18:07.900 --> 18:08.900
Can I have a nilly?

18:08.900 --> 18:10.900
Oh, shut up!

18:10.900 --> 18:13.900
Tim gives us one of his not-so-good takes to explain it.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.900
But unfortunately, in our industrial society, we don't have these rituals.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.900
We prolong adolescence beyond the biological indications of manhood,

18:21.900 --> 18:24.900
confusing the child as well as the parent.

18:24.900 --> 18:28.900
The idea of a teenager acting out being a product of the 19th century

18:28.900 --> 18:32.900
would be news to anyone who's read or seen Romeo and Juliet.

18:32.900 --> 18:37.900
So I don't really buy his explanation as to why we're getting a Breaking Brad episode.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.900
You like that's a pretty good pun, right?

18:39.900 --> 18:42.900
Breaking Brad? No? No.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.900
Tim's eventual solution is to give Brad a taste of manhood.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.900
Or at least, manhood as Tim defines it.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.900
What are you trying to do?

18:49.900 --> 18:52.900
I've got the tailpipe set up for the exhaust system.

18:52.900 --> 18:53.900
I could do it.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.900
Oh, this is man stuff.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.900
You've got to do all the torture and flame and...

19:01.900 --> 19:03.900
Why don't you give it a shot?

19:04.900 --> 19:07.900
We see another example of the importance of masculine coding

19:07.900 --> 19:10.900
in Growing Up in Bell Bottom Blues,

19:10.900 --> 19:13.900
where Brad gets in trouble for fighting another kid.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.900
You're grounded three days, you know that.

19:15.900 --> 19:16.900
That's not fair.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.900
Why did you hit this boy?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.900
Because he was making fun of me.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.900
That's not a reason to punch anybody.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.900
Why are you angry at me? It's your fault.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.900
B-B, back the truck up.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.900
Why is it my fault?

19:29.900 --> 19:31.900
This morning when you dropped me off at school,

19:31.900 --> 19:34.900
you hugged me in front of all my friends.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.900
Once again, Wilson gives us a bad take.

19:37.900 --> 19:38.900
It's a funny thing, you know.

19:38.900 --> 19:39.900
He doesn't want me to touch him,

19:39.900 --> 19:41.900
but he'll still wrestle in Rough House with me.

19:41.900 --> 19:42.900
Well, that's because throughout history,

19:42.900 --> 19:43.900
men have been more comfortable

19:43.900 --> 19:46.900
expressing affection through combative gestures.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.900
Men have shared affectionate gestures,

19:48.900 --> 19:51.900
like hugging and holding hands in plenty of cultures,

19:51.900 --> 19:54.900
but in this episode, Wilson is cherry-picking from history.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.900
Not that Wilson is entirely wrong

19:56.900 --> 19:58.900
with his examples of handshakes and salutes,

19:58.900 --> 20:01.900
but the point is Wilson is only sharing one side of the story

20:01.900 --> 20:04.900
that holds up a specific vision of manhood.

20:04.900 --> 20:09.900
The resolution of the Brad plot has Tim agreeing not to hug him anymore.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.900
Remember, I'm your father. I'm not a man.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.900
Right, Dad.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.900
Anyway, I promise I won't hug in front of your buddies anymore.

20:18.900 --> 20:19.900
Okay.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.900
But I'm still gonna say I love you.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.900
Oh, Dad, that's ten times worse than hugging.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.900
It seems absurd to bow to this social pressure.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.900
There's nothing wrong with a father hugging his son,

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
especially a son who's still in grade school.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
But what can be read here instead is

20:33.900 --> 20:36.900
how Tim's parenting can't escape the demands of a society

20:36.900 --> 20:39.900
that has certain expectations of men,

20:39.900 --> 20:42.900
even when Tim himself thinks they're silly.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.900
So it's not that Tim is a bad father,

20:44.900 --> 20:47.900
but rather a victim of the intense pressure put on boys

20:47.900 --> 20:50.900
to behave within a certain masculine ideal.

20:50.900 --> 20:51.900
And that ideal, in this case,

20:51.900 --> 20:54.900
would be not to express affection physically.

20:54.900 --> 20:58.900
A less conventional father-son dynamic is Tim's relationship with Randy.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
Seen in To Build or Not to Build,

21:00.900 --> 21:03.900
Randy doesn't take to the workshop projects his brothers do

21:03.900 --> 21:05.900
when they're making Mother's Day gifts for Jill.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.900
Look, Dad, I'll just buy Mom something.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.900
I'll buy her something.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.900
I don't like doing this stuff.

21:12.900 --> 21:13.900
Yeah, you'll like it.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.900
Dad, I didn't want to do this in the first place.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.900
Oh, and I just finished it for you.

21:17.900 --> 21:18.900
Great.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.900
And tellingly, the episode seen with Wilson

21:22.900 --> 21:24.900
doesn't have him doling out classical wisdom

21:24.900 --> 21:26.900
on what it means to be a man.

21:26.900 --> 21:27.900
This is a new problem,

21:27.900 --> 21:31.900
something that the traditional masculinity that Wilson espouses,

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
which is really just a masculine clichÃ©,

21:33.900 --> 21:34.900
can't really cope with.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.900
Instead, we see Wilson and his mother exchange a few lines

21:37.900 --> 21:40.900
about the importance of a gift's spirit.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.900
After all, it was Pierre Cornet,

21:42.900 --> 21:44.900
the noted French playwright who wrote,

21:44.900 --> 21:48.900
I am in the habit of looking not so much to the nature of the gift

21:48.900 --> 21:50.900
as to the spirit in which it is given.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.900
Oh, that's beautiful.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.900
Excuse me, son, are you sure it was Cornet?

21:55.900 --> 21:58.900
I believe it was Robert Louis Stevenson.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.900
Well, by golly, Mom, I think you're right.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.900
Pierre Cornet wrote,

22:04.900 --> 22:07.900
the manner of giving is worth more than the gift.

22:07.900 --> 22:11.900
It shows us an example of perhaps a more useful reading of history

22:11.900 --> 22:14.900
and ancient wisdom by dispensing with the gender coding

22:14.900 --> 22:17.900
and instead getting to the heart of a message.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.900
While Brad's path to manhood is more conventional,

22:20.900 --> 22:23.900
Randy shows us that there's more than one way to make a man

22:23.900 --> 22:25.900
and that the idea of manhood is more expansive

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
than the narrow vision of Wilson's definitions

22:27.900 --> 22:30.900
filled with essentialist commentary on what a man is.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.900
The passage from boyhood to manhood

22:32.900 --> 22:35.900
is one that creates a lot of frustration and anxiety,

22:35.900 --> 22:37.900
and growing up, it's only natural for a boy to have questions

22:37.900 --> 22:39.900
on what it means to become a man.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.900
What makes the old story shared by Wilson

22:41.900 --> 22:44.900
and modern masculinity represented in Tim so appealing

22:44.900 --> 22:48.900
is that it reduces the confusion of figuring out what it means to be a man.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.900
There's something comforting about a whole set of behaviors

22:51.900 --> 22:54.900
and customs designed for men to inherit when they come of age.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.900
It takes a lot of the difficulty out of growing up

22:56.900 --> 22:58.900
when someone has a path charted out for you.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.900
But what if you're like Randy and you don't fit into that mold?

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
How do you find your way towards manhood?

23:03.900 --> 23:06.900
It seems that the definition of what it means to be a man

23:06.900 --> 23:08.900
needs to expand to include more types of people.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.900
In the context of home improvement,

23:10.900 --> 23:12.900
that means allowing manhood to expand

23:12.900 --> 23:15.900
beyond sports and power tools to include magic tricks

23:15.900 --> 23:17.900
and performing in school plays.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.900
This is still a show from the 90s, though,

23:19.900 --> 23:21.900
and it can only get us so far.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.900
It's broadening the definition of what it means to be a man,

23:23.900 --> 23:27.900
but it's still very much only representing the cis white hetero perspective.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.900
Non-white men are never a part of the principal cast,

23:30.900 --> 23:31.900
and neither are gay men.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.900
The closest glimpse we even get of trans men

23:33.900 --> 23:35.900
are some less-than-enlightened jokes.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.900
So what's more important than the show's banal message

23:37.900 --> 23:40.900
of saying that it's okay for a boy to want to perform magic tricks

23:40.900 --> 23:42.900
is the deeper meaning behind it.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.900
Rather than exclude people who don't fit the typical definition of manhood,

23:45.900 --> 23:47.900
it's better to expand that definition

23:47.900 --> 23:50.900
and celebrate the differences we see around us.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.900
Now let's talk about getting hit in the dick.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.900
Another big part of this series is Tim getting hurt.

23:56.900 --> 23:57.900
A lot.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.900
Pretty much every episode of Home Improvement includes a scene

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
where some home repair project goes wrong

24:01.900 --> 24:04.900
and Tim usually gets hurt.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.900
Nothing ever too serious, but, you know, we see that he feels pain.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
In the series' first clip show,

24:09.900 --> 24:12.900
a two-parter titled Tool Time After Dark,

24:12.900 --> 24:15.900
there were no clips shown of the Taylor family drama.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.900
Instead, we saw a bunch of random Tool Time episodes

24:18.900 --> 24:22.900
featuring Tim getting hurt in a variety of stunts.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.900
The slapstick elements of humor for this series

24:24.900 --> 24:26.900
are very much baked into its DNA,

24:26.900 --> 24:29.900
which makes complete sense because slapstick is a type of humor

24:29.900 --> 24:31.900
particularly suited to men.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.900
Let's talk humor theory for a moment.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
The reason slapstick works

24:35.900 --> 24:37.900
is because it takes the violation of a norm,

24:37.900 --> 24:40.900
in this case, a person suffering physical harm

24:40.900 --> 24:42.900
and or being embarrassed,

24:42.900 --> 24:44.900
and presents it in a way that's benign.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.900
This is known as the benign violation theory.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.900
And the reason it's benign is because it's happening to a man.

24:49.900 --> 24:52.900
The assumption here is that men are big and strong

24:52.900 --> 24:55.900
so they can handle the punishment and pain of something going awry

24:55.900 --> 24:58.900
whereas women are fragile and need to be protected.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.900
While Home Improvement may question what it means to be a man in the 90s,

25:01.900 --> 25:04.900
it never backs away from the idea that there is an archetype of what a man is

25:04.900 --> 25:06.900
and that includes being big and strong,

25:06.900 --> 25:09.900
or at the very least, bigger and stronger than women.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.900
That's why whenever things go wrong on Tool Time,

25:11.900 --> 25:14.900
the victim is usually Tim, occasionally Al,

25:14.900 --> 25:16.900
and once in a while a male guest star.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.900
At no point are Lisa or Heidi ever in danger,

25:19.900 --> 25:22.900
much in the way Jill is rarely in danger either,

25:22.900 --> 25:25.900
because slapstick is about upholding certain gender roles.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
When you think slapstick, you'll think of something like

25:27.900 --> 25:30.900
The Three Stooges or Charlie Chaplin.

25:30.900 --> 25:31.900
Typically it's a man.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.900
There aren't many women who engage in slapstick comedy.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.900
Partially from the assumption that it's not funny when it happens to women

25:37.900 --> 25:39.900
because women are more likely to get hurt.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.900
In the early seasons, one of the three lines in each episode

25:47.900 --> 25:49.900
was Tim building his hot rod in the garage.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.900
The significance behind the hot rod is summed up nicely

25:52.900 --> 25:54.900
in this scene in the Season 2 episode

25:54.900 --> 25:56.900
where there's a will, there's a way.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.900
God, it was a hardtop convertible. Those were tough to get.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.900
You can't find them. Boy, that was a great car.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.900
You know, and then he died.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.900
Uncle Harry took the car and he sold it.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
We'd never seen it again.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.900
And that was the best thing I ever remember about my dad.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.900
Season 4 capitalizes on the setup of these earlier episodes

26:28.900 --> 26:31.900
to hit the father theme particularly hard,

26:31.900 --> 26:34.900
specifically the search for an absent father.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.900
In He Ain't Heavy, He's Just Irresponsible,

26:37.900 --> 26:40.900
we meet one of Tim's brothers, Marty, played by William O'Leary.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.900
A new father, Marty is considering running away

26:43.900 --> 26:46.900
from his struggling marriage and newborn twin daughters.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.900
He eventually decides not to abandon his family.

26:58.900 --> 27:02.900
We hit the father theme again in My Dinner with Wilson,

27:02.900 --> 27:05.900
where Wilson, who's thinking of moving to Ecuador,

27:05.900 --> 27:07.900
would be leaving Tim without a father figure.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.900
Of course, Wilson decides to stay.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.900
No, no, I think I'm gonna stay right here.

27:34.900 --> 27:39.900
In Ye Olde Shop Teacher, Tim's high school shop teacher comes to visit

27:39.900 --> 27:43.900
and Tim has to deal with seeing one of his adoptive father figures becoming older.

27:43.900 --> 27:47.900
And Jill's rarely seen father visits at Christmas in

27:47.900 --> 27:50.900
Twas the Night Before Chaos, where she has to learn how to connect with him.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.900
And this was all in the first half of the season.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.900
That's why this is the daddy season to me,

27:56.900 --> 28:00.900
because so much of it was trapped in this search for a positive father figure.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.900
And that's outside the usual father-son dynamic between Tim and his sons.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.900
The hot rod, symbolizing Tim's relationship with his dad,

28:07.900 --> 28:09.900
is the subject of,

28:09.900 --> 28:11.900
Brother, can you spare a hot rod?

28:11.900 --> 28:15.900
In which Tim decides to sell the hot rod to pizza entrepreneur Doug O'Brien,

28:15.900 --> 28:20.900
played by Bruce McGill, whose pizza chain, by the way, is named Papa Mia.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.900
Although Tim is just fine selling his beloved hot rod,

28:23.900 --> 28:26.900
the family, and Brad in particular, don't take it well.

28:41.900 --> 28:44.900
Considering how Tim felt about his uncle selling his dad's hot rod,

28:44.900 --> 28:46.900
maybe he should have seen this coming.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.900
When Tim and Brad go to O'Brien to try and get the hot rod back,

28:49.900 --> 28:51.900
we find out what that car meant to him.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.900
Unsurprisingly, it involves his father.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.900
Tim and Brad find an old 46 Ford converter,

28:57.900 --> 29:23.900
Tim and Brad find an old 46 Ford convertible,

29:23.900 --> 29:25.900
that becomes a new project for the father and son.

29:25.900 --> 29:29.900
It reframes the relationship, moving it from the finished product of a car,

29:29.900 --> 29:31.900
and instead highlighting what matters most,

29:31.900 --> 29:33.900
the time they spent building it together.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.900
The search for a father is more than just the presence of a man in one's life,

29:38.900 --> 29:41.900
but rather the experiences that a positive father figure brings with it.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.900
Much of home improvement assumes that manhood and fatherhood are linked.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.900
Not insofar that one's genes must be passed down,

29:48.900 --> 29:51.900
but instead being a positive father figure in the life of a young boy,

29:51.900 --> 29:53.900
guiding them to manhood.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.900
Search for a father figure prevalent in this season,

29:55.900 --> 29:58.900
shows that this isn't strictly a challenge for children,

29:58.900 --> 30:00.900
but rather something men need throughout their lives.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.900
A connection to these moments in their past,

30:02.900 --> 30:05.900
and new mentors and guides for the ones still to come.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.900
It's also a role not to be shirked off or ignored.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.900
It carries with it a pretty heavy burden.

30:10.900 --> 30:14.900
And I appreciate the idea that fathers and sons can come in many forms.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.900
Speaking of father figures,

30:16.900 --> 30:19.900
let's talk about the series regular who is like a father figure,

30:19.900 --> 30:21.900
Wilson Wilson.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.900
What's up with this guy?

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
We've already looked at how inconsistent his advice is,

30:25.900 --> 30:28.900
but aside from his role as wisdom giver in this series,

30:28.900 --> 30:30.900
who is he as a character?

30:30.900 --> 30:32.900
In the season one episode,

30:32.900 --> 30:34.900
Birds of a Feather Flock to tailor,

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900
Tim and Jill are having some marital strife,

30:36.900 --> 30:38.900
and then after having made up,

30:38.900 --> 30:40.900
hang out in a small bar and dance.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.900
Here's the weird thing about this scene.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.900
Wilson isn't in it until this part right here.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.900
The rest of the time, you only see this mysterious guy in the background,

30:49.900 --> 30:51.900
reading a newspaper.

30:51.900 --> 30:52.900
He has no lines,

30:52.900 --> 30:54.900
and the only other time we see this bar in the episode,

30:54.900 --> 30:56.900
Wilson isn't in it.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.900
So it's not like this is his regular haunt.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.900
The only answer here is that Wilson is stalking the Taylor family.

31:02.900 --> 31:06.900
How else can we explain Wilson suddenly showing up in the wilderness

31:06.900 --> 31:09.900
to offer Tim some advice when the family goes camping,

31:09.900 --> 31:11.900
in the middle of winter?

31:11.900 --> 31:14.900
Or how does Wilson show up in the hospital later on

31:14.900 --> 31:16.900
when, again, Tim needs some advice

31:16.900 --> 31:20.900
and Wilson is there delivering a baby as a midwife?

31:20.900 --> 31:22.900
In the season three episode,

31:22.900 --> 31:24.900
Twas the Blight Before Christmas,

31:24.900 --> 31:26.900
we see Wilson once again stalking the Taylors,

31:26.900 --> 31:28.900
this time at church.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.900
He doesn't have any lines in this scene.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.900
None of the other characters acknowledge him,

31:32.900 --> 31:35.900
and this time the camera doesn't even settle on him.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.900
Watching this show as a kid,

31:37.900 --> 31:39.900
I never noticed he was there.

31:39.900 --> 31:40.900
But he was.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.900
He was there.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.900
Imagine living next to this guy.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.900
Sure, there's a 50-50 chance he'll hit you with some wisdom,

31:47.900 --> 31:49.900
but the rest of the time he'll have this weird,

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
essentialist, male-centric reading of history.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.900
In the season four episode,

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
Wilson's Girlfriend,

31:54.900 --> 31:57.900
Wilson finally has the chance to be more than an eccentric neighbor

31:57.900 --> 31:59.900
and to get some love on the regular.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.900
Jill introduces him to her professor.

32:01.900 --> 32:03.900
Well, nice to meet you.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.900
You too. Jill has told me so much about you.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.900
It's all been great.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
Well, I am flattered.

32:08.900 --> 32:10.900
The only thing she didn't tell me was your last name.

32:10.900 --> 32:11.900
It's Wilson.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.900
Oh, I thought that was your first name.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.900
Wilson is my first name.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.900
We soon learn that Wilson, for all his sagacity,

32:20.900 --> 32:22.900
can't seem to share his feelings.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.900
He's more into ideas.

32:24.900 --> 32:25.900
Oh, my, my, my,

32:25.900 --> 32:27.900
I must be displaying the symptomatic behavior

32:27.900 --> 32:29.900
of the classic male emotional distancer

32:29.900 --> 32:32.900
precipitating her to over-function in the relationship,

32:32.900 --> 32:35.900
therefore causing deep-seated resentment.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.900
So knock it off.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.900
Tim, I don't take easily the personal or emotional revelation.

32:42.900 --> 32:43.900
No guy does.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.900
Opening up emotion is just a horrible thing women make us do.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.900
What we're seeing here is the patriarchal standard-bearer

32:49.900 --> 32:52.900
acknowledging that having a whole other side of humanity introduced to him,

32:52.900 --> 32:56.900
in this case from a woman, makes him a more complete being.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.900
Wilson is effectively removing the mask of masculinity

32:59.900 --> 33:01.900
represented by this little bit of imagery.

33:01.900 --> 33:05.900
And I really like this scene because it gets to the heart of Wilson as a character.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.900
Well, my family never really talked much about personal matters,

33:09.900 --> 33:12.900
especially my father, Wilson Wilson Sr.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.900
What was he like?

33:17.900 --> 33:22.900
He was a scientist who didn't put too much stock in emotions.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.900
Must have been very difficult to grow up with a man like that.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.900
Mm, it was.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.900
You know, I loved my father and

33:30.900 --> 33:34.900
it always hurt me when he kept me at a distance.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.900
And the last thing I ever wanted was to be like him.

33:38.900 --> 33:42.900
The primitive man believed that the air he breathed had magic powers.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.900
I'm not bored.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.900
And when a man and a woman kissed,

33:50.900 --> 33:52.900
it was as if their souls were mingling.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.900
Wilson's job on this show is to dispense wisdom,

33:55.900 --> 33:58.900
all while keeping the lower half of his face hidden.

33:58.900 --> 34:02.900
Wisdom, particularly related to feelings, is often the subject of what he says,

34:02.900 --> 34:05.900
but he never reveals anything of his inner self.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.900
While Wilson knows the value of both,

34:07.900 --> 34:10.900
he struggles to escape the conditioning of his childhood.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.900
Wilson's covered mouth is a metaphor.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.900
The covered mouth is a gate, carefully letting the wisdom out

34:15.900 --> 34:17.900
and keeping the feelings inside.

34:17.900 --> 34:21.900
When he welcomes with a kiss, he's welcoming her into that space.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.900
This would have been a great moment to let everyone see Wilson's face,

34:24.900 --> 34:27.900
but sadly the gag would never be dropped,

34:27.900 --> 34:31.900
and poor Oral Hinman, who does a fantastic job as Wilson, by the way,

34:31.900 --> 34:33.900
has to continue standing behind it.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.900
They even make him hold a stupid little mini-fence

34:36.900 --> 34:39.900
when he has to do his curtain call at the end of each episode.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.900
One lovely bit of subtext in this episode is that

34:42.900 --> 34:46.900
Professor manages to be both rich in ideas and emotional expression,

34:46.900 --> 34:49.900
whereas she's learned how to adopt traits that are traditionally coded as masculine

34:49.900 --> 34:51.900
and become a more complete person.

34:51.900 --> 34:56.900
Wilson is a victim of a society that has a rigid view of how men are supposed to behave.

34:56.900 --> 35:01.900
While, yes, the series is still trapped in the narrow gender binary,

35:01.900 --> 35:04.900
it at least acknowledges the profound impact society can have

35:04.900 --> 35:06.900
on how those binaries are expressed,

35:06.900 --> 35:09.900
almost as if they're on a spectrum or something,

35:09.900 --> 35:11.900
and that little line separating them is arbitrary.

35:11.900 --> 35:15.900
Wilson may be a bit of a creeper, but he has the capacity to grow.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.900
Here he is in this Season 6 episode,

35:17.900 --> 35:20.900
Burnin' Love, with a frightening revelation.

35:20.900 --> 35:24.900
We were in fourth grade, I guess we were about nine years of age,

35:24.900 --> 35:29.900
and we were inseparable until one day at the playground we had a big fight.

35:29.900 --> 35:30.900
About what?

35:30.900 --> 35:32.900
Well, I was a big believer in laissez-faire capitalism,

35:32.900 --> 35:34.900
and she was a neo-Marxist.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.900
Although this isn't confirmed in the show, I like to think,

35:38.900 --> 35:40.900
much like learning to share his feelings,

35:40.900 --> 35:44.900
Wilson grew out of believing in silly ideas like laissez-faire capitalism.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.900
I don't have all that much to say about the fifth season.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.900
One small thing is how Tim grew as a character

35:53.900 --> 35:56.900
best exemplified in this scene from the episode

35:56.900 --> 35:58.900
When Harry Kept Dolores.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.900
You're evolving.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.900
No, I'm not, and you take that back.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.900
It's true, you are.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.900
No, no, no, no, you're just saying that

36:06.900 --> 36:09.900
because you want to believe that you married a deep guy.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.900
No, I don't.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.900
Yes.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.900
Can't you see, you're just trying to prove that you married

36:13.900 --> 36:15.900
somebody different than your father, honey?

36:15.900 --> 36:18.900
Wow.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.900
What?

36:21.900 --> 36:26.900
That was an even more profound insight than the one that you had about Harry.

36:26.900 --> 36:30.900
I can't stop myself. What's happening to me?

36:30.900 --> 36:33.900
You're becoming insightful.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.900
Oh, no.

36:35.900 --> 36:38.900
But really, this was a season of one episode

36:38.900 --> 36:41.900
and one that'll give me time to talk about another major player in the series,

36:41.900 --> 36:45.900
the middle child, Randy, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.900
If you were a girl in the 90s, it's pretty likely you had a crush on this boy.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.900
He was on the cover of everything from Tiger Beat to Bob,

36:52.900 --> 36:55.900
typically with the affectionate acronym JTT.

36:55.900 --> 36:58.900
He really looked like he would be the breakout star of Home Improvement,

36:58.900 --> 37:01.900
and for a while, he absolutely was.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.900
He was on talk shows, he was at WrestleMania,

37:04.900 --> 37:08.900
but he's perhaps best known for playing young Simba in The Lion King,

37:08.900 --> 37:10.900
one of several movies he starred in.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.900
Oh, sorry. I've never been a Lion King before.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.900
Well, I have.

37:16.900 --> 37:20.900
You know, I gotta tell you, it's a tough gig.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.900
Everyone expects you to be king.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.900
Playing the wise-cracking Randy,

37:24.900 --> 37:27.900
Thomas had the chance to show off his great comedic timing,

37:27.900 --> 37:32.900
but as the seasons wore on, it became apparent that he had a lot of range for an actor so young,

37:32.900 --> 37:37.900
and so he increasingly got larger roles when it came to any drama surrounding the Taylor Boys.

37:37.900 --> 37:42.900
But it was the season 5 episode, The Longest Day, that really showed what he could do.

37:42.900 --> 37:46.900
This is one of those classic, very special episodes

37:46.900 --> 37:49.900
sitcoms love to do when tackling heavier subjects.

37:49.900 --> 37:55.900
In this one, a doctor's visit has revealed a mysterious lump on Randy's throat that may be cancerous.

37:55.900 --> 37:59.900
Tim and Jill try to keep it secret from him, but he finds out.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.900
I can't believe you guys gave me so good.

38:01.900 --> 38:08.900
You know, if I didn't know better, I think I was dying.

38:08.900 --> 38:12.900
That was a joke, guys.

38:12.900 --> 38:16.900
It was a joke. I didn't get it at first, but I just got it. I got it.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.900
Let your mom make sure she got it.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.900
What's going on?

38:22.900 --> 38:26.900
Is this of anything to do with that blood test I took yesterday?

38:26.900 --> 38:31.900
Okay, yeah, but there's nothing for you to worry about.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.900
Do you remember when the doctor was feeling your neck yesterday?

38:34.900 --> 38:35.900
Yeah.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.900
Well, she felt some swelling.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.900
As they wait for test results from the doctor to come in,

38:42.900 --> 38:46.900
Tim finds out Randy went missing after school, leading to...

39:12.900 --> 39:15.900
Randy's kind of lumps can be malignant.

39:15.900 --> 39:20.900
Randy, look, the chances of this lump being malignant are next to nothing.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.900
How could you not tell me about this?

39:22.900 --> 39:24.900
Because I didn't want you freaking out, okay?

39:24.900 --> 39:28.900
Oh, so instead I read about it on a computer sitting in the school library all by myself.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.900
Your mom and I, that's the last thing we wanted you to do.

39:31.900 --> 39:35.900
I'm really sorry about that, and she will be too, okay?

39:35.900 --> 39:38.900
Why does this bad stuff always have to happen to me?

39:38.900 --> 39:42.900
Well, bad stuff happens everywhere. Bad stuff happens to me all the time.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.900
Yeah, but you cause it.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.900
I know you're scared, you know. I know how you feel.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.900
No, you don't.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.900
I don't want to die at that.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.900
Oh, come on, man. You're not going to die?

40:06.900 --> 40:09.900
Even if you had cancer, which you don't, you do not have that.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
It's a treatable kind, okay?

40:17.900 --> 40:19.900
Hey, come on, come on.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.900
We'll beat this thing, no matter what it is, you know?

40:22.900 --> 40:24.900
I'm not letting anything happen to you.

40:24.900 --> 40:28.900
This scene ends with Tim promising something he can't possibly deliver.

40:28.900 --> 40:33.900
And in many ways, Randy feels like he's left fate and medicine to decide what happens next.

40:33.900 --> 40:37.900
This being a very special episode on a sitcom, things end up working out by the end,

40:37.900 --> 40:44.900
and we find out Randy doesn't have cancer, but instead a thyroid condition that can be treated with a daily pill.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.900
The episode is pretty standard stuff, albeit with some questionable parenting from the tailors

40:49.900 --> 40:52.900
keeping important medical information from their son.

40:52.900 --> 40:56.900
It's most remembered, at least by me, for Thomas's performance,

40:56.900 --> 41:00.900
one that would make me assume he had a bright future in the acting world ahead of him.

41:00.900 --> 41:05.900
The reason we don't talk about Jonathan Taylor Thomas much these days is because in the early 2000s,

41:05.900 --> 41:07.900
he stepped away from the world of Hollywood.

41:07.900 --> 41:12.900
It wasn't the first time he chose to leave the spotlight, though, as we'll be seeing in a later season.

41:18.900 --> 41:23.900
We saw some growth in these seasons as the boys start dealing with more adult problems,

41:23.900 --> 41:26.900
like getting a part-time job or learning how to drive.

41:26.900 --> 41:31.900
The show gradually shifts away from telling stories about becoming men and more about becoming adults,

41:31.900 --> 41:35.900
albeit with some masculine coding thrown in here and there.

41:35.900 --> 41:40.900
What's more interesting, though, is when Tim runs into examples of his old-fashioned manly advice getting out of hand,

41:40.900 --> 41:43.900
and he effectively has to deprogram it out of his sons.

41:43.900 --> 41:49.900
In the Season 6 episode, The Feminine Mistake, we find out Brad's girlfriend is waiting on him hand and foot.

41:57.900 --> 42:07.900
And then we get hit with some bio truths.

42:16.900 --> 42:20.900
One of the core concepts of the show is the confrontation between two ideas,

42:20.900 --> 42:23.900
that men have biological urges that are tamed by society,

42:23.900 --> 42:27.900
and that the definition of a man should be broader than this supposed biological truth.

42:27.900 --> 42:32.900
The wisdom from Wilson in this one reveals that Wilson is apparently a feminist.

42:54.900 --> 42:59.900
Wilson being a feminist is played for laughs, tellingly, because it's not something people would think about him.

42:59.900 --> 43:04.900
Even if we'd grant Wilson his feminism stripes, he's talking about the movement from the 60s

43:04.900 --> 43:08.900
and doesn't have much to say about feminism in the 90s, which is a completely different wave.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.900
Things go worse with Brad.

43:23.900 --> 43:46.900
Brad has to be yanked away from classic masculinity by Tim,

43:46.900 --> 43:50.900
a change from Tim, who would typically try to reinforce it.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.900
This episode is very much about how modern men understand feminism,

43:53.900 --> 43:56.900
and can use it to correct behavior that exploits women.

43:59.900 --> 44:01.900
He's still acting as a feminist here.

44:01.900 --> 44:04.900
I'm going to use a term that I've been trying to avoid until now,

44:04.900 --> 44:07.900
but I hope those of you in the audience who are resistant to it are ready.

44:07.900 --> 44:10.900
This is an example of the danger of toxic masculinity,

44:10.900 --> 44:15.900
and how men can be the best champions to protect the next generation from falling prey to it.

44:15.900 --> 44:19.900
That's why traditional gender roles and norms need to be challenged.

44:19.900 --> 44:24.900
And when someone argues to lock those norms into place and not let people violate them,

44:24.900 --> 44:27.900
they're also arguing to retain this same toxicity.

44:27.900 --> 44:31.900
The point is to hold onto the good and discard the bad,

44:31.900 --> 44:35.900
and that can only be done by challenging what it means to be a man.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.900
A couple of decades earlier, Brad's behavior would have seemed far less egregious,

44:39.900 --> 44:44.900
but by questioning that norm, Angela is given the opportunity to be more than a sandwich dispenser,

44:44.900 --> 44:48.900
and Brad is given the opportunity to not be a piece of trash.

44:48.900 --> 44:52.900
Women can't be solely responsible for demanding respect from problematic men.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.900
Men have to police each other too, particularly fathers raising sons.

44:56.900 --> 44:59.900
Although Tim doesn't become entirely enlightened himself,

44:59.900 --> 45:04.900
he does seem to understand that his attitudes towards women shapes the way his sons see them as well.

45:04.900 --> 45:11.900
So it's not that Brad was defaulting to treating women like a servant because of some biological programming.

45:11.900 --> 45:15.900
It was that he was raised to see women that way based on the behavior of his father,

45:15.900 --> 45:18.900
and more broadly, the way women are seen in society.

45:18.900 --> 45:23.900
In response to losing the boys to adulthood, Tim expresses wanting another child in

45:23.900 --> 45:28.900
Say Good Night, Gracie, after spending the day watching his niece, Gracie.

45:28.900 --> 45:46.900
Tim having spent much of his life raising boys is ready for a change,

45:46.900 --> 45:51.900
and what I like about this episode is how caring for a girl allows him to broaden his perspective.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.900
Tim felt like he had to be masculine for his boys, creating a feedback loop.

45:55.900 --> 45:58.900
He emphasized his masculinity for their sake,

45:58.900 --> 46:03.900
and his presumption of their need for a masculine figure made him dig deeper into that persona.

46:03.900 --> 46:07.900
A daughter offers him the chance to access traits he would typically consider feminine,

46:07.900 --> 46:11.900
letting Tim explore more of himself and who he can be.

46:26.900 --> 46:30.900
This isn't to say that Tim wasn't always into masculine things before having boys,

46:30.900 --> 46:35.900
but rather having to raise boys into men, he accessed that part of himself more frequently,

46:35.900 --> 46:40.900
creating a cycle of behavior, where that behavior was continuously reinforced.

46:40.900 --> 46:43.900
Also, this episode is a funny joke about Buzz Lightyear,

46:43.900 --> 46:48.900
and it was around this time that Tim Allen played the character in the recently released Toy Story movie.

46:48.900 --> 46:59.900
Somewhere behind the scene notes for season 6 and 7 was some controversy over Tim Allen being arrested for a DUI.

46:59.900 --> 47:06.900
By controversy, I mean that audiences reacted to this news by continuing to watch the show.

47:06.900 --> 47:11.900
Allen going to rehab at the end of season 7 similarly didn't seem to turn many people away.

47:11.900 --> 47:15.900
It's strange how controversy just seemed to slide off Allen's back.

47:15.900 --> 47:20.900
I have yet to speak at length about one of the most important characters in the show, Jill Taylor,

47:20.900 --> 47:25.900
so let's right that wrong with a brief look at the small arc she went through in the show's seventh season.

47:25.900 --> 47:31.900
In Room at the Top, we get our first real example of serious marital strife between Jill and Tim.

47:31.900 --> 47:37.900
They fought constantly throughout the series, but this one got especially ugly with a couple fighting in front of their friends

47:37.900 --> 47:39.900
and Tim ended up sleeping on the couch.

47:39.900 --> 47:44.900
But things got much more fraught a few episodes later in Jill's Passion,

47:44.900 --> 47:49.900
where she's tempted at the gym by a man named Ian, played by Tom Wabat.

48:01.900 --> 48:06.900
Jill turns him down and there's no real harm done, but Jill catches herself having a dream about Ian later on,

48:06.900 --> 48:09.900
which makes her think there's something wrong with her marriage.

48:09.900 --> 48:12.900
What was nice about this episode was the resolution.

48:37.900 --> 48:39.900
Actually, I blocked that moment out.

48:40.900 --> 48:45.900
No, I had been really sick. This terrible, terrible flu.

48:45.900 --> 48:49.900
And you passed up Laker tickets so you could stay home and take care of me.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.900
Yeah. Well, I was young in love.

48:55.900 --> 49:01.900
Big Climax is Tim and Jill taking the time to talk with one another throughout the night and reconnecting on a deeper level.

49:01.900 --> 49:06.900
About 10 episodes later, though, Ian makes a return in Taking Jill for Granite,

49:06.900 --> 49:12.900
where we find out Tim's hired Ian to work on the Taylor family's kitchen, specifically their granite countertops.

49:13.900 --> 49:18.900
You know, when I got to your place this morning and you know we saw each other again,

49:18.900 --> 49:22.900
I was afraid it was going to be just awfully uncomfortable all day long.

49:23.900 --> 49:24.900
But it wasn't. Not at all.

49:24.900 --> 49:29.900
No, it really wasn't. You know, we had a nice talk and a nice lunch and...

49:30.900 --> 49:36.900
Tim's reaction is a bit mixed when he finds out his highly sought-after granite guy might be a bad dude.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.900
Can you imagine what this will look like tomorrow?

49:38.900 --> 49:40.900
Pretty much the same.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.900
Why do you say something like that?

49:44.900 --> 49:45.900
I fired Ian.

49:47.900 --> 49:50.900
For a moment, though, I thought you said you fired my granite guy.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.900
I did. When I gave him a lift home, he came on to me.

49:55.900 --> 49:57.900
You fired the granite guy?

50:00.900 --> 50:03.900
Did you hear what I said? He came on to me.

50:03.900 --> 50:04.900
Oh, did you say he had a nice outfit or something?

50:04.900 --> 50:06.900
He kissed me.

50:10.900 --> 50:11.900
What did you do?

50:11.900 --> 50:13.900
I pushed him away.

50:13.900 --> 50:14.900
You should have fired him.

50:14.900 --> 50:15.900
I did fire him.

50:16.900 --> 50:18.900
You fired the granite guy?

50:20.900 --> 50:26.900
Tim and Jill patch things up, of course, because as the earlier episodes helped establish, they have a strong marriage.

50:26.900 --> 50:29.900
We even get a cute little gag for the closing credits.

50:31.900 --> 50:33.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

50:37.900 --> 50:38.900
I...

50:42.900 --> 50:43.900
I...

50:47.900 --> 50:48.900
I...

50:52.900 --> 50:53.900
Oh...

50:56.900 --> 50:57.900
I...

51:02.900 --> 51:03.900
Oh.

51:07.900 --> 51:08.900
Ian.

51:09.900 --> 51:10.900
Ian.

51:11.900 --> 51:12.900
Ian.

51:16.900 --> 51:19.900
But have you spotted the problem with my discussion about Jill?

51:19.900 --> 51:28.900
Let's move on to From Top to Bottom, an episode where Jill is invited to be on a TV show panel to discuss what it's like to be a mother and a grad student at the same time.

51:28.900 --> 51:33.900
Well, he comes up with all kinds of crazy ideas, like he wanted to buy and move up to a hunting lodge.

51:33.900 --> 51:34.900
With the kids? The whole family?

51:34.900 --> 51:35.900
Yeah, the whole family.

51:35.900 --> 51:37.900
Oh, and he wanted to fly into outer space.

51:37.900 --> 51:39.900
Oh, now that is crazy.

51:39.900 --> 51:46.900
Oh, oh, oh, in the middle of writing my master's thesis, he decided he wanted to have another baby.

51:47.900 --> 51:48.900
At your age?

51:49.900 --> 51:54.900
Tim eventually forgives Jill because of the obvious double standard, combined with a less than compelling reason.

51:55.900 --> 52:00.900
You got carried away. You're trying to show off with the girls? I was the buddy of Tyra.

52:01.900 --> 52:02.900
Yeah, that's right. You got it.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.900
I did all the time on Tool Time. Now I know how you feel.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.900
So you're not going to hold this against me?

52:10.900 --> 52:12.900
No, I'm a guy. I let this stuff go.

52:13.900 --> 52:18.900
Most of Jill's problems in this series tend to come from her having issues related to Tim.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.900
Well, once in a while, we might see Jill having fights with her sisters.

52:21.900 --> 52:35.900
Jill-centered stories frequently included Tim in some capacity, whereas Tim-centric stories, while often including Jill, with some regularity, would relegate her to a supporting player, as opposed to being a central part of the conflict.

52:35.900 --> 52:40.900
As interesting as Jill could be, she rarely steps outside the shadow of her husband.

52:40.900 --> 52:46.900
Behind the scenes, Patricia Richardson often had to fight to give her character a more rounded life throughout the series.

52:46.900 --> 52:53.900
I began to be frustrated with I had no friend. I had no job. I had no life outside of the house.

52:54.900 --> 53:00.900
I never had a scene without Tim in it. I never had a scene alone with the children. I had never had a scene alone with Wilson.

53:00.900 --> 53:07.900
I never had any place to go. I go, if they love me so much, then let's develop the character more and give me more to do.

53:07.900 --> 53:13.900
But they love you! But then why don't you develop her? But they love you!

53:13.900 --> 53:22.900
And as one last note before we hit the final season, if you're wondering why I haven't been talking about Al much, it's because I had to cancel him after he wore blackface this season.

53:22.900 --> 53:26.900
Also, this video is really long and I needed to draw the line somewhere.

53:26.900 --> 53:31.900
I should have said, cancel. Is that something? No, that's nothing.

53:35.900 --> 53:40.900
One of the biggest changes to the series in this season was the exit of Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

53:40.900 --> 53:44.900
He departed in the season's second episode, titled Adios.

53:44.900 --> 53:51.900
I get to go to Costa Rica. What? Yeah, some guy dropped out of the program and they're giving me a spot.

53:52.900 --> 53:54.900
Wait, they expect you to just pick up a ghost like that?

53:54.900 --> 54:00.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to be living with a family in San Ramon, which is only 20 miles from where Lauren lives. I leave on Saturday.

54:00.900 --> 54:07.900
The in-show reason for Randy's leaving was the opportunity to spend a year in Costa Rica as part of an environmental study program.

54:07.900 --> 54:11.900
At this point, Randy's has developed a very strong social conscience.

54:11.900 --> 54:16.900
Bedford's the one who's out of line. I mean, they're sweeping their pollution problem under the rug so they can maximize her profits.

54:17.900 --> 54:21.900
Let me tell you something. When you get older, you'll understand not everything is so cut and dried.

54:21.900 --> 54:26.900
I understand right now, Dad. Good. You're taking the company line. You're a sell-out.

54:26.900 --> 54:32.900
You called me a sell-out? Oh, yeah, Dad. I called you a sell-out, but then again, to be a sell-out, you'd have to have principles to begin with.

54:33.900 --> 54:40.900
Although Tim and Jill don't want to see their teenage son leave, Tim in particular, they eventually acquiesce and Randy is allowed to go.

54:40.900 --> 54:47.900
Thomas would return a few episodes later for a guest appearance on the episode titled Home for the Holidays, but he would not return for the series finale.

54:47.900 --> 54:58.900
Behind the scenes, the reason for Jonathan Taylor Thomas' exit from the show was to focus on school, though some animosity was created between him and Tim Allen when Allen saw him performing in movies shortly after leaving.

55:10.900 --> 55:13.900
Speaking in an interview years later, Thomas said,

55:19.900 --> 55:37.900
The rest of Season 8 is a mishmash of subplots that feel like the show trying to find a new footing, like Al dating a millionaire, Tim's brother Marty moving into the Taylor home with his two daughters, and we got the only two-parter in the series, Love's Labor Lost, in which Jill has an emergency hysterectomy.

55:37.900 --> 55:41.900
One thing that's particularly weird about this episode is how we learn about Jill's tumor.

55:53.900 --> 56:01.900
Instead of being in the room when Jill finds out, we instead learn about it with Tim. It reinforces the point I made earlier about so much of Jill's story being told through the medium of Tim.

56:01.900 --> 56:12.900
He is the star, so that's to be expected to a degree. I do wonder why that, even when it comes to having an operation, we can't let Jill be the focus of learning about her own condition.

56:12.900 --> 56:18.900
The second part does give us this nice scene between Jill and her mother, who came to Detroit to take care of Jill.

56:31.900 --> 56:48.900
It only took the show eight seasons to give us a clear example of a mother imparting wisdom to a daughter.

56:48.900 --> 56:56.900
Previous episodes that included Jill's mother had more to do with their relationship rather than Jill's need for a positive mother figure in her life.

56:56.900 --> 57:08.900
That might just be because Jill is a grown woman, making opportunities like this rare, although we seemed to get moments like this on the regular when we had Tim going to his father figure Wilson for advice.

57:08.900 --> 57:16.900
Another interesting bit of trivia is that this season features two episodes directed by cast members, one by Patricia Richardson and one by Tim Allen.

57:17.900 --> 57:22.900
Richardson's episode, Neighbors, isn't too remarkable, but I want to talk about Allen's briefly.

57:22.900 --> 57:30.900
In Loose Lips and Freudian Slips, Jill is placed in a tough spot when she accidentally is caught making a snide comment about one of her professors.

57:46.900 --> 58:03.900
The next time she sees that professor, she is in front of him defending her thesis.

58:16.900 --> 58:35.900
Putting aside Jill's awkwardness, that thesis should sound pretty familiar if you've been paying attention to this video.

58:35.900 --> 58:43.900
It seems Kim Flagg, the writer for this episode, has Jill writing a thesis that could substitute as a reading of the Home Improvement series itself.

58:43.900 --> 58:59.900
In fact, the premise of this episode, where Jill's true thoughts are revealed in an unguarded moment where she makes fun of a man's comb-over, could similarly be mirroring what this episode is doing, revealing a critical reading of this show behind the guise of its usual silly antics.

58:59.900 --> 59:04.900
Wilson's lines here are especially revealing, and it raises the question how to read the subtext here.

59:14.900 --> 59:17.900
No, no, no, no, no. It's about a guy who loses his clothes in Newark.

59:17.900 --> 59:21.900
Time funny stuff happens to him.

59:21.900 --> 59:24.900
So, no, wait. What does this have to do with my thesis, son?

59:24.900 --> 59:30.900
Well, my drama department wanted me to rewrite my play, but I was very passionate about walking naked.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.900
So you refused to make any of the changes?

59:32.900 --> 59:37.900
No, no, no. Quite the opposite. I caved in, rewrote the whole play. It was a big success.

59:37.900 --> 59:39.900
You must have been thrilled.

59:40.900 --> 59:44.900
No, I felt terrible, because I compromised the integrity of the play.

59:44.900 --> 59:47.900
So you think that I should just stick to what I wrote originally?

59:47.900 --> 59:54.900
You know, Jill, your name is going to be on that thesis forever. Shouldn't it represent something that you truly believe in?

59:54.900 --> 59:57.900
Yes, it should.

59:57.900 --> 01:00:08.900
This episode has a lot of meta-cues. It could be seen as undercutting the earlier example of the thesis reading, so maybe this whole episode is making fun of people like me, who read into things a bit too much.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:14.900
The show resolves the plot with Jill rejecting the committee's notes and sticking to her original thesis.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:21.900
In a way, the show feels like it's acknowledging that it shouldn't be more than its original premise, and maybe because of that, it needs to end.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.900
I think it's very telling that this is the episode Tim Allen directed.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:33.900
I think what he's expressing are his frustrations that this series is drifting away from its original stated premise, and that's the masculine response to feminism.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:38.900
And as it drifts away from that premise, it's costing the show's voice its authenticity.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:44.900
And that brings us to the final episode, a three-parter titled The Long and Winding Road.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:53.900
Tool Time has a new producer, Morgan, and he changes the show to be more spectacle than Home Repair. More spectacle than usual, anyway.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:00.900
Tim, frustrated with losing all his creative control of the show, decides to quit, and he's followed out the door by Allen Heidi.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:09.900
If you're gonna turn this show into a three-ring circus, I might just quit. Sorry to lose you. You were a good man.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:17.900
Meanwhile, Jill is offered a job as a counselor in Indiana, leading the tailors to a familiar question.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.900
Okay, so Tim, should she take this job?

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.900
Absolutely.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.900
The job's in Seattle.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900
Karen, this is stupid.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:32.900
Okay, okay, let me ask you another question. Tool time goes national, but you have to move to New York. Do you go?

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:38.900
Yeah, it's my job. It'd be perfect... if it's okay with Jill.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.900
Oh, so you're saying that your job is more important than hers?

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.900
She didn't have a job.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.900
Answer the question, Tim. Do you move to New York or Seattle?

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.900
This might be a good time for you to support Jill.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.900
The truth is, my family's always been based around me and my career.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.900
I never really thought about what would happen if, you know...

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.900
You never thought you'd be making the same sacrifices for Jill as she did for you.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.900
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.900
Although Tim is initially resistant to it, there isn't much discussion about the move.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:16.900
She's got to move to Indiana for a job. I'm going to put on a moo-moo and curlers for her.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.900
So, does this mean you're willing to discuss it now?

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.900
No need to. We're going.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900
Yeah.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:32.900
I'm not too keen on that. Even though he's essentially siding with Jill here, this makes it look like the decision was still his, instead of there being any sort of discussion.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.900
It's a bit incongruent, with an episode that's supposed to be about Tim learning to let someone else take the lead.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:45.900
The second part of the finale is Tim driving Brad and Mark to school, which is an excuse to show off clips from some classic episodes.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.900
The country music star Kenny Rogers recorded the song, We've Got It All, for this episode.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.900
The story picks up again in the third part and final episode of Home Improvement.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:04.900
Tim records the final episode of Tool Time with a bunch of guest stars, the episode gets huge ratings, and Morgan changes his mind, offering Tim big money to stay.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.900
I've been trying to convince him to stay with Tool Time. He keeps turning me down.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.900
He hated what you did to his show.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:16.900
That's all changed since the last episode. We offered to make him the executive producer, and we offered to give him a big raise.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.900
But he won't budge. Something about Indiana.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.900
He turned you down because of my job offer?

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.900
Meanwhile, Al is getting married to his girlfriend Trudy in the Taylor backyard, a classic ending for a comedy.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:43.900
By the power vested in me by the state of Michigan and the church of the celestial moon, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:51.900
I don't know why Wilson is some kind of celestial moon priest. In spite, or maybe because of that, the wedding goes off without a hitch.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.900
But will Tim take the big money, or is he in jail moving to Indiana?

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.900
The moving dilemma is sort of addressed in the final scene.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:38.900
Well, if we ever decide to move, maybe we wouldn't have to leave the house.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:47.900
What does that mean?

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.900
Did they move? Or was that strictly Tim's fantasy?

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:56.900
The ending here is deliberately vague due to a disagreement between Tim Allen, Patricia Richardson, and the writers.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:04.900
The writers were pushing for the Taylor's to move to Indiana, whereas Allen and Richardson were fighting for a less cliche ending, then turning the lights out on an empty home.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:09.900
The ending we got was a compromise, and in many ways, that fits the show quite nicely.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:18.900
It had settled itself to the idea that Tim would uproot his life for his wife in the first part of the finale, and now it was confronting the idea of Jill taking charge herself.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:32.900
While I, as a viewer, might like to see Tim step aside, since it would symbolize Tim shedding his persona of masculine dominance, I'm not sure the show earned such a departure from the man we've been watching for eight seasons.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.900
Tim Taylor grew throughout the series, definitely. But how radical has this change been?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:47.900
The fact that he twisted Jill's decision into his own, shutting down the discussion on a move they would make as partners, suggests to me that he isn't ready to stop being the family patriarch just yet.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:54.900
He'll bend, but only slightly. The vague ending suggests that this conversation isn't over.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:05.900
The series finale was a massive rating success. It was the fifth highest rated series finale for the decade, and it captured 35.5% of American households that night.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:15.900
The decision to end the show largely came from Tim Allen, who was creatively drained after eight seasons. He reportedly turned down an offer of $50 million for a new season of home improvement.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:23.900
Patricia Richardson was also offered a huge paycheck to return, $25 million, though she took some issue with being paid half as much as Tim.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:30.900
So Tim and I sat down and we said, there's no way to do the show anymore the way it is. Zach's graduating, he's moving, Jonathan's gone.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:41.900
You know, the only way to do it is to totally change the show. We'd have to have them, like, you know, move away and open up a bed and breakfast somewhere or something or have Tim go back and teach shop.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.900
I mean, that was one of the ideas we talked about.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:51.900
The only way this is going to happen is you pay me exactly the money you pay him. We're total equals. You pay me exactly the money you pay him. We're executive producers.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.900
I get, if you offer him $2 million an episode, you give me $2 million an episode. We're total equal. I don't do it.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:03.900
Richardson's complaints were joined by similar ones from other cast members. And all that arguing played a role in Tim's decision to end the show.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:17.900
I sat there and I thought about, can I do this again? Knowing Pat's concerns were just almost impossible to address. I just didn't want money to be the motivator. And it would have been.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:31.900
Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, if you don't recognize his face, only took a few small roles after Home Improvement ended in 1999. His lifetime of smoking seems like the likely cause of his diagnosis of lung cancer in 2003.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.900
He passed away on December 29th of the same year at the age of 61.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:46.900
According to castmates and staff members of the show, Hindman was well-loved on the set, and notably one of the few actors who never made a fuss about their role, even though he was permanently behind a wooden fence.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:08:01.900
This is a good place to restate. Hindman's performance as Wilson was excellent. Although I didn't particularly appreciate the character's point of view at times, Hindman delivered his lines with compassion and wisdom that you could really feel throughout its delivery.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:09.900
The rest of the cast went on to have various levels of success, though it's safe to say that none of them were on as huge a hit as Home Improvement had been.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:26.900
Though reportedly very friendly backstage, the remaining cast wasn't completely reunited until 2011 in a photo shoot for Entertainment Weekly. Tim Allen went on to star in Last Man Standing, a sitcom on ABC that's more or less Home Improvement, except raising three girls instead of three boys.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:38.900
And instead of having a tool show, he sells sporting goods. The show also notably featured several small Home Improvement reunions, including appearances by Richard Karn, Patricia Richardson, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:48.900
Its reaction from critics has been lukewarm, but unlike Home Improvement, it hasn't been nearly as successful with viewers, peaking at 40th place in the overall ratings.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:09:01.900
While Home Improvement had a theme that was fairly conservative, the political messaging in Last Man Standing is much more overt, such as having the Tim Allen character, Mike Baxter, be a Mitt Romney supporter in its second season.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:11.900
I haven't discussed Home Improvement's political leanings as much because they're very implicit and not as overt, but it shouldn't surprise anyone at this point that Tim Allen is a fairly conservative guy.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:20.900
So it's only natural that a show with his name on it reflects his worldview to some degree. And what we see throughout Home Improvement is a show that's at its core a conservative one.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:26.900
Conservative in the reasonable sense, not in the reactionary, crypto-fascist sense.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:38.900
Although it should be noted that Tim Allen has at times expressed his desire to use the N-word in his comedy, which for all our sakes thankfully has not happened.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:44.900
Not that I have any love for Tim Allen, more that we don't really need more using the N-word.

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:50.900
People love to complain about shows being political, and I can get on board with complaints of messaging being clumsy or ham-fisted.

01:09:50.900 --> 01:10:03.900
But part of this lookback at Home Improvement has, I hope, highlighted how politics, or more specifically the social relationships between men and women, can be seen as a central theme regardless of any political party or policy being mentioned.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.900
Politics, even how they shape our interpersonal lives, are always present.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.900
Home Improvement was not a feminist show by any stretch, but was it an anti-feminist show?

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:30.900
At its core, I'd argue no. While it scratches its head at basic feminism concepts like a woman getting a job, it doesn't present it as something negative, more as something that is confusing, and it certainly doesn't fall into the trap of portraying feminism as something destructive.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:44.900
It tries, oftentimes clumsily, to debate the merits of feminism and how it applies to men. And to its credit, it does seat some ground, acknowledging that feminism can be a positive thing for men, even though it backs away from using the word itself.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:53.900
Also a part of Home Improvement are the many implicit assumptions that keep it from reflecting a modern conception of manhood. That is to say, modern in the year 2019.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:11:07.900
As I said earlier, Home Improvement featured no gay men, very few men of color, and only vaguely refers to trans men. This creates a show that represents a very specific viewpoint, the white hetero cis male.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:19.900
And that should be noted as an observation, not a criticism. Watching Home Improvement now felt very much like watching an old show, and why a show like Home Improvement in the present would feel even more archaic.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:27.900
The idea of a Home Improvement reboot was something Tim Allen was considering in 2018, when it looked like The Last Man Standing was going to be cancelled by ABC.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:37.900
With many of its cast members on board and reboots being so fashionable, it would have been a sure thing, had Last Man Standing not suddenly been picked up by Fox, where it was renewed for a few more seasons.

It's possible that reboot might still happen one day, but as for the time being, Allen seems content with his current sitcom.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:55.900
Home Improvement is very much an old guard show. It's a show from the past, created in the 90s, signaling a dying breed with an archaic grunt. If it was old-fashioned then, it feels even older now.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:11.900
And to call it apolitical would be a mistake, because the act of advocating for the status quo, or the past, even when you're eschewing politics, still has implicit in it a political stance, and this show is clearly making a stand for the patriarchy.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:19.900
Acknowledging some positive points of feminism, but never completely abandoning the idea that men are the driving force within the world.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:28.900
This show felt to me like watching something finely crafted, with some humour and heart, but ultimately a relic.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:43.900
This one took way longer to produce than I expected. I'd like to give a special thank you to the YouTube channel SJW Debates. He helped me out with some of the humour theory for this video.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:52.900
Anyone unfamiliar with his channel should absolutely check it out. Also, of course, many thanks to my patrons, whose names are floating up the screen now.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:13:02.900
If you'd like to be a patron and have your name on the credits, and maybe something more, if I ever think up more patron rewards, you can go to my Patreon. It's linked below.

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:07.900
I'm getting very close to releasing a bonus video where I sing, and it's not going to be that great.

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:17.900
If you would like more of me and my loveliness, you can follow me on Twitter. I also have a curious cat where you can fire off a few questions.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:24.900
And obviously, obviously, do I need to say it? Yes, I need to say it. Like, comment, and if you haven't already, subscribe.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.900
Thanks for watching.
