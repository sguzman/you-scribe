1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Oh god, this one is even worse.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,960
When we last met, I was wading through the sewage of Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, True

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Allegiance.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,080
In that video, I mentioned an earlier book in the Ben Shapiro-Ura, a collection of short

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,400
stories from 2015 titled What's Fair and Other Short Stories, released on Amazon.com

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,680
as an e-book.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,960
This title seems to be less popular than Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, based on its limited

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,280
release and lower review count.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,060
It bills itself as a collection of short stories, but there are only three, which I guess meets

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,300
the technical definition of a collection.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,520
But it makes for a far shorter read than I expected.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,960
Ben's stories cover three genres.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,840
There's Americana, sci-fi, and a 16-year-old's LiveJournal page.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,960
But to truly see the man at his craft, we'll have to dive right in.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,460
Let's go.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,280
The titular story in this little tome is What's Fair.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,860
In true Ben Shapiro fashion, this story feels like someone trying to cram a bad novel into

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,040
a few pages and reducing it to a series of basic plot points, all fired off at a rapid

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,200
pace.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
This story is told through the eyes of Tommy, who relates his long and troubled history

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
with his older brother Jim.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,260
The two grew up on a farm in rural America, and we get a few scenes to illustrate how

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,720
jealous Tommy is of Jim, typically through the framing of whether or not what happened

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,120
is fair, at least through Tommy's eyes.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,200
The story is written with a painful, homespun narration style, as Ben tries his best to

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,160
make it sound like he's channeling a genuine American rustic.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Here's a sample.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,120
I remember a time when I was a kid that Dad gave me and Jim Christmas presents.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,840
He gave Jim a wristwatch and he gave me a hunting knife.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Boy was Jim taken with that wristwatch.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,920
He'd wear it around every day, rain or shine, always careful to keep it clean, to keep it

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
wound.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,520
If he scuffed it up, he'd buff that scuff right out, and he'd spend hours with a

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,640
handkerchief spitting on it and rubbing it, spitting on it and wiping it until it looked

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
brand new.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,680
Now if that sounds like it would be annoying to read, you would be right.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,000
In this story, Tommy is jealous of Jim's wristwatch.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,760
And even though he tries to make the best of it by going hunting with his knife, Tommy

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,880
eventually loses it in a creak.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,040
A detail to remember.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Next we flash forward in time and Tommy is a senior in high school and Jim is at a nonspecific

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,680
college that's only ever referred to as State.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,120
Tommy has just met Emily, shortened to M. As the star fullback on his school's football

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,400
team, Tommy has his pick of girls, but he's settled on M, the head cheerleader.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
He's not only sweet on her, he's convinced M is his future wife.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,240
If you're rolling your eyes right now thinking this is some 1950s cliche, you'd be surprised

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,720
to know that this story takes place in the 90s, or at least the 90s at the very earliest

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,720
since Tommy refers to M as a miniature Britney Spears.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm not sure why she's miniature since a high school senior is nearly a full grown

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
adult.

51
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,480
With his parents out of town, Tommy brings M back to his place so they can hook up.

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Instead he finds Jim has come home for the weekend from State.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Then we get this exchange.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,600
And that's when Jim opened the door.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,120
He was back from State where he was studying agriculture engineering and he looked at me

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,520
laughing with his eyes and said, hey brother, I'm home.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,920
When I turned back to introduce M, she was looking at him.

58
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
They were married six months later.

59
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
That must have been one hell of a look.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,640
And that's quite a jump for two sentences in the same paragraph.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,080
We never really find out why M isn't a Jim though.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
She just is.

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,080
In the next paragraph, Tommy and Jim's father dies and their mother sinks into a deep depression.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,480
The farm falls into peril and Jim and M move back home to take care of things.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,640
Soon afterwards, their mother tries to drown herself in the bathtub, but survives the

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,880
attempt and is left with brain damage.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
And this all sounds like it's moving too quickly.

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,240
I've literally just covered two paragraphs of this story.

69
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,160
Its pace is manic.

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,640
And if you're wondering if there are any more details on the mother character, let

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,800
me stop you right there.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
We don't learn a thing about who this woman is or why she does what she does.

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,200
She's literally just a perpetual burden on her family.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
And she doesn't even get a name.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,920
Tommy was going to be a football player at State, but he hurts his knee, losing his scholarship,

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
and he's forced to drop out.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,280
And now the family is just stagnating at the farm when Jim gets this big idea.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,080
He's thought of a special plow that will make the millionaires.

79
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,720
While he begins tinkering with that machine for weeks on end, all the work lends on M

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,000
and Tommy, who putter along muttering annoyances about the absent-minded Jim.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Eventually their mother starts a fire in her room.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Tommy and M race to help her while Jim is too busy with his machine to notice.

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,560
Just barely, Tommy and M are able to save Mother.

84
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Tommy, obviously upset with his brother who did not notice their mother nearly burning

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,320
to death in her room, decides to confront Jim in a tense scene in the barn.

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Sure enough, Jim was under that plow again.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
I stood there for a minute, then two.

88
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,440
It must have taken the bastard five solid minutes to notice me.

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,040
When he did, he got out from under the plow, stood up, gave a kind of little smile, and

90
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,000
asked what was wrong.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,720
And I knocked him flat on his ass.

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,480
Listen, Jim, I said to him, you've been having it your own way all this time, but some things

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
are gonna change.

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,800
You've been king of this place for our whole life, but I've had enough of it.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,040
I want my peace.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,160
There's so much to say about this exchange.

97
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
Tommy is so pissed.

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,800
He storms into the barn and then stands there for five minutes?

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
That doesn't seem particularly mad.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,040
And then, instead of confronting Jim about his negligence nearly getting their mother

101
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,400
killed, he instead starts talking about wanting his peace.

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Tommy never mentions his mother in this scene.

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,000
He just whines about things and being unfair, with Jim getting all the breaks.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
Jim responds by turning into a character from an Ayn Rand novel.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,120
Tommy, he said, you don't do anything of importance around here.

106
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,200
You think I need you to run this place?

107
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,320
I could hire a field hen for one quarter the price.

108
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm doing it out of charity for you.

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,560
You've never held down a real job.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,440
You're still going on and on about your days back in high school.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,840
Nobody cares anymore.

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,340
I produce.

113
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,920
The spark in his eyes was beginning to return.

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,600
I knew this meant he was especially mad.

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
You aren't worth anything.

116
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
You've got no education.

117
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,880
You've got no prospects.

118
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,440
You know what dad told me before I left to school?

119
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,120
He said, look after Tommy.

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,280
If anything happens, Jimmy, he can't take care of himself.

121
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,320
Just what do you think I've been doing?

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,360
I started to talk, but he gave me a look that said I'd better shut my mouth.

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
He kept going.

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,400
You know what I've been doing in this barn all this time?

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,520
Trying to make something for myself and for Am, sure, but mostly I've been trying to

126
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
take care of you.

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,440
Still, even though you're sullen and you're lazy and you're ungrateful and you think

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,720
somehow I've cheated you, even though I spent years helping you with your homework, teaching

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,160
you the rules of football, hell, I even got that man from state to come see you play.

130
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,720
When this thing makes us a million bucks, I'm planning on sending you back to college

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
so you can make something of yourself.

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
But if you want to leave, you pick up and you get the hell out.

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,760
This diatribe reframes the entire story for us.

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Now we see Tommy as the big dumb idiot and Jim as the smart, intelligent brother who's

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
just trying to help everyone out.

136
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,720
Tommy is just too dumb to see it.

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,400
Jim's kind offer to take care of his brother is supposed to make him look magnanimous.

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Even after he basically told him he's a useless idiot.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,480
Since Jim is a producer, we're supposed to think it's okay that he treats his brother

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
with such disdain.

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,880
And maybe Tommy is a loser.

142
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Maybe his choice of focusing on athletics over academics and then him ending up getting

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,640
injured blew his entire future and the guy lost his high school crush to his brother.

144
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,200
Tommy has had a rough time of it and maybe he needs a reality check to snap him out of

145
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
this funk and get him to take responsibility for himself.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,240
But you know what that speech doesn't excuse?

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,120
Letting your mother die in a fire.

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,640
That's how this critical speech completely fails.

149
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,520
If we're supposed to take Jim's side here, it would be a lot easier if he, the supposedly

150
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,760
responsible brother, hadn't nearly let his mother die in a fire.

151
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,960
Also Jim technically hasn't done all that much yet.

152
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,760
Tommy and Em run the farm and they're supposed to just assume Jim will invent their way into

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
a fortune.

154
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,720
The story gives us no reason to believe this will happen.

155
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,960
And if anything, Jim comes off as unbearably smug in this monologue.

156
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,680
So naturally, Ben has decided he's the good guy in this story.

157
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
After this, we move on to a scene where Tommy runs into Em late at night, finding her sobbing

158
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,840
about her miserable life as a farm wife taking care of a sick old woman.

159
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Tommy figures this is a great time to talk about hooking up again.

160
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Naturally, it doesn't work.

161
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,240
Embarrassed at his lack of game, Tommy runs into the woods and while passing by the creek,

162
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,560
he finds his old knife, sparkling like new.

163
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not sure how this knife is still in such good shape and hasn't moved in the last 15

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,440
years, but such is the magic of forced storytelling.

165
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,600
A few days later, Jim calls Tommy into the barn to tell him his new plow has finally

166
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
been finished.

167
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,440
He brings Tommy into the barn to take a look and to talk about how their lives are about

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,560
to take a turn for the better and then this predictable twist happens.

169
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,960
This is Tommy talking to Jim.

170
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,000
He hopped over to me like a jackrabbit and grabbed me by the arms.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,360
Kiddo, we're all set from here to the flood.

172
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,240
You're a junior partner in the firm and we're headed right to the top.

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
His smile was infectious.

174
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,360
I could feel myself smiling too.

175
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,940
And then the knife was up under his ribs.

176
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,480
He looked so confused for a minute.

177
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,680
I was confused too.

178
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
I can explain it to you, Tommy.

179
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,200
It turns out you were in a very forced and contrived retelling of the Cain and Abel story.

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,080
One jealous brother murders the other.

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,440
Unlike Cain, though, Tommy gets away with the crime by pretending the plow is what killed

182
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
his brother.

183
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,800
Or at least, he seems to get away with the crime.

184
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,080
In the next scene, Tommy tries to sell the plow to make those millions, but he can't

185
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,500
get it to work.

186
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,800
Turns out there's something wrong that I guess Jim can only fix.

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,280
So Tommy goes home with no money and a busted plow, and eventually packs up and leaves the

188
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,960
farm and Tommy is left alone taking care of his sick mother.

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,160
What this story is so pointedly pressing upon us is the idea that people are born with unalterable

190
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,160
traits, essential components that make them who they are which can never be changed.

191
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,080
Tommy was born dumb and Jim was born smart.

192
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,360
Their lives reflect this internal trait and they have no way of escaping this biological

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
reality.

194
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,280
What Tommy can hope for is Jim taking care of him, and all Jim needs from Tommy is for

195
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,560
Tommy to get the hell out of his way.

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,840
What's most strange about this story is it pretends circumstances are meaningless and

197
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,440
that even when you have a person like Tommy who is apparently cared for, he still can't

198
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,720
escape the loneliness he was born with.

199
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,760
I'll have more to say about this idea of essentialism during the third story.

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,760
You know, I did like the idea of an unreliable narrator whose bias is revealed when confronting

201
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,840
the characters he covets.

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Maybe in the hands of a talented writer?

203
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,780
This could have actually been really good.

204
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,720
But here's a spoiler for the next two stories before we get into those.

205
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,440
What's fair is easily the best story in the book.

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,360
And with that ominous revelation, let's move on to the next one.

207
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,920
Our next stop in the Shapiroverse is the science fiction story From the Pit.

208
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,100
This is a tale of the far future where our hero, a man named Kemp, is fighting for his

209
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,380
survival against hordes of dust mites for the sake of his rich benefactor.

210
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,540
And yes, I did say dust mites.

211
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,400
In this vision of the future, a wealthy man, only referred to as the whale, hires thousands

212
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,940
of people to be shrunk down to less than a millimeter, which is about four hundredths

213
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,140
of an inch, so they can shoot dust mites in the face.

214
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,260
Now before we continue with the plot, I need to acknowledge that this is maybe the dumbest

215
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,980
plan to eliminate dust mites I've ever heard.

216
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,180
Why not, say, make the humans big enough that the dust mites can't harm them and

217
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,100
just spray them like roaches?

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,400
Why not skip shrinking humans entirely and use chemicals from the get-go?

219
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,500
Why not just write a story that doesn't have such a bad premise?

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,820
Of all the stories in this collection, this one is in the most desperate need of some

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
copy editing.

222
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,300
Here's an actual sentence from the story.

223
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,800
Two years.

224
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,260
That was the length of that damnable contract.

225
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,780
I though the money would enough.

226
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,460
Did no one read this over?

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,460
I though the money would enough.

228
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,280
And the rest of the paragraph reads, a guaranteed pension for life, an endless income, a nice

229
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,340
house above the bay with the wind blowing off the sea, Amy in my arms.

230
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,940
She warned me against this.

231
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,540
She was right.

232
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,300
I was wrong.

233
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,340
Sentences either run on for way too long or they're too short and snippy.

234
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,080
It doesn't use commas properly and I though the money would enough.

235
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,900
And don't worry, that's not even the worst grammatical flub in this story.

236
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,660
But back to the plot.

237
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,020
Kemp pines for Amy, an absent love interest that reminds us he has something to live for

238
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,140
in light of the horrors that come.

239
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,620
Kemp fights a bunch of dust mites in a confusing battle scene where he's hanging off the side

240
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,460
of a cigarette when the whale, a clean freak who is also a compulsive smoker, decides to

241
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,740
light up the cigarette and take a drag.

242
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,380
In the chaos, Kemp falls into the whale's mouth and thanks to his little protective

243
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,860
bubble called a halo, he manages to affix himself to the side of the whale's stomach.

244
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,940
A man trapped in the belly of a whale is an obvious reference to the story of Jonah and

245
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,380
the whale from the Old Testament.

246
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,180
In that story, after Jonah turned his back on his mission as a prophet, God had him swallowed

247
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,100
up for a few days by a giant fish.

248
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Jonah eventually is thrown up and then becomes a prophet.

249
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,440
In this story, Kemp is learning the error of wanting to make money from a rich guy who

250
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,500
has a really weird method of killing dust mites.

251
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,760
So not exactly the same.

252
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Or similar.

253
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,980
While sitting in the stomach, Kemp sees the awful truth about the whale.

254
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,440
He has a tumor.

255
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,540
And an ulcer, which is something I'm just mentioning because it'll be used as a plot

256
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,140
device later on.

257
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,060
Somehow Kemp knows the tumor is really bad.

258
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,900
So bad that the whale will be dead in a couple of months.

259
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,400
We haven't gotten any information that Kemp has any sort of medical training or knowledge.

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,060
This is just something he knows.

261
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,220
This knowledge about the tumor could make Kemp fabulously wealthy.

262
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,500
And that does make sense knowing that some big important business dude is going to be

263
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,100
dead in a couple of months is prime blackmail material.

264
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,020
Kemp though isn't a bastard and doesn't want to take advantage of this situation.

265
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,700
Kemp radios his buddy Jensen, letting him know he's trapped in the stomach and that

266
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,580
he's seen the whale's tumor.

267
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,700
He promises not to say a word about it to anyone.

268
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,500
Jensen tries speaking to the whale, but he doesn't believe Kemp and decides he's just

269
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,980
going to kill him.

270
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,220
It's at this point in the story where we get a truly mystifying line that, I suspect, is

271
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,260
the subtext for this entire story.

272
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm going to be a bit of a jerk though and not reveal it until we get to the very end.

273
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,320
As we move along, try and guess what this story is secretly an allegory for.

274
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,040
The whale calls a doctor to have Kemp killed, and their plan is to send in robotic dust

275
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,400
mites to hunt him down.

276
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,200
These were going to eventually replace shrinking humans down to fight dust mites, and I don't

277
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,780
know why they just didn't start with the robots, but this is the story we have.

278
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,480
Inside the stomach, Kemp has decided he's just going to let himself grow back to full

279
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,040
size and rip his way out of the whale.

280
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,960
And to do that, he's going to have to fight his way through the robotic dust mites.

281
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,080
Reversion to his normal size is a gradual process for Kemp, so at this point, he's

282
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,520
about twice his starting size, so probably one tenth of an inch, assuming he started

283
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,440
off as slightly larger than a dust mite.

284
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,520
As the dust mites tear open the halo protecting Kemp, he comes out fighting, kicking his way

285
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,960
past them and climbing up the stomach lining.

286
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Of course, since his tiny little clothes have all ripped off, he's doing it naked, burning

287
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
his hands and feet on the stomach lining.

288
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
As he climbs into the esophagus, one of the dust mites bites off Kemp's leg.

289
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
Then we get this doozy of a typo.

290
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,680
For context, Kemp is pulling himself into the esophagus, which looks like a constricting

291
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,520
ring from his perspective.

292
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,160
Finally, I pry the damn thing open, pull myself halfway through, and it closes around

293
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
my waist.

294
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm trapped, the clicking sounds of the mites closer and closer.

295
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry, it closes around your… what?

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
Your waist?

297
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,760
Is Kemp in the process of relieving his bowels here, or did someone just not know how to

298
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
spell waist?

299
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,120
Of course, I'm sure Ben knows how to spell waist properly.

300
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
This just speaks to the importance of copy editors and how they're your friends, and

301
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,120
if you employ one and have them look over your work, they'll keep it from looking

302
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
like waist.

303
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,640
Somehow Kemp pulls himself to safety and uses what's left of the stomach acid to cauterize

304
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
the wound.

305
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Of course, acid liquefies flesh, making it a horrible fluid to cauterize anything.

306
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,200
Missing a leg and sitting in the esophagus, Kemp decides he'll have a little nap.

307
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
And by little nap, I mean really long sleep.

308
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
September 23rd.

309
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,400
I've lost all sense of time.

310
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,760
I can tell by my size, I'm now about 3 inches tall, that it's been another 36 hours.

311
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,960
How can you lose all sense of time and then be able to tell it's been 36 hours?

312
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,440
And how on earth did the whale go 36 hours without eating any food that would have surely

313
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,040
dislodged Kemp?

314
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:46,400
And how did he sleep, I guess standing up, in the esophagus, missing a leg for 36 hours?

315
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,960
It's at this point Kemp revises his plan, instead opting to climb out of the esophagus

316
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,120
instead of just bursting through the whale's guts.

317
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,400
And we get this funny little scene where Kemp punches the whale from inside of his throat.

318
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,840
It's stupid and random, but it's the only part of the story I liked, it's just this

319
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
adorably pathetic little gesture of a tiny man.

320
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,200
The whale gets desperate and the doctor pulls out their trump card, some Ipecac, which will

321
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,520
induce vomiting.

322
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,520
By vomiting up that stomach acid, it would burn Kemp to death.

323
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,200
Kemp thinks quickly and decides to go back into the stomach, this time with a plan.

324
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
He heads towards the ulcer, remember that thing from a little earlier?

325
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,240
He starts tearing at it, getting it to start bleeding, and for some reason this attracts

326
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
all the robotic dust mites.

327
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,880
I don't know how Kemp knew this would happen, or why it happens at all, but it does.

328
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,480
Here's a fun fact, dust mites don't drink blood.

329
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Maybe the robotic ones are different, but I'm not sure why anyone would program them

330
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,360
to drink human blood, that seems like a weird thing to program a robot to do.

331
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
But now let's think about this plan for a moment.

332
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,120
When it begins, the doctor has already given the whale the Ipecac, and according to Kemp,

333
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,080
he has seconds to pull all of this off.

334
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,400
Just a few seconds now before the geyser of acidic vomit comes up, finishing me.

335
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,240
I rub my right leg, what's left of it, and look down through the ring.

336
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,600
Ipecac is washing through the stomach, and mechanical mites are swimming around in it.

337
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Soon they'll be joining me, along with the acid, unless I join the bursts.

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,040
The ulcer, it's the only chance.

339
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,840
Kemp somehow knew to use the robotic dust mites to attack the ulcer.

340
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,020
He somehow knew the doctor would then, on the spot, decide to cut open the whale to

341
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,600
get it out, and in that whole mess, Kemp would jump to freedom.

342
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,740
And that's the genius plan that Kemp just came up with on the spot.

343
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,560
And what about that impending vomit after the whale swallows the Ipecac?

344
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,360
I think Ben just kind of forgot about it, because it's never mentioned.

345
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,040
Kemp was in the stomach the whole time, so it would have killed him.

346
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,560
The impending vomit acid just never arrives.

347
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Also, it's really impressive that Kemp pulls off this entire plan with one leg.

348
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,320
That's one heck of a plan coming together.

349
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,440
The story ends with the whale demanding that the doctor kill Kemp, but Jensen decides to

350
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,960
murder the doctor instead to save his friend.

351
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,040
The whale, who at no point vomits in this story, presumably bleeds out because he has

352
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,800
a giant hole in his stomach.

353
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,720
So with the story now told, have you figured out the subtext?

354
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,720
It's really tough, because even when you know and you can see the connections more clearly,

355
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,440
it still doesn't make any sense.

356
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,800
I'm going to read this revealing passage for you now.

357
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,700
This is a conversation the whale has with Jensen after he decides to murder Kemp.

358
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,980
Kemp is listening to this conversation from inside the stomach.

359
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,780
Jensen swallows, I can hear it all the way across the room, not even through the beacon.

360
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,860
Sir, he says, that would be pure murder.

361
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,500
Yes, says the whale, but it's my body, and what's in it is my purview.

362
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
That's the law.

363
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,220
Look it up, but look it up after you call the doctor.

364
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,260
This story is about abortion.

365
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,700
Yeah, that basically gives it all away, huh?

366
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,260
So now do we talk about how a living being grows inside a person, or there's a caesarean

367
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,120
operation, or a doctor is being called upon to be complicit in murder?

368
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,460
Sometimes a story's narrative is so bad, so clumsy, and falls so hard on its face that

369
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,740
the only fitting criticism is to tell everybody what happens in it.

370
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,860
So let's move on to the next story.

371
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Utopia is the shortest of the three stories, and easily the worst one, mostly because it's

372
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,180
not really a story, just a drab portrait of what Ben believes a socialist utopia would

373
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,420
look like.

374
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,600
One where everyone lives the same life, with every part of it decided for them by the government.

375
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,100
Our hero is a nameless protagonist who lives in this sheltered society trapped in a giant

376
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,500
bubble cut off from the rest of the world.

377
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,340
He goes about his drab life working at some random factory where his job is turning to

378
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,180
spigot on and off.

379
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,220
On Wednesdays he plays cards with some strangers, Tuesdays he hooks up with a random woman,

380
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,340
and on Thursdays he goes out and looks at the stars.

381
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,540
Ben gives us a world where there are no relationships, not romantic ones, and not even friendships.

382
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,020
This socialist utopia means giving up all those things as people come and go out of

383
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,060
your life and no meaningful connection is ever made.

384
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,180
On one of his stargazing nights, our protagonist looks up at the sky and notices a comet streaking

385
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
through the night.

386
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,540
It happens to be Haley's comet, which passes by every 75 years, although this only gets

387
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,420
revealed a little bit later on.

388
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,900
Somehow, seeing this comet awaken something in our protagonist.

389
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,660
Here's how the book describes it.

390
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,420
And suddenly, his hazy dream burst into consciousness.

391
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,700
He found himself standing, tears rolling down his face, gazing up at the sky, a terrible

392
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,740
longing filled him, a feeling of dread and of hope, a new feeling, an old feeling.

393
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,820
The star tore the night apart, leaving day falling behind it.

394
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,780
When he looked around him, he saw thousands of eyes and thousands of faces staring at

395
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
him, blankly.

396
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,940
The star hit the horizon.

397
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,700
He turned and ran.

398
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,060
Every line is so breathless in Ben's writing.

399
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,980
It's like he imagines every story to be utterly captivating and demands the reader being thralled

400
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,500
along with him.

401
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,580
This reader was annoyed by the tiny sentences that never offered anything of depth or value.

402
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,260
There are just these tiny little descriptions of plot points, only filled with the barest,

403
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,740
scantest of details that seem completely perfunctory.

404
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,020
And what exactly is happening in this moment?

405
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,660
A transformation, yes, but how and why?

406
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,700
And what exactly is changing here?

407
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,420
Let's see if the story will answer that for us.

408
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,700
The protagonist's dash is immediately noticed by the Ministry of Protection.

409
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,660
There are a lot of ministries in this book, but this is the only one that actually does

410
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
anything.

411
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,820
Several enforcers are dispatched to chase after the protagonist.

412
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,580
They try using this thing called the pulse, which is some kind of weapon that uses sound

413
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,220
to incapacitate people.

414
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,940
When they try using it on our protagonist, this happens.

415
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,220
Behind him, the pulse crescendoed.

416
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,140
He could feel the hair on his arm stand on end, his knees begin to buckle.

417
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,700
Soon, he knew, his legs would give out, his head fry from the pulse.

418
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,620
Yes, his head fry from the pulse, good copy editing there, by the way.

419
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,120
But it didn't.

420
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,800
The enforcer's eyes widened in shock as the pod approached.

421
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,300
He was well within range of the pulse now, yet nothing was happening, nothing.

422
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,140
Another enforcement pod opened up with the pulse, full bore, nothing.

423
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,420
A smile creased his worn face.

424
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,140
He slowed to a jog, then a walk.

425
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,420
Then, finally, he stopped dead and turned around, facing his pursuers.

426
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,260
As he did, the pods backed away, as though called away by some higher power.

427
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,980
He turned again and ran toward the mountain.

428
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,980
I have no idea why this pulse, which we've not heard about until now, doesn't work.

429
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,180
It just doesn't.

430
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,360
And this is never explained in the story.

431
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,740
And this mountain location is mentioned for the first time right here.

432
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,340
I don't know why the protagonist knows to just run towards it, but that's what's happening.

433
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,300
What's even funnier is that Ben doesn't even know how his protagonist knows about

434
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
the mountain.

435
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,780
He didn't know how he knew about the mountain.

436
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,440
The Ministry of Environment never talked about it.

437
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,060
Nobody knew the words mountain or valley.

438
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,940
He couldn't even see the mountain thanks to the bubble, the protective climate change,

439
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:00,020
the artificial environment that made all land even and flat, fruitful and evenly graded.

440
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,980
Nobody he knew had ever been outside the bubble.

441
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,220
The protagonist runs towards the mountain, but is stopped by the dome of his enclosure.

442
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,540
Eventually, for unnamed reasons, the doorway is opened and the protagonist is allowed to

443
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,880
approach the mountain.

444
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,020
As he approaches, the protagonist sees a sign that reads, The Creed of Ignorance.

445
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,100
This for the unfamiliar is how Winston Churchill referred to socialism.

446
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,580
The full quote reads, socialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance and the

447
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,420
gospel of envy.

448
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,540
Why would socialists put up part of a quote that makes them sound like the bad guys?

449
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,100
And that quote basically encapsulates this story.

450
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,420
People living in this socialist utopia all think they're happy, but they're actually

451
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,260
under a mass delusion that our nameless protagonist has broken out of, somehow.

452
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,180
Let's read on and see if we get an answer to that.

453
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
He probably guessed we aren't though, right?

454
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,020
Yeah, he probably figured that out.

455
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,020
A chamber inside the mountain houses an old man and his many books.

456
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,220
He's bedridden and just kind of lame there when our protagonist finds him, and the two

457
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,260
have a weighty conversation.

458
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,940
Here's the closest we get to understanding what sent our protagonist on his journey.

459
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Halley's Comet.

460
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,980
I know you don't know what that is, never mind about that.

461
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,340
Suffice it to say that it shows up once every 75 years.

462
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,980
Your father and mother must have seen it at some point.

463
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,700
At that he spoke.

464
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,140
I never knew my father and mother.

465
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
But you remember the comment.

466
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,820
I don't know what I remember.

467
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,240
And then they move on.

468
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,540
If you want answers to nonsensical plot twists, or in this case, the entire premise, Ben Shapiro

469
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,260
isn't the writer for you.

470
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,620
But maybe I'm being nitpicky, it might not matter what brought us to this point.

471
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,120
We have a social outcast from a socialist society who's confronting a man revealed

472
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,480
to be one of that society's architects.

473
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,020
This is the moment this was all building to, so maybe it'll pay off and of course it's

474
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,720
not going to pay off, but let's find out what happens.

475
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,200
In the minds of the socialist, according to the story, the problem is diversity.

476
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,740
The differences between people create strife and discord.

477
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,460
Let's let the old man explain it.

478
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,100
For no matter what measures government tried, inequality remained, redistribution of resources

479
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,860
merely masked the problem.

480
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,580
Laws directed toward helping particular groups often ended with them being strangely disadvantaged.

481
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,900
Different abilities bred different values, different belief systems.

482
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,820
Those values and systems caused conflict.

483
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,800
We tried everything to solve it.

484
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,180
We tried education.

485
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,460
We tried genetic treatments designed to raise the average intelligence.

486
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,100
But each IQ point meant a massive difference in outcome.

487
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,340
There's something very sinister happening here.

488
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,180
And I don't just mean the swipe at the welfare state.

489
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,860
What Ben is presenting to us is a reading of diversity amongst cultures as the product

490
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,660
of genetic differences.

491
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,740
That is to say, the reason some societies differ from others, and more importantly,

492
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,000
why some societies perform better than others, is because of their genes.

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,500
This story is resting very heavily on the idea that some people, or in this case, some

494
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,020
groups of people, are simply born better than others.

495
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:10,220
And he pulls it out to mean that this is a product of our genes, and is completely inescapable,

496
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
regardless of how we engineer society.

497
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,180
It completely disregards history, environments, both physical and social.

498
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,540
If some cultures do better than others, ultimately, it can only be explained because their people

499
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,740
are genetically superior.

500
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,460
If we don't want to talk about culture, we can also talk about class.

501
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,300
Rich people are rich because they have superior genes compared to poor people.

502
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,860
They were simply born to be better.

503
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,220
In this story, because the old man specifically refers to breeding programs that needed to

504
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,300
be used to filter out the differences between people, it's literally talking about eugenics.

505
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,500
The line towards race realism here is pretty direct.

506
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,740
For those who don't know, race realism is a pseudoscience that tries to justify racism

507
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,940
through a misunderstanding of genetics and overemphasis on arbitrary physical characteristics.

508
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,340
I don't want to get too sidetracked here, but if you want to know why this is nonsense,

509
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,460
I've included a few links in the description below.

510
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,560
It's all nonsense, and it's used to explain away some of history's worst crimes.

511
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,020
The old man describes his ideals.

512
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,900
Equality is the key.

513
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,840
Equality cannot be achieved in excellence.

514
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,900
It can only be achieved in mediocrity.

515
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,700
And we have achieved it within the bubble.

516
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,900
All are equal.

517
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
All want nothing.

518
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Aspire to nothing.

519
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
It is perfect.

520
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,540
It is stasis.

521
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,100
It took generations.

522
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,460
Three generations to breed out the intelligent, to select out the unique.

523
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,020
We have more disease now, but we have no unhappiness.

524
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,420
More poverty now, but shared by all.

525
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,500
This operation to create equality didn't take with our protagonist, though.

526
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,260
When the old man tells him happiness is a myth, then nothing can make man happy because

527
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,260
of our internal desires to do better, and eventually failing, becoming unhappy, the

528
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,500
protagonist responds, no, he said.

529
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,460
It is happiness to be so unhappy.

530
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,420
What he's saying so clumsily is the pursuit of greatness, even if it falls short, is what

531
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,780
makes people happy.

532
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,100
Maybe because we fall short and always have something to strive towards.

533
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,620
Although I'm putting words in his mouth a little here, especially with that last sentence.

534
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,700
Because instead of getting more detail, but what I suspect is the whole point of the story,

535
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,260
we get a cringy action scene instead.

536
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,180
Two enforcers have showed up to the mountain to take our protagonist away.

537
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,740
The old man has decided an independent man like our protagonist is trouble.

538
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,140
Here's one really bad part.

539
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,220
It's describing the actions of our protagonist in this scene.

540
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,540
He leapt to the bookcase, his hand gripped a volume.

541
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,060
The penta took, it said, and he pulled it from the bookcase.

542
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,160
The withered man was screaming now.

543
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,480
In anger or despair, he could not tell.

544
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,060
He swung the heavy volume, metal edged at the other enforcer, who was moving towards

545
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,540
him with a slow certitude.

546
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,740
The book crunched into the enforcer's skull, and he toppled to the floor with a crash.

547
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,700
For the unfamiliar, the penta took are the first five books on the Old Testament.

548
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,460
Yeah, this story literally has someone being beaten to death with a holy book.

549
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,620
Subtle, this story is not.

550
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,740
The protagonist confronts the old man, accusing him of ruining mankind's potential, and then

551
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,540
he uses a pillow to smother the old man's scene.

552
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,020
You protected us from our humanity.

553
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,580
From our possibility, may God, the word jumped again to his mouth.

554
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,860
May God forgive you.

555
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,380
In one fell swoop, our protagonist has found God and killed his oppressor.

556
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,260
And the story ends with him wandering off into the wilderness to see if there are other

557
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,340
painfully contrived morality tales he can appear in.

558
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,780
One of the biggest problems this story has is that there's no internal logic to the

559
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
plot.

560
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,180
The main character realizes something somehow.

561
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,340
He is pursued until he isn't, and then he is again.

562
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,260
And he knows about places before knowing about them.

563
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,140
That last part in particular is a problem, since so much of this story is dedicated to

564
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,300
describing the main character's ignorance.

565
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,620
He doesn't know what ants are, he's never seen books, he doesn't know what mountains

566
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,980
are, he doesn't know what a comet is, but he knows the mountain when he needs to, and

567
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,740
he knows anything he needs to know when the plot requires him to.

568
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,740
When he realizes that his life is unfulfilling and makes him unhappy, the story is trying

569
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,780
to convey this inner truth as if the knowledge of wanting more out of life is some kind of

570
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,060
natural impulse that can't be extinguished, only hidden.

571
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,700
It's not a terrible point, but the problem is here, in the story of free will and not

572
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,340
having life dictated to you by the government, ironically makes its protagonist seem like

573
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,100
a marionette dancing on its author's strings.

574
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:53,580
How can this be a story of free will and self-determination when it's so painfully contrived and forced?

575
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,980
This is how terrible writing can ultimately undermine any point an author is trying to

576
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
make.

577
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,460
The worldview here is ultimately one built on selfishness and tribalism.

578
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,260
It not only seems to be fine with one group of people having a higher concentration of

579
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,580
wealth to the detriment of others, it also says that they are inherently worthy of that

580
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,500
higher position in society.

581
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,180
Think back to the talk about diversity creating strife because some groups have superior genes.

582
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,860
This is presented as the natural order.

583
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,620
In this story's world, socialists are trying to upset a natural order where the superior

584
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,420
people make more money and the inferior ones live in squalor.

585
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,060
It's a full-throated defense of capitalism, using racist pseudoscience as an excuse for

586
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,580
not having to care about the poor.

587
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,060
And it's a pretty terrible short story too.

588
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,220
Part of me wants to look back and have some sort of grand conclusion now that I've read

589
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,420
the complete works of Ben Shapiro's fiction, but a bigger part of me would like to simply

590
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,500
fade away and never think about this dark period in my life.

591
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Although if he publishes another book, I will definitely, definitely be reading it.

592
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,700
Not buying it, but definitely reading it.

593
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Whew.

594
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,740
So yeah, another Ben Shapiro literature adventure for all of you.

595
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,940
For those wondering, I did not purchase this short story collection and I very much recommend

596
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,300
against doing that.

597
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,740
It's very bad and you would be giving a bad man money.

598
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,740
Don't do it.

599
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,420
Not all of my videos are going to be about terrible, conservative fiction in the future.

600
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,540
I might do a few now and then if anything catches my eye.

601
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:37,860
The names you see on the screen are my lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely patrons.

602
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,220

your memes.

604
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
It really does help a lot.

605
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:51,180
I know these videos don't look like it, but they do actually cost time and money to produce.

606
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,140
So anyone who would like to contribute to helping me make more videos, I very much

607
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,380
am grateful for that support.

608
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,100
A special shout out to my patron who decided to donate $5.69.

609
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,540
Hell yeah.

610
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,880
That's the sex number.

611
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,020
If you enjoy this video or this channel, definitely like, comment, and subscribe.

612

You can follow me on Twitter, ask me a question on Curious Cat.

614
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Thank you.

615
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,500
Thank you so much for watching.
