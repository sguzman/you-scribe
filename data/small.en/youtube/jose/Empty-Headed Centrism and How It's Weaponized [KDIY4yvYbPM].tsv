0	5800	I was working on a video a few weeks back defending Don Lemon from charges of racism.
5800	10560	For those who missed that mini-outrage, Lemon said white men, particularly right-wing white
10560	16320	men, were responsible for most of the terrorism in the United States, a verifiable fact.
16320	20880	The backlash was predictable, calling him a racist, Nazi, etc.
20880	25440	You know, that thing the left is always accused of, but is constantly heard from voices on
25440	26440	the right?
26440	29960	In making that video, I kept asking myself, how did I get here?
29960	35160	As someone on the left, why am I defending a center-left journalist working for CNN?
35160	39520	Have the lines of defense been pushed so far back that I'm arguing from the center now?
39520	53000	It's time to push back against centrism a little, and the trap we're all stuck in.
53000	56600	So I have to talk about a YouTuber named NuanceBro.
56600	61280	You can tell he's a man of nuance, because in the recent U.S. midterm election, according
61280	66280	to his shirt, instead of voting for a Democrat or a Republican, he voted for nuance.
66280	68800	I don't think nuance picked up many seats, though.
68800	72960	He claims to be making videos that look at both sides of an issue, and then uses facts
72960	74960	and reason to figure out the truth.
74960	79240	He has a few debunking videos where he takes on Black Lives Matter, gun control, and the
79240	84160	pink tax, and he has commentary videos where he defends various Trump policies and attacks
84160	85960	left-leaning media.
85960	91160	On the other hand, he also criticized Candace Owens for denying global warming one time.
91160	95120	So that's the sort of balance you see while glancing over his channel.
95120	99840	Highlighting one example briefly, during the recent kerfuffle over CNN's Jim Acosta having
99840	104200	his press credentials revoked, Acosta had bumped into a female aide working for the
104200	105720	Trump White House.
105720	109720	There was a very stupid uproar about this, and NuanceBro didn't want to get left out
109720	110720	of it.
110720	114080	Like a good little centrist, he came down on both sides of the issue.
114080	119560	He didn't fall into the obviously stupid line that karate master Jim Acosta had viciously
119560	124240	chopped this young woman's arm, because, you know, there's a video that shows it's
124240	125240	clearly accidental.
125240	130080	So I guess credit to NuanceBro for not bawling for one of the dumbest talking points I've
130080	133520	seen in the last, well, only couple of weeks.
133520	158320	There was another part to NuanceBro's take.
158320	160640	Here's the clip he used to prove that.
161640	162640	Thank you, Mr. President.
162640	168880	I wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign
168880	169880	in the midterms.
169880	170880	Here we go.
170880	175160	Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
175160	179760	As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
179760	184920	It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
184920	185920	Thank you for telling me that.
185920	186920	I appreciate it.
186920	189680	Why did you why did you characterize it as such?
189680	192320	Because I consider it an invasion.
192320	194280	You and I have a difference of opinion.
194280	195600	They're hundreds of miles away, though.
195600	197640	They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
197640	198640	That's not an invasion.
198640	201320	Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
201320	202320	You run CNN.
202320	203320	All right.
203320	205320	And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
205320	208560	If I may ask one of the questions, Mr. President, if I may ask one of the questions, are you
208560	209560	worried?
209560	210560	That's enough.
210560	211560	That's enough.
211560	212560	I was going to ask one of the other folks.
212560	213560	That's enough.
213560	214560	Pardon me, ma'am.
214560	215560	Excuse me.
215560	216560	That's enough.
217200	221960	If I may ask on on the Russia investigation, are you concerned that that you may have
221960	225800	I'm not concerned about anything with you may have a certain investigation because it's
225800	226800	a hoax.
226800	227800	Are you?
227800	228800	That's enough.
228800	229800	Put down the mic.
229800	233360	Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?
233360	238080	Acosta was pretty aggressive in his questioning, but ultimately he did sit down and let someone
238080	239240	else have a turn.
239240	241480	The whole exchange lasted two minutes.
241480	246160	More important than Acosta's questioning was that Trump's answers were non-answers.
246160	250040	When Acosta calls him out on it, Trump pivots to insulting him instead.
250040	251680	The caravan was not an invasion.
251680	256520	It's a it's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border
256520	257520	with the U.S.
257520	258520	Thank you for that.
258520	265040	And why did you why did you characterize it as such as I consider it an invasion?
265040	266440	You and I have a difference of opinion.
266440	272760	Do you think that saying we have a difference of opinion on what an invasion is is a bullshit
272760	273760	answer.
273760	275520	And both Trump and Acosta know it.
275520	280920	So Acosta pressed him on it, which is what journalists are supposed to do.
280920	286600	And speaking of rudeness, during that two minutes, Trump said that here we go, that
286600	291000	well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this could end.
291000	292000	Why?
292000	293880	Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
293880	300560	You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you
300560	301680	working for them.
301680	304040	You are a rude, terrible person.
304040	306000	You shouldn't be working for CNN.
306000	310200	Now, whose behavior is unsuited to being at that press conference?
310200	314700	Nuance Bro also used some clips of Acosta shouting out questions at press events and
314700	319800	presents this idea that the press should sit quietly, wait their turn and be polite as
319800	321800	possible to the president.
321800	326600	When the president is lying to your face, calling you names and saying you're the enemy
326600	331700	of the people, I think the days of sitting politely and waiting for your turn are over.
331700	335620	This play to civility has been keeping the press docile for years and it's nice to
335620	337060	see that changing.
337060	341220	Nuance Bro's appeal to that is an appeal to a servile press that behaves in obedience
341220	343620	to the power structures in the government.
343620	348520	In other words, his appeal to nuance is an inherently right-wing stance.
348520	353420	But here I am again, defending CNN, from the supposed center no less.
353420	355420	How does this keep happening?
355420	359880	We need to talk about centrism, both the real and fake kind.
359880	362920	Before discussing political theory, I want to offer this disclaimer.
362920	364840	I am not an expert on the subject.
364840	368480	Although this comes from a basic understanding of political theory obtained from some light
368480	379200	reading and the forethought to ignore especially stupid commentators such asâ€¦
379200	381480	This is a graph of the left-right spectrum.
381480	386040	I know the two-dimensional graph is more popular nowadays, but for the purposes of this video
386040	388480	I want to focus on this one-dimensional one.
388480	392600	Since it was made by me, it is, of course, absolutely accurate in all ways without any
392600	395800	trace of flaw or imperfection.
395800	399760	People find themselves across plenty of different points on the spectrum determined by what
399760	401720	they believe on a variety of issues.
401720	404000	A centrist would exist in this middle area.
404000	408180	To land here, they would need to have a mix of right and left opinions that average out
408180	409280	to the middle ground.
409280	413000	Now before going on, I should mention this video isn't about people who happen to fall
413000	415160	into this region incidentally.
415160	419520	If that's where you are politically, you're probably wrong on a few issues, probably on
419520	421840	the right, but that's not what this video is about.
421840	424800	This video is about people who choose to be in the center.
424800	428920	People who make a purposeful effort to ensure that they balance both sides of a political
428920	431320	equation with a sense of fairness.
431320	433360	These are the centrists who are being played.
433360	437960	Now let's make this image more complicated by talking about the Overton window.
437960	443040	And no, I'm not talking about the shitty novel Glenn Beck wrote about two people who
443040	446000	start a make-out session by discussing the flat tax.
446000	448800	This book exists, do not read it.
448800	453640	The Overton window, a political science tool created by Joseph P. Overton, describes the
453640	456360	range of permissible political thought within a system.
456360	461180	It helps to think of the left-right spectrum as a much longer continuum than it is typically
461180	462180	presented as.
462180	467080	If we zoom out, the right and left we see in our world today can be understood more
467080	471440	broadly in the context of history, where we can move much further in either direction.
471440	475160	And generally speaking, throughout most of recent history, we've been moving to the
475160	476160	left.
476160	481600	If the Overton window is the current range of typical political discourse, it moves along
481600	484400	the spectrum, to the left or right.
484400	488160	So when we talk about taking a position in the center, it's a center that's defined
488160	490200	by the time and place you live in.
490200	494560	In other words, you're taking a position in the center of the Overton window.
494560	497480	But what happens when that window starts to move?
497480	502440	The original Overton window argued that politicians set the parameters for discourse, so when
502440	507640	Democrats tilt to the right to appeal to centrists, and Republicans go so far right they're appealing
507640	511040	to fascists, the window itself shifts to the right.
511040	515400	With the rise of the Tea Party in the aughts, to the embrace of nationalism in Donald Trump
515400	519840	this year, it's plain to see that right-wing ideology is on the ascent in the United States
519840	525240	within political discourse, albeit perhaps not in actual public opinion.
525240	530480	Here on YouTube, we've seen a surge in debates about race realism, ethno-states, anti-feminism,
530480	535320	and other toxic ideas, many of these ideas having long been consigned to the dustbin
535320	536520	of history.
536520	540720	But now they're making a comeback, broadening the conversation and trying to reintroduce
540720	543920	the ideas into our political discourse.
543920	548520	This alteration of our political discourse can stretch or outright push the Overton window
548520	550080	further right.
550080	554840	For those of us on the left, instead of debating more interesting topics or having to fight
554840	559360	for the protections of a free press from a president who doesn't like being asked
559360	564200	tough questions, but where does this leave the centrist?
564200	568000	Anyone who genuinely fell into the center should be starting to feel a bit more like
568000	569320	they're on the left.
569320	573840	Some of the ideals you claim to profess are currently under attack from the right, which
573840	578560	still has considerable power in the US government and, to be honest, a lot of governments around
578560	579560	the world right now.
579560	584320	But the committed centrist, who sees virtue in always taking the middle ground, they find
584320	588600	themselves being dragged along with the window, staying committed to seeing the virtue in
588600	593400	both sides, even if that means moving along with a side that is now becoming increasingly
593400	598780	hostile towards the values that this committed centrist supposedly held.
598780	604120	Their commitment lies in appearing thoughtful, weighing both sides of a situation.
604120	606640	The Acosta example is great.
606640	611080	The right to a free press is in the very text of the Constitution, and freedom of speech
611080	615360	is something we have heard about endlessly from these committed centrists.
615360	619880	But now it's being abandoned, all in an appeal to remaining a committed centrist and
619880	624120	trying to give credence to calls for civility from the Trump White House.
624120	628040	In Nuance Bro's case, he's supporting kicking journalists out of the press bowl because
628040	632560	they ask a few too many questions in a way that he doesn't consider respectful.
632560	636380	This is how the right is playing centrists, and dragging them further to the right under
636380	640360	the guise of remaining even-handed.
640360	644640	And while I finished really quickly with this one, so while you're still here, why not
644640	649800	like this video, or comment on it, or you can also follow me on Twitter, ask me a question
