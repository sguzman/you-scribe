1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
I was working on a video a few weeks back defending Don Lemon from charges of racism.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,560
For those who missed that mini-outrage, Lemon said white men, particularly right-wing white

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,320
men, were responsible for most of the terrorism in the United States, a verifiable fact.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
The backlash was predictable, calling him a racist, Nazi, etc.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,440
You know, that thing the left is always accused of, but is constantly heard from voices on

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
the right?

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,960
In making that video, I kept asking myself, how did I get here?

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,160
As someone on the left, why am I defending a center-left journalist working for CNN?

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,520
Have the lines of defense been pushed so far back that I'm arguing from the center now?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:53,000
It's time to push back against centrism a little, and the trap we're all stuck in.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,600
So I have to talk about a YouTuber named NuanceBro.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,280
You can tell he's a man of nuance, because in the recent U.S. midterm election, according

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
to his shirt, instead of voting for a Democrat or a Republican, he voted for nuance.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't think nuance picked up many seats, though.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,960
He claims to be making videos that look at both sides of an issue, and then uses facts

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
and reason to figure out the truth.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,240
He has a few debunking videos where he takes on Black Lives Matter, gun control, and the

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,160
pink tax, and he has commentary videos where he defends various Trump policies and attacks

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
left-leaning media.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,160
On the other hand, he also criticized Candace Owens for denying global warming one time.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,120
So that's the sort of balance you see while glancing over his channel.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,840
Highlighting one example briefly, during the recent kerfuffle over CNN's Jim Acosta having

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,200
his press credentials revoked, Acosta had bumped into a female aide working for the

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Trump White House.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,720
There was a very stupid uproar about this, and NuanceBro didn't want to get left out

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
of it.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,080
Like a good little centrist, he came down on both sides of the issue.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,560
He didn't fall into the obviously stupid line that karate master Jim Acosta had viciously

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,240
chopped this young woman's arm, because, you know, there's a video that shows it's

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
clearly accidental.

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,080
So I guess credit to NuanceBro for not bawling for one of the dumbest talking points I've

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
seen in the last, well, only couple of weeks.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:38,320
There was another part to NuanceBro's take.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,640
Here's the clip he used to prove that.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Thank you, Mr. President.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,880
I wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
in the midterms.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Here we go.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,760
As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,920
It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Thank you for telling me that.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I appreciate it.

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,680
Why did you why did you characterize it as such?

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,320
Because I consider it an invasion.

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,280
You and I have a difference of opinion.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
They're hundreds of miles away, though.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
That's not an invasion.

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,320
Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
You run CNN.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
All right.

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,560
If I may ask one of the questions, Mr. President, if I may ask one of the questions, are you

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
worried?

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
That's enough.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
That's enough.

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I was going to ask one of the other folks.

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
That's enough.

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Pardon me, ma'am.

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Excuse me.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
That's enough.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,960
If I may ask on on the Russia investigation, are you concerned that that you may have

64
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm not concerned about anything with you may have a certain investigation because it's

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
a hoax.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Are you?

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
That's enough.

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Put down the mic.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Acosta was pretty aggressive in his questioning, but ultimately he did sit down and let someone

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
else have a turn.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,480
The whole exchange lasted two minutes.

73
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,160
More important than Acosta's questioning was that Trump's answers were non-answers.

74
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,040
When Acosta calls him out on it, Trump pivots to insulting him instead.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,680
The caravan was not an invasion.

76
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,520
It's a it's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
with the U.S.

78
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Thank you for that.

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:25,040
And why did you why did you characterize it as such as I consider it an invasion?

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,440
You and I have a difference of opinion.

81
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,760
Do you think that saying we have a difference of opinion on what an invasion is is a bullshit

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
answer.

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,520
And both Trump and Acosta know it.

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,920
So Acosta pressed him on it, which is what journalists are supposed to do.

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,600
And speaking of rudeness, during that two minutes, Trump said that here we go, that

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,000
well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this could end.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,560
You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
working for them.

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,040
You are a rude, terrible person.

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
You shouldn't be working for CNN.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Now, whose behavior is unsuited to being at that press conference?

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,700
Nuance Bro also used some clips of Acosta shouting out questions at press events and

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,800
presents this idea that the press should sit quietly, wait their turn and be polite as

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
possible to the president.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,600
When the president is lying to your face, calling you names and saying you're the enemy

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,700
of the people, I think the days of sitting politely and waiting for your turn are over.

99
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,620
This play to civility has been keeping the press docile for years and it's nice to

100
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,060
see that changing.

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,220
Nuance Bro's appeal to that is an appeal to a servile press that behaves in obedience

102
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,620
to the power structures in the government.

103
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,520
In other words, his appeal to nuance is an inherently right-wing stance.

104
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,420
But here I am again, defending CNN, from the supposed center no less.

105
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,420
How does this keep happening?

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,880
We need to talk about centrism, both the real and fake kind.

107
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,920
Before discussing political theory, I want to offer this disclaimer.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,840
I am not an expert on the subject.

109
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,480
Although this comes from a basic understanding of political theory obtained from some light

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:19,200
reading and the forethought to ignore especially stupid commentators such asâ€¦

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
This is a graph of the left-right spectrum.

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,040
I know the two-dimensional graph is more popular nowadays, but for the purposes of this video

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,480
I want to focus on this one-dimensional one.

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Since it was made by me, it is, of course, absolutely accurate in all ways without any

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,800
trace of flaw or imperfection.

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,760
People find themselves across plenty of different points on the spectrum determined by what

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,720
they believe on a variety of issues.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,000
A centrist would exist in this middle area.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,180
To land here, they would need to have a mix of right and left opinions that average out

120
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,280
to the middle ground.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,000
Now before going on, I should mention this video isn't about people who happen to fall

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
into this region incidentally.

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,520
If that's where you are politically, you're probably wrong on a few issues, probably on

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,840
the right, but that's not what this video is about.

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,800
This video is about people who choose to be in the center.

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,920
People who make a purposeful effort to ensure that they balance both sides of a political

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,320
equation with a sense of fairness.

128
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,360
These are the centrists who are being played.

129
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Now let's make this image more complicated by talking about the Overton window.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,040
And no, I'm not talking about the shitty novel Glenn Beck wrote about two people who

131
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,000
start a make-out session by discussing the flat tax.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
This book exists, do not read it.

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,640
The Overton window, a political science tool created by Joseph P. Overton, describes the

134
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,360
range of permissible political thought within a system.

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,180
It helps to think of the left-right spectrum as a much longer continuum than it is typically

136
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
presented as.

137
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,080
If we zoom out, the right and left we see in our world today can be understood more

138
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,440
broadly in the context of history, where we can move much further in either direction.

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,160
And generally speaking, throughout most of recent history, we've been moving to the

140
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
left.

141
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,600
If the Overton window is the current range of typical political discourse, it moves along

142
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
the spectrum, to the left or right.

143
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
So when we talk about taking a position in the center, it's a center that's defined

144
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,200
by the time and place you live in.

145
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,560
In other words, you're taking a position in the center of the Overton window.

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,480
But what happens when that window starts to move?

147
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,440
The original Overton window argued that politicians set the parameters for discourse, so when

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,640
Democrats tilt to the right to appeal to centrists, and Republicans go so far right they're appealing

149
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,040
to fascists, the window itself shifts to the right.

150
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,400
With the rise of the Tea Party in the aughts, to the embrace of nationalism in Donald Trump

151
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,840
this year, it's plain to see that right-wing ideology is on the ascent in the United States

152
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,240
within political discourse, albeit perhaps not in actual public opinion.

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Here on YouTube, we've seen a surge in debates about race realism, ethno-states, anti-feminism,

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,320
and other toxic ideas, many of these ideas having long been consigned to the dustbin

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,520
of history.

156
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,720
But now they're making a comeback, broadening the conversation and trying to reintroduce

157
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
the ideas into our political discourse.

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,520
This alteration of our political discourse can stretch or outright push the Overton window

159
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,080
further right.

160
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,840
For those of us on the left, instead of debating more interesting topics or having to fight

161
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,360
for the protections of a free press from a president who doesn't like being asked

162
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,200
tough questions, but where does this leave the centrist?

163
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Anyone who genuinely fell into the center should be starting to feel a bit more like

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
they're on the left.

165
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,840
Some of the ideals you claim to profess are currently under attack from the right, which

166
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,560
still has considerable power in the US government and, to be honest, a lot of governments around

167
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
the world right now.

168
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,320
But the committed centrist, who sees virtue in always taking the middle ground, they find

169
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,600
themselves being dragged along with the window, staying committed to seeing the virtue in

170
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,400
both sides, even if that means moving along with a side that is now becoming increasingly

171
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,780
hostile towards the values that this committed centrist supposedly held.

172
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,120
Their commitment lies in appearing thoughtful, weighing both sides of a situation.

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,640
The Acosta example is great.

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,080
The right to a free press is in the very text of the Constitution, and freedom of speech

175
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,360
is something we have heard about endlessly from these committed centrists.

176
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,880
But now it's being abandoned, all in an appeal to remaining a committed centrist and

177
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,120
trying to give credence to calls for civility from the Trump White House.

178
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,040
In Nuance Bro's case, he's supporting kicking journalists out of the press bowl because

179
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,560
they ask a few too many questions in a way that he doesn't consider respectful.

180
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,380
This is how the right is playing centrists, and dragging them further to the right under

181
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,360
the guise of remaining even-handed.

182
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,640
And while I finished really quickly with this one, so while you're still here, why not

183
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,800
like this video, or comment on it, or you can also follow me on Twitter, ask me a question

184
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,280
