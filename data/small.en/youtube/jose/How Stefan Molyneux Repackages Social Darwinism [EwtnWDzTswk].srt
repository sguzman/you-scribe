1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I nearly died watching this video.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Stefan Molyneux promised he would tell me why I hated Trump.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,520
He promised me I had to wait for over 50 minutes before his tedious lecture finally got to

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,880
the goddamn point.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,440
So for anyone who wants the spoiler, here it is.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,040
People hate Trump because he's threatening to take away government assistance programs.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,080
There, just saved you an hour and five minutes.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,160
Although when you think about it, that sounds like a leftist critique, doesn't it?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,320
Why did it take Stefan 50 minutes just to get there?

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Well that's because leading up to you, he takes you through a reading of history that

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,680
mixes up bad science, a love of capitalism, and a touch of racism.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,560
Uh, I mean, race realism?

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,600
I think that's what he calls it.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,520
But of course we all know that's just repackaged racism, and if you don't know that, I have

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,440
a video of mine you can watch, and that explains the whole thing.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,080
A lot of what Stefan says in his video isn't really new.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,600
Stefan has this shtick where he drones on and on about a variety of topics hitting the

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,720
same talking points and tropes.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,960
I once heard advice that if you really believe passionately about something, prepare to be

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,120
boring about it.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
Stefan has really taken that to heart.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm gonna try and not do that with this video though.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,160
I need to mention something that Stefan didn't really bring up in his video, and that's social

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
Darwinism.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,560
Here's a definition of social Darwinism to get us started.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,040
A 19th century theory, inspired by Darwinism, by which the social order is accounted as

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,640
the product of natural selection of those persons best suited to existing living conditions

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,400
and in accord with which a position of laissez-faire is advocated.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,480
This theory was used to rationalize the oppression found through imperialism and capitalism prevalent

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
throughout the last few centuries.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,080
The basic idea behind it is that the British Empire was able to flourish because of their

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,400
essential superiority.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,940
That is, they were born to rule, while other races were born to serve.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,480
Or as Stefan would put it, some people are naturally more capable and others less capable.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,920
The origins of social Darwinism can be traced back to English philosopher Herbert Spencer

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,040
and his conception of society as a social organism.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,880
In Spencer's estimation, society, like an organism, needs to change and evolve on

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,520
its own without the onerous hand of a government.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,040
Although often attributed to Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection, the term

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,080
survival of the fittest was actually coined by Spencer, writing in his 1864 work Principles

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,360
of Biology, where he adapted Darwin's recently published theory into his own framework.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,240
You may have noticed I said adapted because, even though Spencer's work was called social

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,520
Darwinism, his theory of the social organism predates Darwin's theory by nearly a decade.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,000
Back then, Lamarckian evolution was the leading theory on why different species exist.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,520
As a quick sidebar, Lamarckian evolution is the idea that our offspring inherit the traits

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,240
we acquire throughout our lives.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,640
So, for example, a physically fit couple who got in shape through exercise will pass on

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
that physical fitness to their baby.

49
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,240
You can see this idea of evolution manifest itself in the anime Dragon Ball, where Goku's

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,560
sons Gohan and Goten have different power levels at age 6 because Goku had gotten stronger

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
in between the time of their conceptions.

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
And if this sounds completely idiotic to you, that's because it should.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
It doesn't make any sense, because that's not how genes work.

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,080
Back to Spencer.

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,480
An earlier version of his social organism theory can be read in his 1851 work Social

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Statics, published 8 years before Darwin's On the Origin of Species.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,520
And it shows the Lamarckian roots of Spencer's theory.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,280
Here he's basically talking about how society can evolve by shedding some of its weaker

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,600
members and instead focusing on more of its, as Stefan might put it, capable people.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,360
It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death.

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,800
Nevertheless, when regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,160
humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence, the

63
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,720
same beneficence that brings to early graves the children of diseased parents and singles

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,200
out the low-spirited, the intemperate, and the debilitated as the victims of an epidemic.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
I wouldn't take this guy as a moral instructor, basically.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,840
I would see him as a fucking maniac, Jesus.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,320
If we look further in history, we can actually see Social Darwinism's roots go back even

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,960
further than the disturbing psychopathic rants of Spencer.

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Here's a rather telling quote from slightly before his time.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,720
One writer compared the extermination of these races by white settlers as being like the

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,960
melting of snow before the advancing rays of the sun.

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,440
Oh yeah, that was pretty rough.

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,080
As best I can tell, that quote is slightly paraphrased from the writings of Alexis de

74
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,240
Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont.

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
These are taken from writings about their travels through America in the very early

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
19th century, where they witnessed the effects of colonialism first hand.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,440
We can probably travel back even further and find more examples of people being assholes

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,320
to the poor and to different races.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,960
But Social Darwinism's origins have less to do with Darwin's theory and more to do

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
with assholes who believed in the superiority of their race or class.

81
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Their misappropriation of science was an effort to give that form of discrimination some legitimacy.

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,600
The marriage of this hatred with Darwin's new theory via Spencer and other Social Darwinists

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
was fashionable in the 19th century.

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm going to go back to that BBC doc I showed you a few moments ago to explain it more succinctly

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
than I can.

86
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,480
But evolution also suggested that there had to be losers in this great cosmic process

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,600
and the losers were those peoples who could not compete.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,760
And once put into competition with superior races were doomed to disappear.

89
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,240
And this was likely to happen to all the native peoples in North America and the Pacific

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,920
and in Africa.

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,080
Across the world, the crimes of imperialism now came to be taken as proof that the Social

92
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,720
Darwinists were right.

93
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Social Darwinism went on to be a strong rationalization for the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism,

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,760
a form of capitalism that insists the system works best when the government does as little

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
as possible to intervene.

96
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,520
If workers were exploited and owners were getting fat off profits, this was explained

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,120
through the lens of Social Darwinism as the natural order.

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,480
Stefan, as most other Social Darwinists, take the position that the inferior people, or

99
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,220
less capable people, will be less successful at passing on their genes.

100
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,160
That is, at least according to Stefan, until communism showed up and started demanding

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,720
that the damn government step in with its social programs like education and healthcare

102
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,440
just to make sure these damn poor people who are less capable would survive and have a

103
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,960
higher quality of life, I guess.

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Makes one wonder why these inferior people are still with us if they should have been

105
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,560
bred out of the population so long ago.

106
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,640
Stefan's logic goes, people who hate Trump are afraid that their social programs will

107
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,580
go away, and the reason they need those social programs is because they are genetically inferior.

108
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,980
In other words, he's repackaged Social Darwinism and doesn't have the courtesy to tip his

109
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,900
hat to Herbert Spencer, Thomas Huxley, William Grant Sumner, and all the other Social Darwinists

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
of the past.

111
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
What a dick.

112
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,680
Although I guess if he's a dick, he really is living up to their legacy.

113
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
And to clarify one thing here, not all visions of Social Darwinism are the same, I'm giving

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
you a very brief overview here.

115
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,860
Some Social Darwinists were believers in imperialism, others not so much.

116
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,600
If you're curious though, one book that's been recommended by more well-read people

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,080
on the subject than me is Richard Hofstetter's Social Darwinism in American Thought.

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,240
It was published in the 1950s, but considering this is a 19th century ideology, it's still

119
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,960
pretty applicable.

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,800
So why is Social Darwinism wrong?

121
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,320
Social Darwinists will use the mantra of survival of the fittest, but evolution is

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,080
actually more accurately survival of the most adaptable, which is not nearly as catchy unfortunately.

123
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,960
Let's use cats as an example, because eh, the internet loves cats, right?

124
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,240
So when we think of the most evolved, so to speak, of cats, you might think of the biggest

125
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,580
and baddest one out there, the tiger, and yes it's the tiger, shut the fuck up lion people.

126
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,780
But interestingly, a far more successful hunter is this little guy, the black-footed

127
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
cat.

128
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,300
See here on video it's so cute, oh god it's so fucking cute, oh I can't, oh my god I

129
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,200
want one of these so much, they're wild animals, they deserve to be free and ugh.

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,660
It's one of the smallest cats in the wild, and while there is some slight concern to

131
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,660
its welfare as a species, it's generally thought to be in pretty good shape, or at

132
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,520
the very least, it's in far better shape than the tiger.

133
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,520
This adorable cat survives not because it's the biggest, strongest one out there, but

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,600
because it's adapted to its environment successfully.

135
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,640
As a small side note though, while tigers may be less successful hunters than the black-footed

136
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,920
cat, I need to stress that the only reason they're threatened as a species is because

137
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,360
of the invasive homo sapiens who are taking up its space and in some cases killing them?

138
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,840
No shade to the tigers, you guys are, you guys are the fucking best.

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,720
Nothing comes in all shapes and sizes, and there is no hierarchy in evolution.

140
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,440
Nothing is more or less evolved than the other, things only need to be able to reproduce,

141
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
and from an evolutionary standpoint, that's really all that matters.

142
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Now when you think about it, we've all, and I say we as in all organisms living on this

143
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,160
planet, have been evolving for the same amount of time, so a single-celled organism isn't

144
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,080
any more or less evolved than a human because single-celled organisms are still reproducing,

145
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,400
they're still pretty successful, they're all over the place.

146
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,860
Here's the real kicker though, unlike that example I used above of the two cats, it turns

147
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,440
out human beings are all part of a single species.

148
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,000
Implicit in the idea of social Darwinism is that human beings can be divided into different

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
groups.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
In this particular case, it would be different races and classes.

151
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,960
I've already talked about the arbitrary nature of race, but can class be explained by genetic

152
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,440
differences?

153
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Turns out, no.

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,320
In a paper titled, Genetics in Social Class by Dr. N. A. Holtzman from Genetics and Public

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins Medical, he concludes that the roots of social class differences

156
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,080
do not lie in our genes.

157
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,120
Consequently, genetics cannot be used as a justification for maintaining a ruling class,

158
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,600
limiting procreation among the poor, or minimizing social support programs.

159
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,880
The difficulty of class mobility being reduced to genetic weakness is a way of rationalizing

160
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,720
the inequalities that are created and reinforced by a system that keeps the rich rich and the

161
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
poor poor.

162
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,560
Reading between the lines of Stefan's argument of more capable and less capable humans, we

163
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,520
can see that this is just a way for him to pretend that the differences in social standings

164
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,280
between races and classes are part of the natural order.

165
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,800
Stefan has made the mistake of assuming that the way something is is the way it ought to

166
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
be.

167
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
That's conservatism in a nutshell, really.

168
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,880
Imagine if someone had said that about, I don't know, slavery or women having the right

169
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,260
to vote.

170
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,240
Another problem for Stefan is that he's looking at the present without thinking of the history

171
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,320
as also a series of present moments.

172
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,040
If we chose a different point of history and used his perspective, you could actually come

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,440
up with a completely different conclusion.

174
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Imagine if you were in the 13th or 14th century.

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,040
You could argue that the Mongolians were the superior race because the Mongol Empire controlled

176
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,560
most of Asia and was one of the largest empires in human history.

177
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,540
In the 7th and 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate was enormous and was the largest single entity

178
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,100
controlling the highly coveted Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean.

179
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,620
Were the people of the Umayyad Caliphate the superior race?

180
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,780
The Han Dynasty of the, uh, Otts, I guess, were at the helm of a massive and powerful

181
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,060
Chinese empire.

182
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,220
If we were in that point of history, were the Han Chinese the superior race?

183
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,900
You can say that all those empires faded away and were displaced by others later on, but

184
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,780
how can you possibly say that that would never happen again?

185
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,500
What makes white people so special that their empire will be the last one?

186
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,180
The British might have thought that their empire was the greatest of all time, and now

187
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,060
it pales in comparison to what the United States is capable of doing with its pseudo-empire.

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,260
And for the record, I would certainly agree that the rise of an empire is influenced in

189
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,900
a small way by the genes of the empire builders, because all people are products of their genes

190
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,100
in society, but you can extrapolate the personalities and characteristics of imperialists to anyone

191
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,180
with the same skin color.

192
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,500
History teaches us quite clearly that all peoples are capable of creating empires.

193
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,040
That doesn't mean it's natural for one race to supplant another, it just means sometimes

194
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,680
assholes can exploit broken systems to attain power and abuse it.

195
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,760
Which brings us back to Donald Trump.

196
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,680
You don't need Stephon Molyneux's half-assed babble to tell you why you hate Trump.

197
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,560
Anyone who hates him can probably tell you why themselves.

198
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Personally, I hate Trump's misogyny.

199
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
I don't even know what.

200
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
And when you're a star, they let you do it.

201
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
You can do anything.

202
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Whatever you want.

203
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Grab them by the pussy.

204
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I can do anything.

205
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,600
Racism, xenophobia.

206
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,120
Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here, referring to African

207
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,820
countries and Haiti, the president then went on to talk about how they needed to bring

208
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,240
in more people from places like Norway.

209
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Jingoism.

210
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,440
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing

211
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,640
our companies and destroying our jobs.

212
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,120
And perhaps most of all his unbridled stupidity.

213
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,000
My two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There.

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Was that so tough?

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
Geez, less than half the time, too.
