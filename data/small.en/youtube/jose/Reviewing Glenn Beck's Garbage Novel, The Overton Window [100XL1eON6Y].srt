1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
The Overton Window is what happens when you cross a bland political thriller with the

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,840
ravings of a conspiracy theorist.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,720
It's cynical, lazy, and a complete waste of time.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
It's also a complete grift.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,440
It probably won't convince anyone new with its paranoid premise, but it does comfortably

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,480
remind believers that, yes, their country can only be saved by their love of America

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,120
and guns.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,280
To understand this book, we have to go back to when it was published, 2010, and remind

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,040
ourselves of the phenomena that was Glenn Beck.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,280
Glenn Beck really used to be somebody.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,920
He still technically is, but back then he was a really big deal.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,520
A former radio personality, Glenn Beck's start in the cable TV news world was in 2006

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,280
on CNN's Headline News Channel.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,200
By 2008 he had made the jump to Fox News, and within a few years he had become one of

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,600
the hottest shows on cable news.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,280
He had several best-selling books to his name, and he was the spiritual leader of the new

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,520
Tea Party movement.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,960
Glenn Beck's specialty was reciting facts, drawing lines, connecting them on a chalkboard,

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,840
and expressing deep concern that these things might be connected.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,280
Glenn's rants were filled with things the right hates and fears, randomly bundled together

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
in an hour of rage and tears.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:38,480
And I do mean literal tears.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,880
And I don't bring this up to mock Glenn, there's actually nothing wrong with a grown man crying.

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,780
Instead I'm going to use this to illustrate what he does with these tears.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,760
He sells emotions hard, and his generally pleasant demeanor makes him easy to empathize

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
with.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,040
And once you start empathizing with this sad crying man, you're ready to turn on those

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,280
mean things that made him cry.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,440
And what are those mean things?

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,120
This image sums it up nicely.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,280
There's something about the expression on Glenn's face here.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,040
He has pictures of various people underneath the watchful gaze of Chairman Mao, and he

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,560
looks at us in confusion-ness if to say, what aren't you people getting about how obvious

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
this is?

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,200
It's something that seems silly if it's just thrown out at you in a random video like

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,040
this one, but if you'd just been having a cry with this guy, you'd be far more sympathetic

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,680
to this bizarre image and you might actually sit down and listen to his ravines and might

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,600
even give it some credence.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,560
He's using those emotions as a way of manipulating you.

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,000
He also had this thing where he kept calling everything a Nazi, particularly if they were

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:06,840
working for the Obama administration.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,240
The content of Glenn Beck's rantings, or as much content as could be found, was about

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,400
an impending doom brought on by the out-of-control spending of the Obama administration.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,960
The debt would, according to Beck, herald the end of the country and the collapse of

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920
American life as we know it.

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
So he sounded off every night to his loyal followers, becoming a major figure in the

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,800
Tea Party movement.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,400
The Tea Party movement was ostensibly a group of concerned American citizens who were very

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,640
much bothered by the increasing debt and out-of-control spending of the US government.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,100
We sometimes forget about the Tea Party, but 10 years ago they were responsible for a major

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,120
shift to the right in the Republican Party, a shift that we're still feeling today, a

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,440
shift that's included more tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts to welfare programs, and a general

53
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,680
hostility to even the mildest forms of expanding the social safety net.

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Glenn Beck was deeply connected to this audience, the same audience that would sneer at the

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,040
Republican establishment, ignore the criticisms of the mainstream media, and embraced a conman

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,640
posing as an outsider promising to tear down the system.

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,100
It would be unfair to say this all started 10 years ago exactly, but in this book, The

58
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,360
Overton Window, we have a wonderful symbol of the right-wing populism that was becoming

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,280
more mainstream back in 2010.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,960
This novel takes its title from the concept of the Overton Window, created by Joseph P.

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Overton.

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,600
The window describes a range of acceptable political thought within society at any given

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
time.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
It's tied along a number of different dimensions, like the scope of left and right-wing politics,

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,480
but Glenn Beck prefers its original definition, describing the range of freedom within a society.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,480
This book was preceded by a ridiculous trailer that uses the lines from a Rudyard Kipling

67
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,280
poem titled The Gods of the Copybook Headings.

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,960
The poem is referenced several times throughout the novel, and has a degree of thematic resonance

69
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
within it.

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,400
As surely as fire will burn, the gods of the copybook headings, with terror and slaughter

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
return.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,000
The Overton Window.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
That trailer is just… wow.

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,960
I've never seen a book trailer quite like that one.

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,400
To be honest though, I don't see many trailers for books at all.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,160
Before we dive into the narrative though, there are two things we need to look at.

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,660
First, this cover.

78
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,580
At first glance, the image of the Statue of Liberty looking towards the horizon seems

79
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,640
bland and uninspired, but if we zoom in on the statue's body you can tell it's much

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,620
more jacked than the original, and you can even see a bit of a beard as the statue very

81
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,180
politely turns their head back towards us.

82
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,380
For some reason, the Statue of Liberty is a man, and he's holding some kind of weapon,

83
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,540
I think, instead of the usual stone tablets.

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,180
This wasn't the only cover that was being considered.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,380
Glenn posted a number of options on his website, and held a poll to pick out the winner.

86
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,940
The cover chosen came in fourth… out of four.

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,500
Inside the book itself, we get a little note from the author before the narrative starts,

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
and oh boy, does the opening paragraphs at the stage for what's wrong with this book.

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,340
I'm going to channel my inner Glenn Beck here.

90
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,380
I've been a fan of thrillers for many years.

91
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,500
While non-fiction books aim to enlighten the goal of most thrillers is to entertain.

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,800
But there is a category of novels that do both… faction.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,960
Completely fictional books with plots rooted in fact, and that is the category I strive

94
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,600
for with the Overton Window.

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Okay, so first off, novels have been more than entertainment since they were created,

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,920
and second of all, we've had novels set in the real world plenty of times.

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm not sure why Glenn feels the need to invent a new word here, but let's stop to

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,600
appreciate the one he came up with.

99
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Faction?

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,680
First of all, faction is already a word, but I'm pretty sure he wants it pronounced FACT-tion.

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,920
This invented word does not bode well for the rest of this book.

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
The rest of the note reads like classic Glenn Beck paranoia.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,480
He expertly gets so close to the line of outright proclaiming there's a conspiracy afoot,

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,520
and then immediately walks it back, winking over his shoulder.

105
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Here's a prime example.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,680
But while many of the facts embedded in the plot are true, see the afterword for details,

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,280
the scenarios I create as a result of those facts, along with the way things are tied

108
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,040
together and the conclusions that are drawn, are entirely fictional.

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,320
Let's hope they stay that way.

110
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,800
Glenn lets us know that this book is complete fiction, and that he's just tried to warn

111
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
us of something that is definitely not real, but it could be.

112
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,620
And people say he's crazy for saying this could be true, and he's not saying that,

113
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,120
but it could be.

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
And I hope you can all see how this little game works.

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,720
Get as close to the ridiculous line as you can, and you'll attract an audience willing

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,280
to take that extra step in their minds, leaving you ostensibly blameless.

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Now let's dive into the story itself.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,920
Noah is a 28-year-old VP in a PR firm run by his father, Arthur.

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Here's how the book describes Noah.

120
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,960
Good looking, great job, fine education, puckishly amusing, and even clever when he put his mind

121
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
to it.

122
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,720
Reasonably fit and trim for an office jockey, Noah had all the bona fide credentials for

123
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
a killer e-harmony profile.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,040
Who could resist?

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
Well I'll tell you who.

126
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,040
The new girl working in the mail room who catches Noah's eye, a southern woman named

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,560
Molly Ross.

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,040
You can tell she's one of the book's heroes because, like only the most virtuous

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,840
women in their 20s, she's hanging up flyers for her American Patriots group meeting for

130
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
that evening.

131
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,880
They call themselves, and I wish I was making this up, the Founders Keepers.

132
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Thankfully, the opposition isn't called something even stupider like Losers Reapers.

133
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,240
Molly toys with Noah in exchanges like this one.

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
For context, Noah has just said he'd be headed for the meeting Molly was posting flyers

135
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
for.

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
That reminds me of the joke, Molly said.

137
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,720
Noah comes home, Noah from the Bible, you know?

138
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
He nodded.

139
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,480
So Noah comes home after he finally got all the animals into the ark and his wife asks

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,040
him what he's been doing all week.

141
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,240
Do you know what he said to her?

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,120
No, tell me.

143
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Molly patted him on the cheek, pulled his face a little closer.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,440
He said, honey, now I heard everything.

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,840
This is how the whole book is written.

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,760
So Molly is a tough woman, not easily charmed by Noah, which is really easy to believe because

147
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Noah is completely lacking in charm.

148
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,840
Next we meet Arthur, Noah's father and head of Doyle and Merchant.

149
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,960
Arthur is a cold man, and he has a very low opinion of most people, especially compared

150
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
to him.

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,960
In the chapter we meet him, he gives us the first of what will be several long, dull monologues.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,440
This won't be a surprise to anyone who's familiar with the show Glenn Beck used to

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,920
have on Fox News.

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,040
Glenn had a tendency to go on these long, droning sermons, and when characters like

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Arthur in this chapter go on one, you can't help but hear Glenn Beck's voice come through

156
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
every painful beat.

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,520
I'll spare you the ten pages of ranting this guy goes on for and cut to the heart of it.

158
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Arthur's rant is largely just him explaining how the government is completely corrupt and

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,160
that it needs to take control of the people, to usher them into a new age where they are

160
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
safely under the thumb of the elites.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,280
That's basically everything Glenn imagines someone like Barack Obama is saying behind

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
closed doors.

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,560
The United States government has approached Arthur and his company for public relations

164
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,480
help for a recent document that got leaked, listing various groups the government has

165
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
under surveillance.

166
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,040
The document is a list of conspiracy theorists, extreme conservative activists, and other

167
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,160
names assigned to members of Glenn Beck's audience, along with a few outliers to make

168
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
it seem legitimate.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,640
By placing his audience in the crosshairs, this is how Glenn Beck breeds loyalty.

170
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,520
He's inventing a threat, using the supposed language of the dark left-wing establishment

171
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,520
and telling his audience that they're being targeted with said words.

172
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,720
Arthur eventually convinces the government that they should let him take the reins of

173
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,480
their messaging because a grand opportunity is afoot.

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,560
Now, Arthur Gardner said, his voice just above a whisper, while the tide is in our favor,

175
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
come with me.

176
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,680
You can still save yourselves, and in doing so, you can help us build a whole new world

177
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
upon the ashes of the old.

178
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,120
Noah heads over to the tavern Molly and her Patriot friends are all hanging out in.

179
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,680
He obviously just wants to see Molly, though, because he's way into her.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,280
While on the way, Noah's out-of-control cab driver gets stopped by security forces, who

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,080
are out in numbers because of the G20 summit happening.

182
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,040
It's weird that this G20 plot point is brought up and never mentioned again, but it does

183
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,600
give Noah the chance to use the sovereign citizen defense of, am I being detained?

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,960
Which somehow totally works.

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,120
His cab driver is less lucky, as he gets hauled away by cops.

186
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
The rise met.

187
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
Noah and that driver.

188
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
What he was yelling now wasn't hard to understand, probably words he'd practiced from a phrasebook

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,000
for some bad night that might come along when he'd need them.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,040
Help me, my friend.

191
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,400
I have to offer partial credit to Glenn here for portraying this guy in a sympathetic light.

192
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,120
He's clearly the victim, and if anything, Noah comes off as an asshole, shrugging it

193
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
off and getting on with his evening.

194
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
So there's some genuine sympathy here.

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,480
Not enough to give this cab driver a name, background, or even closure since we never

196
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,560
see him again.

197
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,840
Also him mouthing those words, which for some reason aren't in quotation marks, are, as

198
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
best I can tell, the only lines that were spoken by a person of color in this entire

199
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
book.

200
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,320
At least, the only character who is explicitly not white.

201
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Noah shrugs off the police state's shakedown and finally gets to the tavern to meet the

202
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,920
founder's keepers.

203
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,600
The crowd here are obviously meant to be stand-ins for the Tea Party movement, and it's cute

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,380
how Glenn describes them like this.

205
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,880
The diversity of the gathering was another surprise.

206
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,120
There seemed to be no clear exclusions based on race or class or any of the other traditional

207
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,080
media-fed American cultural divides.

208
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,040
It was a total cross-section, a mix of everyone, three-piece suits rubbing elbows with t-shirts

209
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,440
and sweatpants, yuppies chatting with hippies, black and white, young and old, a cowboy hat

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,280
here, a $600 haircut there, all talking together, energetically agreeing and disagreeing as

211
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
he moved through them.

212
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,680
In the press, these sorts of meanings were typically depicted as the exclusive haunts

213
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,000
of old white people of limited beings and even more limited intelligence.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,440
But this was everybody.

215
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,360
This gathering of definitely not just white people reads as deeply insecure from the outside.

216
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
But for anyone within the Tea Party movement, scenes like this must come across as sweet

217
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,200
vindication.

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,600
And even though Glenn claims this patriot gathering in his book is diverse, every character

219
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,520
we meet who has any lines to speak will be white.

220
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,760
Like Molly's friend Hollis, who is big and, uh, nice, I guess?

221
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,520
There's really not a lot to say about this guy.

222
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,200
And what would this gathering be without a few more Glenn Beck rants?

223
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,240
A pair of them this time lasting eight and four pages, respectively.

224
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,000
And it's here it starts to sink in that everyone basically agrees about how the world works.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Even though the Founders' Keeper speakers are foils to Arthur Gardner, the content of

226
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,600
their speeches talk about the same things, the impending disaster, the corruption right

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
through the government, and how the elites are pulling all the strings.

228
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,320
All these rants toss out facts, draw lazy connections, and everyone just nods along.

229
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
There's no real debate or questioning of anything in this book.

230
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,280
Everyone believes in the conspiracy.

231
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,480
It's just a question of whether they support it or fight against it.

232
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,920
The first of the two speakers is Beverly Emerson, Molly's mother.

233
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,360
She manages to cite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. without ever mentioning race.

234
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,500
She also holds up a constitution and does what a lot of this book will do, present this

235
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,920
document as a sacred text.

236
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,640
She talks about the founding fathers less like men and more like prophets.

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,080
The book is dripping with sanctification of the United States' founding.

238
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,920
The next speech comes from a guy named Danny Bailey.

239
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,560
His speech is lots of random facts, once again tenuously connected by arbitrary threads.

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,840
Danny is presented as less credible than the other speakers, and perhaps more of a rabble

241
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
rouser.

242
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,420
He's someone who got famous through a viral YouTube video, and he acts like an egotistical

243
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
rock star.

244
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,880
He seems like an obvious analog for Glenn Beck himself.

245
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,160
Noah scoffs at Danny's speech and gets instantly put on the spot, and then he goes into a rant

246
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,120
of his own where, instead of presenting a different take on the fear-mongering and wild

247
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,160
conspiracy theories being presented, he just agrees with them.

248
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,720
This is all part of Noah's three-page rant, which is only interrupted when a gunshot goes

249
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
off and the tavern is swarmed by police.

250
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,520
Noah is arrested along with everyone else, but is eventually released because he's a

251
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,120
rich guy with connections.

252
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,280
Noah uses his connections to get the other Founders' Keeper's members released from

253
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,280
prison, and he takes Molly and her mom to their respective homes in his limo.

254
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,360
Molly's mom gets dropped off pretty quickly, so Noah and Molly can have a sort of date

255
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,840
as he drives her around New York City.

256
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,640
The limo ride is supposedly about Noah and Molly getting closer, but we instead get more

257
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,080
long rants, highlighting, among many other things, how Bill Clinton was utterly ruthless.

258
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,640
Somehow this rant about Bill Clinton charms Molly, and after a kiss, she follows Noah

259
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,060
back to his apartment.

260
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,100
The dialogue makes a shift from long-winded rants to painful banter between Noah and Molly.

261
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,840
She lets him know she isn't going to have sex with him, and bonus points for Noah actually

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,960
respecting her need to consent, especially since the scene ends with the two of them

263
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
in bed together.

264
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,320
If you thought a woman crawling into bed with a man and wrapping her arm around him would

265
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,280
lead to a hookup, you'd be wrong, because this book is very squeamish about depicting

266
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
sex.

267
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,360
But maybe Molly realized she could never have sex with a man who says something like this.

268
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm telling you right now, you made the rules, but you're playing with fire here.

269
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,520
I've got some rules too, and rule number one is, don't tease the panther.

270
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,280
Who could possibly have sex with someone after they've said that?

271
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,480
Elsewhere, Danny Bailey is approached by another major character for this book's plot, an

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,760
FBI agent named Stuart Kearns.

273
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,840
Kearns picks up Danny from the police station, taking Danny into his custody.

274
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,520
Kearns has been working in deep cover for over a decade, posing as an online conspiracy

275
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
theorist.

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,680
His mission is to make people who question the government look like ridiculous paranoid

277
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
weirdos.

278
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,440
He's more or less embodying the real-world conspiracy theories that Alex Jones is a government

279
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,040
plant designed to undercut other supposedly credible conspiracy theory movements.

280
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,080
Kearns recruits an unwilling Danny with threats of jail time.

281
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,480
He's using Danny, an activist with a degree of credibility and fame thanks to his YouTube

282
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,320
viral video, to further the FBI's agenda to discredit right-wing activist groups.

283
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,480
More on how this plot thread plays out later.

284
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,560
The next morning, Molly starts to pressure Noah to break into his father's office to

285
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,080
steal some documents.

286
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,780
These documents are related to the meeting mentioned earlier where Arthur went on that

287
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,360
Glenn Beck grant for 10 pages, the meeting about the leaked document that Arthur's firm

288
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,200
was hired to cover up.

289
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,520
Noah refuses to do it, and then Molly drops this on him.

290
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,180
Do you want me to leave?

291
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,160
Her voice was tight, and there were sudden tears in her eyes.

292
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,360
Do you never want to see me again?

293
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,120
Because that's what this means.

294
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,040
The book is helpfully establishing that Molly is also an awful person.

295
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Noah and Molly break into the office by using the very clever covert method of Noah using

296
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,160
his keycard to walk in, and suddenly the conspiracy everyone already believed in is revealed

297
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,200
via some PowerPoint slides.

298
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,560
The grand plan is to trigger a catastrophic event that will shift the Overton window in

299
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,120
the direction towards creating more government oversight, taking away people's freedom.

300
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,160
All this physical evidence of a grand conspiracy only gets vaguely mentioned throughout the

301
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,920
rest of this book, because the only thing that really matters in this scene is that

302
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,240
Noah and Molly have learned that something big is happening within the next few days,

303
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,640
possibly a terrorist attack staged by the shadowy group.

304
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,680
The break-in scene also gives us a nice list of objectives the shadowy group has lined

305
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,800
up which include things like social justice and internationalism, but I want to highlight

306
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,760
one particular bullet point on this list.

307
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,080
Expand malleable voter base and agenda support by granting voting rights to prison inmates,

308
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,920
undocumented migrants, and select U.S. territories, Puerto Rico.

309
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,480
Image as a civil rights issue, labeled dissenters as racist, invoke reliable analogies, slavery,

310
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,960
Nazism, segregation, isolationism.

311
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,240
The phrase malleable voter base has a lot, especially when we're talking about the specific

312
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,120
people that make up prison inmates, undocumented migrants, and Puerto Rico.

313
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,240
We're talking about the Black and Hispanic populations.

314
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,400
Why exactly are these people malleable?

315
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,440
Could it perhaps have something to do with their race?

316
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,140
The most charitable interpretation I could come up with is that being given the right

317
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,040
to vote would make them become the tools of whatever party gave them that right.

318
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,080
Imagine this argument being used against giving women the right to vote.

319
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
And how are people convicted in prison more malleable?

320
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,840
I'd expect the opposite, to be honest.

321
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,320
And let's not mince words about undocumented migrants.

322
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,600
This isn't just about granting them voting rights.

323
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,880
This is about the power of citizenship.

324
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,120
This whole little section is just another example of one of the uglier forms of racist

325
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,640
disenfranchisement Glenn Beck smuggles into his work.

326
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
Back to the plot.

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,520
Noah and Molly head over to the secret hideout of the Founders Keepers, a small apartment

328
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,240
in a less-than-reputable New York City neighborhood.

329
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,360
It's filled with conspiracy theory literature and tons of guns.

330
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,620
Hollis shows up again to give us a painful metaphor about how guns are like cookies.

331
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,720
The best ones are homemade.

332
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,360
I don't think that's true, but it hardly matters, because Hollis goes away after that

333
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,560
and we never see him again.

334
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,940
Nice knowing you, Hollis.

335
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,040
We meet some other members of the Founders Keepers.

336
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,720
They're named Patrick, Ethan, George, Thomas, Benjamin, Samuel, John, Alexander, James,

337
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,320
Nathaniel, another Benjamin, Franklin, Rush, William, and Steven.

338
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,280
These names, as you might have guessed, belong to the various Founding Fathers, and they

339
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,600
aren't the actual names of the characters.

340
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,960
Each one of these characters has been tasked with memorizing the works of the corresponding

341
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,060
Founding Father, and they sit around in a circle reciting the words to one another.

342
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,760
This is something lifted directly from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, in which all books

343
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,860
are being burned by a totalitarian government, and people in the Resistance commit books

344
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,400
to memory to save their contents for future generations.

345
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,080
It doesn't really work in the context of the Overton Window, though, since it's not

346
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,780
like the writings of the Founding Fathers are being banned or destroyed.

347
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,160
The book says people are just kind of ignoring them.

348
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm not sure how these handful of people memorizing them is going to change that.

349
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,020
To me, it reads more like these characters treating these works like scripture, something

350
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,680
to be committed to heart and shared in these prayer circles.

351
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,960
We also get some revisionist history as Glenn Beck frames the American Revolution as being

352
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,280
led from the pulpit, and credits the success of the Revolution to Americans staying religious.

353
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,400
You could make several videos about how the very selective reading of history Glenn Beck

354
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,800
has of the Founding Fathers, painting them as former religious than they were, but that's

355
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,400
a project for another book review, because there's so much more to go through in this

356
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
one.

357
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,200
The scene ends with Noah enjoying some lemonade, only to realize he had been drugged by Molly.

358
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,320
Betrayal.

359
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,040
As Danny and Agent Kerns travel along, we get some more talk about how accidents don't

360
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,840
just happen, and how Danny's own message, when it inspires violence, is actually being

361
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,960
twisted and distorted by the government, making it seem more violent than it really is.

362
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,360
I can't help but suspect Glenn might think of himself this way, or at least see it as

363
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,080
a convenient excuse when one of his listeners gets a little too excited.

364
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,360
For instance, when his conspiracy theory about the Tides Foundation led to one of his listeners

365
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,880
driving down there trying to shoot it up.

366
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,940
We learn a bit more of Agent Kerns' plan as he reveals he's stolen a fake nuclear

367
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,120
missile that he's delivering to a group of his more violent conspiracy theorist followers.

368
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,840
Kerns, being a really clever FBI agent, lets his hostage, Danny, grab a beer at a roadside

369
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
bar, all on his own.

370
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,440
Danny, not being a complete idiot, takes this chance to send a text message to Molly, informing

371
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,360
her to stay away from Las Vegas, and that the FBI is going to do something soon.

372
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,680
The five dudes Kerns and Danny are meeting are led by a guy named Elmer.

373
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,920
Using nothing more than his paranoia and knowledge of random facts, Danny also figures out this

374
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,080
Elmer guy must be Muhammad Atta, the guy behind the September 11th attacks, because, and I

375
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,960
kid you not, Atta at one time used the alias El Amir.

376
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,320
Of course there's the problem of Muhammad Atta having died in the 9-11 attacks, but

377
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,920
that's brushed aside as the US government manufacturing the idea that Muhammad Atta

378
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,880
is behind this nuclear attack, using the alias Elmer for some reason.

379
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,040
The logic here doesn't work, and for what it's worth, I believe the book is trying

380
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,840
to portray Danny as the unreliable conspiracy theorist.

381
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,680
How is Danny supposed to be less believable than Molly or Noah?

382
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,680
He goes on the same kinds of rants with tenuous connections between everything he says, but

383
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,520
what makes him wrong and other characters right?

384
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,880
But that's actually missing the point of this book.

385
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,800
This book isn't trying to convince us of a specific conspiracy, it's to get us to

386
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
adopt the conspiratorial mindset.

387
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Noah is revived after being drugged by Molly, and he's lectured by Arthur, who reveals

388
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
more of the plot.

389
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,920
It seems Molly infiltrated the PR company with the goal of releasing the document mentioned

390
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,640
way back in the beginning of the book, you know that government document that was leaked

391
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,040
listing all of the government's enemies.

392
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Now Molly was working for the PR firm that was hired to spin the news of the leaked document,

393
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,680
but how did she get access to the document before it got leaked?

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,480
How did the PR firm even know it existed until the government came to them to cover up the

395
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
leak?

396
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,520
I don't know how they got the document in the first place, none of this really makes

397
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,360
sense, but we're just supposed to roll with this.

398
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Okay.

399
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,280
Molly's bigger role in the infiltration though was to seduce Noah into revealing all those

400
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,880
precious PowerPoint slides he led her to a few chapters ago.

401
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,480
This does explain how she tolerated his awful sense of humor and creepy jokes, but how

402
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,640
did Noah fall for this so easily?

403
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,200
Well, turns out Molly had been researching Noah for months on social media, learning

404
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,720
everything about him, but the key was when she found a certain photo that represented

405
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
exactly what Noah was looking for in a woman.

406
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,280
We learn about it in this excerpt.

407
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,120
Noah turned over another page, and the next item hit him like a blow to the midsection.

408
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
He thought for the first second that it was another picture of Molly, and it seemed that

409
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,520
was exactly the point.

410
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,160
It was a photo of Noah's mother.

411
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,360
Molly seduced Noah by dressing up as his dead mother.

412
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Let's move on.

413
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,960
Arthur tries to talk some sense into Noah by explaining how people are inherently evil.

414
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,200
Then we find out the impending terror attack was actually Arthur's ideal this whole time.

415
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Noah soon learns that Molly's mother is in the hospital, and armed with the truth about

416
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,400
how Molly and her mother used him, he storms right down there to confront her with the

417
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,840
best possible care money can buy because he still totally loves Molly.

418
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,560
After all, what's a little deception and drugging when you finally meet someone who

419
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,760
looks like your mother and doesn't run away screaming when you refer to yourself as the

420
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,440
panther?

421
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,640
In the scene, we also meet a doctor named Ellen Davenport who gives Noah the details

422
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,900
of how Molly's mother was poisoned.

423
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,200
We also find out she and Noah have some romantic history, but forget all that because we don't

424
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,480
see Ellen again for the rest of the book.

425
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,960
Molly's mother is dying, but points Noah towards the hotel Molly is hiding out in.

426
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,720
A hotel near the airport because Arthur has informed law enforcement of all the people

427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,640
within Molly's group and they're currently being hunted.

428
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,760
Molly needs to get out of the city.

429
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,160
Noah heads to the hotel and is reunited with Molly, immediately forgiving her, and he decides

430
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
to help her sneak out of New York City.

431
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,040
To get past security, Noah calls up a fancy security detail that celebrities use to cut

432
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,160
through all the lines at the airport.

433
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,120
Molly conveniently not only looks like Noah's mother, but also looks like Natalie Portman.

434
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,040
And I'm glad I was able to get around to that because that's the reason I chose that

435
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,360
picture.

436
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,960
Noah thinks posing as Natalie Portman is a great disguise because...

437
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,280
It's perfect, Noah said.

438
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,840
She's an A-lister, but she's done mostly art house films, so the average Joe probably

439
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,040
couldn't pick her out of a lineup.

440
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,880
This book was written in 2010.

441
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,280
As Noah and Molly approach security, Noah suddenly remembers that Natalie Portman was

442
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,800
in the Star Wars movies, something Molly apparently doesn't know at all.

443
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,920
The TSA security guy, who Noah suspects is a Star Wars nerd, doesn't say anything until

444
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,840
the metal detector goes off.

445
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Molly forgot to take off her metal jewelry before going through it, including her necklace

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,000
with its silver cross.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Security guard is immediately suspicious because he knows Natalie Portman is actually Jewish,

448
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,680
and he asks Molly about it.

449
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,000
As Noah sweats it out, he thinks about how awesome cops are.

450
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,320
Perhaps no liars like plumbers know leaks.

451
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,760
They encounter them every day, all day.

452
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,120
They know all the little signs and symptoms, and they're trained to understand that where

453
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,720
there's even a little whiff of smoke, one should always assume there's a fire.

454
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,720
As they challenge a person, they study their reactions, pick apart the little telltale

455
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,320
movements, listen to the timbre of the voice, and more than anything else, they watch the

456
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
eyes.

457
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,400
Most suspects have already made a full confession by the time they begin their denial.

458
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,760
That reads pretty creepy to me.

459
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Cops know someone is lying just by looking at them.

460
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,360
How can anyone but a fascist believe something so stupid?

461
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Back to the story.

462
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,160
Molly is confident she can handle the TSA security guy and decides to talk her way out

463
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
of the predicament.

464
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,920
This is a long passage, but I have to read all of it.

465
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,400
She turned to the officer, pulled back her hood and let it settle onto her shoulders,

466
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,540
removed the baseball cap and let it fall to the floor at her feet, and then slow and sure

467
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,320
began to walk toward him.

468
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,720
The force is strong with this one, Molly said, as calm and smooth as a Jedi master.

469
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Her accent was gone and her voice was just breathy enough to obscure any other identifying

470
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,880
qualities of the real McCoy.

471
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,640
The TSA man's cheeks began to redden slightly, a power shift was underway, and as Noah had

472
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,080
learned firsthand, when this girl turned it on, you never knew what was about to hit you.

473
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,520
She continued nearer, put a finger to the frames, and lowered her sunglasses partway

474
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,580
down her nose, tipping her chin so she could look at the officer directly, eye to eye,

475
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,820
just over the top of the darkened lenses.

476
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,720
As she stopped, barely a foot away, she subtly passed an open hand between their faces and

477
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
spoke again.

478
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,180
These aren't the droids you're looking for, Molly said.

479
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,420
After waiting a moment, she gave him a little nod, as though it had come time in their close-up

480
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,520
scene for his own line of dialogue.

481
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,080
There was an eternal pause, and then before his eyes, Noah saw this big, intimidating

482
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,760
young man begin his grinning transformation from the TSA's most vigilant watchdog into

483
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,360
Natalie Portman's biggest fan.

484
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,480
These aren't the droids we're looking for, the officer repeated her words just as that

485
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:00,080
spellbound stormtrooper had said them at the Imperial checkpoint in Episode 4.

486
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,720
Molly used her deep knowledge of Star Wars to give us one of the cringiest scenes I've

487
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
ever read.

488
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,120
Lucky for Molly, who hasn't seen the prequels, happened to write a midterm paper on the first

489
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,520
two movies for her political science class.

490
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,640
This is the point I nearly dropped the book and discussed, but we're nearly done, so

491
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,360
let's keep going.

492
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,480
As Noah and Molly board a plane, we find out it isn't headed for safety.

493
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,160
Molly is taking them directly to Las Vegas.

494
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,360
To pass the time, Molly sleeps, and Noah reads some of the books she brought along

495
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
with her.

496
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,400
Really, they're the writings of the founding fathers.

497
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,640
It's true this that Noah finally understands why they were so great, and he's ready to

498
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,800
create something real with Molly, giving her the polyamorous relationship she was hoping

499
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
for.

500
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,840
Molly, Noah, and America.

501
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
Danny and Agent Kerns finally have the real meeting with the five dudes to exchange the

502
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,280
fake nuke, though we find out that Elmer has stood them up.

503
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,360
There's a tent standoff with the four dudes, followed by a shootout.

504
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,800
Danny and Kerns manage to take out three of the guys, but the fourth one jumps into

505
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,960
their truck and drives off.

506
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,040
Danny and Kerns manage to sneak into the back, only to find a dead body.

507
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,800
It's Kerns' handler, and conveniently the only man who knew Kerns was undercover, and

508
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,800
he's been murdered, and next to him is a second nuclear weapon.

509
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,520
Apparently the four dudes had a second nuke in their truck the whole time.

510
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,320
They wanted two, for some reason.

511
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,440
Somehow Kerns knows that he and his handler were set up the exact same way, delivering

512
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,760
two nukes to these five guys so they could stage a terrorist attack in Las Vegas.

513
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
I don't know why they needed two nukes.

514
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,320
Danny and Kerns chill out in the back of the truck for a bit, and short of ammo, figure

515
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,680
there's no way to overpower the armed guy who's driving the truck, who still hasn't

516
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,280
discovered them yet.

517
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,220
Being in the middle of the desert, their pre-arranged meeting place, Kerns and Danny realize the

518
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,720
only logical thing to do is to blow up the nuke.

519
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,720
As Noah and Molly arrive in Las Vegas, before the nuke has gone off, they start driving

520
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,800
towards the coordinates Danny gave them.

521
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Noah tries to convince Molly to give up, even though he apparently understands what it means

522
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,320
to love America.

523
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,560
Noah still thinks it's hopeless, and with less than 50 pages left in the book, I'm

524
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,040
getting very impatient for our hero to do anything remotely heroic.

525
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,640
Molly doesn't think Noah gets it, and he eventually hovers to jump out of the moving

526
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,920
car so she can go on alone.

527
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
And then he does that.

528
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,980
He tries to flag down some people driving down the road, including security forces chasing

529
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,740
Molly when the nuke goes off behind him.

530
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,640
According to Noah, it feels like a hot summer wind.

531
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
Noah of course survives the nuke, because I guess he was far enough away.

532
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,680
He's arrested, though, and waterboarded, and when he can't reveal any secrets because

533
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,920
he doesn't know any, he's taken to a room where he undergoes electroconvulsive therapy.

534
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,900
Arthur arrives to give Noah a chance to redeem himself, which Arthur believes Noah does when

535
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Noah recites part of that Rudyard Kipling poem that was one of Arthur's favorites.

536
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,820
The epilogue takes place sometime in the future.

537
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,260
Noah is being kept in a special prison for political dissidents.

538
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,060
He's being tasked with writing a creative confession implicating his former cohorts,

539
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,740
but try as he might, he can't hide the facts of what heroes the Founders Keepers were.

540
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,260
I'm not sure what heroic things they did, and he couldn't possibly know about Danny

541
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,740
detonating that nuke, which I guess is heroic, I'm not sure why.

542
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,420
While Noah is in prison, a guard slips him a message, and Molly's bracelet, they've

543
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,320
got work for him to do, and Molly is waiting for him.

544
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,900
And so ends the narrative portion of the Overton window.

545
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,980
I say the narrative portion because the book isn't over yet.

546
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,940
We also have an afterword from Glenn where he lists the many sources he used for this

547
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:52,660
book, and how some of the crazy conspiracy theories he used might be worth taking more

548
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
seriously.

549
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,420
He also happily explains how Danny was supposed to be the crazy one, and offers some reasonable

550
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,820
explanation as to why his theories were baseless, explanations that would have been very helpful

551
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,940
within the actual novel, but hey, I guess having them in the afterword is better than

552
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
nothing at all.

553
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,700
It also would have been nice if Glenn had looked into the other conspiracy theories

554
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,900
he peddled throughout this book, but we don't get any of that either.

555
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,340
That's not what this book is about.

556
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,220
Danny is the token conspiracy theory nut used to buy the appearance of Glenn being a credible

557
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
broker.

558
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,460
He's also the one smuggling in other conspiracy theories that are just as baseless, but making

559
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,740
them seem more respectable because they're coming out of the mouths of reputable characters.

560
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,260
And that's what this book is all about, mainstreaming conspiratorial thinking.

561
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,140
At least Glenn Beck is honest in the afterword about him trying to manipulate the Overton

562
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:47,620
window, only he's not pushing it towards liberty, he's pushing it towards paranoia.

563
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,420
First let's talk about this book's style.

564
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,860
Although it clocks in at 292 pages, not counting the afterword, it's a surprisingly brisk

565
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
read.

566
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:02,020
It works out to 47 chapters with a prologue and epilogue, so roughly 6 pages per section,

567
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,060
and certain parts of the book feel like they're moving in fast forward, with the notable exception

568
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,260
being that Founders Keeper gathering at the tavern which ran on for 6 chapters.

569
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,540
So in this book you're never in a bad scene for too long before another one comes up to

570
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,580
replace it.

571
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,740
The problem is, it's never replaced by anything good.

572
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,180
What little space is afforded to chapters is wasted with pointless aside, such as that

573
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,820
random paragraph about cops being lie detectors.

574
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,900
I know something like that is supposed to build tension, but it feels ham-fisted into

575
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,140
a scene that was already absurd and way too brief to create any real tension.

576
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,900
Any drama that was supposed to be here just doesn't come across.

577
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
And the rants.

578
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,020
There is so much to say about the ranting.

579
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,940
Every character has a monologue, and they're all the same.

580
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,260
The government is corrupt, Spindy is out of control, and there are shadowy forces manipulating

581
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,340
the world.

582
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,500
By the third or fourth rant, I had heard everything there was to be said about this particular

583
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,780
theory, but I was well aware that this being a book by Glenn Beck, he wasn't about to

584
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,060
stop repeating himself.

585
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,940
Those pages need fill-in.

586
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,540
And to go back briefly to that bullet point on malleable voters, as someone on the left

587
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,060
I obviously believe there are some real arguments to be made on why people who live within the

588
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,020
United States deserve voting rights, and in the case of undocumented immigrants, citizenship.

589
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,860
And perhaps you're someone who disagrees with that, and we could even debate it.

590
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,660
But we don't see those clashing viewpoints here.

591
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,940
The well is being poisoned because these arguments are never made by genuine activists or people

592
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,140
who believe there's some merit to the argument.

593
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,020
It's by a shadowy group cynically using these concerns to advance their agenda.

594
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,580
It's similar to the violent activist groups, specifically right-wing ones who are only

595
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:47,060
portrayed as violent when that shadowy group sends in infiltrators and manipulates them.

596
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,260
The normal people we meet in this world all acknowledge the reality of secret conspiracies

597
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,560
that Glenn wants you to believe.

598
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,900
This book is about degrading trust in the institutions around us, specifically the government

599
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,860
and the media, who are all secretly working together, working against freedom and America

600
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,500
and other things people have an implicit love of.

601
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,020
The book is telling us not to trust the supposed protectors of these ideals.

602
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,580
And this is the most important part.

603
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,300
The book does want you to know that you can trust Glenn, who supposedly doesn't want

604
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,180
to be right about this stuff, but he is and is the only person you can trust.

605
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,100
And you can demonstrate that trust by buying one of his books, watching his TV show, or

606
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,440
nowadays, signing up for a membership at the blaze.

607
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,100
And if the conspiracies he tells you support one political party over another, or more

608
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,740
accurately demonizes one party in particular, and if there are some financial interests

609
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,860
that want to demonize said party and champion the other, and they want to use their money

610
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,300
to support Glenn, well, that's just something that happens in the world, isn't it?

611
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
But damn it, did I just suggest there's an actual conspiracy theory here, that Glenn

612
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,380
Beck is peddling a bunch of lies to push conservative talking points like flat tax and climate

613
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,780
denial to the public, and that moneyed interests like Fox News, which hired him to spew this

614
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,380
nonsense and find it very useful to spread information that will ultimately support

615
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,660
the Republican Party?

616
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,540
Is that the conspiracy I'm pushing?

617
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,060
No, that's not what a conspiracy is.

618
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,380
The only part of what I described that might be a secret is the idea that Glenn Beck is

619
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,620
genuine.

620
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,700
Before leaving this book entirely, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about

621
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
its reception.

622
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,540
The general critical response was, as you might have guessed, not generous.

623
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,380
The reviews published at the time from most mainstream outlets criticized its clumsy prose,

624
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,540
bland characters, and rushed plot.

625
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,180
Worst of all, for a thriller, most people noticed how it wasn't thrilling at all.

626
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,020
I mean, I just gave you the plot synopsis.

627
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,340
Point to any moment that was genuinely thrilling, I would love to hear that.

628
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,820
The Overton Window did hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list when it came

629
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,340
out on June 15th, and stayed on that list for three months.

630
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,340
Looking around online, reviews from readers of the book are generally positive, though

631
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
not what I would call enthusiastic.

632
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,620
It scored a 3.5 on goodreads, with most people mentioning how breezy a read it was.

633
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,420
There were a few comments that stood out to me, though.

634
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,940
I like this one review from Elizabeth, who gave it one star.

635
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,420
If part of your goal is to teach, by example, here you're shooting yourself in the foot

636
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,780
by communicating to the world that a name and some fast, poorly written fiction with

637
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,540
jumbled ideas is exactly what the Founding Fathers had hoped for in the future and potential

638
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,620
of America that you so often revere and expound.

639
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,420
A short version of the reviews I read is that fans of Glenn Beck loved it, and non-Beck

640
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,140
fans remained unmoved, although even some Glenn Beck fans were a bit disappointed with

641
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,700
how poorly it was written.

642
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,260
But maybe we can't blame Glenn for that himself.

643
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,980
In an interview with USA Today, Glenn copped to not having been the actual writer of this

644
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,060
book.

645
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,460
On the title page, Beck shares credit with three contributors.

646
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,500
He calls the conspiracy novel My Story, but he says Jack Anderson, one of his contributors,

647
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,020
went in and he put the words down.

648
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,300
Other novelists might not acknowledge such help, but Beck, a self-described fiscal conservative

649
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,580
and common-sense libertarian, says, I'm a team kind of guy.

650
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:13,340
The title page credits Kevin Balfi, Emily Bestler, and Jack Anderson, but as Glenn's quote

651
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,820
alluded to, Jack Henderson, in particular, is a person of interest.

652
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,600
It's kind of weird to think that Glenn hired a professional writer to ghost-write this

653
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,060
entire book, but it still turned out the way it did.

654
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,860
What's truly wonderful about this is that it seems Henderson might have actually conned

655
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,940
Glenn Beck.

656
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,380
In an article on the Huffington Post, Chris Kelly notes that the Overton window is suspiciously

657
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,020
similar to one of Henderson's earlier works, Circumference of Darkness, published in 2007.

658
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,260
I couldn't bring myself to read a longer version of the same novel story with awful

659
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,500
writing to verify how similar they are, but I'm willing to say at least their plots have

660
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,300
a few things in common.

661
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:58,260
Both involve a guy being seduced by a lovely woman to help take down a group of terrorists

662
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,740
who are planning to detonate a nuke.

663
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,380
Only in Henderson's earlier work, it's a right-wing group that's behind everything

664
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,060
and not a left-wing one.

665
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,860
Glenn Beck responded to this article himself, and he was outraged because he seems to think

666
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,500
Kelly was accusing him of plagiarism.

667
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,360
It's not that Glenn Beck plagiarized anything, it's that Jack Henderson wrote a book for

668
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,720
Glenn Beck that was just a recycled version of a book he had previously written.

669
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,320
That Glenn had read Circumference of Darkness and didn't notice that it had recycled the

670
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,920
same plot is kind of funny.

671
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,840
So the only person getting ripped off here is Glenn, and I'm so glad we could find at

672
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,080
least one happy ending here.

673
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,960
The idea of Glenn Beck being a dishonest grifter shouldn't surprise anyone.

674
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,680
Several years after this book was published when Glenn Beck had been exiled from Fox News

675
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,880
and was trying to stay relevant with his own outlet, The Blaze, he tried to continue his

676
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,120
anti-establishment shtick by being a never-Trumper conservative.

677
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,360
Donald Trump is a dictator in the making.

678
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:02,600
You called him a sociopath, dangerous, unhinged, unstable, and you compared him to Adolf Hitler.

679
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,400
I don't think I compared him to Adolf Hitler.

680
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,280
Nobody can be compared to Adolf Hitler.

681
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,760
I said Adolf Hitler of the 1930s and 40s is not Adolf Hitler of the 1920s.

682
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:21,720
Nobody who can reach in and stir a crowd like that has a moral compass that is wishy-washy

683
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,160
at best.

684
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,880
They don't all turn into Adolf Hitler's.

685
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
But one of them did.

686
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,280
He even got to appear on Samantha Bee's show wearing a dumb sweater trying to get some

687
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,760
cred with the left.

688
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,200
When his already diminished audience, compared to his Fox days, kept shrinking, he ran into

689
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,040
the arms of Daddy Trump and never looked back.

690
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,720
Now he's hired such luminaries as Lauren Chen, Dave Rubin, and Steven Crowder, amplifying

691
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,300
their dopey conservative talking points.

692
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,600
The problem of Glenn Peck is the impact he's had on American society.

693
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,120
It can't be understated how much the shift of the Overton window to the right has frozen

694
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,800
and in some cases pulled back progress in the United States.

695
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,160
When you prime a sizable portion of the electorate to reject the establishment in favor of conspiracy

696
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,240
theories that are covers for far-right policies, you create a deeper level of polarization

697
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,240
that is easily plucked up by some swaggering demagogue.

698
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,680
And these people have been conned for many years now and in many ways are victims of

699
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,600
Glenn Beck, people whose grievances were ignored by the Democratic Party and then co-opted

700
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
by the right.

701
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,280
Anyone who sees that the system is working for the rich and powerful should be a ready

702
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,880
ally for the party demanding stronger social programs and higher taxes on the wealthy,

703
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,200
but the power of charismatic charlatans like Glenn Beck symbolized in books like the Overton

704
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,640
window has swept these people away, preying on ignorance and stoking racism to scapegoat

705
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,120
immigrants and the left more broadly.

706
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,200
That's the danger of a book like this one.

707
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,800
Facts are woven into elaborate fantasies and con people into voting against their interests.

708
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,560
This book was, uh, pretty rough.

709
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,420
The sequel to this book is called The Eye of Moloch, and I'm not really super anxious

710
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,860
to read it, but I don't know if people really want to see that.

711
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
I might do it.

712
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,540
There's another Glenn Beck novel I'd actually rather read instead, and I might do that one

713
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,700
as well.

714
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,460
The names you see scrolling up the screen are my lovely patrons.

715
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,820
These patrons who not only get their name in the credits, they also get early access

716
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,700
to my videos, which is a new reward that if you're interested in supporting me is available.

717
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,300
There's also a download to my theme song, and that's it for now, but hey, if you were

718
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,940
considering supporting me on Patreon, like all of these lovely people, you can head on

719
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,020
over there and subscribe to the $5 tier because I'm just putting everything in there, I guess.

720
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,740
You can't support me financially or just don't want to, that's totally fine.

721
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,900
There are lots of free ways you can express your appreciation for my work by liking this

722
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,580
video, subscribing if you haven't already, and ringing that bell if you want to make

723
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,140
sure you're kept in the loop whenever I drop a new video.

724
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,860
Also leave a comment below, tell me about how much you loved this book, or hated it,

725
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:59,660
or maybe learned something about the effect of Glenn Beck on the body politic.

726
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,780
If you have some extra affinity for me, you can always follow me on Twitter and just send,

727
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,220
you know, positive vibes in my general direction.

728
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,660
Thank you all for watching.
