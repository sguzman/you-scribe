1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
This was the longest week of my life.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,320
Tim Poole is a person with a YouTube channel. Two channels, actually.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
He produces about six videos daily where he comments on the news of the day.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,640
He is not a popular guy on the left. To hear him tell it, it's because the left has lost its mind.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,120
While I've watched a few of his videos in the past, and even made a response to one of them,

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,280
I wanted to see what a week-long trek through the world of his content would produce.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
This video covers all the video content created by Tim Poole from December 15th

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
to December 21st in 2019. Let's dive right in.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:56,480
By far, the biggest story of that week in the US political world was the vote in Congress

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,720
to impeach President Donald Trump. Of the 42 videos Tim produced, 11 were about impeachment

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,800
in one way or another. They had titles such as Democrat Slammed by protest as impeachment

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:17,040
support collapses. Majority now oppose impeachment. Impeachment backfire gets worse as Trump now

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,160
defeats every 2020 Democrat in major polling. Democrats have not impeached Trump. Democrats

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,400
own witness undermines Pelosi's strategy. Gee, I wonder why people would think this guy is right-wing.

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,840
These, obviously, clickbait titles are how Tim advertises his political videos.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,040
The Democrats are consistently on the verge of collapse and the Republicans are on an endless

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
winning streak. But to hear Tim tell it, he's actually trying to help the Democrats by offering

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,440
honest criticism. The only problem is he has no idea what he's talking about. Tim has an

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,320
interesting take on the Trump impeachment proceedings. He believes it's a top-to-bottom

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,080
farce. To Tim, Trump not only has done nothing wrong, but the Democrats have been lawless in

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,960
pursuing him, and the subject of the investigation should be Joe Biden. One of the annoying things

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,080
about watching his videos is how rarely he explains why he believes the things he believes.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
Of the 11 impeachment videos, only two really outline his case. I suppose he went into detail

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
in previous videos, which would be fine if he told his viewers where they could get more information,

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,320
like say a link to relevant videos. Instead, his channel is set up so that you have to have some

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,480
knowledge of right-wing narratives to believe anything that he's saying, or even to really

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,800
follow it. Not that it would help, because he's very wrong on impeachment. To be fair, Tim doesn't

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,600
want us to take his legal expertise on the matter, though. Here's an example of Tim trying to use an

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,080
expert to cite the claim that impeachment is baseless. Congress is claiming Trump obstructed

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,520
Congress by rejecting these subpoenas. Trump's argument is that he has executive privilege,

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,960
this information, and he's under no obligation to turn it over without judicial review.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,840
And it sounds like he's right. Why does Alan Dershowitz have authority on this?

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Famous Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden supporter Alan Dershowitz says,

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,120
so Tim's position relies not on the merit of the argument, but on his status as a Clinton and Biden

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,240
supporter. He's using Dershowitz's identity to support his claim, ignoring the many people who

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,840
disagree with him. For example, one of Dershowitz's own students.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,960
Abusive power was rejected, and terms like that, as explicit grounds for impeachment.

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,600
No, that's not true, Alan. Look, that's not, abusive power was not rejected.

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,680
Yes, there were. There was, well, the word maladministration is rejected explicitly.

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Maladministration is a totally different thing.

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
It's also worth noting that Dershowitz is currently advising the Trump administration

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
on impeachment proceedings, but that's only looking at the second article of impeachment,

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,200
obstruction of Congress, during the impeachment process. Tim's dismissal of the first article

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,080
is even more laughable. For those unfamiliar, the short version of the obstruction of power

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,800
claim is that President Trump withheld aid to Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,840
to pressure the president of Ukraine to either investigate or announce an investigation into Joe

47
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,960
Biden and his son Hunter, and also to investigate Ukraine's supposed influence on the 2016 election.

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,480
Tim finds these allegations absurd. One of the claims he seriously makes is that in no way was

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,040
Donald Trump worried about Joe Biden. Why would Trump be scared of Biden of all people? And Biden

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,640
even won the nomination yet. It's a lie. Articles published as far back in March of this year,

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,200
a few months before Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, suggest that Trump was

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,760
definitely worried about Biden. While Biden certainly isn't my favorite Democrat in the

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,480
field, he's undeniably the front-runner, and has been for as long as he's been in the Democratic

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,520
primary. To say Trump is not concerned about Biden or that he doesn't consider him a political

55
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,040
rival is to be willfully ignorant. Tim then tries to describe Trump's state of mind on why he

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,400
withheld the money. I think for one, Trump doesn't want to give U.S. money to foreign countries. I

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,240
think that's a fact. He's withholding aid from like Lebanon or other countries. I don't think

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,920
Ukraine is special. So this is something Trump does all the time, but Democrats are arbitrarily

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,560
choosing this case, even though this is a specific type of military aid that Congress

60
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,400
voted on giving to Ukraine. But even that isn't the real reason Trump is doing this.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Let's listen to Tim tell us the real reason Trump is doing this.

62
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,840
Because he's upset about this.

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Tim believes Trump triggered the investigation as a form of retribution for all the lies the media

64
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
and the Democrats have supposedly been throwing at him. And Tim doesn't think that using the

65
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
office of the president and U.S. foreign policy to go after your political rivals is an abuse of

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,720
power. Of course, that's also not the real reason. Let's hear Tim give us the real reason once again,

67
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,040
and this time it's Trump isn't doing it out of anger, but it's because he really cares about

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,560
America. Trump said, do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.

69
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
He was clearly talking about us as America. And if you want to argue, you got to argue

70
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
from the facts, but they don't do that. They say Trump demanded a favor. Trump said,

71
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,480
I want to favor. He never said that. So they keep going up. They say it's not disputed,

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,360
but they've never presented any evidence that Trump's frame of mind in that conversation had

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
anything to do with Biden. As a quick aside, Biden was mentioned specifically in the conversation,

74
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,400
which I believe proves Trump was thinking about him to some degree. But the important point is

75
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520
none of what Tim is saying holds together. Trump didn't care about Biden during this conversation,

76
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,600
but he did mention him by name as a person to be investigated. Trump withheld the money

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
as part of standard policy, but Tim also acknowledges it was a partisan attack on

78
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,000
political rivals. But also, it wasn't about that. It was about his love of country.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,760
Perhaps there's some nuance here I'm missing, but after watching these videos, I'm not sure

80
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,440
Tim knows what he thinks about this. The only constant in all of these videos is the narrative

81
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,480
that Trump needs to be considered innocent, regardless of the justifications. This is how

82
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,240
narrative is used to reshape the facts. You can talk about what's happening in the news,

83
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
but the facts are being distorted to reinforce the narrative that Trump did nothing wrong.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Contradictions don't matter, and neither do objective facts, just the narrative.

85
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Here's another example of how Tim misrepresents reality to push a Trump innocence narrative.

86
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
Tim really wants to hammer home the idea that Trump hasn't committed any statutory crimes,

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
so this whole impeachment process doesn't meet the standards of high crimes and misdemeanors.

88
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,960
All of the other presidents who actually faced impeachment were being charged with statutory

89
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,160
crimes. Trump is the first president to face no statutory crime. And about 40 seconds before that,

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,120
he asserts something I want us to remember. He would rightly defer to the expert opinion of

91
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,920
an academic on the constitution over a journalist. If you're an academic and you're an expert on

92
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,480
the constitution and you say Trump was unimpeached, I defer to you over the journalist. If you think

93
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,280
Trump should be impeached on these issues, I will still defer to you over the journalists.

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
He's completely right when he says this, but he's also completely wrong when he says the phrase

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,720
high crimes and misdemeanors means that statutory crimes must be a part of the impeachment process.

96
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
In an article for The Atlantic, Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri

97
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
School of Law who literally wrote a book on the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors,

98
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,200
goes into detail about the origin of the phrase and how it most certainly applies to abuse of power,

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,680
and doesn't require any statutory crimes to have been committed. Here are a few excerpts from that

100
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,280
article that provide historical context. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton made the

101
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,960
larger point that impeachment is directed at political offenses that proceed from the abuse

102
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,240
or violation of some public trust. He provides a number of examples of people being impeached

103
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
without having committed a crime, and he offers a famous hypothetical and one of his own to

104
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,600
illustrate the subject even further. Suppose, he imagined, that in 1861, when secession fever broke

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,840
out, the president had not been Abraham Lincoln but a man who, whether moved by fear or an honest

106
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,640
but perverted political theory, refused to mobilize the union against the rebellion.

107
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,040
Would we say that the only remedy in such a case was to allow dissolution of the country because

108
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,720
the president's inaction was no crime? Or suppose to bring the case still closer to home,

109
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,440
a president were to subordinate himself and the interests of his own country to a foreign power

110
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
because he or his family could make money by doing so, or because the foreign country agreed

111
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
to help him secure a re-election. Does anyone seriously suggest that the question of whether

112
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,280
such behavior is impeachable turns on the niceties of ethics rules or campaign finance laws?

113
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,680
So why does Tim continue on with this obviously wrong narrative of impeachment having no merit

114
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
because no statutory crimes have been leveled against President Trump? It's because it supports

115
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
the narrative he loves so dearly, and that's that the Democrats are not only insane, but their

116
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
supporters are complete fools. Tim, apparently, can't understand why the Democrats are impeaching

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,280
Trump. Maybe they're sitting there being like, Trump, if Trump's going to get reelected, he needs

118
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,680
a good villain, so they're all going to pretend to be it. Obviously I'm joking, but I can't imagine

119
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,520
why else they would be doing this. But then he figures out the Democrats are actually on a

120
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,280
suicide mission. Rocking a hard place? Whatever. Impeachment. This is the Democrats' final salvo.

121
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,840
It's their kamikaze. They've lost, they know it, and it's all they have left. And then he finally

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,520
lands on what is quite possibly the most ridiculous explanation as to why Democrats

123
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,680
are impeaching Trump. I think the reality is the Democrats know their constituents,

124
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,680
these these resistance types are not very smart or are lacking information. They're ignorant.

125
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true. Tim Poole thinks that the Democrats are trying to

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,000
fool their base into thinking Trump has been removed from office. In what world does this

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
make any sense? Does he think the Democratic voters are so stupid that they won't notice Trump

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,120
is still in office between now and the election? Tim's evidence for this outrageous claim is

129
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,080
provided in a different video because he's very bad at what he does and doesn't evidence claims

130
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,720
when he first makes them. Liberals on Twitter think impeachment means Trump is getting kicked

131
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
out of office. His evidence is random people on Twitter. I don't think that really meets the

132
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,760
standard of a scientific poll and it's not really a demonstration that this is a widespread problem,

133
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,400
but it does meet Tim's standard of cherry-picking facts to buttress a narrative of the left being

134
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,720
made up of people detached from reality. He also has another theory on why Democrats are being so

135
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,240
supposedly self-destructive. Should I believe that she thinks she's actually doing something here?

136
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
Because we all know Trump isn't going to be removed from office. So why laugh and smile as

137
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
you go to impeach him? Because it feels good? Or is it because you want to watch the world burn?

138
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,840
Rashida Tlaib just wants to see the world burn. She is, in fact, the Joker. But Tim,

139
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,040
in an effort to speak to his fellow liberals, does occasionally offer political advice. And wow,

140
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,680
this may be the worst of his commentary. For instance, here's a slogan he recommended to

141
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,280
Democrats. If the Democrats' whole campaign was Trump's not that bad, we'll be a little bit better,

142
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,400
they would be much, much better off than where they are today with protests erupting at their

143
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,680
town hall meetings. Democrats should run on a vaguely pro-Trump sentiment that they're only

144
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,240
going to do a little bit better? Does he not understand that Donald Trump has never been a

145
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
popular president? And how does this appeal to Democratic voters who, generally speaking,

146
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,080
don't like Trump? But that's not the end of his awful advice. Tim repeatedly mentions Democrats

147
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,600
have nothing to offer and need new ideas to sway the public. I think the only conclusion we have

148
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
is the Democrats are campaigning on things no one cares about. They're saying nothing,

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
no one cares what they have to say. Interesting point, and totally true, if you ignore the

150
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,560
Democratic primary, which had been going on this whole week. You know, the primary, where they're

151
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,680
discussing various ideas on healthcare, college tuition plans, climate change strategies,

152
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,800
campaign finance laws, financial regulations, income inequality strategies, and plenty of other

153
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,040
ideas. I'm not sure how someone could think that the Democrats aren't trying to offer anything new

154
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,520
or different, but I know why Tim hasn't heard of any of this stuff. Only seven candidates at the

155
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,600
stage last night. Eh, they go on and name it. I don't care. I didn't watch debate. Speaking

156
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,920
specifically to Bernie, though, Tim thinks it would have been a solid strategy to have supported

157
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,000
Trump's investigation into Biden. Look, if you're gonna ask me, I think Bernie should be,

158
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,120
what should be behind Trump on this one. Think about it. For one, politically, it gets Biden

159
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,280
out of the way. I don't think that's the right reason to do it. That's, you know, political

160
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,960
nonsense. Wow, there are so many reasons not to do this, such as it's wrong on the facts,

161
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,360
it harms your standing within the Democratic Party, and it gives ammo to Bernie's opposition

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,840
in the election, which would be pretty accurate when he's teaming up with Republicans to target

163
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,200
Democrats. Tim is also quick to support Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's vote of present,

164
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,560
not citing for or against impeachment. But you may have noticed that Tulsi Gabbard voted present,

165
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
and man, I was on the airplane, but I wanted to give a standing ovation to this.

166
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
This is the best vote of anybody. Tulsi Gabbard's not running for reelection. She's running for

167
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,120
president. She has to be there for most Americans. This was a move that annoyed both the left and the

168
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,400
right, but he sees it as the right move to make. His undying support of Gabbard, often complimenting

169
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,240
her political skills, is betrayed by the fact that she polls at under 2% in the Democratic primary.

170
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm sure Tim would blame the DNC or the media, but Bernie Sanders faces similar challenges,

171
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,880
and he's managed to be one of the frontrunners. That's because people actually like him and his

172
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,880
policies, and based on a recent poll, not many people like Tulsi. But hey, this deeply unpopular

173
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,840
Democrat is an example of someone doing it right in Tim's eyes, so that's the sort of support one

174
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,280
would get for following Tim's strategies on how to run a successful campaign. I believe all these

175
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,880
suggestions from Tim Pool reveal two things. The first is that Tim is genuine. This could be

176
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,840
portrayed as him providing his bona fides to his right-wing audience as being ostensibly someone

177
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,800
on the left, but the reactions and comments tend to be disinterested on how to repair the left and

178
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,440
more interested in destroying it. I think he genuinely believes that these suggestions will

179
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
write the Democratic Party and let it have a brighter future in American politics. The second

180
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,360
thing these suggestions reveal is that Tim Pool is completely clueless when it comes to politics.

181
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
His ideas betray an appalling ignorance on political maneuvering and public sentiment.

182
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,400
It pretends the Democratic base is non-existent or not worth considering, and it praises strategies

183
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,000
that have been proven to fail. Tim just doesn't know what he's talking about here. Before leaving

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,560
his impeachment discussion, I'll highlight one more clip. Here's Tim talking about Donald Trump's

185
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,320
political leanings. Donald Trump, in reality, for those that are actually tracking politics,

186
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,920
is a moderate. He really is. They want to claim he's far right now. Trump's a New York Democrat.

187
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,440
I think the only reason he ran as a Republican is because Democrats would never elect a billionaire.

188
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't know how someone could possibly believe this. The man who spent his administration by

189
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
trying to undo everything done by President Obama, from the Iran deal to the Paris Climate

190
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,240
Accord to the Affordable Care Act, the man who pushed tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,

191
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,120
and the man who is appointing conservative judges across the country, is a New York Democrat.

192
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,000
And that's a narrative that, if you can convince someone of, you can convince them of anything.

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,160
Donald Trump is supposedly a moderate. So what, in Tim's mind, would a real conservative look like?

194
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,560
Recently, Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks announced a run for Congress in California. Although well

195
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,680
known for being on the left, a number of spurious articles attacking him appeared in the supposedly

196
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,520
left-wing mainstream media. Tim commented on this in his video titled, The Young Turks Cenk Uygur is

197
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,440
getting destroyed by establishment over his animal love endorsement. Now, I really want to stress the

198
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,400
title here. Tim gets very angry about misleading headlines, but what does this one suggest? The

199
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
media is a tanking Cenk, yes, but it's only vaguely hinted at being based on falsehood by

200
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,320
the quotation marks around animal love. And the quotation marks are there because Tim is just

201
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,840
afraid YouTube will censor him if he uses a forbidden word. This is because YouTube will

202
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,520
shut down videos, they'll demonetize videos, and I can not use certain words to explain certain

203
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
ideas. I'm sure Tim would say, well, if someone clicked the video, they'd get the full story,

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,080
and then they would walk away realizing that he's not saying it's true. He's actually saying

205
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,800
the opposite. First of all, the viral clip is out of context. I refuse. I don't care if it's

206
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,000
if it's Cenk Uygur. I don't care if it's Nick Fuentes. You take an out of context clip, and I

207
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,800
can't tell what it is. I'm going to tell you the GTFO, period. Pretty straightforward. Tim clears

208
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,760
things up. Anyone who'd watch his video would understand that this was about defending Cenk

209
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,280
about the claim, not advancing it. But if we look under the comments of this video, we'll see that

210
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,640
his clarifications haven't really affected a large number of viewers. Comment after comment

211
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,520
about Cenk wanting to have sex with animals, I'd be a little worried if I made a video supposedly

212
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,200
to defend someone, only to find everyone repeating the exact charge that I was trying to debunk.

213
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,360
People don't really watch Tim's videos for his analysis, but to have their narratives be

214
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,120
confirmed. In this case, it's a narrative about someone on the left being some sort of weird

215
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,680
deviant. It also might not have helped things if Tim had not spent so much time complaining

216
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,760
that Cenk yelled at him one time and that Tim doesn't like that he's running for office.

217
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,960
That's what most of the video is actually about. And in the video titled, conservative memes are

218
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,680
being censored because fact checkers think leftist media is the default. We get more on Tim's

219
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,120
feelings about the left-wing hypocrisy in the media. Newsguard, which is apparently left-wing,

220
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,720
had the gall to criticize The Daily Wire, which is a news outlet run by everyone's favorite Ben

221
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,480
Shapiro. They say that, right here, does not repeatedly publish false content. Thumbs up.

222
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,440
It's got a green check mark. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, Newsguard, for letting me know

223
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
that there are severe issues with Daily Wire, but at least they're not publishing false content,

224
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,320
right? Actually, they say this, credibility. However, The Daily Wire frequently publishes

225
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,320
false and misleading information. Okay, hold on. You told me they don't do that. And then,

226
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,440
in your own content about it, you say they do do that. I got a contradiction here.

227
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Newsguard has made a factual error. I'm sorry. Got him. Now, a clever person here might go on

228
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,520
to read the very lengthy 31 paragraphs detailing all the times The Daily Wire misrepresented a

229
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,560
story, but no, that's not what Tim is here to do. He's here to talk about the little summary

230
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,160
graphic at the top, not matching the more detailed breakdown at the bottom, while specifically this

231
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,600
sentence here. Tim calls this inconsistency a factual error, but the error here appears to

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,160
be that Newsguard isn't being hard enough on The Daily Wire in its summary graphic. And you know,

233
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I think we have to give it to Tim this time. Newsguard is just too soft on right-wing news websites.

234
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm not sure how being too soft on a right-wing news outlet proves that the fact checkers have

235
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,640
a left-wing bias, though. Kind of the opposite, actually. Better luck next time, Tim. But my

236
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,480
favorite part of this video is when Tim starts going off on Buzzfeed News. Let's see how angry he gets.

237
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:57,760
Tim, though, thinks Buzzfeed News was running this story as something to laugh at and that

238
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:11,440
they're all secretly racist. You know what's interesting, though? The Buzzfeed News article

239
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,080
actually never mentions the race of either of the two men, and it doesn't publish pictures of them

240
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,120
either. So how does Tim know they're black? I didn't just want to accuse Tim of making a

241
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,360
racist assumption here, so I took the extra step of digging up the original video on this story

242
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,520
from November 6th, 2019 titled, Buzzfeed wrote a fake headline about two black men fighting to death

243
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,240
over chicken. So Buzzfeed News didn't mention race at all, but Tim puts it right in the headline.

244
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,880
That's an interesting choice. Tim's problem with this chicken sandwich story is that there was no

245
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,560
literal chicken sandwich in anyone's hands, but rather people were in line to buy said sandwich.

246
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,280
For context, this sandwich was making a much awaited return, and Buzzfeed News based its headline

247
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,200
on a statement from the police. Oh, as Tim argues, nowhere did they say they were fighting over a

248
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,280
sandwich. What the police said was that it was preliminary, they said it's preliminary, but

249
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,440
this was related to the release of a sandwich. Could it be that I don't know because of the

250
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,800
release of the sandwich, a guy was going to meet up with another guy at the location and they

251
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,320
weren't going to get the sandwich? The sandwich has nothing to do with it. It seems Tim got more

252
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,280
information about this new story from an article in the Daily Mail which posted lots of pictures.

253
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,400
There's a comment from the cousin of the stabbed man clearly upset that his cousin's death is being

254
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,800
used to market a chicken sandwich. Tim seems to think this proves his point that the murder had

255
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,400
nothing to do with the sandwich though. Then Tim starts to get really worked up. This is when they

256
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,840
cover the violence. This is when they cover the violence that when I was growing up in Chicago,

257
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,320
this is the kind of stuff we deal with. And now you've got this dude's family saying they weren't

258
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,400
fighting over a chicken sandwich man, but that's the funny story that Buzzfeed gets to report,

259
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
isn't it? These people are hypocrites and they're disgusting. You know, I never really claimed to

260
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,360
be a media expert, at least not the way Tim does. I'm just curious, does Buzzfeed News ever dare to

261
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,120
talk about the violence in Chicago? These articles are all from 2019 and they seem to suggest that,

262
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,920
yes, in fact, they do. Lots of important stories are there. If Tim thinks this isn't enough,

263
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,600
then I have some great news for him. He has a platform where he can cover all of these stories

264
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,160
and more and can really put a spotlight on the violence problem in Chicago he apparently cares

265
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,600
about a lot. For some reason, he chooses not to. In the interest of fairness, Tim's two primary

266
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,800
channels actually did cover a very specific crime in Chicago quite extensively in 2019.

267
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,120
One that did also involve issues of race and it so inspired Tim that he made 12 videos alone on

268
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,720
the subject and that's the Jussie Smollett staged hate crime. So when Tim points his finger at

269
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,760
Buzzfeed News for being racist and ignoring violence in Chicago, when Tim's recent work in

270
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,600
said field is to obsessively discuss a staged hate crime, he can spare me the indignation. Maybe he

271
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
should take a look at the sort of stories he propagates instead of lying about the people who

272
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,600
are doing the very thing he accuses them of not doing. Oh, and going back briefly to the Popeyes

273
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,160
story, Tim wanted to give credit to the Daily Mail for doing a better job covering the story.

274
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,560
Funny how Tim doesn't get upset about the Daily Mail saying it was over a chicken sandwich, huh?

275
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,760
Now let's talk about how much Tim cares about the media. In the artfully titled video,

276
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,720
California has nuked leftist media from orbit. Hundreds of writers are being fired under new law.

277
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,800
Tim describes how a new law was passed in California that puts a limit on how much

278
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,960
work employers can purchase from freelancers without making them full-time employees.

279
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,400
Tim sums up the problem for us like this. Are these leftists saying, hey,

280
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,520
companies aren't paying their employees enough and they keep hiring freelancers?

281
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,680
Got an idea. Let's make it so they can't hire freelancers more than 35 times per year.

282
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,440
That way, they'll be forced to hire the freelancers, right? It all makes sense.

283
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,960
This is a progressive victory, they say. In reality, it's very different. In reality,

284
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,760
they say, well, we can't hire all these people. Just fire all these people. We'll save money

285
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,520
and we'll figure it out somewhere else. Or better yet, they're going to hire freelancers in different

286
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,200
states. You know what's going to happen to these people who don't have work anymore?

287
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,040
They're not going to be able to pay their rent. Then they're going to end up in a homeless camp

288
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,920
and it's going to be your fault. This video is in the context of talking about a new story where

289
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,280
Fox eliminated 200 jobs right before the holiday season, no less. Many of these cuts are coming

290
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,480
from SB Nation, a blogging network owned by Vox. Tim even reads a small excerpt in an official

291
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,120
statement from SB Nation. This is a bittersweet note of thanks to our California independent

292
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,840
contractors, John Ness. Executive director of SB Nation wrote in a post on Monday,

293
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,080
in 2020, we will move California's team blogs from our established system with hundreds of

294
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,720
contractors to a new one run by a team of new SB Nation employees. You know what they literally

295
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,840
said? We need these jobs filled. If you're in California, you're fired. We're going to rehire

296
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,080
because the jobs aren't going anywhere, other people. Think about that for a second. This is

297
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,720
not a case of being told your company can't support you. I'm sorry, we have to let you go.

298
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,440
It's not a case of Vox going out of business. It's literally Vox saying, you guys passed the law.

299
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,560
I got to fire you, but this dude over here in Arizona, he's all good. He's hired. He gets your

300
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,920
job now. What would happen if we clicked on that link and read the full statement? We'd find this

301
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,280
telling paragraph. To comply with this new law, we will not be replacing California contractors

302
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,800
with contractors from other states. Rather, we're encouraging any contractors interested in one of

303
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,080
our newly created full-time or part-time employee positions to apply. We know many of our California

304
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,400
contractors already have other full-time jobs and may not have the bandwidth to apply, but we hope

305
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,800
to see many of them join us as employees. So SB Nation is getting rid of its freelance positions

306
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,760
and replacing them with full-time and part-time jobs. Although I do feel for the freelancers who

307
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,280
have full-time jobs and we're just doing this freelancing to make a little extra income.

308
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,320
If there are examples of people being unfairly hurt by this law, this story isn't it. Tim tries

309
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,720
to portray it as people being cast out in the streets with no source of income and now they're

310
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,800
going to be struggling living in homeless camps because they can't pay their bills, saying that

311
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,680
all these jobs are going out of state when in fact they aren't. They're being replaced by full-time

312
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,520
positions, which is sort of how the law is supposed to work because full-time positions

313
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,800
are better than freelance ones. And this is Tim all over. He finds these stories that he thinks

314
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,400
reinforces narratives, in this case the leftist media championing socialist policies that destroy

315
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,480
jobs, but he doesn't check the facts well enough to make sure they don't say the exact opposite.

316
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
He finds enough information to confirm his narrative of leftist media pushing the destructive

317
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,240
agenda and then he moves on, confident that his audience won't do the basics to fact check him.

318
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,640
There's one criticism I know I'm going to get, so I want to address it right here.

319
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,760
I've seen him use this defense on Twitter before, saying watch all my videos before you criticize

320
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,760
me, which is frankly preposterous. When there are hundreds of hours, no one can possibly do this.

321
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,320
The point of this response is to show you all what it's like to watch a single week of his content.

322
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,960
If I was a person unfamiliar with Tim Poole and decided to give his content a try for a week,

323
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,760
what would I find? What would I see? These are the results of that.

324
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Q&A. I'll have a community post asking for more questions in the future,

325
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,440
so if you've got any questions for me, hold on to them, and we'll do a big QA video.

326
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,000
That'll be fun. Like, comment, subscribe, hit the bell.
