00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
April 24th while hosting one of the highest rated programs on the channel, Tucker Carlson,

00:05.200 --> 00:09.920
Left Fox News. There was much celebration in left-wing spaces as one of the leading voices

00:09.920 --> 00:14.240
for far-right messaging was no longer going to have a platform on the most watched cable news

00:14.240 --> 00:18.960
channel in the United States. But even in that moment, people did wonder aloud just

00:18.960 --> 00:23.280
who might be replacing Carlson in that coveted 8pm time slot.

00:23.280 --> 00:28.080
After several weeks of rotating hosts, we got that answer on June 26th.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.960
Jesse Waters would replace Tucker Carlson with his show, Jesse Waters Primetime,

00:32.960 --> 00:37.600
moving to 8pm on July 17th. If you're not familiar with this guy, Jesse Waters has

00:37.600 --> 00:41.600
been working for Fox News for his entire professional life. He started off as a

00:41.600 --> 00:47.040
production assistant at Fox News after graduating from Trinity College with a BA in History in 2001.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.040
In 2003, he was brought on to the O'Reilly Factor, which would go on to be one of the

00:51.040 --> 00:56.320
top-rated shows for Fox. Waters would specialize in unexpectedly confronting interview subjects

00:56.320 --> 01:00.480
in public, often creating footage that was more spectacle than informative.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.480
This is the environment that shaped Waters throughout most of his professional life at

01:04.480 --> 01:07.920
Fox News as he spent roughly 10 years working with O'Reilly.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.560
In 2014, Waters joined the Fox News Show Outnumbered, though it was in 2015 where

01:12.560 --> 01:17.920
he really got to spread his wings as the star of Waters World, a monthly special and running

01:17.920 --> 01:22.640
segment on the O'Reilly Factor. In 2016, one segment garnered quite a bit of attention for

01:22.640 --> 01:27.600
ostensibly being about asking Chinese Americans in New York their opinions on politics,

01:27.600 --> 01:33.200
all while asking culturally insensitive questions and engaging in East Asian stereotypes.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.000
There was a lot of criticism that was directed towards Waters for this segment,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.960
though it didn't seem to affect his work in Fox News. This segment wasn't really that unique

01:48.960 --> 01:54.080
either. He would similarly have other segments asking cab drivers about immigration and mocking

01:54.080 --> 01:59.360
people at pride parades. The anatomy of these segments is pretty basic. Waters would go up to

01:59.360 --> 02:03.840
random people, ask them questions, and play whatever answers they get to make people look

02:03.840 --> 02:10.000
stupid, often splicing in footage of random TV shows and movies. It's a very old, tired technique.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.960
You can see variations of this technique used all over TV and YouTube. It doesn't have much value

02:14.960 --> 02:18.560
as a piece of journalism, but it does give an audience the opportunity to laugh at people

02:18.560 --> 02:23.280
they would dislike, immigrants, people in the LGBT community, and liberals and leftists more

02:23.280 --> 02:28.560
broadly. Waters' world would go from a segment and monthly special to a regular weekly series

02:28.560 --> 02:34.400
in 2017. It would come to an end in January of 2022, but that's just because Jesse Waters was

02:34.400 --> 02:39.920
getting a new show. Waters' largest platform more recently was his role co-hosting The Five,

02:39.920 --> 02:44.960
which would eventually become Fox News' top show. Waters became one of the show's regular hosts,

02:44.960 --> 02:49.760
starting in 2017. And while the makeup of The Five has changed over the years, right now it

02:49.760 --> 02:56.960
consists of Waters, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Janine Pirro, Harold Ford Jr., and Jessica Tarloff.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.840
Waters again courted controversy on the show for a number of remarks. Some of his more memorable

03:01.840 --> 03:07.600
ones include when he said Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn't ripe enough to become

03:07.600 --> 03:13.520
president. She's not ripe enough to run for president. First, she has to get married.

03:14.480 --> 03:19.120
She has to plan a wedding. You want to plan a wedding and run for president at the same time?

03:19.120 --> 03:22.240
And he said that teachers are taking away gender from kids.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.720
Little kids are losing their gender because they get stuffed in classrooms with grooming teachers.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.400
He also made this weird comment about how he can tell someone's immigration status

03:30.400 --> 03:36.480
just by looking at them. I saw on the way into work a illegal immigration family digging through

03:36.480 --> 03:42.240
the trash, looking for recyclables. How did you know they were illegal? You can tell. Jesse.

03:42.240 --> 03:47.760
I can tell. I'm a city guy. And you don't want me to get into it, but I can tell.

03:47.760 --> 03:53.600
Jesse's commentary on The Five and his commentary more broadly tends to follow this type of pattern,

03:53.600 --> 03:59.200
using provocative commentary that seems designed or to shock or entertain depending on the audience.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.560
It usually doesn't have much of the way of serious analysis. On The Five, his voice is balanced out

04:04.560 --> 04:09.920
by the other hosts, but on his own program, Jesse Waters Primetime, we can see how Waters stands on

04:09.920 --> 04:14.240
his own while under the biggest spotlight he's ever had. I should also mention that even though

04:14.240 --> 04:19.360
he has a Primetime show, he is still also one of the hosts on The Five, so he's on two shows every

04:19.360 --> 04:23.920
weekday for Fox News. He's a pretty big deal over there. To see how Jesse Waters has been getting

04:23.920 --> 04:28.400
along, I watched the first two weeks of his show from its debut on July 17th, though I'm going to

04:28.400 --> 04:33.120
mostly focus on that first week as it's fairly representative of his work. I also watched a handful

04:33.120 --> 04:37.920
of episodes for the past year and it's all pretty consistent in quality. And yes, this show has been

04:37.920 --> 04:43.920
on for over a year. In fact, it began airing on January 24th, 2022 as a replacement for the

04:43.920 --> 04:48.880
aforementioned Waters world. So what we're getting isn't a whole new show, but rather a time slot

04:48.880 --> 04:53.520
shift. Keep that in mind, as this shouldn't be seen as a show still trying to figure itself out

04:53.520 --> 04:57.840
in its early days, but rather an established entity trying to fill the big hole left by the

04:57.840 --> 05:02.960
departure of Tucker Carlson. Waters' show is structured like most other cable news shows,

05:02.960 --> 05:07.600
a feature story that takes up the first 15 to 20 minutes, usually including a short interview.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.000
The next segment will run a bit shorter, maybe five to ten minutes, and also typically has an

05:12.000 --> 05:16.400
interview. And then there are a barrage of quick stories and segments, often not lasting more than

05:16.400 --> 05:20.560
a minute or two. It's amazing how many segments they squeeze into this 40-minute program,

05:20.560 --> 05:24.720
usually getting six or seven in each episode. And that's not counting the puff segments where

05:24.720 --> 05:29.680
Waters reads text messages he gets through the program or goes on short rants about his dentist.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.080
For the sake of organizing the flurry of stories and segments from just one week of the program,

05:42.080 --> 05:47.360
I'm going to organize them into three categories. Real daily news, that is the news of the day that

05:47.360 --> 05:52.880
is timely and relevant to the broader public, boilerplate issue news, stories that individually

05:52.880 --> 05:57.600
don't mean much on their own but serve as evidence of a larger persistent issue in the news,

05:57.600 --> 06:03.360
and non-news stories that have the appearance of news but are actually not reporting or commenting

06:03.440 --> 06:09.120
on anything of value. I also have a bonus category for stuff that was just weird and silly. These are

06:09.120 --> 06:14.400
segments I wanted to talk about but could find a place for. One of the big problems facing cable

06:14.400 --> 06:20.240
news is its struggle to find enough news to fill a 24-hour schedule. That isn't to say there aren't

06:20.240 --> 06:25.040
things happening in the world that are newsworthy. There are plenty of stories to fill up 24 hours.

06:25.040 --> 06:30.640
The real challenge comes in finding stories that appeal to a wide audience. As I write this, there

06:30.640 --> 06:34.880
is a coup happening in Niger where there is an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected

06:34.880 --> 06:40.000
government. I don't expect the story to get more than a few mentions on Fox News at best,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.360
and I would be absolutely shocked it was mentioned at all in Jesse Waters' primetime. In fact,

06:45.360 --> 06:50.400
in the two weeks I spent watching this program, it wasn't mentioned once. On the other hand,

06:50.400 --> 06:56.720
there was typically at least one story every night about Hunter Biden. This isn't just a Fox News

06:56.720 --> 07:01.520
problem though. MSNBC and CNN have this same tendency to focus on stories that appeal to

07:01.520 --> 07:05.920
their audiences more so than any broader principle of news of the day. After all,

07:05.920 --> 07:11.440
these channels are designed to earn advertising revenue. And generally speaking, people are less

07:11.440 --> 07:16.000
interested in a government being overthrown in Niger than they are about cocaine being found in

07:16.000 --> 07:20.720
the White House. Which brings us to one of the few real news stories of the day that Waters covered

07:20.720 --> 07:26.960
on his program. Cocaine was found in the White House. On July 13th, the Secret Service announced

07:26.960 --> 07:31.120
it was closing the investigation into the small bag of cocaine found at the White House due to a

07:31.120 --> 07:36.000
lack of physical evidence. This was after it was sent for testing and no fingerprints or DNA could

07:36.000 --> 07:41.040
be recovered from it. That isn't to say the bag was untouched, rather it could easily mean there

07:41.040 --> 07:46.640
wasn't enough uncompromised traces to provide a useful piece of evidence. On his July 18th episode,

07:46.720 --> 08:04.720
Waters covered the story like this. We're already off to a bad start here,

08:04.720 --> 08:10.080
as this interview he's highlighting isn't actually new. It's from Friday, July 14th,

08:10.080 --> 08:15.520
four days before Waters' program aired on Tuesday. I guess this supposedly new development

08:15.520 --> 08:20.080
wasn't urgent enough for him to include it in his Monday show, or maybe because it was from that

08:20.080 --> 08:24.960
obscure network known as Fox Business that perhaps he's not familiar with. It's actually standard

08:24.960 --> 08:29.840
police procedure to destroy drugs that aren't part of an active investigation or criminal trial.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.560
If no one has been charged and the police have no evidence for an investigation, holding onto drugs

08:34.560 --> 08:39.040
takes up valuable space in an evidence locker. I'm sure they have records of the evidence,

08:39.040 --> 08:43.440
whether it be the test results or photographs or other things they can keep for longer storage,

08:43.440 --> 08:48.240
but they simply can't hold onto every piece of drugs they find. But what's more interesting

08:48.240 --> 08:54.880
here is how Waters frames this story and the only supposed path to truth now. The only way now we'll

08:54.880 --> 09:00.080
ever prove whose coke it was is if Hunter confesses. The only way to find out the truth is if Hunter

09:00.080 --> 09:05.440
Pieden confesses. This presupposes Hunter is the one who the drugs belong to. Waters supports this

09:05.440 --> 09:09.440
claim by saying that visitor security is so tight at the White House, only a Biden family member

09:09.440 --> 09:22.640
could have brought it in. Over 500 people work full time at the White House, which Waters does

09:22.640 --> 09:27.040
mention later but not in the clip I just showed you because it's more important that he craft this

09:27.040 --> 09:31.600
narrative first before mentioning facts that are less convenient. It's easier to ignore something

09:31.600 --> 09:36.560
when a person already has the conclusion fed into their mind. Waters always places an emphasis on

09:36.560 --> 09:42.080
the facts that fuel the speculation he wants his audience to engage in that this cocaine could only

09:42.080 --> 09:46.880
have belonged to Hunter Biden. With 500 people working at the White House, it's quite possible

09:46.880 --> 09:51.360
any one of them could have brought cocaine in there and 500 people with probably very busy,

09:51.360 --> 09:56.320
intense jobs and likely coming from privileged households themselves, it's quite possible any

09:56.320 --> 10:00.880
one of them could have been doing cocaine. Did the Secret Service dust the cubby for prints

10:01.840 --> 10:07.120
or did they blow up the cubby also? And if you stash coke in the cubby, wouldn't you want to

10:07.120 --> 10:14.560
cover it with something like put it in a backpack, put it in a book, maybe a pouch? Was there anything

10:14.560 --> 10:20.160
else inside the cubby? I hate to turn this into a basic class on journalism, but asking open-ended

10:20.160 --> 10:26.240
questions isn't journalism. It isn't even analysis. It's the classic conspiracy theory technique of

10:26.240 --> 10:31.200
just asking questions. And with the questions Waters is asking, he's already given away the

10:31.200 --> 10:36.960
game. These questions are designed to create a narrative in the mind of the viewers. Waters isn't

10:36.960 --> 10:40.400
going to answer them because he simply doesn't have the evidence to back them up, but none of

10:40.400 --> 10:44.400
the viewers at home are burdened with that responsibility. And if they need any nudges in

10:44.400 --> 10:48.480
that direction, Waters will make the relevant assumptions and make sure the questions lead

10:48.480 --> 10:53.440
toward a very specific conclusion. That is, only Hunter Biden could have left the cocaine in the

10:53.440 --> 10:58.240
White House. On July 19th, Jesse Waters had an update for a request his team made for footage

10:58.240 --> 11:03.040
from the White House about that cocaine in a locker. Last week, we asked for any and all

11:03.040 --> 11:07.360
surveillance footage relating to the coke bag found at the White House. But the Secret Service

11:07.360 --> 11:13.360
is telling us, no, they're not releasing any tapes or documents. They're telling us releasing it

11:13.360 --> 11:18.320
would interfere with the investigation. But the Secret Service shut down the investigation

11:19.200 --> 11:24.800
last week. This isn't news. This is nothing. Saying you tried to get some evidence, but then

11:24.800 --> 11:30.880
didn't, is not a new development in the story. The subtext is that something fishy is supposedly

11:30.880 --> 11:35.840
happening here, of course without actually doing the very hard work of demonstrating or

11:35.840 --> 11:41.200
evidencing that something fishy is happening here. Waters also covered the very real story of former

11:41.200 --> 11:46.800
President Trump facing another indictment for his role in interfering with the 2020 election.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.840
It was presented like this. Well, it looks like Joe Biden's going to have Trump arrested

11:51.840 --> 11:57.520
again. The only real discussion of the charges here dismisses them offhand and frame the entire

11:57.520 --> 12:03.200
thing as Joe Biden trying to keep Trump occupied in court during the electoral campaign. Something

12:03.200 --> 12:08.880
that's entirely conjecture and based on the idea that Biden is simply too infirm to campaign.

12:08.880 --> 12:14.960
Waters is evidence for this. Supposed strategy is this. And here's Joe Biden nearly falling

12:14.960 --> 12:30.480
asleep with the Israeli president. This is particularly lazy as these videos of Biden

12:30.480 --> 12:35.360
falling asleep at meetings have been circulated in the past only to be revealed as being deceptively

12:35.360 --> 12:41.120
edited. In this case, it's a specific section of footage where if you zoom in, you can see that

12:41.120 --> 12:45.760
Biden isn't falling asleep here. He's reading some notes he placed on his lap. And if you rewind

12:45.760 --> 12:50.000
the tape a little bit, you can see Biden putting those notes on his lap, which might have made it

12:50.000 --> 12:56.400
more noticeable. He's not falling asleep. The rest of this segment is dedicated to dunking on CNN

12:56.400 --> 13:02.480
for how they're covering the story. CNN turned into TMZ and turned Jack Smith into Tom Cruise. Watch.

13:04.880 --> 13:10.480
Turns out even Jack Smith can't resist a $5 foot long. On the point about CNN, fair enough,

13:10.480 --> 13:15.520
covering someone getting a sandwich on their lunch break is deeply silly and reveals how that

13:15.520 --> 13:20.560
channel struggles to fill its 24 hour schedule by wasting air time talking about nonsense.

13:20.560 --> 13:25.120
But how did a story about the indictment of Donald Trump turn into a story dunking on CNN and

13:25.120 --> 13:30.480
hypothesizing that this is all part of Biden's electoral strategy? Probably because it's easier

13:30.480 --> 13:34.880
to mock a media outlet than doing some real investigation into the story itself. If they

13:34.880 --> 13:39.360
really wanted to defend former President Trump, they would dig into the details of the potential

13:39.360 --> 13:43.680
charges, or what little was known about them at the time of this episode, and undermine them with

13:43.680 --> 13:48.480
another set of facts or investigation. Instead of doing that though, they pivoted away from the

13:48.480 --> 13:54.000
actual news to instead attack a perceived enemy. Jesse Waters Primetime is not built to handle

13:54.000 --> 13:58.720
breaking news. This is one of the major challenges for commentary programs in general. To provide

13:58.720 --> 14:02.880
interesting or insightful commentary, you often have to wait for a more complete picture of a

14:02.880 --> 14:07.680
news story to be revealed to really analyze it. But by jumping on breaking news, it leads to

14:07.680 --> 14:12.400
stacked judgments that are more often guided by an agenda or ideology than the evidence itself,

14:12.400 --> 14:16.960
and that ultimately becomes what an audience is coming to see, reinforcement of a narrative more

14:16.960 --> 14:22.000
so than reporting on the news of the day. Jesse Waters Tonight uses news as an impetus to push

14:22.000 --> 14:26.400
narratives, creating the illusion that people are being informed when really they're just being

14:26.400 --> 14:30.800
taught to think about something else when these news stories are brought up. So when someone

14:30.800 --> 14:35.920
mentions Trump is facing a third indictment, someone who watches Jesse Waters Tonight is

14:35.920 --> 14:40.480
now armed with a talking point about CNN worshipping the lawyer helping bring charges

14:40.480 --> 14:46.080
against Trump by covering how he got a sub for lunch. That says nothing about the actual charges

14:46.080 --> 14:50.560
against former President Trump, but it does create the vague impression that the media and justice

14:50.560 --> 14:55.840
system are in cahoots to frame Donald Trump. This program isn't unique in that respect,

14:55.840 --> 15:00.320
though it is pretty brazen in how little regard it has for using evidence of any kind to support

15:00.320 --> 15:05.680
its narratives. It reminds me of a segment I saw on Tucker Carlson's program where he turned a

15:05.680 --> 15:10.720
cringy White House social media post for a surprise birthday party into some grand gesture

15:10.720 --> 15:16.080
demanding obedience from the people. It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out

15:16.080 --> 15:22.000
this concept they've just heard about called happiness. Paris suddenly yells surprise at her

15:22.000 --> 15:26.960
own surprise birthday party, like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities.

15:27.840 --> 15:33.120
What the hell is going on here? Jesse Waters doesn't have that kind of heft to his commentary,

15:33.520 --> 15:38.800
he's not talking about the Democrats being in league with the powerful elites that are trying

15:38.800 --> 15:44.880
to control everything you do and end white people in America. He just sort of calls the Democrats

15:44.880 --> 15:50.080
corrupt, refers to them vaguely as the powers that be, and moves on from there. It's more toothless

15:50.080 --> 15:54.960
than the toxic stuff you would see coming from Tucker Carlson. Boilerplate stories are the ones

15:54.960 --> 16:00.160
that make up the bulk of Jesse Water Prime Time's news coverage. While every story Waters comments

16:00.160 --> 16:05.120
on is tied to some kind of narrative, these are the stories that, if not for the narratives

16:05.120 --> 16:10.320
attached to them, likely wouldn't be covered as news. As a point of comparison, a former president

16:10.320 --> 16:15.120
being indicted is big news no matter what political decision you take. A former NBA player

16:15.120 --> 16:20.400
supporting trans people at an event is not a big news story, unless you want to weave it into a

16:20.400 --> 16:25.040
larger narrative regarding trans acceptance in the mainstream. This cuts in both directions,

16:25.040 --> 16:30.080
by the way. Whether you want to use this clear sign of trans acceptance going up as a good thing

16:30.160 --> 16:35.200
or a bad thing. Case in point, here's Jesse Waters covering that story on July 17th.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.560
Of course, some context is missing from that clip. Here are the part of Charles

16:50.560 --> 16:53.040
Berkeley's comments that weren't included in the clip.

17:20.560 --> 17:29.760
Also, this is apparently something Charles Berkeley does pretty regularly.

17:38.800 --> 17:43.920
The Berkeley non-story tumbles into another story about the live-action Snow White being more

17:43.920 --> 17:50.000
inclusive, which tumbles into an image of some performers using the washroom. This is how quickly

17:50.000 --> 17:54.720
Jesse Waters primetime moves from subject to subject within the same segment. All of this

17:54.720 --> 18:00.560
eventually leads to an interview with an anti-trans activist. This new terminology was the language

18:00.560 --> 18:06.720
of female erasure that would be used to take away my own sex-based rights. All of these little

18:06.720 --> 18:11.360
stories and the quick interview are done within less than five minutes, and they all serve the

18:11.360 --> 18:18.080
same purpose. A generalized anti-LGBT, more specifically anti-trans, message. A popular

18:18.080 --> 18:23.360
narrative on the right and Fox News specifically. These little stories don't say much of anything

18:23.360 --> 18:29.600
on their own, but the interview ties them to this narrative of some kind of coordinated effort that

18:29.600 --> 18:36.640
apparently Charles Berkeley and Disney are working on together to trans everyone. These tiny pieces

18:36.640 --> 18:41.920
of information are merely meant to reaffirm something someone was convinced of a while before.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.760
None of these news stories are particularly newsworthy, but the narrative is all that matters

18:45.760 --> 18:49.920
here, which is why they found their way onto this supposed news program. It's a triumph of

18:49.920 --> 18:55.600
narrative over news. Another example of one of these boilerplate stories, and this was all over

18:55.600 --> 19:01.840
Fox News in general, was the supposed cancellation of the Jason Aldean song, Try That in a Small

19:01.840 --> 19:06.640
Town, and by canceled, they mean not having his video played on the Country Music Television

19:06.640 --> 19:12.400
channel. The story was worth segments on the 18th and 19th, even opening an episode where nearly

19:12.400 --> 19:29.680
15 minutes was spent talking about it. A more cynical reading of this, and one I ascribe to,

19:29.680 --> 19:34.640
is that this whole idea of getting canceled is largely a marketing ploy. Jason Aldean has

19:34.640 --> 19:39.040
courted controversy in the past, and that's gotten him coverage in the mainstream press.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.920
Every time one of his controversial statements is in any way condemned, it's then flipped to make

19:43.920 --> 19:49.280
him some kind of martyr, endearing him to the audience that watches Fox News. It's obviously

19:49.280 --> 19:55.040
not a coincidence that, after getting canceled, Aldean's song hit number one on iTunes. The only

19:55.040 --> 19:59.600
thing even remotely interesting about this story is that Aldean's song includes the lyrics,

19:59.600 --> 20:05.040
cuss out a cop, spit in his face, stomp on the flag and light it up. Yeah, you think you're tough.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.560
We'll try that in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.840
First off, if you spit in a cop's face anywhere, big town or small town, that cop will almost

20:13.840 --> 20:19.200
certainly arrest you. But what's really interesting is that line about stomping or burning the flag.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.200
That's protected speech out of the First Amendment. It's ironic for someone to cry

20:23.200 --> 20:27.600
censorship when their song includes a lyric about censoring the political speech of someone else,

20:27.600 --> 20:32.080
and based on the lyrics, it doesn't sound like he's after some kind of friendly conversation.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.840
And this water segment is an absolute joke when, in the very same episode,

20:35.840 --> 20:39.040
we see Waters complaining about the new live-action Snow White movie,

20:39.040 --> 20:42.720
insisting that they hire little people for the role of the Seven Dwarves.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.560
Were Seven Dwarves not diverse enough for Disney? Think about what's better,

20:47.120 --> 20:51.680
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, or Snow White and the Six Unemployed Dwarves.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.200
Disney has the artistic freedom to make any kind of movie they want,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.400
and Waters is free to criticize them. It just seems strange that,

20:58.480 --> 21:02.160
when someone criticizes Jason Aldean, it's considered censorship,

21:02.160 --> 21:04.800
but not when Waters criticizes Disney.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.720
These are the boilerplate stories that masquerade as news to push a narrative.

21:08.720 --> 21:13.600
And while these are trivial stories, the narratives that are attached create the danger.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.480
What's being fought over here is not the right to free expression,

21:16.480 --> 21:20.640
but the policing of what sort of speech is acceptable in public spaces.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.800
Contrasting these two stories can tell you a lot. When it comes to right-wing media,

21:24.800 --> 21:28.160
a music video being pulled is an attack on American values.

21:28.160 --> 21:34.000
When it comes to supposed left-wing media, it's an outside ideology infecting the population.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.360
And by left-wing, we're talking about the very mild inclusivity of a soulless Disney movie.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.200
So calling that left-wing is too generously adopting the right's framing.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.680
It's more like centrist liberal messaging.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.480
The idea here is to make even though centrist ideas appear far left,

21:50.480 --> 21:54.240
and to police what sort of discourse is acceptable in popular culture.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.320
The easiest way to do that is to engage with anything deemed popular,

21:58.320 --> 22:03.200
and using that to frame any part of it that is left to conservative as extreme.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.320
It both normalizes the right-wing position,

22:06.320 --> 22:10.720
and makes any sort of centrist or left-wing position seem unthinkable.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.200
As much as we might want to ignore these stories,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.920
I do think it's important to acknowledge what they are.

22:15.920 --> 22:21.120
It's not just a dopey guy chasing ratings with a ginned up story about something from pop culture,

22:21.120 --> 22:22.480
although it is that too.

22:22.480 --> 22:27.520
It's also an attempt to fight off even the mildest form of non-conservative messaging and culture.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.800
It would be easy to ignore if millions of people weren't watching this,

22:30.800 --> 22:32.880
and internalizing these messages.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.560
While we roll our eyes,

22:34.560 --> 22:40.640
people are mobilized on social media to harass actresses for daring to appear in certain movies.

22:40.640 --> 22:46.960
And again, this is about a version of Snow White that has fairly modest, centrist inclusivity.

22:46.960 --> 22:51.680
A true leftist Snow White would end with the prince abandoning the monarchy to join Snow White's

22:51.680 --> 22:55.840
multiracial, polycule co-op where they live sustainably in harmony with nature,

22:55.840 --> 23:01.040
taking brief breaks to disseminate anti-monarchist literature to foment rebellion in the kingdom.

23:01.040 --> 23:06.080
And a media controlled by the left would let a bad country music slowly fade away into obscurity.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.480
Because without the whole, canceling narrative,

23:08.480 --> 23:12.720
everyone was happy to ignore this Jason Aldean song when it came out nearly two months ago

23:12.720 --> 23:14.400
before the video was pulled.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.680
Although much of the supposed outrage coming from leftists is overblown on this program,

23:19.680 --> 23:24.240
there was at least one genuine piece of news that was upsetting.

23:24.240 --> 23:28.640
Plowback over Florida's updated school curriculum that included language instructing

23:28.640 --> 23:32.480
teachers to mention the benefits enslaved people got from slavery,

23:32.480 --> 23:36.560
bringing a false sense of balance to what is an obviously hideous institution.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.200
Here's an interesting bit of gaslighting from Waters.

23:39.200 --> 23:43.760
Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied

23:43.760 --> 23:45.200
for their personal benefit.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.560
That's the section everyone's freaking out about.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.040
I always hesitate to use the term gaslighting because it's so overused,

23:53.040 --> 23:56.240
but in this case, I don't know how else to describe this.

23:56.240 --> 24:01.200
Let's put Waters' statement here on the screen and compare it to what he says just seconds later.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.200
No one is arguing slaves benefited from slavery.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.280
No one is saying that.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.080
It's not true.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.760
They're teaching how black people developed skills during slavery in some instances that

24:13.760 --> 24:17.040
could be applied for their own personal benefit.

24:17.600 --> 24:23.280
He says no one benefited from slavery and then says that enslaved people learned skills that

24:23.280 --> 24:25.280
they then benefited from.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.400
It's incredible that he thinks no one can see through this.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.920
The authors of this part of the curriculum defended their choice of words and offered

24:31.920 --> 24:35.920
a list of examples of supposed former enslaved people who used the skills they were forced

24:35.920 --> 24:37.200
to learn to their benefit.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.360
A Twitter user by the name of Alexander went through the list one by one, highlighting

24:41.360 --> 24:44.560
how the majority of these examples cited were never enslaved.

24:44.560 --> 24:48.960
And in one case, one of the examples was George Washington's white sister.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.880
Here it is broken down in a handy chart.

24:50.880 --> 24:57.120
Of the 16 names cited, two of them, maybe, fit the criteria of someone formerly enslaved

24:57.120 --> 25:01.040
who used the skills learned while enslaved in their personal life afterwards.

25:01.040 --> 25:06.800
The two African-American academics who crafted this school curriculum don't appear to be the

25:06.800 --> 25:12.080
best choice for crafting a curriculum when their knowledge of history is so weak.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.440
But this is hardly a lesson worth learning at all.

25:15.440 --> 25:20.320
The lived reality for many of the people who were enslaved, the ones who were eventually freed and

25:20.320 --> 25:25.280
the many, many more who weren't, was not one where they acquired any sorts of skills of their

25:25.280 --> 25:26.160
own choosing.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.400
These were all forced on them so they could be exploited by people who owned them.

25:30.400 --> 25:35.520
When it comes to slavery or any sort of historic event, there are numerous facts that one could

25:35.520 --> 25:40.400
include or not include that help shape the impression of young students when it's taught

25:40.400 --> 25:42.080
in a school curriculum.

25:42.080 --> 25:47.280
Trying to evoke any kind of upside to slavery is a mockery of the horrors of that institution

25:47.280 --> 25:53.040
and brings with it a false sense of balance, as if this horrible period of history requires

25:53.040 --> 25:55.360
some kind of silver lining.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.520
So Waters isn't entirely wrong in this case when he says the left is outraged.

25:59.520 --> 26:03.840
A curriculum written by people ignorant of history trying to soften the impact of slavery

26:03.840 --> 26:07.920
to a generation of children in Florida is something worth getting angry about.

26:08.720 --> 26:13.840
The next group of stories I want to talk about that I noticed on Jesse Waters Primetime are

26:13.840 --> 26:15.520
the non-stories.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.520
These are stories that, once again, serve a narrative but don't even have the tenuous

26:19.520 --> 26:22.880
link to that narrative that a low-stakes boilerplate story has.

26:22.880 --> 26:27.120
These are some of the most weak attempts to present a facsimile of news that's designed

26:27.120 --> 26:30.080
to feed into the fear and paranoia of the audience.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.120
Here's one example from the July 17th episode.

26:33.120 --> 26:39.200
It's about a federal grant of $16 million that is being used to help complete two trails

26:39.200 --> 26:40.000
in Connecticut.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.960
This grant is finishing a project that completes an 84-mile trail connecting the towns of Plainville

26:44.960 --> 26:45.920
and New Britain.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.400
Here's what that segment looked like.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.520
New Britain, Connecticut was given $17 million in infrastructure money from Joe Biden

26:54.320 --> 26:56.240
for an anti-racist hiking trail.

26:56.960 --> 27:01.040
Yes, this has somehow become an anti-racist hiking trail.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.920
But before we get to that, here are a few quick corrections.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.720
First off, it's two trails and not one that this money is for, and these trails are for

27:08.720 --> 27:10.000
more than hiking.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.080
One includes a public bus route that would need to be paved and staffed.

27:14.080 --> 27:18.960
Also, Waters had $17 million, but it's actually $16 million, something his employee gets right

27:18.960 --> 27:21.360
when he goes to speak to the people in New Britain.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.080
$16 million, you could take a hike in the woods.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.440
Does that sound right?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.880
It sounds actually quite boring.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.360
The anti-racist part is the confusing one.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.800
Looking at the official announcement, there's no mention of race at all.

27:32.800 --> 27:37.040
It's part of the Rebuilding America in Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity

27:37.040 --> 27:41.280
Program, which is part of the Investing in America initiative, which does include a

27:41.280 --> 27:43.920
small section on racial equity being a priority.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.360
But this specific project?

27:45.920 --> 27:47.840
What would make it anti-racist?

27:48.400 --> 27:53.920
The best answer I could come up with is because the population of New Britain is nearly 62%

27:53.920 --> 27:54.960
non-white.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.600
In 2023, the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity Program gave

27:59.600 --> 28:06.480
out grants to 162 different projects, and the program has been around in some form since 2009.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.920
Also, this trail project was announced back in 2022.

28:09.920 --> 28:13.440
This is all on excuse to send this guide to a community of non-white people to get

28:13.440 --> 28:18.240
a few quick sound bites complaining about a project that's been inaccurately framed.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.160
This is all intercut with footage of goofy jokes to really hammer home how silly this

28:22.160 --> 28:24.640
should all sound, but this isn't news.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.960
It's an old story that's been trotted out to advance a tired narrative of Biden's

28:28.960 --> 28:34.480
infrastructure plan being bad, and since there are 161 other projects getting grants like these,

28:34.480 --> 28:38.720
among many others that are part of the broader initiative, an endless series of segments like

28:38.720 --> 28:43.280
these can be produced with no informational value whenever they need to fill some time.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.640
It does harken back to the earlier segments Jesse Waters did when he was working for Bill O'Reilly.

28:48.640 --> 28:53.520
None of these were really newsworthy either, but they made people laugh and generated anger

28:53.520 --> 28:55.040
towards the right people.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.600
My favorite non-story though comes from the July 20th episode where Waters reported on

28:59.600 --> 29:03.520
the discovery of an unclassified document that supposedly revealed everything about

29:03.520 --> 29:09.120
Hunter Biden's business dealings that they were not only true but way worse than we realize,

29:09.120 --> 29:13.520
with tapes of Joe Biden making threats and extorting people for millions of dollars.

29:13.520 --> 29:20.640
This document details that Joe and Hunter Biden coerced a Ukrainian CEO to bribe them

29:20.640 --> 29:21.760
10 million dollars.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.880
The document genuinely does say all those things.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.160
I read it myself.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.400
Although, crucially, it doesn't actually have direct evidence.

29:30.400 --> 29:34.480
It claims there are recordings and bank records that prove everything that's said within them.

29:34.480 --> 29:40.640
But the document itself is just saying that this evidence exists, not actually providing

29:40.640 --> 29:41.920
the evidence itself.

29:41.920 --> 29:47.600
I'll let you all know right now I have no loyalty to the Biden family or the Biden administration,

29:47.600 --> 29:52.240
and it's honestly a bit annoying whenever I have to find myself defending them because it's

29:52.240 --> 29:57.280
important to explain how people like Jesse Waters lie about political stories all the time.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.760
If there were real evidence that crimes were committed by anyone in the Biden family or

30:01.760 --> 30:04.640
administration, they should absolutely be investigated.

30:04.640 --> 30:09.040
A scandal like this would be important front page news around the world, and rightfully so.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.080
No government official should ever be above the law.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.360
Though the reason this story is coming up so late in my video is probably similar to the reason

30:17.360 --> 30:21.200
even Jesse Waters didn't open his show with news of this document.

30:21.200 --> 30:26.320
It was mentioned in the second segment of that nice program, 12 Minutes In, and he only spent

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
about two minutes on the story.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.480
It reminds me of the old axiom, big if true.

30:32.480 --> 30:37.600
The statements in this unclassified document come from an FD1023 form.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.280
A message from the FBI explains what type of information these forms contain.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.760
FD1023 is the form our special agencies record raw unverified reporting from confidential

30:47.760 --> 30:50.000
human sources, CHSs.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.040
FD1023s merely document that information.

30:53.040 --> 30:58.080
They do not reflect the conclusions of investigators based on a fuller context or understanding.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.480
Recording this information does not validate it,

31:00.480 --> 31:05.120
establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI

31:05.120 --> 31:06.800
and our investigations.

31:06.800 --> 31:11.760
That unverified part is particularly crucial, especially since this document comes from

31:11.760 --> 31:12.960
2020.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.200
Not included are any documents that reflect any investigation related to this information,

31:17.200 --> 31:20.240
including whether or not the evidence exists at all.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.480
None of this evidence has been presented anywhere.

31:23.040 --> 31:27.520
This raises the possibility that the informant, who provided the information, was either lying

31:27.520 --> 31:29.280
or mistaken about them existing.

31:29.280 --> 31:34.080
Without any additional information, there's really nothing to go on here other than some hearsay.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.880
In other words, until the document's information is verified, this is a non-story.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.560
Someone making a false statement to the FBI is non-news.

31:42.560 --> 31:47.440
After dropping this bombshell on his July 21st episode, Jesse Waters decided to open his program

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
with an update on the document.

31:49.440 --> 31:54.800
If the Ukrainians have 17 tapes of the Bidens talking bribes plus bank records,

31:54.800 --> 31:59.440
and the President Biden has sent Ukraine billions of dollars for, quote,

31:59.440 --> 32:04.800
as long as it takes, you think the President's being blackmailed.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.680
Getting straight to the point, do these tapes exist and is Waters going to play them for us?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.400
And unlike Waters, I'm actually going to answer this question.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
No, he doesn't play them for us.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.160
And he doesn't show any of the bank records that supposedly exist either.

32:18.160 --> 32:22.480
And as of readiness, none of this evidence has come to light.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.920
We can't verify it.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.560
But what we're doing over here is called journalism.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.160
We're trying to verify it.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.760
We're connecting dots.

32:29.760 --> 32:33.440
The reason Waters opened this episode mocking other media outlets instead of

32:33.440 --> 32:38.000
reporting on the veracity of the claims made in the document is because, as he just said,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.600
his team hasn't been able to verify the claims made in the document either.

32:41.600 --> 32:46.080
But that won't stop him from using this unverified piece of information to advance a narrative.

32:46.080 --> 32:50.000
Jesse Waters claims to be a journalist, but he's not reporting any news here.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.880
The story, if there is one, is that this document was released publicly by Republicans for reasons

32:54.880 --> 32:59.280
that could easily be more political than a genuine attempt at investigating a crime.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.280
Republicans using political theater to attack their opponent isn't really newsworthy,

33:03.280 --> 33:08.240
in my opinion, and any journalist reporting on it is in some way complicit in that theater,

33:08.240 --> 33:11.600
unless they're pointing out what the Republicans are engaged in here.

33:11.600 --> 33:16.400
But Waters goes a step further by treating it true until proven false.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.000
It's the triumph of narrative over evidence once again.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.680
I mentioned the cocaine story earlier as a form of real news,

33:23.680 --> 33:28.000
because even though it's less important than the president supposedly being blackmailed,

33:28.000 --> 33:32.560
the key difference here is that there's evidence that someone actually left cocaine in the White

33:32.560 --> 33:37.200
House, and there's still no evidence anything in this form is in any way true.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.560
Now, I've been covering this Biden corruption story for a while now,

33:40.560 --> 33:45.760
and I can feel it's finally breaking through. What about you?

33:45.760 --> 33:48.960
This is how Waters wants his audience to understand the story.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.680
He wants them to feel like it's true.

33:51.680 --> 33:56.640
Not actually think it's true based on the evidence presented, just have that feeling it's true.

33:57.200 --> 34:02.080
This last section is a collection of some bad stuff I saw in this program that I honestly

34:02.080 --> 34:06.400
just don't know how to classify. The first are segments that were just advertisements

34:06.400 --> 34:09.360
for politicians dressed up as a news story and interview.

34:09.360 --> 34:13.680
On July 20th, we had a ridiculous interview with Ron DeSantis where he was making a big

34:13.680 --> 34:18.480
deal of pulling the investments of the Florida Pension Fund out of Anheuser-Busch.

34:18.480 --> 34:23.040
This is in response to the value of the company going down, supposedly of the backlash to the

34:23.040 --> 34:28.560
advertising campaign featuring trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney. And by advertising campaign,

34:28.560 --> 34:33.600
I mean they sent Mulvaney a can of beer and they made a TikTok video about it.

34:33.600 --> 34:38.240
Middle class workers with pensions are seeing their portfolios implode.

34:38.240 --> 34:43.520
So Florida police officers, teachers, firefighters are witnessing their retirement funds collapse.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.600
Bud Light went woke and first responders went broke.

34:47.600 --> 34:52.000
This sounds pretty drastic. People are supposedly going broke because of this slide in the stock.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.960
Using the number Waters has given us, a drop in valuation of $16 billion since April,

34:56.960 --> 35:01.120
we can compare that to Anheuser-Busch's current value of $116 billion

35:01.120 --> 35:04.160
on the date this episode was broadcast, July 20th.

35:04.240 --> 35:09.040
$16 billion out of the former value means Waters is counting this from when the company was valued

35:09.040 --> 35:13.840
at $132 billion on April 1st. So roughly a drop of 12%.

35:13.840 --> 35:18.080
Governor DeSantis gives us more information on how much of this drop affected Florida pensions.

35:28.160 --> 35:33.040
So a loss of 12% of value from $50 million would mean a loss of $6 million

35:33.680 --> 35:41.920
out of $180 billion or roughly 0.003% of the pension was lost because of wokeness.

35:41.920 --> 35:45.680
I think it makes it painfully clear how little an issue this is

35:45.680 --> 35:51.040
and it's hardly worth the governor personally intervening. Though this is effective as PR to

35:51.040 --> 35:55.680
make DeSantis appear as some kind of warrior protecting the people of Florida from wokeness,

35:55.680 --> 35:59.440
lest they lose 3 thousandths of a percent of their pensions.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.280
We can see something similar in the July 19th episode where Ted Cruz was brought on so they

36:05.280 --> 36:11.120
can rage against the Barbie movie for supposedly including a map influenced by Chinese propaganda.

36:11.600 --> 36:17.760
If you see right here, next to Asia, shows the nine dashes. Now those dashes signify

36:17.760 --> 36:23.520
Chinese ownership of the ocean, islands, and reefs. The Chinese believe they own the South

36:23.520 --> 36:28.880
China Sea. But they don't. So why did the Barbie movie bow to China?

36:28.880 --> 36:32.960
I should point out first that the map actually has eight dashes, not nine.

36:32.960 --> 36:37.360
And it's not drawing a border. Those dashes are actually Barbie's journey from Barbieland to the

36:37.360 --> 36:41.760
real world, at least according to a representative from Mattel. I actually haven't seen the movie.

36:41.760 --> 36:47.120
Also, I think it's pretty obvious that this map is not meant to accurately reflect the real world.

36:47.120 --> 36:52.800
It kind of looks like it was drawn by a child. When Cruz is interviewed, he reveals that he

36:52.800 --> 36:57.600
hasn't seen the movie, but he does have some new legislation ready to fight Chinese censorship.

36:57.600 --> 37:02.480
I introduced legislation, it's called the script act that says the federal government

37:02.480 --> 37:09.440
will not allow movie makers to use US government assets, things like jets or tanks or ships or

37:09.440 --> 37:14.320
helicopters, if they allow the Chinese government to censor their films.

37:14.320 --> 37:18.560
US Department of Defense already has immense influence over movies produced by big studios

37:18.560 --> 37:24.640
as it is. To get approval for using any US military assets like planes and tanks, potentially saving

37:24.640 --> 37:29.440
a production millions of dollars, scripts have to be approved by the US Department of Defense.

37:29.440 --> 37:34.000
These approvals sometimes include suggestions to change movie scripts to more kindly reflect

37:34.000 --> 37:39.360
the actions of the US military. Many movies, which studios are trying to reduce the budget of,

37:39.360 --> 37:43.920
will happily agree to these terms to get access to some of these valuable assets.

37:43.920 --> 37:49.520
Ted Cruz's legislation is just empowering this form of governmental oversight on film productions,

37:49.520 --> 37:53.600
making sure that a studio will have to avoid anything seemingly favorable to the Chinese

37:53.600 --> 37:58.240
government, bringing it more in line with the official position of the US government.

37:58.240 --> 38:02.560
If the influence of China is considered censorship by refusing access to a market,

38:02.560 --> 38:06.400
this is just American censorship with a different incentive structure,

38:06.400 --> 38:09.760
refusing access to millions of dollars saved in production.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.280
All that said, I'm not sure how many movies this would apply to.

38:13.280 --> 38:18.000
Most movies featuring the military are already mostly pro-American, and those that aren't don't

38:18.000 --> 38:22.960
typically come out spouting Chinese propaganda. This really just seems like another publicity

38:22.960 --> 38:28.160
stunt to create, the illusion of a politician passing legislation that will protect the people

38:28.320 --> 38:33.760
from Chinese censorship when, in reality, it's just a bunch of hollow posturing.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.720
There are another bunch of segments that I really don't know how to talk about,

38:36.720 --> 38:40.320
aside from pointing out how silly they are, like the one about sharks.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.000
Watch out for sharks.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.040
Or alligators.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.240
The gator hopped right out of the water and chased him halfway home.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.240
Guy's lucky to be alive.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.320
And then there were the cocaine sharks.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.720
Bales of coke are now washing up in the oceans,

38:54.720 --> 39:00.240
and marine biologists are worried that sharks, yeah, are eating the coke.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.760
Oh, and sex robots.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.800
They will eliminate the need for real women.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.360
Do you believe that?

39:07.360 --> 39:09.760
And did you know that Joe Biden got new shoes?

39:09.760 --> 39:11.280
Joe Biden's wearing sneakers now.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.920
He's been rocking a no sock look, too.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.480
What about the Amish? Did you know that they're healthy?

39:16.480 --> 39:20.960
A research foundation found that the Amish are the healthiest people in America.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.200
That last one isn't true, by the way.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.640
The Amish have a lot of health issues, specifically genetic disorders.

39:26.640 --> 39:31.680
Though the reason they bring on Steve Kirsh is to push some big anti-vaccine nonsense.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.000
These stories, of course, are all tied to narratives as well.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.560
It's just hard to talk about every single one of them,

39:36.560 --> 39:39.360
because they're usually very minimal and deeply silly.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.680
Back in 2020, Fox News was sued over some comments Tucker Carlson made on his program

39:43.680 --> 39:44.880
about Karen McDougall.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.680
Fox News successfully defended Carlson by arguing that,

39:47.680 --> 39:49.840
and this is a quote from the judge's opinion,

39:49.840 --> 39:53.360
the general tenor of the show should then inform a viewer that

39:53.360 --> 39:57.200
Carlson is not stating actual facts about the topics he discusses

39:57.200 --> 40:01.760
and is instead engaging in exaggeration and non-literal commentary.

40:01.760 --> 40:05.440
This has been broadly understood to mean that Fox News' lawyers were arguing

40:05.440 --> 40:09.440
that no audience would ever believe Tucker Carlson was telling the truth about anything.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.840
The actual opinion is a bit more narrow,

40:11.840 --> 40:14.960
using details of the script to say that it should have been clear that

40:14.960 --> 40:18.560
Carlson's statements were in that particular episode,

40:18.560 --> 40:20.560
and I'm quoting from the judge's opinion here,

40:20.560 --> 40:24.320
exaggeration, non-literal commentary were simply

40:24.320 --> 40:26.560
bloviating for his audience.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.120
This speaks to how scripts on Fox News are written,

40:29.120 --> 40:32.480
and something that can be seen in the same work Jesse Waters does.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.880
One of the tougher things to nail down when covering Waters,

40:34.880 --> 40:37.040
or any of these more polished presenters,

40:37.040 --> 40:40.960
is that their scripts are put together with caveats and other rhetorical protections

40:40.960 --> 40:44.960
to protect them from being tied to the narratives they're so obviously pushing.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.440
They use questions and offer assumptions,

40:47.440 --> 40:50.000
though when you see the pattern of these questions and assumptions,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.640
they always point things in the same direction.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.800
It protects the hosts from the liability of making these claims

40:56.800 --> 40:59.600
while still advancing them in the minds of their viewers.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.360
To use a more controversial example,

41:01.360 --> 41:04.720
whenever someone has questions about a genocide,

41:04.720 --> 41:08.880
it only ever seems to be questions that suggest it wasn't as bad as people think,

41:08.880 --> 41:10.800
or that it possibly never happened.

41:10.800 --> 41:15.520
The questions never seem to wonder that it might have been even worse or more widespread,

41:15.520 --> 41:18.960
because these questions are searching for a specific answer.

41:18.960 --> 41:23.600
It's how you deny something horrible happened without actually saying it outright.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.360
You simply ask questions and let the audience answer them in their head.

41:27.360 --> 41:31.280
The assumptions are even more telling as leaps of logic are taken as facts,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.200
always moving toward the same conclusion.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.760
Here's a segment from July 27th that really show that in action.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.080
It starts off with a single piece of evidence,

41:40.080 --> 41:42.480
a statement from a supposed IRS whistleblower,

41:42.480 --> 41:44.560
and we're going to see how this program twists it.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.920
The IRS whistleblowers confirm when I asked

41:47.920 --> 41:53.040
if they had documents pertaining to foreign accounts and they said they did.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.760
So with regard to the Hunter Biden investigation,

41:55.760 --> 41:57.280
foreign accounts are a part of it.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.120
Now let's look at the speculation.

41:59.120 --> 42:03.280
With Joe, I suspect there are offshore accounts.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.800
Based on what Comer has said,

42:04.800 --> 42:08.320
he is speculating that the account or accounts belong to Joe Biden.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.840
Looking at his original statement,

42:09.840 --> 42:12.800
we don't even have confirmation that it belongs to any Biden,

42:12.800 --> 42:17.120
just that in this whole story, a foreign account or accounts were used.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.440
Then water starts to grow that speculation.

42:19.440 --> 42:24.400
IRS whistleblowers have indicated that they have documents suggesting that the Biden family,

42:24.400 --> 42:27.920
possibly Joe Biden himself, are hiding money offshore.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.720
Sources tell Primetime they have not seen the documents yet,

42:30.720 --> 42:35.040
but when they do, it goes through a vote and then the documents will be released.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.640
Notice that even though he opens with speculation,

42:38.640 --> 42:42.160
he tempers all of that, kind of protecting himself when he says that

42:42.160 --> 42:44.880
we won't know any more details about these bank accounts,

42:44.880 --> 42:48.560
as they have to go through the House Ways and Means Committee to be approved for release first.

42:48.560 --> 42:53.120
But that doesn't stop him from building on that speculation with a series of questions.

42:53.120 --> 42:56.400
Why would Joe Biden receive money through shell companies from his son?

42:56.400 --> 42:59.840
And why wouldn't Joe Biden have an offshore bank account?

43:00.400 --> 43:03.920
We don't even have evidence that this account or accounts belong to Joe Biden,

43:03.920 --> 43:07.280
but these questions make sense if you're willing to join waters on this ride

43:07.280 --> 43:09.360
that just assumes that to be the case.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.640
I note how the questions all seem to be moving towards the same answer,

43:12.640 --> 43:16.960
that Joe Biden has some suspicious foreign bank accounts for a nefarious purpose.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.640
And then we get to the conclusion.

43:18.640 --> 43:23.680
Once you start zeroing in on foreign, foreign bank accounts, foreign lobbying,

43:23.680 --> 43:28.400
foreign agents, foreign business partners, foreign policy, foreign deals,

43:29.040 --> 43:31.040
that's fertile ground for impeachment.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.360
That's when you get into conspiracy, money laundering, even treason.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.280
And that's why this looks more and more like a bribery ring.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.440
So what we have here is bribery.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.240
And I'll remind you, this all started from the fact that

43:44.240 --> 43:49.120
someone said that this case involves foreign accounts and that is morphed into

43:49.120 --> 43:50.960
Joe Biden is being bribed.

43:50.960 --> 43:54.400
This is how the assumptions made by Waters and the questions he asked

43:54.400 --> 43:57.680
move the audience towards specific conclusions that

43:57.680 --> 44:00.720
Joe Biden is involved in some kind of elaborate corruption

44:00.720 --> 44:03.520
and no real evidence of any of that is presented.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.240
It's all very circumstantial and speculative.

44:06.240 --> 44:09.600
Waters has proven that he can work in unison with Fox News more broadly,

44:09.600 --> 44:11.920
pushing narratives the channel finds useful.

44:11.920 --> 44:14.880
And unlike Tucker Carlson, he doesn't stray as obviously

44:14.880 --> 44:19.600
into the white nationalist talking points, aside from the one or two odd turns.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.480
Waters mostly stays in the realm of the mainstream right.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.800
And he would sooner spend the rest of his time

44:24.800 --> 44:28.800
complaining about infrastructure to attack anti-racism

44:28.800 --> 44:32.800
and not using stories of men tanning their balls to advance fascism.

44:32.800 --> 44:35.120
Waters, as a product of the Fox News system,

44:35.120 --> 44:37.440
is probably the perfect guy for the role he's in.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.800
And the few weeks we got of others trying out for the APM slot

44:40.800 --> 44:45.040
were probably to make sure he wasn't too obviously seen as Tucker Carlson's replacement,

44:45.040 --> 44:47.760
ensuring that the audience wouldn't turn on him right away.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.520
All Jesse Waters needs to do is keep his nose clean and not get into any trouble.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.800
And he can probably enjoy a long career telling the Fox News audience

44:54.800 --> 44:59.200
exactly what they want to hear, unless he runs his mouth and gets himself into trouble.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.720
I did let the air out of her tires.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.280
She couldn't go anywhere.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.000
She needed a lift.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.200
I said, hey, you need a lift?

45:09.200 --> 45:10.320
She got right in the car.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.280
Does she know this story?

45:11.280 --> 45:12.560
No, she doesn't know the story.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.000
Did she watch your shows?

45:14.000 --> 45:15.040
Did Jesse watch?

45:15.040 --> 45:17.920
Credit to Juliet Jeske for popularizing that clip.

45:17.920 --> 45:21.280
Also, her publicly available research helped provide some additional context

45:21.280 --> 45:23.440
for Fox News more broadly while working on this video.

45:23.440 --> 45:26.320
Check out her stuff on Decoding Fox News if you get the chance.

45:26.320 --> 45:30.720
And for the record, in that clip, Jesse Waters has claimed that he was just joking.

45:30.720 --> 45:36.240
What absolutely isn't a joke is that at the time, Waters' future wife was working for him.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.960
And she's also the woman he cheated on his first wife with.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.800
So he seems like a lovely guy.

45:40.800 --> 45:47.280
It does make one thing that his future might not be entirely dissimilar from his mentor, Bill O'Reilly.

45:47.280 --> 45:51.760
I guess we'll see what becomes of Waters and his dollar store David Schwimmer haircut.

45:52.480 --> 45:56.240
One thing I wanted to laugh at but didn't really know how to talk about in the video

45:56.240 --> 46:01.600
was the fact that at the end of every episode, Jesse Waters has a tagline where he says,

46:01.600 --> 46:04.320
I'm Jesse Waters and this is my world.

46:04.320 --> 46:07.840
From the look on his face when he does it, you can tell he's so proud he came up with it.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.280
And it's also maybe one of the worst things I've ever heard.

46:11.280 --> 46:15.360
I don't know why you'd want your catchphrase to be modeled after one of the most famous

46:15.360 --> 46:17.360
box office bombs in history.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.560
But I would never accuse Jesse Waters of ever being clever.

46:20.560 --> 46:24.640
But if you think I'm clever and would like to support me through some sort of

46:24.640 --> 46:29.760
financial means, you can become like all the lovely names you see floating up the screen now

46:29.760 --> 46:32.400
by joining my Patreon and supporting me there.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.680
You can also become a YouTube member if that's more convenient for you.

46:35.680 --> 46:40.320
If you haven't already, I also suggest you like, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell

46:40.320 --> 46:41.680
for notifications.

46:41.680 --> 46:45.840
If you don't know what to comment, why not share your favorite box office bomb?

46:45.840 --> 46:49.760
Extra points if you can somehow weave it into a clever sign off.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.320
Like, I'll be black in a flash.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.840
Thank you all so much for watching.
