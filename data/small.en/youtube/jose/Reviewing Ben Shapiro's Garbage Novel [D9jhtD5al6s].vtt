00:22.000 --> 00:27.040
In 2016, conservative commentator and guy who will absolutely not go to any gay barbecues,

00:27.040 --> 00:32.240
Ben Shapiro decided he would take a break from penning an endless series of books about how to

00:32.240 --> 00:37.040
own the left with facts and logic, and decided to try his hand at writing some fiction.

00:37.040 --> 00:43.520
The title of his first original novel is True Allegiance. This is not a good book.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.720
Do not buy or read it. And now with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get started.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.760
The first thing that a person sees when opening up this book is a terrific cell phone. The very

00:53.760 --> 01:00.560
first page includes praise for the book, including this quote from Salon. Meet our new Ayn Rand.

01:00.560 --> 01:06.320
Of course, the full quote actually reads, Meet our new Ayn Rand. Ben Shapiro's hand-fisted

01:06.320 --> 01:12.320
propaganda fiction is even worse than you guessed. But it's actually even worse than that. Even though

01:12.320 --> 01:17.840
the book calls it praise for true allegiance, this article was published in 2015, a year before True

01:17.840 --> 01:23.120
Allegiance was released. The author was actually taking a shot at Ben Shapiro's short story

01:23.120 --> 01:28.640
collection titled What's Fair that was published digitally that year. The rest of the accolades

01:28.640 --> 01:34.400
come from conservative fixtures and a few creative types. Here's a brief sample. It's prophetic.

01:35.280 --> 01:42.320
Just a little too real for comfort. Is it really fictional? Yes to that last one. That's how

01:42.320 --> 01:46.480
novels work. But to address the other comments, the opening pages of this book are trying very

01:46.480 --> 01:52.320
hard to convince us that this book describes a plausible depiction of the real world. I want

01:52.320 --> 01:58.640
you to think about that as we go through its plot. This is a tough book to read. Particularly

01:58.640 --> 02:04.000
in public, you have to hold it in just such a way that no one can tell you're reading a book by Ben

02:04.000 --> 02:08.800
Shapiro. The actual prose is a lot easier to grasp. The novel is split into three parts,

02:08.800 --> 02:14.080
with chapters divided amongst five central characters, although Ben breaks this rule drifting

02:14.080 --> 02:20.080
to other characters all the time. The main character is Brett Hawthorne. And yes, I do need

02:20.080 --> 02:26.160
to say it like that. Brett Hawthorne is the youngest general in US history at 41. He spends

02:26.160 --> 02:30.560
most of this novel murdering terrorists and getting angry at those damn liberals who would

02:30.560 --> 02:37.040
rather send them winter coats. Our next major character is President Mark Prescott. He's a

02:37.040 --> 02:41.680
president obsessed with how he's perceived in the media, and he's trying to appease the American

02:41.680 --> 02:47.440
population by bringing the troops back home and going massively into debt to China to pay for work

02:47.440 --> 02:54.400
programs. He's generally a cowardly guy. He's also a thinly veiled combination of Barack Obama

02:54.400 --> 03:00.320
and Bill Clinton. Our next major character is Ellen Hawthorne, Brett's wife. Ellen does

03:01.120 --> 03:06.240
something working for the governor of Texas. I think she's an aide for him. It's really hard

03:06.240 --> 03:11.200
to tell because she goes from photographing dead children at the border to leading the National

03:11.200 --> 03:16.800
Guard, and then she's suddenly like a proxy for the governor. I really don't know what her

03:16.800 --> 03:23.520
specific title is. She just does whatever the plot needs her to do. Next we've got Soledad Ramirez.

03:23.520 --> 03:28.640
She runs a ranch that falls on hard times when the EPA shuts down access to a river to protect

03:28.640 --> 03:33.680
a threatened species. It prevents her from watering her cattle and destroys her ranch,

03:33.680 --> 03:39.680
so she resorts to terrorism. This is an obvious nod to the Cliven Bundy story of a few years back

03:39.680 --> 03:44.080
when ranchers took over a government building because he wanted to keep using land stolen from

03:44.080 --> 03:50.560
the government. Our last character is, brace yourself for this one, Levon Williams, a drug dealer

03:50.560 --> 03:55.680
from Detroit who hustles his way into a civil rights movement that's a stand-in for Black Lives

03:55.680 --> 04:02.400
Matter. If there's one character who will just drive you up a wall with the naked racism of it,

04:02.400 --> 04:08.480
it's Levon, so look forward to that. And so there we have our principal cast, three protagonists

04:08.480 --> 04:14.480
and two antagonists. The book opens with a prologue that takes us into the story in Media Reyes.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.880
It's a scene from further along in the story where the George Washington Bridge is collapsing

04:18.880 --> 04:23.040
after a terrorist bombing. Leaving that aside from now, let's go to the first chapter where

04:23.040 --> 04:28.400
Brett Hothorn is stationed in Afghanistan, which is quickly falling into the hands of the Taliban

04:28.400 --> 04:32.880
after the feckless left-wing President Prescott decided to pull out the majority of the troops.

04:32.880 --> 04:38.240
As Kabul crumbles around him, we learn about Brett's backstory. We find out he has a friend

04:38.320 --> 04:42.720
named Derek who taught him how to get out of scraps using his wits instead of fighting.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.240
Fun fact about the rest of this book, every scrap Brett gets into,

04:46.240 --> 04:50.880
he escapes by beating up or murdering the other person. We don't hear from his buddy Derek,

04:50.880 --> 04:56.000
who the book is quick to tell us is his black friend, until much later on when we find out

04:56.000 --> 05:00.880
he grew up to become a plot device. Brett and Ellen have a special way of saying goodbye to one

05:00.880 --> 05:07.360
another. Take a bullet for you babe. I shuddered every time I had to read that.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.600
Back in the United States we meet President Prescott. He's recently come up with a new

05:11.600 --> 05:17.120
governmental program called the Work Freedom Program to get Americans working again. Here's

05:17.120 --> 05:22.800
a fun fact that I'm sure is just a coincidence. One of the campaign slogans the Nazis used in the

05:22.800 --> 05:29.200
1930s was work, freedom, and bread. The phrase comes up from a 19th century German novel,

05:29.760 --> 05:35.600
Arbeit Mach Frei. Where criminals attained freedom through work, it was also the phrase

05:35.600 --> 05:41.760
emblazoned on the gates to concentration camps. I think Ben is trying to suggest something here

05:41.760 --> 05:48.560
by having the president create a Work Freedom Program. As Prescott delivers his speech we meet

05:48.560 --> 05:54.240
Soledad, who has decided to take the impending doom of her ranch into her own hands when she

05:54.240 --> 05:59.440
hires someone to bomb a U.S. federal building. The woman who bombed an office belonging to the

05:59.440 --> 06:04.720
U.S. government is a hero, but the Taliban soldiers who bombed the U.S. embassy in Kabul

06:04.720 --> 06:10.720
two chapters ago are villains. It's strange to see a book use such frightening morality that

06:10.720 --> 06:16.080
justifies actions on the basis of the one performing them, but here we are. Soledad,

06:16.080 --> 06:20.640
captive in her ranch, is surrounded by law enforcement who would easily arrest this

06:20.640 --> 06:26.880
one 50-something-year-old lady except that there are dozens of biker ranchers surrounding them,

06:26.880 --> 06:31.840
ready to die for Soledad. I guess they're ready to just go to war with the cops, okay.

06:31.840 --> 06:37.680
Next we go to Detroit to meet Levon, who's got a fancy crack operation because Ben's knowledge of

06:37.680 --> 06:43.520
black culture is from movies from the 1970s and 80s. Levon meets Jim Crawford, a civil rights

06:43.520 --> 06:48.640
leader who takes Levon under his wing after Levon poorly quotes Hamlet. Jim responds,

06:49.360 --> 06:55.760
quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet. Ben thinks that's what black people talk like.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.760
Then, in the same chapter, we cut away to a new character, Officer Ricky O'Sullivan,

07:01.760 --> 07:07.600
who is confronted by a young boy named Kendrick Malone late at night. Apparently, this boy was

07:07.600 --> 07:11.760
just wandering around the streets of Detroit in the middle of the night. I can't describe the

07:11.760 --> 07:16.960
madness of this scene, so let me just read some of it. As a bit of context, O'Sullivan thinks

07:16.960 --> 07:21.280
Kendrick has a gun concealed in his pants, but at this point he can't see it.

07:22.080 --> 07:28.000
Fuck you, honky. The kid shot back. Get the fuck out of my neighborhood. Then he laughed,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.840
a cute kid's laugh. O'Sullivan looked for sympathy behind those eyes. Found none.

07:34.640 --> 07:41.520
Oh shit, O'Sullivan thought. Then he said, hands up, right now. It goes on like this for a little

07:41.520 --> 07:47.280
while, but later on the scene. You go home, white boy, said the kid. His hand moved lower.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.240
Suddenly, O'Sullivan's head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a preternatural energy.

07:54.240 --> 07:59.440
He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn't going to get shot in the corner of Iowa

07:59.440 --> 08:03.920
and Van Dyke outside a shitty convenience store and in a shitty town by some eight-year-old,

08:03.920 --> 08:09.680
bleed out in the gutter of some city the world left behind. He had a life too. The gun felt alive

08:09.680 --> 08:17.440
in his hand. The gun was life. Yeah, that's right. The kid is eight. As you might have guessed,

08:17.440 --> 08:23.120
this ends with the cop murdering the child. And after he realizes he just shot a child who was

08:23.120 --> 08:29.360
holding a toy gun, not a real one, we get this line. When he looked up, he saw them coming.

08:30.080 --> 08:37.200
Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit coming out of the darkness, congregating. He could feel

08:37.200 --> 08:43.600
their eyes. Soledad's chapter also ended with people surrounding law enforcement, but in that

08:43.600 --> 08:49.120
case, it was the heroic biker ranchers surrounding the cruel cops who were trying to arrest this

08:49.120 --> 08:54.400
harmless woman who bombed a government building. In this chapter, it's a bunch of scary black

08:54.400 --> 08:59.120
people surrounding this innocent cop whose only crime was murdering an eight-year-old.

08:59.760 --> 09:05.920
I would almost think that this symmetry was intentional. I'm not sure Ben is that clever,

09:05.920 --> 09:10.800
unless he was trying to expose his ridiculous bias here. This is Ben's way of showing us who

09:10.800 --> 09:15.280
the good people are and who the bad people are. It underscores what I mentioned earlier. Their

09:15.280 --> 09:20.240
actions aren't material. It's their identity that will inform who we should consider a protagonist

09:20.240 --> 09:26.240
and who we should consider an antagonist. And next, we finally meet Brett's wife, Ellen. The

09:26.240 --> 09:30.320
chapter we meet her in is boring, but it establishes that she works for Governor

09:30.320 --> 09:35.600
Bubba Davis of Texas and that there are drug dealers arriving in Texas by helicopter and

09:35.600 --> 09:40.800
they murder one of Ellen's friends. And this plot point doesn't have any lasting ramifications

09:40.800 --> 09:46.080
aside from letting us know that the border is soft and under threat by Mexico. I mean,

09:46.080 --> 09:50.880
drug dealers, right? It's drug dealers who are coming across the border, sure.

09:50.880 --> 09:56.720
Ben is cramming a lot of topics into this story. I'd say way too many for 266 pages,

09:56.720 --> 10:03.440
but who am I to disagree with the cool kid's philosopher? Back in Afghanistan, Brett Hawthorne

10:03.520 --> 10:07.840
finds out that the US has been betrayed by the US ambassador to Afghanistan. Apparently,

10:07.840 --> 10:12.720
this guy was a big donor to the Prescott campaign and he was rewarded with becoming

10:12.720 --> 10:17.680
ambassador to Afghanistan. Honestly, that sounds more like a punishment than anything else.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.920
Maybe this is why he betrayed America. We never really get an answer to the question of why he

10:21.920 --> 10:27.360
betrayed America. The plot point is pretty much dropped after this revelation. It's a brief

10:27.360 --> 10:33.040
scene where Brett opens the ambassador's briefcase, finding a map with two sets of coordinates,

10:33.040 --> 10:38.480
one set in Iran and one set in Iraq. And from there, he somehow figures out the ambassador

10:38.480 --> 10:45.760
sold Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction to Iran. I'm not sure how I figured this one out.

10:45.760 --> 10:52.400
He just kind of did. Ben also helpfully rewrote history by giving Saddam Hussein nuclear weapons

10:52.400 --> 10:56.960
he never had. I don't know why he couldn't just pretend it was chemical weapons that were never

10:56.960 --> 11:01.360
found, but Saddam had nukes in this story. Whatever. After that, Brett gets captured

11:01.360 --> 11:07.040
by some terrorists. Governor Bubba Davis gets a lengthy introduction. We find out that the

11:07.040 --> 11:12.080
governor was once a big player in the oil industry and then he ran for office when he found out the

11:12.080 --> 11:17.440
Environmental Protection Agency was threatening the production of oil. It's amazing how a rich

11:17.440 --> 11:23.840
oil tycoon running for office to protect his own business is presented as some kind of hero in this

11:23.840 --> 11:28.880
book. It seems like there's a problem with the system if a rich person can afford to run for

11:28.880 --> 11:34.080
office when their money is at threat. Here's a passage from the book describing Bubba's campaign.

11:34.800 --> 11:39.600
In his opening campaign speech, he named the three top environmental officers in the state and read

11:39.600 --> 11:44.400
off how much they'd received from lobbyists from the environmentalists and how much those

11:44.400 --> 11:48.720
environmental groups received from global competitors like the Saudi government.

11:49.920 --> 11:55.440
Why would Saudi Arabia, which makes its money off of oil, want to finance people

11:55.440 --> 12:02.560
protested against oil? Or these environmentalists specifically against American oil? Typically,

12:02.560 --> 12:08.880
they argue for green energy and getting off oil entirely. It doesn't make sense. Even when Ben

12:08.880 --> 12:14.160
is writing fiction, his conspiracy theories don't seem believable. Also, this scene of an angry Bubba

12:14.160 --> 12:20.480
reminded me of something. Well, go fuck yourself then, he sputtered slamming the phone down on his

12:20.480 --> 12:28.320
carefully crafted maple desk. He looked up. Oh, hey Ellen, glad you're back. I did not hit her.

12:28.320 --> 12:35.200
It's not true. It's bullshit. I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi Mark. Back with Soledad,

12:35.200 --> 12:40.800
she's eventually spirited away from her ranch by Aiden Foster, formerly in law enforcement. Aiden

12:40.800 --> 12:46.640
just couldn't stomach being on that side anymore. And oh god, here we go back and leave on story.

12:46.640 --> 12:52.000
We find out that the recently murdered eight-year-old Kendrick was actually sent there by

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
Levon and Jim so they could manufacture a story about the cops shooting a kid. Yeah,

12:58.640 --> 13:04.720
that's really how it happened. Ben has given us the most ghoulish black activists I've seen in

13:04.720 --> 13:11.680
a book in a very long time. A large group of, as the book puts it, mostly young black men

13:11.680 --> 13:17.040
start protesting. Levon, who is apparently a master of manipulating the media, tricks them

13:17.040 --> 13:21.600
into covering the story from the angle that the shooting of an eight-year-old kid is wrong.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.160
I'm not sure you need to trick the media into believing that a child getting shot by a cop is

13:26.160 --> 13:31.920
a bad thing, but that's how this novel frames it. Ben introduces a new character who gets a focal

13:31.920 --> 13:37.360
point chapter just for this one time only. He's a terrorist from the Middle East and you better

13:37.360 --> 13:43.600
believe his name is Muhammad. In Muhammad's story, we also meet Ibrahim Ashami, a bin Laden-like

13:43.600 --> 13:49.600
figure who, in spite of being a sloughest terrorist, is somehow being supported by Iran.

13:49.600 --> 13:54.960
Considering how much ISIS and Iran are at odds with one another, this is a stretch. It's supposed to

13:54.960 --> 13:59.760
be showing readers that theocratic Muslims will put aside their differences when it comes to

13:59.760 --> 14:04.800
fighting against America. This reads into a broader paranoia about Muslims, that they will

14:04.800 --> 14:10.400
one day create a universal alliance and start attacking the West. It's a grotesque caricature

14:10.400 --> 14:15.920
of Muslims and Islam in general, and it's also exactly what Osama bin Laden was trying to do on

14:15.920 --> 14:21.200
9-11. By having the US respond violently in the Middle East, he was hoping all Muslims would unite

14:21.200 --> 14:28.160
together and team up to fight America. And 18 years later, it's pretty obvious that he failed.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.600
We also get this line, where Muhammad is sitting in a cafe in Tehran and getting very frustrated.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.800
He was getting sick of listening to the Western-style, sinful music blasting over the speakers.

14:39.520 --> 14:45.200
What, he asked himself, does it mean to hit me baby one more time?

14:45.840 --> 14:51.200
So I guess in Iran, music is over 20 years out of date, and pretty neat that they, I guess,

14:51.200 --> 14:55.840
can play American music right there in public. Muhammad picks up a nuke from a Russian guy,

14:55.840 --> 14:59.920
which is weird because I thought it was the American ambassador to Afghanistan who was

14:59.920 --> 15:05.280
hooking them up with Saddam Hussein's nukes, unless this ambassador was also working for Russia.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.680
It's never really explained because Russia's involvement and the ambassador, all this stuff,

15:09.680 --> 15:14.160
is just sort of forgotten about. Brett is in the hands of Ashami, and we get a terrible

15:14.160 --> 15:18.800
comeback line when Brett, after hearing America get talk-town to by Ashami, says,

15:18.800 --> 15:22.240
we live for something. We live to kill bastards like you.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.320
Most of Brett's lines read like this one. While captive, Brett sees a landmark through an open

15:28.320 --> 15:34.080
window and somehow figures out not only is he in Tehran, but that he must be at the same coordinates

15:34.080 --> 15:38.320
on the map he found in the briefcase. I don't know how he puts that one together. Brett is

15:38.320 --> 15:42.960
filmed in a hostage video, and he sends a message back to America by blinking in Morse code.

15:42.960 --> 15:48.480
This was first done in 1966 by Jeremiah Denton when he spelled out torture while describing his

15:48.480 --> 15:54.720
captivity in Vietnam. Ben even describes it in this book. While Denton only blinked out torture,

15:55.360 --> 16:02.640
Brett manages to blink out Airstrike Now, 514231 356961.

16:03.440 --> 16:08.080
Somehow the terrorists don't notice one of the most famous examples of an American sending a

16:08.080 --> 16:12.320
secret message back home, or that he's blinking really weirdly for three minutes.

16:12.320 --> 16:17.440
Also, those coordinates are in the middle of Tehran, so to kill Ashami, Brett is gasking

16:17.440 --> 16:22.800
the president to launch an airstrike on the capital city of Iran. This would start a war

16:22.800 --> 16:27.920
killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, but in Brett's mind that's worth it to

16:27.920 --> 16:33.280
get one terrorist. Because Prescott isn't a complete maniac, he decides to send in a special

16:33.280 --> 16:38.560
forces team instead. Except he waited four days, letting Ashami slip through their fingers,

16:38.560 --> 16:42.800
and Brett apparently didn't need that team to save him anyway because even though he's got a

16:42.800 --> 16:47.440
broken arm and he's been awake for two days straight, he's able to murder both of his guards

16:47.440 --> 16:52.160
and escape. And on the way out, he saves the team that had come to rescue him, because the building

16:52.160 --> 16:56.560
has been set up to explode, and he just sort of hauls them out of there. I'm not sure why the

16:56.560 --> 17:01.280
building exploded, or why there were only two guards though. The terrorists can't afford recruits,

17:01.280 --> 17:06.240
but they can afford extra bombs for all their buildings. Brett knows Mohammed is heading to

17:06.240 --> 17:10.560
America for another attack. He doesn't tell the president because he thinks he's a giant wimp,

17:10.560 --> 17:15.200
so he decides to solve this problem alone. In the wake of all these events, we finally get the

17:15.200 --> 17:20.400
bombing of the George Washington Bridge from way back in the prologue. Back in Texas, Governor

17:20.400 --> 17:24.800
Davis is using the National Guard to patrol the border, which is, from the book's perspective,

17:24.800 --> 17:28.880
working really nicely by turning the southern part of Texas into a police state. It's a bit

17:28.880 --> 17:33.520
frightening how often this book talks about how nice it is to have armed military personnel

17:33.520 --> 17:39.040
everywhere. Since the president hates America, he's annoyed by safety at the border. But Baba

17:39.040 --> 17:47.040
doesn't care. He's just a Texas badass. Ben loves his characters. In Detroit, Levon is unveiling his

17:47.040 --> 17:52.320
master plan to get the city to bow to the will of his angry black man mob so he can start making

17:52.320 --> 17:57.920
reforms to the police system. He wants an all-black police force, and this apparently means they'll

17:57.920 --> 18:04.560
have to have lower education standards and allow in more criminals. Gee, I wonder what Ben is saying

18:04.560 --> 18:09.760
about the black community here. We're getting a caricature of a civil rights leader in the making,

18:09.760 --> 18:14.800
and it's being used to make a broader point about the black community. It's not the legacy of racism

18:14.800 --> 18:18.720
that's held them back, but the evil people who take advantage of the community's

18:18.720 --> 18:24.880
rage and loose moral character. They seem like the violent and angry community easily led astray by

18:24.880 --> 18:31.200
the worst members inside of it. Unless you doubt his expertise, Ben has intimate knowledge of the

18:31.200 --> 18:37.120
black community. Remember this line from earlier on? Quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet.

18:37.680 --> 18:43.680
Thanks to a Republican district attorney, the officer who shot the child won't be charged,

18:43.680 --> 18:50.320
and people are getting angrier. Back in the US, Brett is trying to track down Muhammad,

18:50.320 --> 18:54.640
and we get a cringy scene where Ben Shapiro reveals he doesn't understand what racial

18:54.640 --> 18:59.520
profiling is. In this scene, a Port Authority security guy is refusing to help Brett racial

18:59.520 --> 19:05.280
profile records of people entering the US. Look, Brett burst out, losing his patience.

19:05.920 --> 19:10.800
I don't give a rat's ass at this point whether it's racial profiling or not. Maybe you're right,

19:10.800 --> 19:16.160
maybe Muhammad is a light-skinned Norwegian woman or a Cherokee elder, or maybe he's a Persian or

19:16.160 --> 19:21.280
Arabic-looking son of a bitch who hangs out with other Persian or Arabic-looking sons of bitches

19:21.280 --> 19:27.040
who look like Ibrahim Ashami. If I end up being wrong and he looks like Helen Mirren, feel free

19:27.040 --> 19:32.800
to tell the New York Times editorial board about it. At this point in the story, Brett has a physical

19:32.800 --> 19:40.000
description of Muhammad. In an earlier scene, he describes him. He's about 5'9", 140", skinny,

19:40.000 --> 19:47.280
maybe 17 years old, blue eyes, angular face, sharp, big nose. So if he knows he's looking

19:47.280 --> 19:52.480
for an Arabic guy and has such a specific description, how is that racial profiling?

19:53.120 --> 19:59.040
Racial profiling is questioning people on the basis of their race, not targeting a specific

19:59.040 --> 20:04.000
person whose ethnicity you know and who you have reason to believe will commit a crime.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.800
Maybe Brett is worried about a fake name, but looking up an Arabic man that he has already

20:08.800 --> 20:13.760
seen makes perfect sense. It's the difference between stopping someone on the street because

20:13.760 --> 20:18.480
they look like someone who is trying to commit a crime and stopping someone on the street because

20:18.480 --> 20:23.040
they belong to a certain ethnic group that you just happen to believe commits crimes.

20:23.760 --> 20:29.200
You have a crime which you have evidence is going to occur versus an imagined crime that you think

20:29.200 --> 20:33.920
might occur because that racial group is always responsible for crimes. You see the difference

20:33.920 --> 20:40.640
now. Ben, I suspect, doesn't. We also finally get to hear from Brett's best friend Derek. Remember

20:40.640 --> 20:45.920
him? Well, he's not just your token good black guy, he's also your token Muslim because he goes

20:45.920 --> 20:51.920
by Hassan Abdul. And what makes him a good Muslim, you ask? Well, he infiltrates mosques and informs

20:51.920 --> 20:56.560
on other Muslims to the government. His role in this book is to hand off some information to Brett

20:56.560 --> 21:03.040
and then get murdered because he's just a plot device, not a character. Bubba Davis sends Ellen

21:03.040 --> 21:07.520
to parlay with the president as Prescott demands the National Guard be taken from the border to

21:07.520 --> 21:12.400
help the cleanup in New York City after the bridge was bombed. On Soledad's side of things, we find

21:12.400 --> 21:18.240
out that her new right-hand man, Aidan, is childhood friends with Ricky O'Sullivan, the cop who shot the

21:18.240 --> 21:23.040
eight-year-old black child. So now the threads are coming together as Soledad's team decides to head

21:23.040 --> 21:28.400
to Detroit to rescue Ricky. Their plan is kind of weird. They're going to have the biker ranchers

21:28.400 --> 21:34.080
drive into the middle of the angry mob, which has congregated outside the prison Ricky is currently

21:34.080 --> 21:39.520
staying in. The biker ranchers will start a fight and as things turn violent they'll sneak Ricky out

21:39.520 --> 21:46.000
in the confusion. While this is going on, Levon has Jim, his civil rights mentor, murdered, leaving

21:46.000 --> 21:51.920
Levon in control of the movement. Remember Ashami, the terrorist who's apparently the mastermind

21:51.920 --> 21:55.920
behind all these attacks? You might as well forget about him because we found a new Muslim leader who

21:55.920 --> 22:00.800
will be the focus for the rest of this book. Muhammad and his nuke have hooked up with an

22:00.800 --> 22:07.600
imam named Omari, who runs a major mosque in the US. Omari has close ties to the president because

22:07.600 --> 22:13.520
of course the left-wing president is unknowingly friends with a terrorist. The president is bending

22:13.520 --> 22:18.320
to all of Levon's requests, like letting him influence the police department, not just in

22:18.320 --> 22:23.280
Detroit, but eventually in cities across the US. And now I'm just going to skip ahead to the end of

22:23.280 --> 22:28.400
Levon's story here because from this point on nothing really happens. He becomes more powerful

22:28.400 --> 22:33.120
and he gets everything he wants because the president is afraid of being called a racist.

22:33.120 --> 22:38.800
I'll have more to say about Levon later on. Soledad is finding more people deserting her

22:38.800 --> 22:44.640
terrorist cell and soon the only ones left are her, Aiden, and Officer Ricky. The last biker to

22:44.640 --> 22:51.280
leave them is a guy named Ezekiel, who then helpfully lets us know is black and this guy betrays

22:51.280 --> 22:55.520
them. He's secretly been working with the US government and he gives a scarf with a tracking

22:55.520 --> 23:01.440
device implanted on it to Soledad. It's also strange that he's the only biker whose race is

23:01.440 --> 23:07.840
explicitly mentioned, just a detail I noticed. Soledad gives that bugged scarf to Aiden and it's

23:07.840 --> 23:14.000
in his hands when the president, you know, the feckless coward who would have tea with a terrorist

23:14.000 --> 23:19.680
decides to order a drone strike on American soil. Personally I think it would be easier to just

23:19.680 --> 23:23.760
arrest three people who are driving around on motorcycles but I guess the drone is, uh,

23:24.560 --> 23:29.360
I don't know, doesn't make sense. Since Aiden is the one holding the tracking device,

23:29.360 --> 23:34.080
the operation is botched and it's Aiden who's killed when Soledad was originally the main

23:34.080 --> 23:40.800
target. This brutal murder hardens Soledad, so much so that she's decided she needs to assassinate

23:40.800 --> 23:46.560
the president. She's still supposed to be one of the heroes by the way. Back with Brett. He's now

23:46.560 --> 23:51.520
running around with the evidence from his now dead best friend that Omari is working with

23:51.520 --> 23:57.040
Muhammad and they secretly are going to plan some sort of terrorist attack in New York City.

23:57.040 --> 24:02.080
All while Brett is trying to stay one step ahead of the president's goons. I guess the president

24:02.080 --> 24:05.920
wouldn't want to know about an impending terror attack because he's friends with the guy

24:05.920 --> 24:10.960
perpetrating it. Ellen arrives in New York trying to find her husband and we learn that Muhammad

24:10.960 --> 24:15.840
wasn't in New York to bomb the George Washington Bridge. He's actually part of a second bombing

24:15.840 --> 24:20.960
plot, this one to detonate a nuke inside of New York City. From what I can gather, the plan

24:20.960 --> 24:25.600
was to set off one large bomb in New York City on the George Washington Bridge. Then the president

24:25.600 --> 24:30.000
would call back the military from Afghanistan to help with the cleanup and then with all that

24:30.000 --> 24:35.760
military personnel concentrated they would detonate a second bomb to kill everyone. In this case the

24:35.760 --> 24:40.800
bomb would be a nuke. Generally speaking I think detonating a nuclear weapon inside of New York City

24:40.800 --> 24:45.680
is going to be a knockout punch no matter what comes before it or how much military may or may

24:45.680 --> 24:50.640
not be inside there. But I'm not the terrorist mastermind in a pen Shapiro novel so what do I

24:50.640 --> 24:55.760
know? Amari is now the guy who's detonating the nuke and his plan is to do so during the president's

24:55.760 --> 25:01.520
big speech in New York City where he's pushing his new work freedom program. Brett mindlessly

25:01.520 --> 25:06.480
wanders through the crowd during the president's speech when he bumps into Soledad. He notices her

25:06.480 --> 25:11.600
arm in her purse in a way that can only be understood as her secretly holding onto a gun.

25:11.600 --> 25:17.200
I'm not kidding here's how Ben describes that in the book. He'd seen that arm angle before.

25:17.200 --> 25:21.760
He knew what a person looked like before they pulled a gun from concealment. He could feel

25:21.760 --> 25:26.560
the threat before he even knew he felt it. He could feel it before he felt it. That's just

25:27.200 --> 25:32.960
ah that's good writing isn't it? Brett grabs Soledad. The gun goes off not shooting anyone and

25:32.960 --> 25:38.480
Brett is the one who's tackled by the president's goon as Soledad just melts into the crowd. Brett

25:38.480 --> 25:44.160
is placed under arrest and in that commotion Amari decided not to detonate the nuke. I'm not really

25:44.160 --> 25:48.480
sure why he waited but the president decides to fly away with his inner circle that includes

25:48.480 --> 25:54.320
Amari and Ellen who he's decided is now a hostage to use against Governor Bubba. As they're in the

25:54.320 --> 25:59.440
air president Prescott decides to circle over New York City a few times for a pafoto op. Seizing on

25:59.440 --> 26:04.800
this opportunity Amari is going to threaten to detonate the nuke. Ellen rises to the occasion

26:04.800 --> 26:10.160
in this moment by confronting Amari when all the other passengers can't described in this

26:10.160 --> 26:15.840
unbelievable line. The other passengers looked around uncomfortably paralyzed by a peculiar

26:15.840 --> 26:22.160
inability to overcome their political correctness. That's right the passengers are too politically

26:22.160 --> 26:27.920
correct to stop someone trying to detonate a bomb or maybe he wasn't trying to detonate a bomb.

26:27.920 --> 26:32.560
Amari said he wanted to negotiate with Prescott to get some sort of concession but Ellen reacts

26:32.560 --> 26:38.720
too quickly and instead she detonates the nuke. Instead of stopping the terrorist she does his

26:38.720 --> 26:44.480
job for him and blows up a nuke over New York City and killing hundreds of thousands. The book tells

26:44.480 --> 26:49.040
us it's only hundreds of thousands but the blast I guess would only kill that many. The fallout would

26:49.040 --> 26:53.360
kill millions. I don't think Ben understands fallout because Brett is in New York City when

26:53.360 --> 27:00.240
this happens and he somehow is fine. You wouldn't be if a nuclear bomb exploded over a city the

27:00.240 --> 27:06.160
fallout would kill so many people. Well we already know Ben doesn't understand nukes right because

27:06.160 --> 27:11.280
of this clip. President Trump wanted to nuke hurricanes which by the way I don't even care

27:11.280 --> 27:15.840
whether it does anything it just sounds cool. Just the idea anytime you're talking about nuking

27:15.840 --> 27:20.880
a random thing that's not really gonna hurt anybody I'll admit the 13 year old boy of me

27:20.880 --> 27:26.320
is kind of for it. Oh god he's so dumb. I bet you didn't expect that plot twist though right?

27:26.320 --> 27:32.320
Ben is ending his book by nuking New York City. But wait there's an epilogue in it we find out

27:32.320 --> 27:38.080
that our new president is going to be former VP Allison Martin who for some reason we have not

27:38.080 --> 27:42.960
heard about until now. She blames the nuke going off on Ellen which is more accurate than she

27:42.960 --> 27:48.160
realizes but she thinks it was because Ellen was a suicide bomber sent by the governor of Texas

27:48.160 --> 27:53.440
which is as good a pretense as any to lead the country into a civil war. We also get a glimpse

27:53.440 --> 27:59.440
outside of the US borders where we find an international coalition led by China including

27:59.440 --> 28:06.320
Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia who are launching a massive invasion of the United States. This comes

28:06.320 --> 28:11.040
completely out of nowhere and makes no sense whatsoever. It's maybe the dumbest thing in this

28:11.040 --> 28:16.960
book and it's a very competitive field and in the closing scene we see Brett rescued from prison by

28:16.960 --> 28:23.200
Soledad and together they're going to start a new terror cell which means a sequel.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.920
Some people use VPN for enhanced security and safety. Personally I use it for accessing

28:31.920 --> 28:36.880
different parts of the internet that aren't accessible in my home country of Canada. One

28:36.880 --> 28:42.480
of my favorite shows to watch on Netflix is Kim's Convenience. It's a really great Canadian show

28:42.480 --> 28:47.920
about a Korean family that has a convenience store in my hometown of Toronto. It just finished up

28:47.920 --> 28:53.360
its third season but if I go to Canadian Netflix you'll see there are only two seasons. Season

28:53.360 --> 28:59.200
three is coming on October 2nd. Of course that's not the case for other Netflixes around the world

28:59.200 --> 29:04.960
so what I can do is open up NordVPN and with a few quick clicks I can move IP address from Canada to

29:04.960 --> 29:10.320
the United States or maybe maybe we'll wait to the next election before trying the United States.

29:10.320 --> 29:16.400
Instead I'll move to where my family is from that's Spain and we just click there. Nord will

29:16.400 --> 29:21.680
find the best server to make sure I've got decent latency so the stream comes in okay

29:21.680 --> 29:28.560
and then it switches and there we are. So I go back to Netflix, I refresh the page

29:29.680 --> 29:37.840
and boom three seasons and that's how I use NordVPN. As part of this sponsorship viewers of this video

29:37.840 --> 29:44.960

29:52.000 --> 29:57.600

29:57.600 --> 30:02.640
viewers can support this channel and get a little something extra back as well so do click on that

30:02.640 --> 30:09.600
link below if you're in need of a decent VPN. Style is very subjective. I'm a fan of simple

30:09.600 --> 30:15.040
effective prose and some writers can use language so effortlessly you could read them writing about

30:15.040 --> 30:20.720
anything. Ben Shapiro is not one of these writers. One of the things he does in this book that

30:20.720 --> 30:25.920
constantly bugged me were these short little one sentence paragraphs. Here's how he ends one scene.

30:25.920 --> 30:32.480
He glanced up at the face of the secret service agent on his back. A thick burn scar marked his

30:32.480 --> 30:38.640
face near his ear. Then everything went black. The short sentences are meant to emphasize each

30:38.640 --> 30:43.840
one. It's like writing in bold or under lighting the sentence except less obvious. Unless you do

30:43.840 --> 30:50.400
it all the time and Ben uses this technique dozens of times. She felt tears well in her own eyes.

30:50.400 --> 30:57.200
She couldn't cry. Not yet. So she went to work as usual. Ben also has a problem with starting so

30:57.200 --> 31:03.760
many sentences particularly action scenes with the word then. Then without hesitating he stabbed

31:03.760 --> 31:08.320
the boy through the eye. When he looked up he saw the explosives packed along the ceiling.

31:09.040 --> 31:15.120
Then he noticed a camera operated by remote in the corner of the hallway. The annoying thing

31:15.120 --> 31:19.440
about these sentences is that they're just as effective without the word then. This is what

31:19.440 --> 31:24.160
they look like removed and they're fine. By constantly starting a sentence with then it

31:24.160 --> 31:28.000
creates the impression that this story is being told to me by a child. And I want to give some

31:28.000 --> 31:32.240
special consideration to the many names Ben has come up with for this novel. Here are some of my

31:32.240 --> 31:43.760
favorites. Brett Hawthorne. Mark Prescott. Levon Williams. Ricky O. Sullivan. Bubba Davis. Jack

31:43.840 --> 31:57.920
Blatch. Southers. Ibrahim Ashami. Jim Balaban. Bill Collier. Billy Barron. James Easton McLawrence.

31:59.040 --> 32:08.400
Aidan Foster. Beauregard Feldkopf. And a special shout out to Jeff Jeffords, the soldier who's only

32:08.400 --> 32:13.440
mentioned in one paragraph where we find out his head was cut off and sent to Governor Davis.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.680
For anyone planning to write a book where gruesome decapitation happens, try not to give

32:17.680 --> 32:23.680
the victim a silly name like Mark Markson or Bill Billson. One thing we get a lot of in this

32:23.680 --> 32:29.680
266 page book is characters. Dozens of them. Many appearing for no more than a few paragraphs,

32:29.680 --> 32:34.640
but what's most telling is how these characters are presented to us. Let's take the subplot of

32:34.640 --> 32:39.280
Ricky O. Sullivan shooting the eight-year-old boy. The boy's name is Kendrick Malone, though we

32:39.280 --> 32:43.440
don't even learn that until after he's been murdered. The scene where the two encounter one

32:43.440 --> 32:48.880
another is told entirely from Ricky's perspective. We see the fear, doubt, and regret through his

32:48.880 --> 32:54.320
eyes, creating sympathy for the character. We never get Kendrick's perspective. Part of that

32:54.320 --> 32:58.880
may be because they were trying to hide that this was a setup, but even after he dies, we do meet

32:58.880 --> 33:05.600
his mother, Regina Malone, who's briefly described as a slightly overweight black woman. And that's

33:05.600 --> 33:09.840
about it. She's never a focal point. We never really learn anything about her aside that she's

33:09.840 --> 33:15.680
being used as a prop by Levon and Jim. The Malone family, although victims in this narrative, are

33:15.680 --> 33:20.320
without a story or perspective. They're just props being used to tell us the story of a sympathetic

33:20.320 --> 33:25.360
police officer and two conniving civil rights frauds. When we find out Officer Ricky isn't

33:25.360 --> 33:30.080
being charged with the crime of murdering a child, we get a brief rundown of the district attorney,

33:30.080 --> 33:34.960
Kim Donahue. She's introduced as a straight-shooting Republican who got into office after her

33:35.040 --> 33:40.000
Democratic competition dropped out of the race because of a sex and corruption scandal. Ben

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
tries to give her backstory so we can feel sympathy for her when Detroit's black community

33:44.000 --> 33:49.760
is enraged by her decision to not press charges against Ricky. Ben has no interest in even trying

33:49.760 --> 33:54.640
to present the grievances of black residents of Detroit. People are reduced to easily manipulated

33:54.640 --> 34:00.800
props. We get no backstory or history for Regina Malone or Kendrick. They're just there to be

34:00.800 --> 34:06.080
manipulated by others. We can see this pattern repeated throughout the book. We get a lengthy

34:06.080 --> 34:10.880
story and explanation to create sympathy for Soledad as she descends into terrorism. We see her flee

34:10.880 --> 34:15.520
from her ranch, see her friend get hit with a drone strike, and then watch her try to assassinate

34:15.520 --> 34:20.160
the president. This is taken from the final page of the book after Soledad has rescued Brett and

34:20.160 --> 34:26.080
they're driving towards freedom. Brett looked at her. You're that terrorist. I prefer rancher.

34:26.080 --> 34:31.840
The government made me a terrorist. No, said Brett. You make you into a terrorist.

34:32.880 --> 34:39.280
You're free to get out at any time. Brett went silent. This part of the book could easily be

34:39.280 --> 34:43.600
considered apologetics for a certain type of terrorism and it's all told in a way that we're

34:43.600 --> 34:49.440
supposed to feel sympathy or compassion or at least understanding for Soledad and her actions.

34:50.080 --> 34:55.360
This book is filled with terrorists but we never get more than the briefest explanations for why

34:55.360 --> 34:59.760
they're doing what they do, at least when they're from the Middle East or if they're Muslim.

35:00.320 --> 35:06.000
What's telling is who he attempts to give depth, characters whose actions he feels that need to be

35:06.000 --> 35:12.080
rationalized as blameless like the cop who shoots an eight-year-old kid or justified like the ranchers

35:12.080 --> 35:17.440
who decide to bomb buildings and naturally the lines being drawn are to advance a distinctly

35:17.440 --> 35:24.720
right-wing worldview. Ben doesn't seem concerned or interested in the stories of the Black residents

35:24.720 --> 35:30.800
of Detroit who aren't scumpags or any terrorists who are swept up under this charismatic leader or

35:30.800 --> 35:36.480
even the charismatic leader himself. No, these are cardboard cutouts for the more detailed

35:36.480 --> 35:41.680
protagonists to fight against. One of the major players I've only briefly touched on in this book

35:41.680 --> 35:46.080
is the media. A quick way of understanding who the novel is trying to portray as sympathetic

35:46.080 --> 35:51.360
is seeing what their stance towards the media is. For example, Brett and Ellen show open disdain

35:51.360 --> 35:56.640
or disgust for the press at every turn, whereas President Prescott is enthralled by them. And

35:56.640 --> 36:02.400
Levon uses the media as a tool for manipulation. In these two cases, the media is portrayed as being

36:02.400 --> 36:07.760
powerful enough to lead around the most powerful man in the world but so weak and fragile that it

36:07.760 --> 36:12.560
can be easily manipulated by a drug dealer. The media is a corrupting force in these books,

36:12.560 --> 36:18.720
although Ben points out a few exceptions like box news or conservative bloggers. The few times we

36:18.720 --> 36:24.720
meet reporters or journalists in this book, they're often grimy sneaks like Jack Blatch,

36:24.720 --> 36:29.840
who spreads fallacious stories about Brett cheating on Ellen, or they're empty-headed reporters who

36:29.840 --> 36:36.320
fawn over Leon, particularly reporters who, the book makes sure we know, are white and female.

36:36.320 --> 36:41.920
Just to add a little extra bit of racism to this. The novel is creating this world run by the media

36:41.920 --> 36:47.120
and that media has been captured by people with bad intent, typically activists with left-wing

36:47.120 --> 36:52.080
politics. Considering this book itself is a piece of media, it's not a huge leap to assume

36:52.080 --> 36:57.360
it's playing the same game, acting as a form of propaganda to advance a narrative. Damn the facts

36:57.360 --> 37:02.160
and logic it has to trample under its feet. If the left does it, this book seems to argue,

37:02.160 --> 37:07.120
shouldn't the right do it as well? Left-wing activists are never portrayed as honest actors

37:07.120 --> 37:12.320
in this novel. They are often drug dealers or hustlers seizing power or environmentalists

37:12.320 --> 37:17.040
employed by a foreign government. That one random scene in the book's epilogue of the various

37:17.040 --> 37:22.480
nations on earth led by China uniting to invade the US isn't as random as it seems. It actually

37:22.480 --> 37:26.800
makes perfect sense in the worldview of this book. It's presenting a vision of America that is under

37:26.800 --> 37:32.320
siege, seemingly from within, but in truth the danger comes from outside its borders.

37:32.960 --> 37:38.720
This is an intensely tribal book, dripping with fear and paranoia. Fear of non-Americans,

37:38.720 --> 37:44.320
and often American people of color, as an existential threat to the United States.

37:44.320 --> 37:49.600
And those who represent the liberal establishment are enabling these people to destroy America.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.840
It's a bit scary to think what sort of mind produces this kind of fiction,

37:53.840 --> 37:58.640
a mind so wracked with fear over a world that's out to destroy everything it holds valuable.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.120
Going back to some of those quotes plastered on this book, it's even more troubling to see them

38:03.120 --> 38:08.880
speaking on how real this book felt. And it must be a feeling because it's literally non-factual,

38:08.880 --> 38:13.760
it's completely made up, and it's hilariously inaccurate whenever it discusses geopolitical

38:13.760 --> 38:18.720
dynamics in the real world. Aside from the outrageous plot, to identify with the concerns

38:18.720 --> 38:24.960
of this book is to identify with fear and paranoia. To assume the world, or more accurately America,

38:24.960 --> 38:30.160
is headed towards chaos with one more loan to the Chinese, or every time there's a protest

38:30.160 --> 38:34.400
over a black child being murdered. There are a few small moments in this book where I got the

38:34.400 --> 38:39.280
impression that it was starting to sound like an honest depiction of the mainstream left in America.

38:39.280 --> 38:45.200
I remember one speech by President Prescott that seemed to be a version of something you might have

38:45.200 --> 38:50.480
heard former President Obama say, only not as well written. But then the game would be given

38:50.480 --> 38:56.160
away completely by diving into Prescott's mind to get some vapid line about how much he loves

38:56.160 --> 39:01.280
the cameras, or that he's ogling some blonde in the front row. Ben can't seem to portray left-wing

39:01.280 --> 39:06.080
politics as anything more than a farce, as if there's nothing genuinely motivating that side

39:06.080 --> 39:11.760
of the political spectrum. At least, not anything more meaningful than vanity. I suspect these are

39:11.760 --> 39:16.880
the strawmen Ben wishes he was fighting against, and sometimes thinks he is. By using fiction,

39:16.880 --> 39:21.520
he can make them say the things he thinks they secretly believe. Ironically, this book isn't

39:21.520 --> 39:27.120
giving us a glimpse into anyone's mind, except for Ben Shapiro's. Books very rarely portray the

39:27.120 --> 39:32.640
world in a completely comprehensive and meaningful way. In the hands of truly great writers, they

39:32.640 --> 39:37.920
provide us insights into these small fragments that make up the human experience. What shabbier

39:37.920 --> 39:43.600
writers reveal is something about themselves and how they see the world. Ben's book doesn't reveal

39:43.600 --> 39:48.720
any worthwhile social commentary, rather it lets us look deep into his small paranoid mind and

39:48.720 --> 39:54.320
displays the ugly, prejudiced lens through which he sees the world. And Ben wants us to see it that

39:54.320 --> 40:00.880
way too. Feel like I gotta repeat, please don't read this book. I got my copy from the library,

40:00.880 --> 40:06.000
I did not give Ben Shapiro another sale. Genuinely believe we can learn something using literary

40:06.000 --> 40:09.920
analysis regardless of the quality of the book, and I feel like I learned something reading this,

40:09.920 --> 40:15.360
and it wasn't a complete loss. I hope maybe you got something out of this video too. All those

40:15.360 --> 40:21.040
