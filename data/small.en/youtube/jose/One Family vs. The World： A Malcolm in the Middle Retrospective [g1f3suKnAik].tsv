0	9720	Debuting in the year 2000, Malcolm in the Middle had a profound impact on the world
9720	11320	of television sitcoms.
11320	15920	The show centered its stories around an over-the-top family while popularizing a single-camera style
15920	18160	of filming on network television.
18160	22360	Throughout its run, it was nominated for multiple awards, was a critical darling, and achieved
22360	26680	rating success before finally becoming to an end in its seventh season.
26680	29960	The series was created by Linwood Boomer.
29960	33620	Originally an actor, he broke into the TV world as the character Adam Kendall on the
33620	36080	series Little House on the Prairie.
36080	39620	He gradually moved towards writing and producing, soon finding himself working on a number of
39620	41060	TV sitcoms.
41060	44220	In the writers' room, he would entertain his colleagues with stories of his family
44220	47920	growing up, and eventually he'd put together a pilot based on those early years of his
47920	48920	life.
48920	53000	Boomer was considered gifted and put into special classes, much like the main character
53000	54440	on his show, Malcolm.
54440	59080	My mom would never tell me what my IQ was, so when I wrote Malcolm, I said his IQ was
59080	60680	165.
60680	63600	My mom then told me that mine was never that high.
63600	68760	The idea of a child prodigy in less-than-ideal circumstances was at the center of Boomer's
68760	69760	pitch.
69760	71560	It was easy to write because I knew the material.
71560	75280	I'd been thinking about it for a very long time, and a lot of those pieces in the pilot
75280	76720	were pieces of my life.
76720	79840	I'd spent a lot of time telling them as anecdotes.
79840	81200	They were polished.
81200	84960	Although it was shown to several different networks, the show ultimately landed on Fox,
84960	89320	a network with a history for depicting non-traditional family dynamics, at least non-traditional when
89320	91640	it came to what you would see on network television.
91640	93960	The role of Malcolm was given to Frankie Muniz.
93960	98120	Originally written as a 9-year-old, Malcolm's age was instead made vague to accommodate
98120	100000	the 13-year-old Muniz.
100000	103920	Although Boomer considered himself at that age to be more antagonistic, Malcolm was written
103920	108640	to be more of a charming eccentric, a genius living in a family of underachievers, trying
108640	132680	to understand a world that demeans people like him.
132680	135800	Jane Kaczmarek was cast as Malcolm's mother, Lois.
136320	140680	It was a role that earned Kaczmarek seven Emmy nominations for a lead actress in a comedy
140680	143360	series, one for every year the show is on the air.
143360	147080	Though sadly she would never win the award, she does hold the record for most nominations
147080	149840	within that category without actually winning it.
149840	153600	Along with Malcolm, Lois was one of the two characters left largely unchanged from the
153600	157840	original script for the pilot, a fierce matriarch of her family that holds them together through
157840	159280	sheer force of will.
159280	178400	Brian Cranston was cast as a father of the family, Hal, and unlike the other characters,
178400	181240	was radically transformed by the actor.
181240	185560	Originally a ghostly presence in the series, Cranston played Hal as a character motivated
185560	186640	by fear.
186640	191080	This opened him up to some of the more absurd plot lines and physical gags, with stunts
191080	214880	often performed by Cranston himself.
214880	219200	The oldest child of the family, Francis, was played by Christopher Masterson.
219200	223400	Having been sent away to military school, Francis typically appears in his own self-contained
223400	227080	plot lines, disconnected from the stories back in his family's household, though he
227080	240120	does appear in a handful of episodes that bring everyone together for some chaos.
240120	244640	Justin Burfield played the second oldest brother, Reese, although technically younger than
244640	247880	Frankie Munes, his character was a year older on the show.
247880	250280	Reese is the dimmest member of the family.
250280	253480	He would only be caught using his head to solve the problem if it meant smashing it
253480	259600	against something.
259600	272800	The final member of the family is Dewey, played by Eric Per Sullivan, the youngest member
272800	274700	of the family, at least in the beginning.
274700	278760	He began the series as a cute bit of comic relief, and gradually grew into a budding
278760	288680	musical virtuoso by the series' end.
288680	292360	In the pilot episode of the series, the family was given the name Wilkerson, though this
292360	296320	was dropped afterwards to avoid any specific ethnic label for them.
296320	299640	In the interest of sticking to how they are most often presented in the series, I am going
299640	302240	to avoid using any last name for the family.
302240	306720	The cast was joined by a host of other characters, such as Craig Feldspar, played by David Anthony
306720	311040	Higgins, Malcolm's friend Stevie Carnarbon, played by Craig Lamar Traylor, and Lois'
311040	313500	mother Ida, played by Cloris Lechman.
313500	317440	Another vital aspect of the series was its style, which was unique on network television
317440	322160	at the time, breaking the tradition of a multi-camera setup, where a scene was filmed from multiple
322160	323600	angles at once.
323600	327160	Malcolm in the middle opted to use a single camera for filming, something more akin to
327160	330760	dramas on network television or comedies on cable television.
330760	335080	There was no studio audience, or laugh track for that matter, and to compensate, the series
335080	341240	used a number of techniques, camera movements, montages, and lots of changes in filming locations.
341240	345240	Although commonplace among comedies today, back in 2000, this was incredibly rare for
345240	347120	network television sitcoms.
347120	352640	Malcolm in the middle premiered on January 9, 2000, on Sunday night, between The Simpsons
352640	354080	and The X-Files.
354080	358400	It was a plum spot, and an advertising blitz ensured that this show would have every advantage
358400	363080	possible to make a strong first impression, and a strong first impression is exactly
363080	369920	what it made.
369920	374520	The first episode of the series, creatively titled Pilot, begins with Malcolm offering
374520	380720	some narration to the camera.
380720	385000	A rarity for TV sitcoms, Malcolm offers us a running narration throughout the series,
385000	388280	giving us some insight into how his mind works in any given scene.
388280	391880	But this does more than provide context, it lets us see into the mind of a genius to
391880	395400	realize that the things he cares about in life aren't all that different from what
395400	396400	we care about.
396400	400120	After the opening credits, with a song performed by They Might Be Giants, we meet the rest
400120	401760	of Malcolm's family.
401760	404280	Malcolm and his brothers have two states of being in their home.
404280	406840	They're either fighting with each other, or they're asleep.
406840	411160	While the boys walk to school, Francis is introduced through a short montage.
411160	438120	It's here we see two strengths of the show's style.
438120	441760	On your standard sitcom, there are usually only a handful of locations, due to the cost
441760	444280	and effort of building new sets for a multi-camera setup.
444280	448320	A single camera lets them film on various locations more easily, so we get to see things
448320	451080	that would otherwise be summarized by dialogue.
451080	454680	In this example, it's the many exploits of Francis, shown through a series of quick
454680	459000	cuts, watching the chaos of his teenage years unfold, rather than having it summarized by
459000	461280	a character describing his antics.
461280	465040	This moment would have far less impact if it was someone talking about how Francis lit
465040	468840	a car on fire and hooked up with a girl, instead we actually get to see it.
468840	473200	The episode's plot introduces the premise of Malcolm's genius finally being noticed
473200	485160	in school, and him being brought into the gifted class.
485160	499000	We meet Malcolm's eventual friend Stevie, and Malcolm reluctantly connects with him.
499000	503040	The idea of being normal comes up a lot in this series, and Malcolm is desperate to hold
503040	516720	on to that.
516720	521240	By the end of the episode, we realize that this is Malcolm's first step into realizing
521240	532280	he doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the world, that he isn't quite normal.
532280	535880	Although most of us aren't geniuses, what's relatable here is the feeling of not quite
535880	540520	fitting in at school, of being unsure of where exactly your place is in the world.
540520	542640	In Malcolm's case, he's a genius.
542640	546880	But for other kids, it might mean braces, an unexpected growth spurt, or having to move
546880	547880	somewhere new.
547880	552280	This episode's resolution sees Malcolm embracing Stevie as a friend, standing up to a bully,
552280	554680	and deciding to make the most of his new situation.
554680	557780	Although rough around the edges, Malcolm is a good kid, and now he's stuck trying to
557780	560720	figure out his new status as a krellboying.
560720	564680	In the series krellboying is a term used to describe kids in the gifted program.
564680	568680	It gradually fades away over time, as Malcolm's krellboying friends become a less prominent
568680	569940	part of the series.
569940	574440	The name is a reference to the Rick Moranis character in the 1986 movie Little Shop of
574440	575440	Horrors.
575440	580160	It's hard to imagine kids in the year 2000 having strong memories of a fourteen-year-old
580160	581600	horror musical.
581600	585920	This is one of those little details that remind us this is a show written by adults about
585920	590960	kids who don't necessarily have their finger on the pulse of pop culture in the 2000s.
590960	595560	This episode includes the first and only appearance of the family's last name, Wilkerson, seen
595560	597960	here on Francis' nametag.
597960	603200	The pilot was a huge success, winning Primetime Emmy Awards for Writing for a Comedy Series,
603200	606960	awarded to Linwood Boomer, and Directing, awarded to Todd Holland.
606960	611880	In the ratings, it pulled in 22.4 million viewers, and the following week's episode,
611880	617320	Red Dress, set a series high for 23.3 million viewers, although the first season would eventually
617320	621520	settle to an average of roughly 15 million viewers per episode.
621520	625320	The episode Red Dress also includes one of the most obvious shots of a crew member in
625320	627680	an episode I've ever seen.
627680	632320	Another thing that made Malcolm in the Middle different was how it structured its episodes.
632320	637200	While other sitcoms would have a main plotline and a shorter backup plotline in each episode,
637200	641040	Malcolm in the Middle could sometimes include up to four different plotlines running through
641040	642440	a single episode.
642440	645960	It ensured that, even though Malcolm was the main character, he would never have to shoulder
645960	650720	the bulk of each episode, and really emphasize that the show was an ensemble cast.
650720	655520	Malcolm's teacher, Caroline Miller, played by Catherine Lloyd Burns, is credited as a
655520	658760	principal member of the cast, though that would only last for the season.
658760	662840	She serves as a guide for Malcolm into his new surroundings in the gifted class.
662840	667960	Malcolm's world in the gifted class, self-contained in the first few episodes, comes crashing
667960	683200	up against the reality of his family in the episode Crawl Boyin' Picnic.
683200	687480	Up to this point, Malcolm's intelligence has largely just been an abstract IQ score,
687480	691760	but the climax of this episode shows us what his brain is truly capable of.
691760	717120	And, much to Malcolm's relief, he finds out his family, while shocked, isn't about
717120	729600	to treat him like a completely different person.
729600	733040	One interesting distinction here is that Malcolm isn't entirely alone.
733040	736240	Throughout this episode, the Crawl Boyins are constantly fawning over him.
736240	739960	He's the smartest kid in class, and they're all deeply impressed, and it's heavily implied
739960	743720	in the series that these nerds being bullied in the present are destined for great things
743720	745000	in the future.
745000	748480	Malcolm is literally being welcomed into a new class of people, and he's afraid of
748480	753240	losing his place in the world he would have to leave behind, represented by his family.
753240	755160	Malcolm's family is not rich.
755160	756460	Far from it, in fact.
756460	760640	One of the running themes of the series is just how little money they have for anything.
760640	764600	Malcolm shares a room with his two brothers, both parents work dead-end jobs, and their
764600	767400	house is in a constant state of disrepair.
767400	771160	The outside world is a cruel place for the family, and while they may torment one another,
771160	773280	they also protect each other as well.
773280	776500	Malcolm's fear of losing that connection and being swept up into that new world is
776500	778880	another reason his family is so important to him.
778880	782240	He's seen enough of the world to know that even if he has an edge, he's just a few
782240	785600	mistakes back into that same rut his family ended up in.
785600	788840	While the Crawl Boyins are convinced the world will get better for them in the future, Malcolm
788840	791200	is well aware that it isn't good for them in the present.
791200	794680	The laws of the playground don't favor the smart, they favor the strong.
794680	797000	The Crawl Boyin kids are constantly bullied.
797000	800460	While Malcolm's family can make him feel like he's been cursed, it's all he really
800460	801460	has to hold onto.
801460	803160	There's no winning for Malcolm.
803200	807320	He can only lose the least amount possible, and in this case, it's about not losing
807320	808400	his family.
808400	812880	The dynamic between Hal and Lois is interesting insofar that you have this very strong mother
812880	816720	figure taking charge of the family, and a father figure who is a bit more fearful and
816720	817720	timid.
817720	820640	Not afraid of his wife, of course, but more the world around him.
820640	825120	This unique dynamic invites a conversation about gender roles on the show.
825120	830260	Men in this series are generally presented as uncivilized brutes, only tamed by the presence
830260	831260	of women.
831260	835420	For a season, we can see two examples, with Reese going from schoolyard bully to queried
835420	837460	mess when dealing with a crush.
848740	852380	Eventually, Hal sits him down, along with the other boys, for a talk.
861260	876580	The idea of this destructive behavior being genetic is a bit worrying, and we actually
876580	880820	see it challenged in the episode where Reese, instead of acting like a maniac, takes an
880820	884180	interest in his crush's cheerleading and then trying to talk to her.
891260	907940	The pyramid, a symbol of ancient civilization, is a fitting metaphor for gender roles.
907940	911860	As Reese and Wendy decide to connect in a meaningful way, instead of the more primal
911860	917380	fashion described by Hal, it risks the very pillars that hold this social order together.
917380	921580	Even if society is brought down around them, the bond between two people survives.
921580	923820	And isn't that more meaningful than some dumb pyramid?
923820	928740	We can see the impact of Lois and Hal in the episode, The Bots and the Bees, where Lois's
928740	932820	departure causes Hal to regress into the person he was before he met her.
932820	937700	Hal is a dangerous rebel, untamed and wild, so long as Lois isn't around.
937700	941220	Hal and Reese are interesting to contrast in these two episodes.
941220	945240	The show presents rebellious behavior as a method of attracting women and as a product
945240	946780	of being outside their influence.
946780	950140	It's an outward sign that a man needs a woman to civilize him.
950140	955420	In one generation, we see this script followed unthinkingly, and in another, it's contradicted.
955420	959380	Reese ends up with a potential to love interest, and Hal ends up covered in bees.
959380	963700	It's the difference between critically examining yourself and internalizing what you think
963700	969060	society is telling you a man should be, reducing it to some kind of biological imperative.
969060	972420	Season 1 ended with the episode, Water Park, part 1.
972420	976380	The plot lines here are mostly concluded at the end of the episode, with the exception
976380	981740	of Dewey, who had been left all at home with a babysitter who dies by the end of the episode,
981740	988640	leaving Dewey completely unattended.
988640	993520	The season 2 opener, Traffic Jam, part 2, has the family stuck in traffic while trying
993520	995880	to return home from the water park.
995880	1000000	While technically a continuation of the previous episode, the plot lines are all new, with
1000000	1003960	every member of the family and their own storyline, the Dewey plot line carried over from last
1003960	1007360	season is resolved when he's finally brought home by some bikers.
1007360	1010720	But the one plot line from this episode I want to highlight is how Lois tries to resolve
1010720	1014320	the Traffic Jam through sheer force of will.
1014320	1027340	Lois, who is such a dominant force throughout the first season, is starting to show the
1027340	1028880	limits of her power.
1028880	1053120	Can this notice it again this season in the episode, Traffic Ticket?
1053120	1082200	The
1082200	1086180	contrast between Lois being the voice of authority and her using that voice to stand up to a
1086180	1090220	greater authority reveals that at the heart of the character, Lois believes in a higher
1090220	1092100	form of morality.
1092100	1095900	There's a theory of moral development created by American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg
1095900	1099980	that describes how we grow as moral beings, moving from understanding morals as rules
1099980	1104300	we use to achieve certain outcomes to applying a system of universal ethics.
1104300	1109100	Lois operates at the post-conventional level, certain of her morals and bucking at the system
1109100	1110780	when it won't let her express them.
1110780	1114760	And when Lois is disciplining her children, she's trying to move them up that ladder.
1114760	1118400	In later seasons, we'd see examples of Lois' bending to the rules, but this is typically
1118400	1122400	a product of her needing something from the system, like keeping her job.
1122400	1126060	Although Lois is trying to instill a higher order of morality in her kids, she's also
1126060	1131080	capable of realizing that a system requires some degree of conformity for survival.
1131080	1134520	Going back to Howe's response to Lois about the world working against the family, this
1134520	1138900	is brought into sharp focus throughout the series, and this season has some great examples.
1138900	1143340	In the episode, New Neighbors, we find out the family has had a less-than-positive relationship
1143340	1145700	with most of the other families on their street.
1145700	1155300	Families keep moving in and out of that house, I wonder why?
1155300	1157720	The neighbors here represent the world at large.
1157720	1161660	One important part of this episode is how it shows just what brings the family together,
1161660	1164140	an outside threat, like new neighbors.
1164140	1168540	I think the word everyone is tiptoeing around is feud.
1169540	1182100	Some of the better episodes intersect their various plotlines using this very principle.
1182100	1186300	The ending to Lois' birthday uses a similar conclusion, where the family bands together
1186300	1188420	to fight off a group of clowns.
1188420	1192140	The show never explains why so many clowns are hanging out at the batting cages, unless
1192140	1196000	that one birthday party had four clowns, which seems excessive to me.
1196000	1199880	The economics of hiring clowns aside, the family's ability to hold together against
1199880	1202760	outside threats is a frequent theme throughout the series.
1202760	1207520	It echoes other sitcoms featuring working-class families, where an external conflict, symbolizing
1207520	1212600	the hostility of the outside world, requires the family to band together as a single unit.
1212600	1216720	Season 2 also introduced a few memorable supporting cast members, including Cynthia, played by
1216720	1220240	Tanya Raymond, a girl in Malcolm's gifted class he has a crush on.
1220240	1223560	Although not the first or last girl Malcolm would explore his feelings for, Cynthia is
1223560	1239160	probably the most memorable.
1239160	1243240	Sadly Cynthia would only hang around until Season 4, and was replaced before then by
1243240	1246480	a rotation of increasingly forgettable love interests.
1246480	1250880	And Season 2 introduced us to another special talent held by one of the boys, Reese, who
1250880	1274080	is a gifted chef.
1274080	1278240	But Season 2's most celebrated episode, by far, is bowling.
1278240	1283120	The episode uses the premise of either Hal or Lois taking the boys out bowling, and displaying
1283120	1287440	two stories in parallel that represent the different timelines created depending on which
1287440	1289720	parent takes the boys out on that trip.
1289720	1293640	While the respective stories offer a few interesting twists and turns, it's the novelty of how
1293640	1297640	they're presented that really sets this episode apart, using creative editing techniques
1297640	1299780	to highlight each timeline transition.
1299780	1303880	The fortunes of the characters vary, and the episode contrasts Hal's loose parenting
1303880	1308160	style with Lois' stricter style to create happy endings for different boys.
1308160	1312280	A good night out is a roll of the dice, and neither parent is necessarily better than
1312280	1315920	the other, but each one has their own strengths and weaknesses.
1315920	1320480	Highly praised at the time, it won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing and Writing
1320480	1324480	for a Comedy Series for Todd Holland and Alex Reed, respectively.
1324480	1328560	To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle for me to find much to say about this episode
1328560	1329760	outside of its style.
1329760	1333760	The randomness of parenting and the largely forgettable nature of both storylines makes
1333760	1338440	me think a lot of the acclaim this episode got was for its technical achievement.
1338440	1341200	Episodes like this make me feel as though Malcolm in the Middle's more interesting
1341200	1343400	aspects were overshadowed by its style.
1343400	1347060	The better episodes did have some interesting commentary in them, but the show was so unique
1347060	1351560	in its presentation at the time that it garnered most of the critical attention.
1351560	1354960	The last episode I want to highlight from this season is Flashback, where we see how
1354960	1381920	Parenthood ruined the family's fortunes through a series of flashbacks.
1381920	1406640	The episode ends with Hell and Lois reminding each other of why they're in love.
1406640	1408420	This is such a sweet episode.
1408420	1412280	Love holds the family together in the face of their increasingly dire circumstances.
1412280	1416100	The episode is an inversion of the threats highlighted in the episodes like New Neighbors.
1416100	1420300	This shows how families create disruptions in their own lives, but unlike the hostile
1420300	1424380	world, a family can offer the very real reward of comfort and love.
1424380	1428060	Even when the world is literally raining on you and the only dry space is a house with
1428060	1432260	three screaming boys, it's not so bad when you know there's some love in there too.
1432260	1436020	Part of why I think this show struck a chord with so many people is because of that.
1436020	1440660	Most people's families are messy and complicated, but there's still a core of love in there.
1440660	1448340	This was a sitcom that dared to show an unvarnished version of that love.
1448340	1452300	Unlike the other boys in his family, Francis' plotlines are typically far removed from the
1452300	1454060	other characters in the household.
1454060	1458380	Starting the series off in a military economy, his plotlines contain their own unique supporting
1458380	1463580	cast where Francis and his buddies are constantly at odds with the demanding common-dense Spangler,
1463580	1465980	played by Daniel van Bergen.
1465980	1470780	Season 3 completely changes Francis' circumstances as he emancipates himself, letting him leave
1470780	1475940	the military academy, and heads to Alaska for promises of riches with his friend Eric
1475940	1477780	Hansen, played by Eric Neninger.
1477780	1482340	Francis' stories in the first two seasons center around rebellion against authority,
1482340	1483900	and the third is no exception.
1483900	1487820	When he travels to Alaska in season 3, he finds himself working a rough job under the
1487820	1504180	auspice of the hot-tempered Lavernia, played by Brenda Well.
1504180	1508060	Season 3 also meant the introduction of the most prominent member of Francis' supporting
1508060	1511540	cast, Piyama, played by Emmy Coligado.
1511540	1516180	Piyama introduces a shift in Francis towards more responsible behavior, eventually leading
1516180	1520100	him to work as a ranch hand in season 4, though he never quite gets it together in
1520100	1522740	a way suggested by her early appearances.
1522740	1527500	And while I think it's neat that the show included an indigenous character of an unspecified
1527500	1532220	tribe, and Coligado does do a great job in her performance, it's a little awkward seeing
1532220	1537880	an indigenous character portrayed by someone whose background is Filipino, which is literally
1537880	1540100	on the other side of the world.
1540100	1542580	Francis as a character is a symbol of unfocused rebellion.
1542580	1546980	While it might be tempting to write him off as a bad seed, Francis demonstrates kindness
1546980	1550700	and intelligence throughout the series, though it never manifests itself in the special ways
1550700	1552220	we see in his brothers.
1552220	1557060	Reese has his cooking, Malcolm is a genius, and Dewey eventually blossoms into a musician,
1557060	1559620	but Francis never gets any special skills.
1559620	1563420	As we only see him in his futile struggles against a military school trying to shape
1563420	1567500	him and a low-paying job exploiting him, this is a commentary on how the world punishes
1567500	1568500	rebellion.
1568500	1572060	With his brothers as a comparison, it appears though the family space is the one that affords
1572060	1576700	the chance to explore possibilities and push limits in a safe way, and one thing all the
1576700	1580900	boys in this family do is consistently push the limits through their acts of rebellion
1580900	1582420	against authority.
1582420	1586620	After his family sent him to military school, Francis was more or less at the mercy of the
1586620	1590820	system, and this show demonstrates that the system does not care about him at all.
1590820	1594300	He can either become a military drone or work a dead-end job in misery.
1594300	1598460	The closest we see to Francis living a happy life is in season 4, with the boss who treats
1598460	1602860	him with kindness and respect, though in this case it's an outsider to that system,
1602860	1605900	Otto Mankuser, played by Kenneth Mars.
1605900	1609420	Eventually Francis drops the ball there too, perhaps it was just too late for him to learn
1609420	1613340	how to function in society, or perhaps more accurately, Christopher Masterson would have
1613340	1616860	less of an on-screen presence on the show in later seasons.
1616860	1620980	Either way, his character remains an indictment of a system that abandons those who buck up
1620980	1622020	against it.
1622020	1625700	One moment I want to highlight in season 3 is the synthesis of some of the ideas presented
1625700	1626940	in earlier seasons.
1626940	1630860	In Los' makeover, when the boys play against Hal in a game of basketball, they come into
1630860	1635300	one of the few domains where Hal feels comfortable being a domineering patriarch.
1635300	1649860	The boys bend together to fight back.
1649860	1660860	But Hal then starts to play dirty.
1660860	1664860	Eventually they play a final game where the boys unveil their secret weapon.
1664860	1667580	The boys take down the system by punching it in the balls.
1667580	1671260	It's a nice little story about how the rules are stacked against the younger generation
1671260	1674020	until they bound together to hit it where it hurts.
1674020	1678100	So simple and so effective, this little moment I think embodies so much of what this series
1678100	1679100	is.
1679100	1682860	And in Mayan Pagan, this is where the series peaks, with its strongest message about uniting
1682860	1687900	together against an unjust authority.
1687900	1692820	It isn't pretty, but it's a response in kind, and one Hal certainly won't be forgetting.
1692820	1695780	Hal is the past and the boys are the future.
1695780	1698780	One they'll be making more just by working together.
1698780	1703300	There was still much more Malcolm in the middle to go, and season 3 had a major one-hour special
1703300	1707780	that included a number of guest stars, including Terry Bradshaw, Heidi Klum, Tom Green, Howie
1707780	1712140	Long, Christina Ricci, Magic Johnson, Bradley Whitford, who was married to Jane Kaczmarek
1712140	1717060	at the time, and Susan Sarandon, who was nominated for an Emmy in this appearance in the episode
1717060	1719060	Company Picnic.
1719060	1723940	While ratings for season 3 were strong, and Company Picnic in particular was a great performer,
1723940	1726180	the gentle decline was starting to show.
1726180	1729620	The series still had some important things to say, and would of course return to some
1729620	1731300	of its earlier themes as well.
1731300	1740420	Much of the impact it had made in its debut was starting to wear off.
1740420	1744420	As the series progressed, Malcolm's stories tended to be less about his krull-boying friends
1744420	1746340	and more about his dating life.
1746340	1750780	He had numerous love interests over the years, like the blonde one, the other blonde one,
1750780	1752180	and another blonde-haired girl.
1752180	1757000	These stories tended to downplay his intelligence, revealing that being a genius can come hand-in-hand
1757000	1760220	with being ignorant of how to act around a girl you have a crush on.
1760220	1764020	In the episode Stupid Girl, we see Malcolm actively hide his intelligence to attract
1764020	1783660	a girl named Allison, played by Brittany Finnimore.
1783660	1787340	More importantly than his love interests, Malcolm's relationship with his mother is
1787340	1791920	afforded the rare opportunity to grow when she traps him for a special talk about dating.
1818200	1821120	Malcolm's conversation with Lois was really great.
1821120	1824800	It shows us a parent-child connection that's rarely seen on sitcoms and presents it as
1824800	1826760	something healthy and productive.
1826760	1830360	Growing up involves seeing your parents as adults and learning from all their experiences.
1830360	1834720	It's hard to imagine Lois having this conversation with Reese, so maybe it's not a perfect fit
1834720	1839160	for every kid, but it's a nice contrast to seeing the boys at odds with their parents.
1839160	1843280	Sadly, this wasn't followed up in any meaningful way throughout the series, which is an example
1843280	1847960	I think of how the show was capable of producing great episodes, but couldn't change its dynamic
1847960	1851100	enough in a meaningful way to capitalize on them.
1851100	1855320	Another example of some of the limitations of the show appeared in the episode, if boys
1855320	1859460	were girls were Lois fantasizes what her life would have been like if she had had daughters
1859460	1860660	instead of sons.
1873280	1883520	Reese has become Renee, Mimi Paley, Malcolm is Mallory, Lisa Foyles, and Dewey is Daisy,
1883520	1884520	Jeanette McCurdy.
1884520	1901840	Lois's fantasy eventually makes a turn for the realistic.
1901860	1905940	The episode ends with Lois still wanting a girl, so the conclusion is satisfying enough
1905940	1909740	as it shows parental love accepts the good with the bad, but a sign of the show losing
1909740	1914160	some of its edge was watching the girls deliver the message of the episode so bluntly.
1914160	1917620	Having the moral of the story delivered in such a ham-fisted way is a lot less clever
1917620	1919680	than those earlier episodes.
1919680	1923700	One interesting bit of trivia about this episode is that the story credit went to Alexandra
1923700	1928380	Kaczynski, the 11-year-old niece of the show's costume designer Heidi Kaczynski.
1928380	1932940	I wish they had done a better job of bringing this 11-year-old visionaries idea to life.
1932940	1937280	One new idea introduced in season 4 that the series actually built upon was Dewey's special
1937280	1948680	talent, being a musical prodigy.
1948680	1968400	And we find out that Hal was a YouTuber before YouTube was even a thing.
1968400	1973280	But the most important change for the series was, undoubtedly, the birth of Jamie.
1973280	1976760	Early in this season, we found out Lois was pregnant, much like Jane Kaczmarek was at
1976760	1977760	the time.
1977760	1981400	Kaczmarek would miss several episodes because of her pregnancy, although we would see her
1981400	1983640	getting increasingly pregnant on camera as well.
1983640	2007880	This pregnancy came to the explosive finish in the two-parter titled, Baby.
2007880	2030600	The baby is named Jamie.
2030600	2034200	And while initially there is some mystery around the baby's gender, Jamie is eventually
2034200	2037020	revealed to be a boy at the beginning of season 5.
2037020	2040420	The new child undoubtedly means new hardships for the family, and perhaps that's why
2040420	2044500	the season ended not with the baby being born, but instead an episode trying to find Jamie
2044500	2047340	Daycare in an episode appropriately titled, Daycare.
2047340	2056060	In need of some assistance, the family turns to the church.
2056060	2059940	The completely non-religious family has suddenly become inspired by the word of God.
2059940	2064160	It's a simple dramatization of how religion can sometimes be less a product of spiritual
2064160	2067960	discovery and more a necessity for people who need community connections to make ends
2067960	2068960	meet.
2068960	2095800	It also introduces an interesting moment where Lois realizes something about Jamie.
2095800	2099440	In an episode where we see the family reject religion, we also see a mother who doesn't
2099440	2102480	instantly turn into a maternal force upon meeting her baby.
2102480	2106760	That's a couple of very big conventions this episode turns on their head, a rarity compared
2106760	2107760	to sitcom's past.
2107760	2111600	One of the great strengths of this show is that it takes very common ideas that might
2111600	2115600	pop into people's minds, like not loving your child as much as you think you should
2115600	2119520	or not being religious when it's expected of you, and presents these thoughts as things
2119520	2122600	not to be ashamed of, but instead to be addressed.
2122600	2127360	But living up to some unrealistic sitcom perfection is not only okay, but more realistic
2127360	2132560	than the more commonly depicted happy family on the quiet street with the picket fence.
2132560	2135920	This was a huge part of the appeal of Malcolm in the Middle, it portrayed a family that
2135920	2140160	not only behaved in ways that felt more real, it also included characters with psychology
2140160	2141720	that felt more real as well.
2141720	2145360	The birth of Jamie is often described as the point where the show began its decline in
2145360	2149400	quality, and while I'd personally say it happened a bit earlier, a decline in quality
2149400	2152100	doesn't necessarily mean the show has gotten bad.
2152100	2155380	One later season still had a few interesting things to say.
2155380	2161220	My parents tell me this is going to be a very special Thanksgiving.
2161220	2164500	In season 5, Malcolm finally gets a job.
2164500	2168100	Even though he's still in high school, he's drafted into an entry-level position at The
2168100	2171280	Lucky Aid, which is the same drugstore Lois works at.
2171280	2175340	Work is presented as boring and lacking in challenge, what's even more depressing is
2175340	2179780	that by working alongside his mother, Malcolm is getting a glimpse into his possible future.
2179780	2184020	We're proud of our 95% employee retention rate.
2184020	2189300	You may think you're just starting a job, but when you join the Lucky Aid family, you're
2189300	2191980	here for life.
2191980	2194660	He also sees a side of Lois that he hadn't before.
2194660	2197060	One minute you're telling me I'm doing a great job, and the next minute you're writing
2197060	2198060	me up.
2198060	2199060	You broke the rules, Malcolm.
2199060	2202140	Come on, that box-planting area is a stupid rule.
2202140	2203140	You know I'm right.
2203140	2207460	Albert is a grade 5 employee, he has put in 20 years of service time.
2207460	2210980	Sometimes that's more important than what's right or wrong.
2210980	2212740	Who are you?
2212740	2216660	Lois manages to convince Malcolm not to share her secret, but when the favor needs to be
2216660	2219700	returned, Lois stitches Malcolm right up.
2219700	2221900	It's not what it looks like.
2221900	2223380	Lois, are you in there?
2223380	2224380	I'll explain later.
2224380	2228540	I know exactly what this looks like to you, but I'm asking you for a little flexibility.
2228540	2229540	Trust me.
2229540	2232060	Lois, where's the- what's going on here?
2232060	2234980	Well, I'll have to write Malcolm up again.
2234980	2238340	He's flattened another box outside of the box-flattening area.
2238340	2240340	And he has no recourse.
2240340	2241660	You're growing up.
2241660	2243180	You're sick of living under my authority.
2243180	2244580	You want me to cut you some slack?
2244580	2247700	You're wondering when I'll finally see you as an adult.
2247700	2251140	Well, that's never going to happen.
2251140	2253780	That's just not the way it works.
2253780	2256980	You can move away from home, you can get married, you can have kids of your own.
2256980	2260100	You can even become a professor of physics at MIT.
2260100	2262860	I will always be your mother.
2262860	2265740	And that's just the way it is until one of us dies.
2265740	2270300	After all this time, seeing Lois go from strict but ultimately just to becoming another tool
2270300	2272340	of the system is disappointing.
2272340	2276060	This is probably the saddest lesson learned in the series, that the world that's so unfair
2276060	2278600	to Malcolm can also include his parents.
2278600	2282620	They have to live under the same system that imposes their rules on him, and in many ways
2282620	2287980	this is another example of Malcolm seeing his parents as adults, as he enters adulthood
2287980	2289100	himself.
2289100	2292180	Work is often the tool used to keep Malcolm and his family in their place.
2292180	2296060	The only reason Malcolm has to take this job is because Hal is the victim of a corporate
2296060	2299720	shake-up that he doesn't completely understand, and money is tied in the family.
2299720	2304260	Work is consistently shown as a means of being exploited by someone somewhere.
2304260	2308940	Way back in season one, in the episode, Malcolm Babysits, Malcolm gets his first ever taste
2308940	2312700	of employment working as a babysitter, only to find out that the generous couple had been
2312700	2314740	secretly recording him the whole time.
2314740	2318180	A few lines from Lois and Hal in this episode make the point especially clear.
2318180	2319900	I don't even know what they're going to pay me.
2319900	2320900	I'll tell you what they're going to pay you.
2320900	2323060	They're going to pay you what all jobs pay.
2323060	2325700	Less than your worth, and just enough to keep your crawling back for more.
2325700	2327100	So how's the job going?
2327100	2329020	They were jerks, so I quit.
2329020	2331380	Well, that's pretty much what work is.
2331380	2333020	Welcome to the club.
2333020	2336180	And in season two, we see what Hal's life would have been like outside of work, where
2336180	2338820	he dedicates his time to creating a painting.
2338820	2342700	Hal goes on a rollercoaster becoming a more effective parent, to becoming an obsessive
2342700	2345980	painter, to finally creating something truly beautiful.
2345980	2348460	I did it.
2348460	2350860	I really did it.
2350860	2353860	What's that sound?
2353860	2357780	I don't know.
2357780	2358780	It sounds like...
2358780	2359780	Look out!
2359780	2360780	Paint the lairs!
2360780	2361780	Help!
2361780	2370140	The family could never have anything good, and the world seems to constantly be working
2370140	2371140	against it.
2371140	2372820	Why do we root for these losers?
2372820	2373860	Because they never give up?
2373860	2375140	Is that what life is?
2375140	2377220	Getting knocked down over and over again?
2377220	2378540	Always getting up?
2378540	2379540	Until you die?
2379540	2383660	That piece of art that immediately self-destructs is a good metaphor from that case.
2383660	2387740	The only options Hal has now is to pick up the brush again, or forget it and go back
2387740	2388860	to work.
2388860	2392300	And who can't relate to putting your dreams on hold because you have to go up there and
2392300	2393300	make a living?
2393300	2396420	It makes Hal want to stand up and do something about it.
2396420	2399980	Although I really only mentioned this episode because it included one other moment I've
2399980	2400980	had to highlight.
2400980	2403980	I've had this cute lab partner in science for eight weeks now.
2403980	2405920	Her name is Cheryl.
2405920	2408540	I finally left Cheryl no on her desk asking her out.
2408540	2414380	And when she read it, she turned to me and said, do you know who Reese is?
2414380	2417760	So then she goes, does anybody know who Reese is?
2417760	2420260	And everybody shrugged.
2420260	2423420	So then I said, probably some nobody.
2423420	2426140	And you know what?
2426140	2427140	I was right.
2427380	2431740	Okay, now that I've brought the mood down, let's talk about Reese.
2431740	2435460	Although often presented as a dumb force of destruction, he's probably the most tragic
2435460	2437100	character in the principal cast.
2457140	2460940	Then I worked on my triceps.
2460940	2463340	I want to break up.
2463340	2464340	Oh.
2466340	2467340	Yeah.
2467340	2468340	Yeah.
2468340	2469340	That's okay.
2469340	2470340	Yeah, it's fine.
2470340	2471340	No.
2471340	2477020	I was just kidding anyway about, yeah, no biggie.
2477020	2480780	Look, Reese, it's not you.
2480780	2481780	It's me.
2481780	2483500	I just think I can do better.
2483500	2485940	Reese is a very tough character to like.
2485940	2489520	He's a bully and completely heartless at times, but he's also capable of showing
2489520	2493700	some genuine concern for others, at least when it comes to his family.
2493700	2498260	I'll say grace.
2498260	2501780	Thank you Lord for giving me the talent to express my love for my family and the only
2501780	2503060	way I know how.
2503060	2504060	Amen.
2504060	2508420	In Reese's apartment, we see a great example of what's really holding him back.
2508420	2510220	He's just not that bright.
2510220	2511860	You've been using credit cards?
2511860	2512860	How much have you spent?
2512860	2516180	10, 11 grand, but I'm still way under the $20,000 limit.
2516180	2518420	How can you spend that much in 10 days?
2518420	2521780	Well, you know, I got that new convection oven, and that made the refrigerator look
2521780	2522780	kind of shabby.
2522780	2526100	Plus, I had to buy new clothes every time mine got dirty, and that giant gong in the
2526100	2527100	bathroom?
2527100	2529660	I mean, how do you guys do it?
2529660	2531620	And this is his whole character in a nutshell.
2531620	2536380	He's not that smart, and not being that smart makes an already tough world that much tougher.
2536380	2539260	His options are limited, and he's left to lash out violently.
2539300	2544540	That may be why this season ends with a two-parter titled, Reese Joins the Army, and Reese becomes
2544540	2546140	the ideal soldier.
2562140	2566300	But eventually, Reese has to turn on his brain and use his misbehaving to win the war game.
2569260	2595300	It's frightening to think that what makes Reese a good soldier is that he can go from
2595300	2597900	unthinking robot to malevolent troublemaker.
2597900	2602140	Both are apparently crucial modes for a soldier, at least according to the show, and this
2602140	2605900	season ends with Reese headed into active duty in Afghanistan.
2605900	2608780	As a character, Reese seems to have the dimmest future ahead of him.
2608780	2613180	His good qualities can only manifest in environments that he spent years carving out a space in,
2613180	2617420	and the US military is less patient with him than Lois, ready to ship him off to Afghanistan
2617420	2619100	rather than send him to his room.
2625300	2635900	Season 6 resolves the Reese plotline with Lois traveling to somewhere in non-specific
2635900	2642420	South Asia to bring him home.
2642420	2648060	With the US government failing him, Reese's only salvation is, once again, his family.
2648060	2652540	The old theme of family holding together in the face of an indifferent society returns,
2652540	2656500	albeit in a very extreme and strange way that's less compelling than it was the first
2656500	2657500	time around.
2657500	2660820	The commentary on the military could have just as easily been applied to Francis'
2660820	2662620	time in the military academy.
2662620	2665500	One major change was the larger role in the series for Dewey.
2665500	2669980	In season 5, Dewey don't mix up at his school, Dewey is placed in the special ed class and
2669980	2674340	we're introduced to a supporting cast of kids called Buseys, taking their name from
2674340	2677780	actor Gary Busey, known for his eccentric behavior.
2677780	2682060	This gives us a glimpse into the lives of the kids in the special education class.
2682580	2686740	While a premise like this could have taken a very bad turn, the show instead reveals
2686740	2691380	how placing these children in classes that have given up on them only makes things worse,
2691380	2695780	and the differences displayed between the special needs and gifted classes are so stark
2695780	2700300	that I can't help but read a very real commentary on social class differences here.
2700300	2704180	All it takes is doing poorly on some tests, and then your change in class means you'll
2704180	2708220	be perpetually falling behind your peers, forced to watch them excel in ways you'll
2708220	2709540	never have a chance to.
2709540	2714260	Much like Reese's military adventure mirrored Francis's, a change in class for Dewey and
2714260	2718780	a metaphor for a change in social class mirrors Malcolm's, although there's a less promising
2718780	2721160	future in Dewey's new class.
2721160	2725240	Season 6 takes the special ed class premise and continues to build on it, with the Busey
2725240	2727280	kids appearing in several episodes.
2727280	2730540	Each of them revolve around the basic idea that they need Dewey to take care of them,
2730540	2733920	whether it's an episode where they all run away to live in a tree, or an episode where
2733920	2738300	Dewey arranges for them to be in an opera based on his family's internal strife.
2738300	2741860	Although generally a decent depiction of kids with special needs, taking some time
2741860	2746180	to portray them as having personalities and not just a walking collection of symptoms,
2746180	2749140	their dependency on Dewey borders on depressing at times.
2749140	2753340	In the episode, Buseys take a hostage, Dewey has neglected his friends, and without his
2753340	2767700	guidance they lash out at their teacher.
2767700	2771740	This episode goes a long way in explaining how these kids, left behind by the system,
2771740	2775700	desperately cling to the one person who offers them the chance to have fuller lives, and
2775700	2780140	the fact that this person is also a kid puts a huge strain on him, and he neglects them.
2780140	2784100	It's ridiculous to imagine that a classroom full of kids should be cared for by another
2784100	2785100	kid.
2785100	2788020	This is a portrait of how society has failed the children who need them the most, and even
2788020	2797060	worse, lets them be exploited.
2797060	2801460	The episode's framing sadly obscures this point, as demonstrated by Francis' talk
2801460	2816540	with Dewey, where he's told he shouldn't shirk his responsibilities.
2816540	2819540	The idea that this should be on Dewey is completely backwards.
2819540	2823020	The kids in the class need help, and even if Dewey can somehow get them through the
2823020	2825740	year, is his life now just taking care of them?
2826100	2827460	And what about kids in other grades?
2827460	2831100	They would have to hope to get lucky enough to have a compassionate caretaker.
2831100	2834700	Dewey is forced to sacrifice his own happiness for others, and the show's framing of this
2834700	2839740	is admirable, while positive on its face, is more accurately read as a complete failure
2839740	2840860	of the system.
2840860	2845700	One person cannot fix a system on their own, though when one person makes a stand it can
2845700	2848260	sometimes inspire a greater call to action.
2848260	2852540	In the episode Billboard, the boys vandalize a giant billboard, and when caught they try
2852540	2878940	to play it off as activism.
2878940	2897300	As the episode progresses, Reese has a realization about women.
2897300	2901860	The idea of using activism to escape blame is interesting, and it fits in with the cynicism
2901860	2902860	of the show.
2902860	2907380	All the power of activism affecting change, even on the people exploiting it, demonstrates
2907380	2908380	its power.
2908380	2912820	We are who we pretend to be, after all, and maybe even performative activism is better
2912820	2914340	than doing nothing at all.
2914340	2919220	In the episode Tiki Lounge, this same idea is taken a step further when Malcolm is forced
2919220	2923800	into joining his school's booster club, a blisteringly positive group of teens always
2923800	2926900	looking to hold special events to raise money for charity.
2926900	2930500	Malcolm assumes they're just a bunch of phonies looking for an excuse to throw a party, and
2930500	2934860	their unrelenting positivity is a cover for their insincerity, while running the auction
2934860	2937580	he tries to expose their hypocrisy.
2937580	2943220	First set him up, our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put up for auction a photograph
2943220	2952380	of herself from 8th grade, with her original nose.
2952380	2974220	I appreciate that the booster club really was passionate about the causes they claim
2974220	2976980	to care about, even though they're not very good at raising money.
2976980	2981140	It's a very kind critique of the champagne liberal stereotype.
2981140	3005520	Her hearts may be in the right place, but their methods are less than ideal.
3005520	3009340	A lot of the praise for a show like Malcolm in the Middle I see from people further on
3009340	3014220	the left often touts its realism, and that realism, especially in earlier seasons, is
3014220	3017060	often buoyed by a deep cynicism about the world.
3017060	3021020	Unlike previous episodes, though, this episode was surprisingly positive in its outlook and
3021020	3024820	conclusion, offering the important lesson that setting aside pride can help different
3024820	3027260	groups of people achieve great things.
3027260	3031660	Thinking of the modern day and the temptation of people further left to mock liberals for
3031660	3037140	their hypocrisy makes this episode seem like a stark contrast to that tendency, as it offers
3037140	3041460	a counterpoint that good things are possible when working on goals together with people
3041460	3045900	who may be misguided in their methods, but are ultimately interested in helping other
3045900	3046900	people.
3046900	3050860	And it's better to set pride aside to achieve positive change rather than sneer at people
3050860	3061020	who could be allies.
3061020	3065580	The season 7 premiere, Burning Man, took the family on the road to experience the desert
3065580	3066580	festival.
3066580	3070860	It's weirdly fitting and strangely out of place at the same time, a familiar feeling
3070860	3072020	in the later seasons.
3072020	3076340	There's one interesting part where Hal's suburban father routine is considered an art
3076340	3091580	piece.
3091580	3092980	Is this show art?
3092980	3094260	What even is art?
3094260	3095780	Is it the depiction of the real?
3095780	3096780	The unreal?
3096780	3099740	Is it an emotional experience or an intellectual encounter?
3099740	3103780	Hal's subplot seems to be asking these questions about the show, with a crowd viewing him
3103780	3108260	as a stand-in for suburbia, offering them a window into this forbidden space.
3108260	3112300	Is that, then, how we, the audience of the show, also experience it?
3112300	3116900	Or do we feel kinship with Hal's perspective, seeing these eccentrics as the outsiders?
3116900	3121940	We're watching them, watching him, but also, watching him, watch them.
3121940	3125980	What is the act of watching someone in a space we can never enter, as our stand-in
3125980	3127700	is entering it for us?
3127700	3132900	We will never go to Burning Man, or rather, we will never go to the idea we have of Burning
3132900	3135300	Man that this show is representing.
3135300	3141300	Or maybe more accurately, the show is mocking the kind of overwrought artistic interpretation
3141300	3142980	like the one I just gave.
3142980	3146740	Malcolm in the Middle is a show that, when it works, feels very real.
3146740	3151100	It's conveying the idea of the family struggling to survive in a world that sees them as commodities
3151100	3152340	to be exploited.
3152340	3155780	When they go on adventures like this one, it starts to feel less real.
3155780	3158180	It's more like a hallucination out in the desert.
3158180	3163300	The season 7 premiere scored a 3.5 in the ratings, which is a very far cry from its
3163300	3164800	earlier seasons.
3164800	3169020	On average, it was getting less than 4 million viewers per episode.
3169020	3175100	In January of 2006, Fox announced that Malcolm in the Middle would be ending this season.
3175100	3179220	Francis had largely exited the show by this point, only appearing in a handful of episodes,
3179220	3182720	but Christopher Masterson was still a part of the series, directing an episode this season
3182720	3184820	titled Hal Greaves.
3184820	3187980	Masterson wasn't the only cast member to direct an episode in the series, though.
3187980	3192660	Bryan Cranston directed several episodes in the series, including Malcolm Defends Reese,
3192660	3194260	which also aired this season.
3194260	3198820	The final season still managed to effectively hit some familiar notes, such as in Lois Strikes
3198820	3203060	Back, where Lois decides to get even with some mean girls who played a cruel prank on
3203060	3204060	Reese.
3204060	3227060	Lois uses some brutal techniques.
3227060	3231060	The idea that certain people are less deserving of justice because their troublemakers might
3231060	3234340	have landed clear had Reese been less of a jerk in earlier episodes.
3234340	3237660	It also doesn't help that the show kinda had the same premise for an episode a few
3237660	3241660	seasons back, in which a teacher flunks Reese because he thinks he's a punk.
3241660	3245460	The episode ends with Lois and Reese finally having something to bond over, the use of
3245460	3248260	cruelty to satisfy their need for justice.
3248260	3251000	Although Reese is probably just in it for their cruelty.
3251000	3255180	As the series wound down, it brought into focus Malcolm and Reese's final year of high
3255180	3259180	school, Reese having deliberately failed a grade so he could spend another year there.
3259180	3263420	Well established as a social outcast, Malcolm works with some of the other school misfits
3263420	3266860	to hold a morp, that's prom spelled backwards.
3266860	3272180	A counterparty for the prom happening in the gym, the morp is in the basement.
3272180	3275220	Malcolm's insecurity gets the better of him, and he has to confront the other kids
3275220	3278860	to let them know he and his outsider friends are having a good time.
3305220	3310420	And no one cares.
3310420	3314020	But eventually the two parties come together, bridges are mended, and the kids decide to
3314020	3334100	leave high school behind, which isn't enough for Malcolm.
3334100	3338260	Things like this that seem to contrast the Malcolm we knew just a season ago, ready to
3338260	3341980	join up with the boosters when he realizes their genuine desire to do good.
3341980	3343900	But that's not the Malcolm we have anymore.
3343900	3347540	And this represents the Malcolm we see more frequently in these later seasons where he's
3347540	3351100	not quite the charming eccentric he was originally written as.
3351100	3359500	And that brings us to the final episode of the series, Graduation, airing May 14th, 2006.
3359500	3363060	The premise for this episode is that Malcolm's family is struggling to find a way to afford
3363060	3370260	sending him to college.
3370260	3373660	Linwood Boomer, the creator of the series, makes a fun cameo in this episode, playing
3373660	3381460	on a loan shark Hal tries to get money from.
3381460	3386300	A friend of Abe, Stevie's father, shows up to offer Malcolm a shortcut, letting him skip
3386300	3390740	college and go straight into the workforce with a hefty six-figure salary.
3390740	3414420	A
3414420	3418500	garbage bomb set up by Reese goes off early in the car, and we get an exchange that sums
3418500	3428140	up the series.
3488140	3497700	I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path.
3497700	3501180	You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.
3501180	3502180	That's Dewey.
3502180	3503180	Really?
3503180	3505620	This is unbelievable.
3505620	3508380	You actually expect me to be president.
3508380	3510740	No, no, I'm sorry.
3510740	3515840	You expect me to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.
3515840	3520740	You look me in the eye, and you tell me you can't do it.
3520740	3525720	The show wraps up with a few interesting visuals, such as this callback to the first episode.
3525720	3530240	Another callback to the first episode is once again revealing the family's last name through
3530240	3536320	Francis' name tag at his new office job, only now the last name we see is no last name.
3536320	3540960	That name is also clearly mouthed by the speaker during graduation when Malcolm is introduced
3540960	3542440	as valedictorian.
3542440	3545900	And the scene closes with Malcolm delivering a nice speech about family.
3545900	3550440	And the series comes to an end with an epilogue, giving us a sense of where all these characters
3550440	3551440	are heading.
3551440	3553040	The final line of the series is,
3553040	3555000	Listen, I'm gonna get to my cab pass.
3555000	3556000	I'll talk to you later.
3556000	3559600	A huge part of what made the series work so well was the obvious chemistry between the
3559600	3560840	actors on screen.
3560840	3564000	It felt like a real family, and in some ways it was.
3564000	3566760	Frankie Muniz spoke to that in a recent interview.
3566760	3570280	It really did feel like a family, especially with us kids.
3570280	3573160	We spent more time together than we did with our real families.
3573160	3577240	We'd be outside playing kickball in sports, and we'd be arguing, fighting, bickering,
3577240	3579640	and playing pranks on each other just like brothers would.
3579640	3582280	So in that sense, you really do become like a family.
3582280	3585160	While the family and Malcolm in the middle was consistently at each other's throats,
3585160	3588760	they also demonstrated the love they had for one another and how protective they were against
3588760	3589760	the outside world.
3589760	3597800	That struck a chord for any family that knew how to band together when it counted.
3597800	3601520	During the end of the series, Frankie Muniz took a handful of rules over the years, but
3601520	3603920	largely stepped away from the world of acting.
3603920	3608400	Sadly Muniz has had continuing difficulties with his health, including two transient ischmetic
3608400	3612040	attacks, also known as mini-strokes, and nine concussions.
3612040	3616000	Muniz believes this is the reason his memory has been severely compromised, to the point
3616000	3618640	where he struggles to remember his time when Malcolm in the middle.
3618640	3623240	That said, he has reported memories returning to him and generally seems happy in his life.
3623240	3627320	He and his wife are expecting their first child in early 2021.
3627320	3631320	Although he was nominated for three Emmys for Malcolm in the Middle, Bryan Cranston's
3631320	3636560	career really took off in 2008 when he was cast as Walter White on Breaking Bad, a role
3636560	3641040	completely unlike Hal, and one which earned him four Emmys, enormous ratings, and glowing
3641040	3644980	praise as one of the most iconic roles on television.
3644980	3646600	So he became a pretty big deal.
3646600	3650680	Cranston has been working on high-profile projects ever since, though he clearly has
3650680	3654840	some affinity for his time on Malcolm in the Middle, going so far as to film a bonus alternate
3654840	3659400	ending to Breaking Bad, which features him waking up as Hal, realizing the Walter White
3659400	3661800	character was just a dream.
3661800	3665720	The same scene included Jane Kaczmarek, who, post-Malcolm in the Middle, found her career
3665720	3670000	completely changed, although she hasn't been cast in a role quite as prominent as Lois
3670000	3671000	since her time on the show.
3671000	3674720	In an interview, she spoke about struggling to get auditions and never being considered
3674720	3678240	for comedy roles at all prior to her time on Malcolm in the Middle.
3678240	3683000	Since the show ended, she's had a steady stream of roles on dozens of projects.
3683000	3687000	Christopher Masterson acted in a handful of projects after Malcolm in the Middle ended,
3687000	3692080	though he seems to have transitioned out of acting entirely in 2014 and now works as a
3692080	3693080	DJ.
3693080	3697480	One fun fact I found about the role of Francis is that Bryan Cranston's Breaking Bad co-star
3697480	3702520	Aaron Paul had auditioned for the role, though the part eventually went to Masterson.
3702520	3706640	Justin Burfield moved away from acting almost immediately after Malcolm in the Middle ended
3706640	3710640	and went into working as a producer, working on several projects before eventually becoming
3710640	3714080	the Chief Creative Officer at Version Produced.
3714080	3718560	Eric Purr Sullivan also stepped out of the acting world, having only appeared in four
3718560	3722800	projects after Malcolm in the Middle, the last one released in 2010.
3722800	3727120	Sullivan has largely left the public eye, though a handful of photos and appearances
3727120	3729760	have emerged in recent years.
3729760	3733080	Since the show's end, there has been some discussion on bringing Malcolm in the Middle
3733080	3737520	back in some capacity, some of the cast members shared their thoughts on a revival.
3737520	3741600	We've talked about how fun it'd be to do a reunion show, season, or a movie, and
3741600	3743480	I don't think anything excites me more.
3743480	3747560	I'd love it because I had such a great time doing the show and the whole cast was amazing.
3747560	3751360	I feel like we have more story to tell, especially 20 years later.
3751360	3754280	There were so many possibilities about what the family could be up to.
3754280	3757040	As a fan of the show, I want to know what happened.
3757040	3760720	I remember one of the final things in that final episode in 2006.
3760720	3764240	Hal and I are rejoicing that we've got two kids out of the house and I come home with
3764240	3768600	a pregnancy stick and you hear us both screaming because I'm pregnant again.
3768600	3770400	If that was true, we'd have a 14 year old.
3770400	3775040	We'd have another Malcolm at home because when the show started, Malcolm was 14.
3775040	3777200	I told Linwin this thing still resonates.
3777200	3780420	I want him to pull him out of retirement and have him write a reunion movie.
3780420	3784360	If we were to produce a Malcolm in the Middle 20 years later show, we'd absolutely contact
3784360	3787200	every single crew member to come back because that's the family.
3787200	3788760	I'm going to keep working on him.
3788760	3790500	I think I can convince him.
3790500	3791500	Like a good wine.
3791500	3792500	It endures.
3792500	3793600	It passes the test of time.
3793960	3797320	It's a classic story and series and I couldn't be prouder.
3797320	3801920	It remains to be seen if anything concrete will materialize, particularly with Linwood
3801920	3804620	Boomer seemingly content with the show not coming back.
3804620	3808920	But in August of 2020, there was a small reunion for many of the cast members on the show.
3808920	3812160	They performed a reading of the first episode of the series over Zoom.
3812160	3816780	Tickets sold to the viewing raised funds for Healing California, a charitable organization
3816780	3819280	that provides free dental, medical and vision care.
3819280	3822960	A handful of photos have emerged from the event and a number of guest stars who appeared
3822960	3826700	in the series throughout the years can be spotted making cameos.
3826700	3828920	Watching the series was a strange experience.
3828920	3832840	At the time of its airing, I was at that young age where I could relate to the younger characters,
3832840	3836480	but now I'm not quite old enough to relate to the adults with children.
3836480	3840480	Late in the series, there's a scene where Hal and a random kid are dancing on an arcade
3840480	3844900	machine that is legally distinct from a dance dance revolution machine.
3844900	3847960	In this footage, I can see my past and my future.
3847960	3852040	And while I could probably smoke both of these scrubs at DVR, I think the power of the series
3852040	3858280	is in moments like this, seemingly absurd but utterly relatable, speaking across generations.
3858280	3862080	Malcolm in the Middle was a major force in popularizing the single-camera style sitcom
3862080	3863440	on network television.
3863440	3867800	It helped end the age of laugh tracks, introduced more sophisticated uses of music, and let
3867800	3871980	characters travel to a number of exciting and not-so-exciting locations.
3871980	3875760	But through these stylistic accomplishments, at its core was the story of a family struggling
3875760	3879280	with one another and uniting together to take on the world.
3879280	3883800	The idea of life being an endless struggle is at the center of what makes this show feel
3883800	3884800	real.
3884800	3887640	It's relatable to anyone who feels that they live in a world where you can feel lost
3887640	3892640	in a crowd vanishing into faceless anonymity, like a middle child constantly overlooked
3892640	3893880	by their family.
3893880	3897680	But even though Malcolm was the middle child, if you don't count Francis, until Jamie
3897680	3900480	is born, his family never treat him that way.
3900480	3904480	Hal and Lois love all their boys, hard as that may be sometimes, and in spite of the
3904480	3907520	rough edges of their dynamic, they're there for one another.
3907520	3910240	In a recent interview, Jane Kaczmarek summed this up.
3910240	3914400	People say they're such a dysfunctional family, and I would think, are you kidding
3914400	3915400	me?
3915400	3917000	They sit down for dinner together every night.
3917000	3918920	Those kids don't get away with anything.
3918920	3920600	This is a highly functioning family.
3920600	3924560	They're mean, loud, and aggressive, but they're highly functioning.
3924560	3928880	When Malcolm runs off to one day be president, he does so with the knowledge of what it means
3928880	3929880	to suffer.
3929880	3933640	Instead of falling into a cynicism and despair, show leaves us with some degree of hope that
3933640	3935820	things might change and get better.
3935820	3938740	But Malcolm's very existence has always been absurd.
3938740	3943500	A child genius who was born in just the right circumstances to change the world around him.
3943500	3948380	The solution to the struggle Malcolm's family faces is to get extremely lucky, and that's
3948380	3952020	the hope for people like them in their world, that someone like Malcolm might be born in
3952020	3953500	the right family to make things better.
3953500	3955980	And then what are the odds of that happening?
3955980	3958380	It's an indictment of the world they live in.
3958380	3961540	And for anyone who's struggled to get ahead in the world, sometimes it feels like the
3961540	3964940	only solution is to become extremely lucky.
3964940	3970460	Something that, for most people, only exists in the world of fantasy.
3970460	3972780	So that is Malcolm in the Middle in the books.
3972780	3976140	To be honest, I had actually stopped watching Malcolm in the Middle when it was first airing
3976140	3981580	around season four or five-ish, so seeing those later seasons was a first for me.
3981580	3986080	And for anyone curious, Malcolm in the Middle is easily the most abandoned series I've had
3986080	3989300	for one of these retrospectives, and I hope people enjoyed this.
