00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
In June of 2018, Jordan Peterson launched a defamation lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier

00:04.720 --> 00:11.600
University for $1.5 million. This lawsuit came on the heels of a suit from former Wilfrid Laurier

00:11.600 --> 00:16.880
University student Lindsay Shepherd. In that suit she claims an encounter she had with her

00:16.880 --> 00:23.680
supervisor left her unemployable in academia and left some lasting emotional distress. After she

00:23.680 --> 00:28.320
was reprimanded for showing a Peterson-related video in one of the classes she was a teacher's

00:28.320 --> 00:33.600
assistant for. We don't need to guess about the timing of these two lawsuits here. Peterson

00:33.600 --> 00:39.280
actually describes his lawsuit like this. I decided that Wilfrid Laurier had learned very

00:39.280 --> 00:44.080
little from its public embarrassment and that Shepherd's claims were valid, justifiable,

00:44.080 --> 00:49.600
and necessary, including her statement that her future lack of employability in academia

00:49.600 --> 00:55.040
was improbable to say the least. I also decided to launch a claim of my own against the same

00:55.040 --> 00:59.840
defendants. I thought that two lawsuits might make the point better than one.

01:00.960 --> 01:05.920
So Peterson's suit is being filed not strictly because he's an offended party,

01:05.920 --> 01:10.960
but in support of the Shepherd suit. The message he's trying to deliver is quite clear that the

01:10.960 --> 01:16.720
faculty of Wilfrid Laurier University and presumably all university faculties across Canada

01:16.720 --> 01:21.920
better watch what they say about him in the future. Many commenters have noted the obvious

01:21.920 --> 01:28.080
hypocrisy here. Peterson's claim to fame involved sounding the alarm about a shadowy group of social

01:28.080 --> 01:34.560
Marxists trying to control his language with Canadian Bill C-16, which added trans people

01:34.560 --> 01:39.840
to the list of groups who were protected by hate speech laws. But now Peterson is the one trying

01:39.840 --> 01:44.720
to control the language of others, or more specifically, he's trying to control the ideas

01:44.720 --> 01:50.400
they're allowed to express behind closed doors. The hypocrisy is a fair point, but there's a deeper

01:50.480 --> 01:55.120
point here about how the legal system is being used as a tool by a wealthy individual to create

01:55.120 --> 02:00.640
a chilling effect, more commonly known as libel chill, although obviously in this case it's

02:00.640 --> 02:05.600
defamation not libel. First I want to just make sure we're looking at the Peterson suit and the

02:05.600 --> 02:09.360
Shepherd suit differently. While I don't agree with either, I think there's a clear difference

02:09.360 --> 02:14.320
between a student who believes her university's faculty mistreated her, wrong as she may be,

02:14.320 --> 02:18.960
and a professor from a different school not liking the way he's being spoken about by the same

02:18.960 --> 02:25.520
faculty in private. What we have here is a clear case of the law being used to silence criticism.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.760
It uses the legal system as a weapon and creates a chilling effect that will make

02:29.760 --> 02:35.680
any other person in a Canadian university faculty, perhaps more broadly even, think twice

02:35.680 --> 02:39.760
before they criticize Peterson in private in front of one of his followers.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.200
For a broader look at how libel chill works, I want to talk about an incident that happened

02:45.200 --> 02:51.040
in March of 2016 when pro wrestler Hulk Hogan won a lawsuit against the media outlet Gawker

02:51.040 --> 02:58.640
for a staggering $140 million in damages after the media outlet published a sex tape he was

02:58.640 --> 03:04.080
featured in. For the sake of your eyes, I won't put the footage from the sex tape on screen

03:04.080 --> 03:09.760
from what I've been told the Hulkster has sex the same way he wrestles. He has three moves and never

03:09.760 --> 03:15.840
goes longer than five minutes. The $140 million won by Hogan was later reduced to $31 million in

03:15.840 --> 03:21.680
a settlement in November of the same year, but the damage had been done and Gawker was no more.

03:21.680 --> 03:28.240
While Gawker has traipsed in controversy in the past with a series of questionable articles to

03:28.240 --> 03:33.920
say the least, it wasn't really the Hulk Hogan sex tape that brought them down. It was a different

03:33.920 --> 03:40.720
article that outed PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel as being secretly gay. While Hulk Hogan is an

03:40.720 --> 03:46.800
American hero for daring to headbutt the flag of the Soviet Union, he didn't bankroll his lawsuit

03:46.800 --> 03:51.840
against Gawker. It was Thiel who paid roughly $10 million for the suit, all part of a large

03:51.840 --> 03:56.880
operation he had been funding to find ways to take the media organization down. Publishing an

03:56.880 --> 04:03.040
article about someone being secretly gay while obviously a dick move isn't actually illegal.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.360
In fact, being a public figure like Thiel means it's much harder to sue someone for what they

04:07.360 --> 04:11.920
print, either online or in print. It's part of the framework of what protects the press,

04:11.920 --> 04:18.320
a vital aspect of free expression. What Thiel did was bypass Gawker's free expression and use the

04:18.320 --> 04:23.600
legal system to silence them forever. The effect not only ends his vendetta, it also sends a clear

04:23.600 --> 04:29.040
signal to other media outlets. If they find anything salacious about him, maybe this time

04:29.040 --> 04:33.680
nothing to do with his sexual life, but perhaps some kind of shady business dealings, Thiel may

04:33.680 --> 04:39.440
deploy his considerable means within the legal system to exact vengeance. This is obviously

04:39.440 --> 04:44.400
an extreme example, as we're talking about much higher dollar amounts at play here than in the

04:44.400 --> 04:48.960
Peterson case, but keep in mind Thiel is a much wealthier man than Peterson. The difference here

04:48.960 --> 04:55.760
is in scale more so than intent. And Peterson is making a statement that he is willing to put up

04:55.760 --> 05:00.800
his money to silence criticism of him done in private. What's perhaps more disturbing about the

05:00.800 --> 05:06.320
Peterson case is that he's suing a university and not a media outlet. This isn't an article that

05:06.320 --> 05:10.240
was published somewhere, it was a private conversation in which two of the participants

05:10.240 --> 05:15.040
had no reason to believe would be made public. How could they have possibly known that Shepard

05:15.040 --> 05:19.600
was secretly recording them? And would Shepard's account have been so widely disseminated had it

05:19.600 --> 05:24.400
not been for that recording? It'll be interesting to see how this lawsuit is resolved.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.880
Peterson has been badmouthing academia since the beginning of his rise to internet fame.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.600
Here are a few comments he made in a 2016 interview.

05:32.160 --> 05:38.720
It might be that the university is already dying. It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, I think huge swaths

05:38.720 --> 05:46.400
of the university are irrevocably corrupted. Sociology, gone. Anthropology, gone. History,

05:46.400 --> 05:52.000
big chunks of it are gone. The classics, literature, social work, political science

05:52.000 --> 05:57.360
in many places, and that doesn't cover women's studies, ethnic studies. They probably started

05:57.360 --> 06:03.040
lost, and it's gotten far worse. I believe now, with the exception of the science, technology,

06:03.040 --> 06:09.920
engineering, mathematics branch, that universities do more harm than good. I think they produced

06:09.920 --> 06:14.400
indentured servants in the United States because tuition fees have gone up so much and you can't

06:14.400 --> 06:19.360
declare bankruptcy on your student loans, or teaching university students lies and pandering

06:19.440 --> 06:25.200
to them. And I see that as counterproductive. That's a god-awful impression, sorry about that.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.000
We also can't forget Peterson's project to catalog the courses he considered

06:30.000 --> 06:36.880
indoctrination cult classes in 2017. He only pulled back on that initiative after he cited

06:36.880 --> 06:42.240
some negative responses from his twitter followers. But it demonstrates how poorly Peterson thinks of

06:42.240 --> 06:47.920
certain branches of academia, and how he sees himself, or rather his philosophy, if you can

06:47.920 --> 06:53.600
call it that, as the antidote. Peterson has also circulated a petition to try and take tax funding

06:53.600 --> 07:00.560
away from universities. As of recording, it's sitting at 1484 signatures, so I don't think

07:00.560 --> 07:06.080
that'll work. There's also his recent video for Dennis Prager's fake university, which wasn't

07:06.080 --> 07:11.680
too kind to the academics instructing young minds. They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the

07:11.680 --> 07:16.880
west with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their life's mission to undermine

07:16.880 --> 07:22.800
western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive, and patriarchal.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.000
He presents the world of academia as some kind of Soviet nightmare where kids have cultural

07:28.000 --> 07:34.080
Marxism drilled into their minds. Plenty of videos have drilled into this particular effluvia already,

07:34.080 --> 07:39.680
so check those out for more information. Jordan Peterson is the academic who undermines academia,

07:39.680 --> 07:44.480
much in the way Larry Elder is celebrated as a black man who undermines black activism,

07:44.480 --> 07:49.280
Blair White as a trans woman who undermines trans activism, and Christina Hoff Sommers as

07:49.280 --> 07:54.560
a woman who undermines modern feminism. None of these people are advancing anything particularly

07:54.560 --> 07:59.840
new or interesting, but rather standing up for the status quo while denying any of the criticisms

07:59.840 --> 08:04.640
of discrimination or bigotry faced by the groups they identify with. Many of the points they make

08:04.640 --> 08:09.520
are often heard from conservative commentators who don't belong to their identity groups.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.160
Now we have the totalitarian left in America, and if you don't see it their way,

08:14.160 --> 08:18.960
you're attacked and demonized. And if you're a student, you can be punished through the

08:18.960 --> 08:26.240
grading system. This cannot continue. Academic freedom is one thing. Harming students with insane

08:26.240 --> 08:32.240
ideology is quite something else. That there is such a thing as indoctrination at the university.

08:32.240 --> 08:38.880
You get in there and you're given courses, you're given seminars I should say, on how racist you

08:38.880 --> 08:46.400
are or on how to avoid sexual harassment. The universities were largely infiltrated by a lot

08:46.400 --> 08:51.360
of folks on the new left. The establishment at those universities decided not to challenge

08:51.360 --> 08:56.960
the student body when the student body kind of rose up in the 1960s, and a lot of the

08:56.960 --> 09:01.520
very bad ideas that had started earlier in the 1930s and 40s ended up taking over the universities

09:01.520 --> 09:06.560
in the 1960s. In other words, it's a noxious corruption of identity politics where someone's

09:06.560 --> 09:11.600
gender, race, or in Peterson's case career are used to give their claims more credibility,

09:11.600 --> 09:15.680
when in fact all their claims are simple conservative talking points that we've been

09:15.680 --> 09:20.400
hearing for years, but we're supposed to believe they're more credible because in this case the

09:20.400 --> 09:26.080
person's identity makes them look like an insider. This all illustrates a man who is at war with the

09:26.080 --> 09:32.000
very institution that he uses as currency for his credibility. He is the university professor who

09:32.000 --> 09:37.360
was valued for his consistent criticism of the university system and used conservative talking

09:37.360 --> 09:43.120
points that we've been hearing for years. This, I believe, is the key to his fame and why so many

09:43.120 --> 09:49.520
conservative thinkers, talkers, and speakers have all latched on to him. This lawsuit Peterson filed

09:49.520 --> 09:55.680
isn't about making money but instead about making a point, and it's a simple one. Faculty at

09:55.680 --> 10:00.560
Canadian universities are on notice. They better watch what they say about Jordan Peterson.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.520
As he gets wealthier, it makes me wonder what he's going to start using that money for

10:06.080 --> 10:08.400
and what other voices he might try to silence.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.160
Expression is never free when someone uses their wealth to make you pay a price.
