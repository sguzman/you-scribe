1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
What makes a classic TV show?

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,540
Some shows take the world by storm, becoming fan favorites remembered for generations.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,900
Others are slow starters, growing a following before reaching that tipping point of becoming

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,760
a fixture on TV screens around the world.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,180
And some never reached those heights, achieving cult status among a select group of influential

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,180
people.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,580
Arrested Development has a unique distinction of not only achieving that cult status, but

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,280
parlaying that into a divisive return, only to have that change how people remember a

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,600
series that was being called a future classic.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,080
The story of Arrested Development, a show about a family that fell apart, held together

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,720
by one man, will be put together by this one man, trying to understand how we decide what

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,280
makes a TV show a classic.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,880
In the early 2000s, reality television was on the ascent, and that got director and former

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,320
TV star Ron Howard thinking of new ways of doing television.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,460
Something that used this reality TV grammar to tell scripted comedies with more depth

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,180
and layers, while also cutting back on costs.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,060
A different kind of situation comedy that would be packed with more jokes, you know,

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,660
more funny situations, and a less traditional feel than what you get with a normal kind

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,180
of half hour sitcom.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,460
Through the production company he started with Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment, Howard

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,300
approached a number of producers with this concept, and it was Mitchell Hurwitz who connected

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,080
most with the idea.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,620
But I wanted to use that savings in expense and time to shoot a lot of scenes and to try

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:41,320
to get at family enmeshment and to try to get at character that went beyond stock character.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,220
Hurwitz was particularly attracted to the idea of creating characters with greater depth

26
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,240
than in your typical sitcom.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,260
Hurwitz had been a veteran of many sitcoms including The Golden Girls, The Golden Palace,

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,000
The John Larraket Show, The Ellen Show, and several other programs that didn't start

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,420
with V. One small project of note was a 1999 series called Everything's Relative which

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,940
aired on NBC.

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Notable not just for starring Jeffrey Tambor, who would be part of the cast of Arrested

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,100
Development, but also for acting as a half step between the sitcoms of the past that

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,220
Hurwitz had started his career working in and what sitcoms of the future would eventually

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
look like.

35
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,980
It's a strange combination of the single camera style with an awkward laugh track thrown

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,060
in and the plot of a comedy writer forced to make his dysfunctional family work would

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:35,260
very much echo what would eventually become Arrested Development.

38
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,420
Although six episodes were produced, it only ran for four before it was cancelled.

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,460
But it was this project that would help inform the pitch Hurwitz took to Imagine Entertainment.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,060
Hurwitz's original idea for Arrested Development was a dysfunctional family going from riches

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,020
to rags, though many of the particulars went through a number of changes before it all

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:07,060
came together.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,820
Other aspects of the show came from Hurwitz's own life.

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,340
Having grown up in California, the famous Bluth banana stand was based on a chocolate

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,060
chip business he started at twelve called The Chipyard, and the street that stand began

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,580
on, Balboa Boulevard, would be the name of the apartment complex that Lucille Booth would

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,700
call home.

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,900
The character of Maybee was even named after Hurwitz's two daughters, May and Phoebe.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,000
Outside of his own life, Hurwitz was also inspired by the Enron scandal that saw a massive energy

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,460
company crumble when it committed an elaborate accounting fraud scheme.

51
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,060
The Blue Family at the center of the series would similarly be watching their own business

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,980
crumble all around them.

53
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,460
Arrested Development was always supposed to be different.

54
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,900
Instead of a finely polished product, rehearsed throughout the week, and then recorded on

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,460
a soundstage, it would be filmed on location with little rehearsal.

56
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,420
Scenes were written and rewritten on the fly, and the look of the show mimicked a documentary,

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,900
one shot with two cameras, often moving through scenes scrambling to get reactions.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,660
Jason Bateman was cast as Michael Bluth, the one son holding the Bluth family together.

59
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,260
Bateman's first on-screen acting job was at the age of twelve on Little House on the

60
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
Prairie.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,140
He wanted to appear in Silver Spoons and It's Your Move.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,900
Throughout the 90s, he had a series of failed TV pilots, creating some reluctance to cast

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
him as Michael.

64
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,860
But when he auditioned, they found he was the perfect fit for the relatively level-headed

65
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,360
member of the Bluth family, the man who wants nothing more than to leave that family, only

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,940
to be constantly dragged back into their drama.

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,620
They are going to keep Dad in prison, at least until this gets all sorted out.

68
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,900
Also, the attorney said that they're going to have to put a halt in the company's expense

69
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
account.

70
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,060
Interesting, I would have expected that after they're keeping Dad in jail.

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,660
Portia de Rossi was cast as Lindsay Bluth, Michael's twin sister.

72
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,780
De Rossi had made her debut in the 1994 movie, Sirens, and before Arrested Development, she

73
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,740
was a regular on Ally McBeal.

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,180
As Lindsay, she was the socialite who spent more time creating the illusion of being a

75
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,900
philanthropist than actually doing anything aside from shopping.

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm kind of the charitable one of the family.

77
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,300
I think it's best if you got a job.

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,660
Oh come on, I'm a parent, I care about my daughter every bit as much as Michael cares

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
about his son.

80
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,340
What grade am I in?

81
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
What kind of job?

82
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,620
Will Arnett played the eldest of the Bluth siblings, George Oscar Bluth Jr. or Job.

83
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,900
Job was one of the tougher roles to be cast, with none of the actors auditioning, managing

84
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,020
to find a suitable voice for the character.

85
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,460
Arnett, who only had a few credits to his name, most notably two episodes on The Sopranos,

86
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,260
managed to breathe life into the impossibly arrogant and intensely vulnerable Job.

87
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
And Job is quite the magician.

88
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
This is the magic trick, huh?

89
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
Illusion, Michael.

90
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,860
Mmm, trick is something a whore does for money.

91
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,140
Michael Cera was cast as Michael's son, George Michael.

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,860
Only 15 by the time Arrested Development premiered, he had already appeared in several movies

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,340
and TV shows.

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,140
George Michael is the timid, well-meaning teen who is struggling to grow up with a

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,420
father who doesn't quite get him.

96
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,460
George Michael is also nursing a confusing attraction to his cousin.

97
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,940
I'm tempted to kiss again so we can teach him a lesson.

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Why would that teach them a lesson?

99
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,140
No, I mean, to freak them out.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,980
Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense.

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Well, isn't that what makes it funny?

102
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
I'm laughing.

103
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,140
Let's go fish, you know.

104
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,580
Alia Shawkat was cast as maybe Funke, Lindsay's daughter.

105
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,260
Even though she was only 14 when the show debuted, she'd already come off a nearly

106
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,520
40-episode run on the series State of Grace.

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,440
She is bolder than her cousin, seeming to lack much empathy as her antics fail to catch

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:48,880
the attention of her absent-minded parents.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,280
Tony Hill was cast as the youngest Bluth sibling, Byron Bluth, better known as Buster.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,040
Relatively unknown at the time, Hill had guest spots on a few programs, but Arrested Development

111
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
would be his first major role.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,400
Buster is an extremely awkward mother boy who spends much of the series in a state

113
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,680
of perpetual confusion.

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:27,560
David Cross played Tobias Funke, Lindsay's husband and maybe his father, although creator

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,800
Mitch Hurwitz claims to have offered the well-traveled stand-up Cross any role he wanted,

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Cross said it was the roles of Job and Buster that were suggested to him.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Regardless, it was Tobias that spoke to Cross as a character.

118
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,440
After a beef struggle with the network to make sure Tobias would have what would be

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,840
his signature mustache, Cross slipped into the role of a former therapist turned actor

120
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:56,560
who had a very unusual way of choosing his words.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
Jeffrey Tambor was originally asked to only play the role of family patriarch George

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
Oscar Bluth Sr. for a single episode, but the role was such a good fit for Tambor that

123
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,960
he jumped at the chance to become part of the principal cast.

124
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,720
A veteran and beloved from his time as Hank Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show, Tambor

125
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,520
created a George Sr. that was both domineering and slimy, all from the comfort of his prison

126
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:28,600
cell.

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Jessica Walter made up the final member of the principal cast as Lucille Bluth, the sharp-tongued

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,040
matriarch of the Bluth family.

129
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Having been acting for over 40 years, Walter was the most experienced of the cast, notably

130
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,440
appearing in Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, Play Misty for Me.

131
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,320
Lucille Bluth is a woman so wealthy and out of touch with the common man that she has

132
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:59,600
trouble acclimating to her family's new financial reality.

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,640
Although technically not a member of the cast, Arrested Development did have a regular narrator

134
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,840
voiced by Ron Howard.

135
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,160
Originally Howard was only a placeholder, but his performance as a detached narrator

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,320
was so effective and was very charming to the network, he became a permanent fixture

137
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
for the series.

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,840
I actually borrowed from National Geographic.

139
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:28,440
I thought it should be approached with a kind of a sociological or anthropological mindset.

140
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:37,200
I think this is the same narrator who would be doing something about the indigenous inhabitants

141
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,000
of the Amazon basin, and then their next job would be to come and talk about the Bluth

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,520
family.

143
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Arrested Development had a very rich world of recurring characters, and it would be nearly

144
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,600
impossible to list all of them here.

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,720
But the ones who appeared most frequently were the family's lawyer Barry Zuckercorn,

146
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,240
played by Henry Winkler, news anchor John Beard, a local Los Angeles news anchor who

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,680
was portraying a fictionalized version of himself, Liza Minnelli as Lucille Bluth's

148
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,240
rival, Lucille Austero, also known as Lucille II, Mae Whitman, played George Michael's

149
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,960
season 2 love interest Ann Veal, and Justin Grant Wade, appeared as high school jock,

150
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Steve Holt.

151
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:37,920
There was also this mysterious janitor, played by Martin Moll.

152
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,640
He always gets me to Gene Parmesan, how could I forget him?

153
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
Debuting on November 2nd, 2003, in an episode titled, Pilot, we meet the Bluth family just

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:00,760
as it seems as though it's ready to fall apart.

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,160
The cast is introduced through some narration and a few key interactions, and we find out

156
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,720
that this episode is about Michael being snubbed for a partnership at his family's business

157
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:19,200
shortly before George Sr. is arrested.

158
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,300
The family looks to Michael to run the business.

159
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:44,560
Even though he wants to leave for the sake of his son, he stays behind.

160
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,060
Of course George Michael might also be motivated by the new crush he has on his cousin, Mae

161
00:11:49,060 --> 00:12:00,100
B.

162
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,740
This along with many character dynamics would be explored throughout the season.

163
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,680
Unlike other sitcoms that tended to keep a fixed premise and placed it in novel situations

164
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,540
in each episode, Arrested Development would introduce dynamics that would run and change

165
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,080
as we followed the adventures of the Bluths.

166
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,500
Perhaps this would mean dynamics that ran through the entire series, sometimes only

167
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,360
for a season or even just a few episodes.

168
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,040
George Michael's crush on his cousin went the distance, sometimes becoming the focus

169
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,040
of his character and other times just humming along in the background, but it was always

170
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,880
safe to assume that, no matter where you are in the series, George Michael is harboring

171
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:47,120
some feelings for Mae B.

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,300
The pilot was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and you may be more familiar with their

173
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,680
work on the highest grossing movie of all time.

174
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,600
They were a major part of establishing the look of Arrested Development, using a cinema

175
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,260
verite style to create the impression of a documentary crew in the thick of it.

176
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,860
If the series looks like it was Mae cheaply, that was by design, as multi-camera sitcoms

177
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,140
at the time were becoming increasingly expensive to produce.

178
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,060
The quick cuts and rushed production meant that footage sometimes lacked the polish to

179
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,900
tell a coherent story, which is part of the reason a narrator was used to fill in the

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
gaps.

181
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:37,460
This was a necessity, with shows often having

182
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,780
thirty minutes of footage needing to be cut down to twenty-two minutes for broadcast.

183
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,580
It was often suggested that this might be attributed to the actor's improving, and

184
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,500
while this was the original intention of the series, the writing was so strong that

185
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,140
very little of that happened as the series progressed.

186
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,820
Alternate takes often came from writers coming up with new jokes on the spot.

187
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,540
New jokes and missing plot points were also recorded after the fact.

188
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:14,540
Later inserted into scenes, while a speaking character's back is turned to the camera.

189
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,340
In addition to the structure and style of the series, the pilot also establishes some

190
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,020
important ways it would differentiate itself from other sitcoms.

191
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,980
Families that don't get along weren't an entirely novel concept at this point, even

192
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,500
if the opposite were still more common.

193
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,740
But arrested development added some subjects to the idea by placing Michael and his son

194
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,940
in a literal fake home, a model home created by the Bluth Company to sell their new development

195
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,900
project, Sudden Valley.

196
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,900
One of the big charms of the series was its ability to take seemingly meaningless jokes,

197
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,620
references, and build on them several episodes or several seasons later.

198
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,100
Sometimes it was just a running gag, but sometimes it also meant expanding on a moment to create

199
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,540
an entire plotline.

200
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,820
An example from the pilot is Michael interviewing for a new job at Sitwell Housing.

201
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,380
What was originally just a placeholder company was later revealed to be a major rival to

202
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,620
the Bluth Company, led by Stan Sitwell, played by Ed Begley Jr.

203
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:16,340
Themetically, the show also had some interesting

204
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,100
things to say about how the upper class are often just as silly as the rest of us and

205
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,340
got to where they were by being willing to step over others and each other.

206
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,380
And there's the very interesting fusion between family and business throughout the

207
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,700
series, connecting love and commerce with disastrous consequences.

208
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,540
When George Sr. tells Michael that he didn't promote him to protect him, we find out it

209
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,780
wasn't purely out of concern for his son.

210
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,100
And as we'll see throughout the series, the Bluths are never beneath screwing one

211
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,740
another over for financial gain, or in some cases, to protect the company.

212
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,300
The pilot episode for Arrested Development did so much heavy lifting I can't possibly

213
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,460
cover it all here, and the rest of the series is similarly dense.

214
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,340
As we'll see as we move forward, this was often weighed more to its complexity rather

215
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,820
than its depth, and it was the show's complexity that played a role in it becoming a revered

216
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,300
classic that struggled to find a wider audience.

217
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,140
One of the central dynamics of the series, especially in its first season, is the struggle

218
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,080
between the Bluth siblings and their parents.

219
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,140
One of the ways it manifests itself is in the rivalry between Job and Michael.

220
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,380
Job and Michael butt heads in the early episode over Job's girlfriend, Marta, played by

221
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,860
Leonor Varela, and then later by Patricia Velasquez when scheduling conflicts arose

222
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,020
for the first actress.

223
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,220
Job's attitude towards his girlfriend is less than attractive.

224
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:10,260
On the other hand, Michael is completely smitten with Marta, and he's conflicted

225
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:25,340
over the fact that he wants to date his brother's girlfriend.

226
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,860
As Marta develops feelings for Michael, she's overheard expressing them to her mother by

227
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,660
Job.

228
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:45,340
Spanish speakers are probably head of the joke on this one.

229
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,540
Job and Michael come to blows in the following episode.

230
00:17:48,540 --> 00:18:02,020
Finally Marta becomes a real character, realizing the Bluths are awful.

231
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,820
This rejection brings the two together, until we see them at each other's throats over

232
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:20,140
who gets to run the company.

233
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,420
Throughout this stretch of episodes in the first half of season one, there's very little

234
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,580
that Marta does except play the dutiful and eventually conflicted girlfriend.

235
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,180
It's hard to understand what she ever saw in Job, and that a few gestures from Michael

236
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,180
sweep her off her feet make her seem as though this is a woman, who is a successful actress

237
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,620
by the way, who has had some underwhelming experiences with romance.

238
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,260
What it also reveals is that she's more of a prop being passed around so we can learn

239
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,980
more about the relationship between Michael and Job.

240
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,340
That this eventually gets replaced by who gets to be in charge of the company reveals

241
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,940
that their rivalry is a product of their own bitter feelings towards one another, and also

242
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,860
how inconsequential Marta was as a character.

243
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,380
The joke about confusing the word hermano for a name also reveals just how horribly

244
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,260
self-absorbed these characters are.

245
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,700
It's a word that should come very easily to anyone with a Spanish-speaking girlfriend.

246
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,860
But Job is completely oblivious, and Michael, for as charmed as he supposedly is by Marta,

247
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:26,940
can't be bothered to learn the language he speaks, although he does sort of try.

248
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Michael and Job's rivalry isn't the only dynamic we see in these early episodes though.

249
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,180
We also get a glimpse of the grotesque as we learn about the relationship between Buster

250
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:44,740
and Lucille.

251
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,700
Third dynamic is created by Lucille's need to be needed, and Buster is the one paying

252
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
the price for that need.

253
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,360
Buster breaks away from his mother by becoming romantically involved with Lucille's best

254
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:06,760
friend and rival, Lucille Ostero.

255
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,600
While this gesture from Buster wasn't entirely intentional, he was supposed to be bidding

256
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,200
on his mother, Buster and Lucille too do develop their own strange dynamic.

257
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:43,640
Lucille fights back by replacing Buster with a boy adopted from Korea, An-Yong.

258
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,320
An-Yong is the Korean word for hello.

259
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,160
The parallel here between An-Yong and Marta is pretty clear – they're both pawns in

260
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,480
the game the Blue Family is playing.

261
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Mark that way by not only being outside the family, but outside the broader cultural context

262
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
the Blues find themselves in.

263
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
In contrast, Lucille too is a far more developed character, because she lives in that white

264
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,640
upper-class world – the world the series is giving us a glimpse into.

265
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,760
It reveals the general disinterest these people have for those who are outside their bubble.

266
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,920
Even though An-Yong hangs around until the end of the series, the number of appearances

267
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,800
he makes dwindles as time goes on, and his role in the finale is more of a bit part for

268
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,360
a character who is ostensibly part of the Bluth family.

269
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,680
In that way, along with basically reusing the same joke about the Bluths not understanding

270
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,360
a word spoken in another language, the show reveals itself to be part of that same world

271
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,880
as the Bluths, concerned with the Bluth family but not so much with the people they step

272
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
on.

273
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,680
They're just there to prove a point.

274
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,760
The Bluth siblings are very much aware of how their parents have messed up their lives.

275
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,240
They even bond with Buster when he dares to criticize their mother.

276
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm mom and I want to shoot down everything you say so I feel good about myself.

277
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Look who's ragging on the old lady.

278
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Hey!

279
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Finally!

280
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm an uptight ******!

281
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Buster!

282
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
******!

283
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
You old horny slut!

284
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:18,000
Well no one's gonna top that.

285
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,240
Lucille Bluth is not likely to win Mother of the Year.

286
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,680
In the first season, she even attempts to pin a car accident that was absolutely her

287
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
fault on Michael.

288
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,840
The original premise of the series was a family alienated from one another by its wealth,

289
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
learning how to get along.

290
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,460
While the first half of that statement is present, the second half never quite comes

291
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
to fruition.

292
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,260
They're more a family stuck together sharing their misery, and Lucille is the perfect

293
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
representative of that.

294
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,180
Lucille is completely out of touch with the world outside of her wealthy socialite bubble.

295
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
I mean it's one banana, Michael.

296
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
What could it cost?

297
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
Ten dollars?

298
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,700
While lines like that reveal Lucille's detachment from the wider world, her relationship with

299
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,940
her children is similarly detached, held together not through love, but through manipulation.

300
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,940
I just want my children to love me.

301
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Stop lying.

302
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
Stop manipulating.

303
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Just be nicer.

304
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,940
What?

305
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I'm a horrible mother.

306
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
No, no, my, you crazy mother.

307
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
That's crazy, Todd.

308
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
You're a fantastic mother.

309
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
You're the mother.

310
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,940
George Sr. isn't a whole lot better.

311
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:32,380
While he may be in jail for most of the first season, his brief trips out of prison reveal

312
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,340
someone less interested in the welfare of his family and more about keeping himself

313
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,060
from being locked up for good.

314
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,980
George Sr. is a patriarch in many senses of the word.

315
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,340
Head of the family, head of the company, and he literally portrays God in one episode.

316
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,740
Although when he uses that opportunity to make his escape, the episode very cutely reveals

317
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:58,380
that this is a world where you can't trust in even a heavenly father.

318
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,860
George Sr. and Lucille are, quite clearly, awful parents, and the show is very clear

319
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,060
to present them as two people not to be trusted.

320
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,940
And more than just bad parents, they represent authority and status more broadly, being wealthy

321
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,820
and running the Bluth Company.

322
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,740
George Sr. as a boss is tough to get a grasp on since he's arrested in the first episode

323
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,460
of the series, but the culture created at the Bluth Company is one set up for a domineering

324
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,260
boss to control his employees the way a domineering father controls his children.

325
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,500
For example, using former employee J. Walter Weatherman, played by Steve Ryan, to teach

326
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:46,820
his kids lessons.

327
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,260
When the younger Bluths step into positions of authority, rather than commiserating with

328
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,780
the workers knowing what it's like for George Sr. and Lucille to treat them like children,

329
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,180
they instead adopt the role of their parents.

330
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:07,420
When Michael takes charge of the company, he leads his employees around like sheep.

331
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:17,700
The Bluths also have family discussions in front of them, as if they aren't even there.

332
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,100
Job even organizes the workers not to improve their conditions, but instead to undermine

333
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:35,220
Michael as the one in charge.

334
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,180
And going back to Michael, even though he's presented as the responsible one, he expects

335
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,300
his workers to work without getting paid, something that reveals a deep level of disrespect

336
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,580
even from the normal Bluth.

337
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,540
In spite of whatever hardships the Bluths place on one another, they still adhere to

338
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,020
their social standing, even when those hardships should be teaching them another lesson entirely.

339
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,780
What they learn is to not stand in solidarity with the oppressed, but to claim their birthright

340
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,220
as oppressors.

341
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:14,540
Early in the season, Michael discovers a truth about his father.

342
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,060
Michael knew his father was guilty of something, but he had no idea it was this bad.

343
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,460
And that's another recurring theme of this series, people who seem bad being revealed

344
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,100
as even worse.

345
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,940
One late addition in season 1 was George Senior's identical twin brother, Oscar George Bluth.

346
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,900
The introduction of Oscar came about because creator Mitch Hurwitz happened to see Jeffrey

347
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,880
Tambor in a wig, and he thought it looked interesting.

348
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,100
So Oscar was written into the show, giving Tambor two recurring characters to play, which

349
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,700
is a pretty big step up from initially being cast to a single episode guest role.

350
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,020
The reason the Bluth company looms so heavily over the family, defining their relationships,

351
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,980
and shaping their goals, is in part because aside from Michael, none of them have a sense

352
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:05,820
for business.

353
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,660
This is a family that has largely lived off the largesse of the unethical George Senior,

354
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,620
never having to consider what living in the real world means.

355
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,500
Throughout season 1, we see how this dynamic has created a family unable to do more than

356
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,260
occasionally band together against an outside threat.

357
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,300
The rest of the time, they spend bickering and plotting against each other to take control

358
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,060
of the company, out of fear that this loss of power will mean they will have to know

359
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:36,900
what it feels like to not be rich.

360
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Family isn't there for love or comfort, so much as they're there to help make you

361
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
money.

362
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,420
It's very clearly in this episode where it's revealed that George Senior monetized

363
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,380
the rivalry between Job and Michael in a series of tapes called Boy Fights.

364
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,140
And more than the alienation caused by their wealth, we see how the Bluth company is so

365
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,620
concerned with making money that they're willing to deal with a dictator like Saddam

366
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
Hussein.

367
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:22,060
Wealth and the pursuit of it has shattered every part of the lives of the Bluth family.

368
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,060
They don't trust one another, they live in deluded fantasies about themselves, and

369
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,100
have created a company whose workers have been conditioned to behave like children.

370
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,200
In short, the Bluths represent everything bad about a society fueled by greed, living

371
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,380
in a twisted version of the American greed that creates parodies of families as a means

372
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,660
to financial gain.

373
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,340
It's almost mocking any workplace where a boss will come in and tell everyone, we're

374
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
like a family.

375
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,220
Except it's a family where a father controls all the children and takes most of the money

376
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,580
for himself.

377
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,620
In the season finale, Michael once again wants to leave his family, only for circumstances

378
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,560
to convince him to stay.

379
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:18,540
With his trial still some time away, George Sr. seemingly has a heart attack and is hospitalized.

380
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,100
And that's when the family realized that George Sr. wasn't dead, but was fleeing

381
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,020
the country that he loved so very much.

382
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,220
This is a nice setup for the next season, which is as good a segue as any to talk about

383
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:41,100
another unique trait of the series, the previews for the next episode.

384
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,540
What was especially fun about these is they almost never appeared in the next episode,

385
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,380
rather they were fun jokes for an episode to end on, playing on whatever happened in

386
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
the episode itself.

387
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,140
These were originally added because Mitch Hurwitz wanted to get test audiences to say

388
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,180
they wanted to see what would happen on the next episode.

389
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,100
These previews also reveal a loose relationship with continuity, something the series would

390
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,140
be less comfortable with as time went on.

391
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,900
The first season of Arrested Development was about establishing its style and tone, demanded

392
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,260
much of viewers to follow plotlines and jokes through many twists and turns, all to arrive

393
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,080
at the core of a series that had a basic message of how wealth can poison a family.

394
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,020
It was a very new way of presenting an old message, and it was that pairing of a new

395
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,300
style and familiar message that won the attention of critics.

396
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,660
Here's an example of a review of the first episode from a writer at the New York Times

397
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,780
shortly before the show premiered.

398
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,020
The Bluth heirs are eccentric and warped, but they are not hothouse child prodigies

399
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,980
like the Tenenbaum siblings.

400
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,500
They are nouveau riche misfits, the ewings of Dallas as seen by Bunuel, and they are

401
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
quite amusing.

402
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,300
As the year went on, critics became increasingly enamored with the show.

403
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,740
At the TV Land Awards, it won the Future Classic Award.

404
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,940
It wasn't the best predictor for classic television.

405
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,160
For every year in which it would go to a massive hit like The Office, there would be other

406
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,740
years where it would go to flash in the pans like Heroes.

407
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,960
That said, the award meant enough to Arrested Development that the acceptance speech may

408
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
be nominated on to the first season DVD release of the show.

409
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,920
This sentiment would be carried by critics all the way into the Emmys, where Arrested

410
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,440
Development was nominated for four awards and won three.

411
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,400
Mitch Hurwitz won for writing in a comedy series, The Russo Brothers won for directing

412
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,680
in a comedy series, and the show itself won Best Comedy Series, beating out the likes

413
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,480
of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Everybody Loves Raymond, Sex in the City, and Will and Grace.

414
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,520
Special attention should be given to how Hurwitz ended his acceptance speech for Best Comedy

415
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,880
Series.

416
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,800
Saying let's watch it was a reminder that, in this absolute love-bomb of critical praise

417
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,440
from the TV critics, very few people were actually watching the show, a sentiment that

418
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,920
can be seen during interviews at the time.

419
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,480
My dream has always been to work on a show, regardless of what that show is, that holds

420
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:13,920
Malcolm's numbers, and if it doesn't happen, you move on, you move on.

421
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,640
So just how bad were the ratings?

422
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,560
While the first episode debuted to just under 8 million viewers, by the end of the first

423
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,400
season it was down to less than 6.

424
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,880
Its average for the year was 6.2 million viewers.

425
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,400
Its lead-in, Malcolm in the Middle, while not a ratings juggernaut, was still doing significantly

426
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,040
better beginning the season with 10 million viewers, ending with 8 million viewers, and

427
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,640
having an average of 8.35 million viewers.

428
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,880
There was a small uptake in the ratings on March 17th when the show was given the coveted

429
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,200
spot following American Idol, giving the show its highest rating ever with 9.6 million viewers.

430
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,840
But even though this one episode was moved to the middle of the week for a one-off attempt

431
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,640
to garner a new audience, it ended up losing nearly 60% of the people who were watching

432
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,800
American Idol.

433
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,040
And looking at ratings for the following weeks, it seems none of that 3 million audience

434
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,040
surplus seemed to follow Arrested Development back to its Sunday night time slot.

435
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Aside from cops, Arrested Development was the lowest-rated show on Fox not to get cancelled.

436
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,680
In overall viewing numbers, it was ranked 105th.

437
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,180
Things weren't looking good ratings-wise.

438
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,840
In an article from Entertainment Weekly, some concerns were expressed by the network.

439
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,080
Fox Entertainment president Gail Berman admits Arrested Development's numbers are

440
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
troubling.

441
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,800
Still, she insists the network is an abandoning hope.

442
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Yet.

443
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,880
Look, I love this show, she says.

444
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,160
We're trying to figure out every possible way we can help it.

445
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,360
Hurwitz in interviews years later expressed that he believed the network was considering

446
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,640
cancelling the show but only relented after all of the critical acclaim, particularly

447
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,280
because of the awards it was winning.

448
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,760
Therefore they felt like they had to keep it on the air.

449
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,880
By winning the Emmy for Best Comedy series, along with two others, it was hoped that these

450
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,240
successes would turn things around for the series, giving it a bigger profile, attracting

451
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,920
a wider audience, and telling a huge comeback story.

452
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,200
They didn't, but it would have been.

453
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,880
Season 2 opens with Michael heading back to the family because he isn't sure they really

454
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,280
got how serious he was about leaving.

455
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,840
I think we're still there.

456
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
We're going back.

457
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,560
Michael is once again trapped with his family, only now he's implicated in George Sr's

458
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,400
dealings with Saddam Hussein.

459
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,120
And evidence he needs to clear himself is stolen by George Sr, effectively throwing

460
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,560
his own son under the bus to save himself.

461
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,920
He's not a great dad.

462
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,780
George Sr's ties to Saddam Hussein, revealing the interest of private business in earning

463
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,320
a profit over national security, is just one of many political observations made throughout

464
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
the series.

465
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,680
In the same episode, we see Buster enlist into the army by Lucille when she's confronted

466
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,200
by a legally distinct version of Michael Moore.

467
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Although Lucille would later regret it, it does

468
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
underscore the desperation of the US military if they're willing to accept a guy like

469
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,840
Buster into their ranks.

470
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,680
As the next two seasons progress, the political commentary gets increasingly obvious.

471
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,520
The Patriot Act, a controversial piece of post-9-11 legislation that gave the US government

472
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,960
greater surveillance power, is mocked when it's used to obtain a photo of bunkers with

473
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,000
weapons of mass destruction, not realizing that this photo is actually of Tobias' balls.

474
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,120
George Sr is found in a hole similar to the one Saddam Hussein was hiding in, and at one

475
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,440
point he records a video that very much presents him looking like Osama bin Laden.

476
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,680
The beliefs even find themselves in a rock, meeting Saddam Hussein impersonators living

477
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,800
in the Iraqi version of the model home, complete with what appears to be a weapon of mass destruction.

478
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,400
I haven't even mentioned references to the cut and run talking point, the George W. Bush

479
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,560
mission accomplished photo op, the Rumsfeld photo parody, and so many more.

480
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Arrested development was diving into political comedy in a way no other sitcom at the time

481
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
was.

482
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,120
Towards the end of the third season, we also learn that George Sr has secretly been working

483
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,360
with the US government this whole time.

484
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah, we got some guy named George Bluth to build houses down there so we could wire them.

485
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,120
The Bluths are portrayed as entrenched in the government establishment, and are also

486
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,040
working with Saddam Hussein.

487
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,640
Although Hussein's reign wasn't welcomed by the United States when it began, his war

488
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,480
with Iran did make him a temporary ally, an uneasy partnership that went south when Iraq

489
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
went on to invade Kuwait.

490
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,480
The Bluths represent the capriciousness of these relationships, dependent on economic

491
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,160
ties as oil can be traced to the root of many of these real-world conflicts.

492
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,600
Although Arrested Development was more concerned with showing how incredibly silly all of

493
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,520
this was, it also revealed a cynicism towards American foreign policy that was rarely seen

494
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
in the immediate post-9-11 era.

495
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,720
It's a sharp rebuke of the unthinking patriotism that you often saw on TV shows, instead opting

496
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,000
to portray how the American government and big businesses are happy to collude with supposed

497
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,160
enemies if it meant keeping the price of oil down.

498
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,600
Another big part of this series is the increasingly sour relationship between Tobias and Lindsay.

499
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,880
As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

500
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Really?

501
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
When did that start?

502
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but...

503
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,160
We get a hint of why their marriage is failing in the first episode of this series.

504
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
You're gay.

505
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
No, no.

506
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
No, I'm not.

507
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm not gay.

508
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,880
No, Lindsay, how many times must we have this?

509
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
No.

510
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,440
Assumptions about Tobias' sexuality come up again many times throughout the series'

511
00:37:41,440 --> 00:38:08,960
run, usually because of his unusual choice of words.

512
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,020
The irony here being that Tobias, as a trained analyst and therapist, isn't able to infer

513
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:21,680
some deeper meaning behind the unusual way he speaks.

514
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,620
Tobias actively rejecting expectations of his gender leads people to suspect he may

515
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,960
be gay, or the fact that he's a never-nude, which means he can never go anywhere without

516
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,320
wearing a pair of cutoffs, and that he often uses female pronouns when drawing analogies

517
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,400
to himself may even suggest that he's trans.

518
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,520
In her essay on the character, Darcy Dahl, an assistant professor of philosophy at Delta

519
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,840
College, describes how the real lesson here is to not treat Tobias' sexuality or gender

520
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,280
identity as some kind of guessing game, but instead reflect on what that says about the

521
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
expectations we place on people.

522
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
She writes,

523
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,760
What a person like Tobias shows us is that we needn't conserve ourselves with fitting

524
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,520
into a specific mold.

525
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,720
We need not worry about whether we're too feminine or masculine, nor about whether our

526
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,880
sexuality or personality conforms to normal standards.

527
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,760
Perhaps we should all try to find the Tobias inside of us.

528
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,960
While there are plenty of things in Tobias we can find fault with, such as his neglect

529
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,320
of his daughter, his inability to leave a doomed marriage, or his ridiculous attempts

530
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,620
to try and become an actor, when it comes to his sexuality or gender, he doesn't seem

531
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,280
to be distressed by it.

532
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,880
So how is it anyone else's business?

533
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,960
Even if he does have some kind of deep internal conflicts, instead of telling him what those

534
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,000
are, what he needs is a loving, caring space to explore those feelings himself and find

535
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,560
his own way through them, which again, is something he may not even need.

536
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,880
It's also something he'll never find in the Blue Family.

537
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,480
Lindsay struggles to find a life outside of her marriage with Tobias being asked to leave

538
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
the model home.

539
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Like what you see?

540
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,640
I've been looking for those, you're gonna stretch them out.

541
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
That's all you can say?

542
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, excuse me for liking the way they shaped my junk.

543
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
I don't know why, but that's it.

544
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
You can pack your junk and get out.

545
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,480
And Tobias has to worm his way back in by posing as a British danny named Mrs. Featherbottom.

546
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Who'd like a banger in the mouth?

547
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Oh, right, I forgot.

548
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,560
Here in the States you call it a sausage in the mouth.

549
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,880
We just call it a sausage.

550
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,980
Although Lindsay assumes Tobias is doing this because he misses maybe, the truth is, either

551
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,860
she nor Tobias are very concerned with the happenings of their daughter.

552
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,940
The Funke family is crumbling because of Tobias' nursing this ridiculous dream about

553
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,300
becoming a doctor, and Lindsay is trying to maintain her life as a philanthropist while

554
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,620
dating outside her marriage, and they're each living off the fumes of the family fortune,

555
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,740
doing nothing to adapt to their new circumstances.

556
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,500
They're so clueless that they're not even sure their marriage is over or not.

557
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,580
Maybe the fact that we don't know if we're together or not is a sign that we should split

558
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
again.

559
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,820
Or stay split up.

560
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,580
Okay, forget about Vegas.

561
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,900
We'll stay here and get back together.

562
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,380
This reveals the level of rot that sets in the minds of people living off of fabulous

563
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,980
wealth, particularly when they had nothing to do with its creation.

564
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,120
Tobias and Lindsay have spent much of their adult lives living off their whims, especially

565
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,620
Lindsay's whim to become married to Tobias.

566
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,200
It's a reflection of a life lived without consequences for those whims, and maybe is

567
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,900
left out in the cold, born into a family that barely pays attention to her.

568
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,060
Luckily for her, she manages to connive her way into becoming a teenage movie executive.

569
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:35,220
These two seasons also saw a number of changes for Buster.

570
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,860
After joining the army, he lost his hand to a dangerous seal attack.

571
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:48,860
And then a seal bites off his hand.

572
00:41:48,860 --> 00:42:03,100
We also learn that Buster's father may not be George Sr.

573
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:20,460
A

574
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,620
key part of Buster's story is this bizarre moment where Lucille is confronted.

575
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:35,340
Oh, this guy always gets me.

576
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,060
Although George Michael's crush on his cousin was firmly established in season one, over

577
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,340
time we see him develop a new interest in Anne Veal.

578
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Michael isn't a fan.

579
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,540
Although much of the series establishes he finds her bland and uninteresting, there is

580
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:59,100
another side to his lack of an appreciation.

581
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,700
There's something particularly gross about a grown man making jokes about a teenage girl's

582
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
weight.

583
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,180
And even though Mae Whitman, for many of her scenes, is wearing a fat suit, or at least

584
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,100
the hips of a fat suit, according to the actress, she just doesn't seem particularly overweight.

585
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,940
It's a strange vocal point for Michael and reveals him to be not quite the nice guy he

586
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,580
tries to present himself as.

587
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,060
It's a subtle reminder that there are no good bluths in the show.

588
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,460
Even while he's romancing Anne, George Michael still has an attraction to his cousin.

589
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:42,960
When the two of them kiss in the season two finale, the model home literally sinks.

590
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,940
And while this gets awkwardly ignored in season three, we do get some closure for the George

591
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,900
Michael relationship with Anne.

592
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,700
She dumps him.

593
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,980
Third season did show us a relationship blossoming though, and it's perhaps the most controversial

594
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,740
one in the series, Michael's relationship with Rita Leeds, played by Charlize Theron.

595
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,940
Let's just jump right to a fact that the series takes several episodes to reveal.

596
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,980
Rita has a mental health condition that is unfortunately revealed through the use of

597
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,420
an ableist slur.

598
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:18,360
Michael is unable to notice for several episodes because she's British and incredibly beautiful,

599
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,480
so he assumes she's being quirky.

600
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,060
When he proposes and nearly has sex with her, he only stops after learning the truth.

601
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:38,560
And then he ends things with Rita.

602
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,400
This half-season arc has gotten some critical attention over the years, though aside from

603
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,140
the use of a certain word and the childlike innocence archetype Rita is slotted into,

604
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,060
the series does make an effort to create a more well-rounded character who has wants

605
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,220
and desires of her own.

606
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,940
It's a level of depth we didn't get to see for other love interests of Michael, such

607
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,940
as Marta.

608
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,720
Although it's worth mentioning that Rita is fabulously wealthy, putting her in a closer

609
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,020
social standing to the Bluths than someone like Marta.

610
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,720
Being white and British I'm sure helps as well.

611
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,280
One thing Arrested Development does that's unlike a lot of other shows is including a

612
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,260
number of characters with disabilities, visible or otherwise.

613
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,820
Even members of the principal cast have disabilities, such as Tobias being a never nude and Buster

614
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,840
losing his hand, while in the case of Buster, laughing at him for losing a hand and treating

615
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,440
him like a machine can seem a bit cruel.

616
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,280
And Tobias being a never nude is just a punchline.

617
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,820
The show's record on characters with disabilities does become more complex when looking at the

618
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,280
supporting cast.

619
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,480
For Slate, Inku Kang wrote,

620
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,700
It's hard to think of another series that features so many different kinds of disabilities

621
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,220
while ensuring that the people with those syndromes are more than their impairments.

622
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:52,000
In fact, they are, with a single glaring exception, just like the rest of the show's version

623
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
of Orange County.

624
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,840
Vain, Vindictive, Pompous, Dishonest, Opportunistic, and or Oblivious.

625
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,100
These characters fit so seamlessly into the rest of the show's universe that they silently

626
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,460
expose how cloying and or exoticizing Hollywood's usual stereotypes about people with disabilities

627
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,460
are.

628
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:15,900
Inspirational, Asexual, Tragic, Brilliant, or Superpowered, a victim or a villain.

629
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,700
They're impairments poised to be overcome.

630
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,460
One of the major through lines in the series is the impact between generations within a

631
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,460
family.

632
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,740
And this can be seen in one of the key relationships between a father and son.

633
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,460
Michael and his son, George Michael.

634
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,780
Michael is determined to raise his son in a loving way that his father hadn't for

635
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,780
him.

636
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:39,260
In the second episode, we see how Michael does that when he confers the important responsibility

637
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,740
of running the family banana stand on George Michael.

638
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,380
Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.

639
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,380
It's up to me now.

640
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,380
I'm Mr. Manager.

641
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,380
Manager?

642
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,380
We just say...

643
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,380
I know, but...

644
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,740
It doesn't matter who.

645
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,380
The subtle joke here is that Michael is denying his son the adult Mr. Title, not letting him

646
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,380
grow up.

647
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,620
A key part of the relationship.

648
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,900
The two Bluth boys struggle to communicate with one another.

649
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,900
And while Michael remembers his father being a controlling tyrant, he exercises his own

650
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,580
brand of control over George Michael.

651
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,740
I'll work weeknights, I'll lay people off.

652
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,660
I'll give up my summer, all my summers.

653
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,980
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

654
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,060
Michael realized he had done to his son what his father had done to him.

655
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,180
Michael doesn't want to be like his father, but the way he's raised George Michael is

656
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:27,820
a lot like the way George Sr. raised him, such as getting them to be incredibly hard

657
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,820
on themselves.

658
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,820
What?

659
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,820
No, you stupid jerk.

660
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,820
Why not?

661
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,820
Dumb.

662
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,820
Dumb.

663
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,200
Dumb, George Michael.

664
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,700
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

665
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,420
Whoa, calm down, you two.

666
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,580
It's just a math problem.

667
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,480
Yeah, but if I fail math, there goes my chance at a good job and a happy life full of hard

668
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
work.

669
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Like you always say.

670
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,500
I know, but it's my fault I've been pushing him too hard.

671
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,020
It's just dumb, dumb, dumb, Michael, dumb.

672
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,020
Shh, shh, I forgive you.

673
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,860
The intergenerational impact of bad parenting is felt throughout the series.

674
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,620
It's this relationship that carries the heart of the series in the early seasons, and would

675
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,340
be one major thing to keep in mind for the fourth season, though that wouldn't be coming

676
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,700
for another eight years.

677
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,180
Fox finally pulled the plug on Arrested Development, with its third season order being cut to a

678
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:14,580
lean 13 episodes, the final four bearing in opposition to the Winter Olympics.

679
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,420
The series did make several attempts to appeal to a wider audience, though they never quite

680
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,580
resonated.

681
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,380
The second season also used some very heavy-handed product placement to earn some goodwill and

682
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:36,260
extra ad revenue for the network.

683
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,220
In the third season, after learning the show was being cancelled, a special Save Our Bluths-themed

684
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:47,100
episode, titled SOBs, parodied every stunt that shows used to goose the ratings, from

685
00:48:47,100 --> 00:49:00,020
guest stars to shots in 3D.

686
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:10,900
At one point, they even resorted to begging.

687
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,860
When this episode aired, the writing was more or less on the wall, Fox would no longer be

688
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,780
home for Arrested Development, and the show even made coy remarks about the future of

689
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:31,780
the show.

690
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,460
At one point we see the show contrast its own brand of complex characters with other

691
00:49:35,460 --> 00:50:00,820
TV sitcoms.

692
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:09,980
It's almost defensive in how firmly the show asserts itself as something transgressive

693
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,560
in the sitcom's space, and at the time, there was some truth to that.

694
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,980
There was an abundance of mediocre sitcoms on the air, using tired yet familiar gags

695
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,180
to attract audiences looking for something comfortable.

696
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,700
But it wasn't as if other genre-dying shows weren't finding success, and blaming the

697
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,820
audience isn't always the best bet.

698
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:46,300
Michael himself acknowledges this when he says, In the season 3 finale, Development

699
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,620
Arrested, we find the Bluths once again on a boat, much in the way the series began.

700
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,780
George Sr. is free, and we learn Lucille was the real brains behind the Bluth company,

701
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:05,700
and Lindsay finds out she's adopted.

702
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,060
Sharp-eyed viewers also noticed a subtle reference to the show's strong sales on DVD.

703
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,180
Other bombshells include learning that Anne is dating Job, who then gets punched in the

704
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,940
face by George Michael, and Michael realizes he succeeded in his mission.

705
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:37,820
When Michael realizes his son is hurting after learning about Job's betrayal, he

706
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:46,260
wants to comfort him, and he learns something important when Lucille tries to stop him.

707
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,500
It was at that moment that Michael realized how much he'd sold out.

708
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,340
As Michael runs off to be with his son, Lucille sells the company to stand sit-well in a panic,

709
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:05,580
as An-Yong is revealed to have betrayed the Bluths.

710
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:20,820
And the show ends on the crucial relationship.

711
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:34,260
And the epilogue gives us one last gasp of hope.

712
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,940
And so ends the first three seasons of Arrested Development, hitting the important beats of

713
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,140
how families and businesses should be kept distinct, the sinister relationship between

714
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,780
the American government and the business world, and that wealth can rot the connections within

715
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
a family.

716
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,100
But it's hard to focus on the themes of the show with all the loud raging over its

717
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,020
untimely cancellation.

718
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,140
Although there were brief flashes of self-awareness, such as the few words from Michael in the

719
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,220
SOB episode, most of the time this was a show that was clearly kicking and screaming as

720
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,500
it went off the air.

721
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,540
Not that it didn't have some ground for that, but it does complicate a reading of

722
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,540
it.

723
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,060
The text becomes less about the characters and their antics and more about the context

724
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,500
the show found itself in.

725
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,220
While the curtain was coming down on the show for now, with some of its lowest ratings thanks

726
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:25,380
to the love of critics and a passionate fanbase, it wouldn't be quickly forgotten.

727
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,260
Upon entering its second season, ratings for Arrested Development weren't really helped

728
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,460
by its Emmy wins.

729
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,260
It didn't do any worse, but it didn't do a whole lot better either.

730
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,900
The second season averaged 5.9 million viewers per episode, only slightly down from Season

731
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,100
1's 6.2 million.

732
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,580
Although ratings remained low, the show surprisingly got picked up for a third season in an Entertainment

733
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,780
Weekly article.

734
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,820
Peter Leguri, the new Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, said in a statement,

735
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,020
Arrested Development is one of the best comedies on television.

736
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,940
The decision to order another season becomes easy when you consider its amazing cast, creative

737
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,580
brilliance, critical acclaim, and advertiser appeal.

738
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,380
It's my first official pick-up since taking the job and I think it's a great way to start.

739
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,940
One change was the show being moved from Sunday nights at 9.30 to Monday nights at 8.

740
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,780
It fared even worse than the ratings.

741
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,460
The third season would go on to average 3.9 million viewers, losing 2 million from the

742
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,700
previous season, albeit that does include four episodes that were aired directly against

743
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,100
the Olympics, dragging down the overall average.

744
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,020
The low ratings hurt morale on the show, and that was likely made worse when the full season

745
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,260
was cut down to a 13-episode half-season.

746
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,820
Although Mitch Hurwitz was in talks to bring the series to showtime for a fourth season,

747
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,220
ultimately these negotiations fell through.

748
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,100
Part of the reason, as Hurwitz would later explain, was because of his own fatigue running

749
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,940
such a detailed series.

750
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,780
In an interview, he said,

751
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,780
In truth, I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series.

752
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,620
I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I think a lot

753
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,640
of the actors were ready to move on.

754
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,140
My first instinct was that it was over when Fox pulled the plug.

755
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,920
I considered continuing the show because I felt I owed that to the fans, but I am determined

756
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,880
to give them some other kind of entertainment that will satisfy them at some point, I hope.

757
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,940
Even though Arrested Development had a record low viewership, the main demographic appears

758
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,020
to have been movie studio executives, so hopefully the cast will be able to benefit from that.

759
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,540
Even if the show had been picked up for a fourth season, Hurwitz expressed that he likely

760
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:26,860
would have taken a backseat role, unable to keep up the pace of running a show that was

761
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,940
built on so many small details.

762
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,720
The third season in particular seems to have really demotivated him and everyone working

763
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,080
on the show because of a lack of faith in how it was presented and promoted by the network.

764
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,480
Although the audience for Arrested Development was small, they were particularly passionate,

765
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,280
and when it came time to point fingers, many of them were directed at Fox.

766
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,560
This wasn't entirely spontaneous, though.

767
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,120
In the same way the instant classic label was encouraged by the DVD release of the first

768
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,320
season, the second season's DVD set had a message of its own buried at the end of the

769
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,660
season 2 blooper reel featurette.

770
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,620
I got an idea for what you can do, why don't you f***ing fire your complete marketing team

771
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,780
or get a new one in there, notice how to market a show that won five motherf***ing Emmys,

772
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,900
Golden Globes, SAG Awards, WGA Awards, DGA Awards, Producers Guilds Awards, Critics Top

773
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Ten lists.

774
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,940
You know, if you can't market that kind of show and get better ratings, then maybe the

775
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,060
problem doesn't lie here.

776
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,700
Maybe it lies with marketing.

777
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,180
Good night.

778
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,740
Good night, thank you very much.

779
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,500
David Cross's frustration at the network was a pivotal moment, and really shaped the

780
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,540
perception of why the show failed.

781
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,660
It was moved to different time slots, it wasn't advertised the right way, or the network simply

782
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,980
didn't believe in it.

783
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,540
Looking at the evidence, not all of that is true.

784
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,200
The show had a very stable time slot, aside from that one episode in the first season

785
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,220
that was placed after an episode of American Idol, and the final four episodes being programmed

786
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,780
against the Olympics, which was decided well after the show had been cancelled.

787
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,580
It often didn't air new episodes on consecutive weeks, but the same was true for other shows

788
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,020
on the same night, which tended to perform better.

789
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,140
To say the network simply didn't believe in the show is a bit of a stretch when it

790
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,780
ran for two and a half seasons, with ratings that would get most other shows cancelled

791
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,180
in less than half that amount of time.

792
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,460
None of that is to say the network is blameless, though.

793
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:14,060
Arrested Development is a hard show to sell, but Fox was unable to capitalize on its acclaim

794
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,340
and loyal fanbase to reach a wider audience.

795
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,340
A brilliant show doesn't naturally find an audience if a network isn't entirely sure

796
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,500
how to find that audience.

797
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,620
In 2011, Mitch Hurwitz wrote an article for The Guardian titled, Arrested Development

798
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,980
creator Mitch Hurwitz's guide to getting a sitcom cancelled.

799
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,300
In it, he has some unflinching reflections on why the show failed to connect to audiences.

800
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,660
Here are a few examples.

801
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,540
Try to do too much for a 20-minute program.

802
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,700
If in your particular medium an audience is used to a simple plot line or maybe one or

803
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,940
two stories, see if you can get aid in there, and find a way that they somehow intertwine.

804
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,100
Add a sprinkle of incest.

805
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,380
They'll never admit it, but viewers love sex.

806
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,140
In fact, they love any sort of titillation, with the exception of incest.

807
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,660
So focus on that.

808
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,840
First impressions are everything, so if you can screw that up, you're made.

809
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,900
With Arrested Development, we tried showing the deep disdain that connects a family.

810
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,340
We wanted to hold up a mirror to American society, and just as predicted, America looked

811
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,340
away.

812
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,260
Make easy jokes about minority groups.

813
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,860
Whether they be Mexicans, Jews, or homosexuals, any group can be dismissed with a few stereotypical

814
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,860
cracks.

815
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,140
That's what we tried to do.

816
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:23,420
And given their lack of coming to the party, it seems we succeeded.

817
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,060
That last word in particular is worth considering, as there is a distinction to think about when

818
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,300
it comes to edgy humor.

819
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,140
While Arrested Development did have a few tasteless jokes about certain identity groups,

820
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,740
sometimes being outright racist, it typically had even more jokes about the oblivious bluths

821
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,820
and their racist attitudes.

822
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,580
In many cases, the bluths were the butt of the racially charged jokes.

823
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:50,460
For example, when Job brings out his racist puppet Franklin, the joke here is that Job

824
00:58:50,460 --> 00:59:00,500
is a racist.

825
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:12,420
The episode even makes a decent bit of racial commentary.

826
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,620
So maybe not all the racial humor on the show was offensive.

827
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:20,040
But a question worth asking is, even if something isn't offensive, is it something someone

828
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,900
from one of these groups would actually want to watch?

829
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,620
Perhaps more than the racism, rather, it's that a show centered around a rich white family

830
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,900
gets less interesting the further the audience gets away from that experience.

831
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,860
There are plenty of examples of shows ahead of their time that had weak first seasons,

832
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,500
only to catch on some time later.

833
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,860
Cheers was one of the lowest rated shows on network TV when it aired.

834
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,840
Seinfeld went from a solid performer to one of the highest rated shows on television.

835
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,700
But those were shows that began in the 80s, and Arrested Development began in 2003.

836
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,740
The realities of network television were changing, with more channels to compete against and

837
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,580
more people DVR-ing shows.

838
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,320
It was tougher for a niche show to get a chance to grow, because audiences were fragmenting.

839
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,740
There was one unique advantage Arrested Development had been in the mid-2000, and that's the

840
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,780
benefit of DVD sales.

841
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,580
Although it's tough to find hard numbers, sales for Arrested Development DVDs were

842
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,420
quoted as being somewhere around 3 million units sold in the United States in an article

843
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,500
that was published in 2013.

844
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,660
The Numbers, a website that estimates the sales of media, claims that the third season

845
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:26,220
of Arrested Development sold roughly 400,000 units in its first three weeks, with an audience

846
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,860
of under 4 million, that's a very high conversion rate of people buying DVDs.

847
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:36,740
While these numbers would be dwarfed by powerhouses in the TV-DVD space, such as Family Guy,

848
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,100
it was still a sign that, at the very least, Arrested Development had a dedicated enough

849
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:49,020
fan base not to let the show vanish into the night.

850
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,180
In the years between Arrested Development's cancellation and return, the series was kept

851
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:57,900
alive in the minds of the public with rumors of a supposed movie being in the works.

852
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:02,220
The cast and creative team would, on occasion, stoke those rumors, but a lot of it was driven

853
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,420
by a fan base hungry for more Arrested Development.

854
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,660
Writing for The Verge, Keith Phipps offers some insight into this time.

855
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,340
Here's some inside baseball.

856
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:16,940
If you worked at a pop culture website between 2006 and 2013, running items about Arrested

857
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,860
Development's long-rumored return was like printing page views.

858
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,340
In addition to having a voracious fan base, Arrested Development was also fortunate to

859
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,740
have critics in position of influence to ensure that the series was held in high regard,

860
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,740
frequently placing it on lists of the all-time greatest TV shows.

861
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,220
This period is what started to cement the idea of Arrested Development being canonized

862
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,300
as one of the all-time TV greats.

863
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,020
It was unique, daring, and canceled before its time, everything to make it a darling,

864
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,940
and its reputation was helping it find a wider audience even off the air.

865
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:53,260
In TV history, shows that are considered all-time classics are often those that drew a massive

866
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:57,180
audience, but a space has always been carved out for smaller shows that were canceled before

867
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,900
their time, usually because they were very influential.

868
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,660
That space is reserved for shows that are not remembered by a mass audience, but rather

869
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,860
critics or a passionate fan base that keep it from being forgotten.

870
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,140
Historically, this is closer to how other forms of art are remembered.

871
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,700
Although popularity is a helpful boost, a mass audience tends to move on from a work

872
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:19,020
of art as time goes on, so it falls to critics, academics, and the most passionate

873
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,820
appreciators of a field of art to preserve its memory.

874
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,380
With television, things become more complicated.

875
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,380
It's rare for any long-running TV series to have its best episodes or moments in the

876
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,500
first season or two.

877
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,820
Oftentimes, shows will find that their third, fourth, or fifth seasons are among their

878
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,300
strongest, but it could only get there if it could build on a base of popular support.

879
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,020
This is why popularity is always important to consider when thinking of the all-time

880
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,140
TV greats.

881
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:48,380
A movie, a song, or a book is a finished product and is going to reach the highest

882
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:52,540
potential it can, but a show that keeps running has room to grow and improve.

883
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,740
This makes Arrested Development's accomplishment of becoming considered a

884
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,820
classic so quickly even more impressive.

885
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,140
Throughout the years following the cancellation of the show,

886
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:04,940
fansites started popping up online, including the Balboa Observer, the Inconvenient

887
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,180
Bluth, and the Banana Stand.

888
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,860
Fansites in particular were a fitting homage, as the show itself was constantly

889
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,540
putting together mock websites that were briefly mentioned on an episode.

890
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,700
The series itself almost seems built for internet fandom, as part of the fun involved

891
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,460
diving into each episode, finding foreshadowing for future events.

892
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,900
Like a vague reference to a dangerous seal attacking people several episodes

893
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,740
before it would bite off Buster's hand.

894
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,380
Or a guy who bears a striking resemblance to one of Saddam Hussein's sons appearing

895
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,500
at a Bluth Company event.

896
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,700
Is that Kusei Hussein at the omelet bar?

897
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,500
All these little details became catnip for a fanbase that was all too happy to dissect them.

898
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:50,380
In many ways, this has even influenced how other fandoms have deconstructed shows on the internet,

899
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:55,500
hyperfixating on every detail in a trailer or an episode, trying to connect various narrative

900
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,820
strands. While Arrested Development fans certainly didn't invent this way of looking at media,

901
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,140
they did help popularize it on the internet.

902
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:06,780
There is a downside to this though. It's helped give us an online culture that is less inclined

903
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,980
to discuss the themes or experiences of watching something to instead try and find any small

904
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,500
detail that appears more than once and calling it a day.

905
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,860
While no specific way of watching a TV show is correct or better than the other, I personally

906
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:25,260
appreciate a more balanced approach. It's fun to find easter eggs, but I think it's fun to do

907
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,900
something with those eggs to shape one's understanding of what a show is trying to say.

908
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,580
The series even inspired fans to create a documentary that included interviews with

909
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,620
cast members and other people involved with the production of the series.

910
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:41,020
It also interviewed a number of fans, all expressing their undying love for the series.

911
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:45,180
After what seemed like an endless series of teases, eventually it was revealed that Arrested

912
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:51,820
Development was coming back from the land of dead TV shows. It was what fans thought was a dream come

913
01:04:51,820 --> 01:05:00,300
true. On October 2nd, 2011, the cast of Arrested Development, along with Ron Howard and Mitch

914
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,700
Hurwitz, all gathered for a reunion at the New Yorker Festival. It was here we got the first

915
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,060
real indicator that the show would be returning for a limited run.

916
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,940
About six weeks later, it was announced that Netflix would be the new home for this new run

917
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:33,820
of episodes, convinced in part by the show's strong streaming and DVD performance. Rather

918
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,980
than renewing the life of the series and continuing to produce new seasons, this was

919
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:43,100
intended to be a standalone season. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings described it saying,

920
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:48,460
Arrested Development is a wildly successful tactic, as opposed to fundamental to the strategy.

921
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:53,980
In August of 2012, a rough date was given for the series' return, spring of 2013.

922
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,140
One of the major challenges for the fourth season was that, thanks in no small part to

923
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:03,500
the critical success of the original three seasons, the cast had become very hot commodities, so

924
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,300
working out the time to film ten episodes of a fourth season was a real challenge.

925
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,780
Hurwitz decided that, instead of trying to recreate the ensemble dynamic of the earlier

926
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,660
seasons, he would instead use these episodes to focus on the individual characters, making it

927
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,620
easier to film around the schedules of the actors. In fact, this project wasn't even originally

928
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:28,140
intended to be a self-contained fourth season. Rather, the idea was for a series of shorts that

929
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:32,460
would lead to an eventual movie. Hype for the series eventually turned this into a full-blown

930
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:37,420
season, but the movie was always going to be part of the plan. In an interview, Hurwitz said,

931
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,820
The master plan is to do these episodes and then do the movie, where the family is all together,

932
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:46,140
and it's very much written and directed in that direction. It all leads to a bigger story.

933
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,780
It's kind of the preamble, although hopefully it'll be satisfying in its own right.

934
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:55,420
The fourth season was really more of an act one that would hopefully lead into a movie with acts

935
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:00,300
two and three. Although originally planned to be ten episodes, with Jason Bateman appearing in all

936
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:05,100
of them and the rest of the cast being featured in one episode each, the series kept getting larger

937
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,740
in the planning stages. Eventually it would grow to fifteen episodes. Episodes would still feature

938
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:13,980
a character from the Blue Family, only some characters got two episodes and others only

939
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:19,660
won. Hurwitz was pushed to his limits organizing the series. David Cross in an interview describes

940
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,900
what it was like visiting Hurwitz's office. You know the murder scene where they go to the

941
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:28,540
psycho killer's apartment and he's got all this crazy sh** mapped out? That's what it looked like.

942
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,580
Post-it notes and index cards all across the three walls into this big conference room,

943
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,140
yarn stretching from one thing to another and pinned in one place, and then a sharp angular

944
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:43,500
uptick to the Lucille character and down. And then there's a different colored yarn that intersects

945
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,140
and weaves in. It took Hurwitz 25 minutes to explain what I was looking at and I still didn't

946
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:53,100
get everything. When you see that, of course it has to be a TV show. There's no way else to do this.

947
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,700
Episodes weren't filmed separately. Rather, multiple scenes were shot each day regardless

948
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,020
of the episode they were in. Scripts were rewritten or sometimes only half finished,

949
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:07,660
so many lines were written on the set. In an interview, director Troy Miller said,

950
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:11,260
There's never been a half hour comedy with a level of complexity here. The idea of how

951
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:17,260
characters interrelate and the episodic arcs in A, B, C, D and E stories, it's this crazy wormhole

952
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:22,860
he's created. Portia de Rossi describes her experience filming saying, Look, I had a meltdown

953
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:29,020
absolutely. Then she laughs. I think all of us as actors had a moment where things came kind of

954
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:34,060
unglued for a second. At one point I remember I had all the episodes on the floor of my trailer

955
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:39,340
and they were all open to pages and I kind of went beautiful mind crazy trying to map everything out.

956
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:45,020
I had arrows and diagrams and it was so crazy and then I thought, Oh, I just have to let go

957
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:51,740
completely and show up to set and be present. As its May 26, 2013 premiere date approached,

958
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:56,380
it was clear that the season wasn't meant to be consumed the way the previous three had been.

959
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:01,580
It was meant to be watched repeatedly with jokes revealing themselves on rewatches and plot lines

960
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:05,660
intersecting in ways people weren't noticing the first time around. Ahead of the release,

961
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:11,260
Mitch Hurwitz offered some advice on watching the season. You can't take it all in at once.

962
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:16,060
It's like the selective attention test. It gives fans something to pour over if that's fun for them.

963
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:20,540
If they want to go right back and check out the Job episode and see how that was set up,

964
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:25,260
they can. Months ahead of the premiere, Netflix started a unique marketing campaign.

965
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,820
They began placing fake shows and movies on their platform inspired by previous episodes

966
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,620
of Arrested Development. There was also a contest for five fans with the most impressive creations

967
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,180
getting a chance to appear in a scene on the show. We also got a fun demo reel for Tobias

968
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:50,060
on his website, insertmeanywhere.biz. Netflix even held an orange carpet premiere

969
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:53,740
to celebrate the release, screening the first two episodes of the season.

970
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:58,380
Leading up to the release, there were a number of times and interviews that Mitch Hurwitz was

971
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:03,020
asked if he had any misgivings about the series potentially tarnishing the legacy of the original

972
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,260
three seasons he had created. At this point, Arrested Development had more or less been

973
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,300
branded an all-time classic. Hurwitz was always quick to reassure people that this season would

974
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,340
not disappoint, and one quote in particular makes it quite clear how the profile had not only grown

975
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,140
in the minds of the audience, but also in the mind of the show's creator, Hurwitz said.

976
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,820
If the first series aspired to be the godfather in terms of the family,

977
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:30,620
this thing aspires to be a godfather too. I'm sure a lot of people went to see the godfather

978
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:35,740
part two and said, what happens to the machine guns? What are we doing in Cuba? Meetings? Who

979
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:40,620
cares about meetings? But the godfather too was more substantial and rewatchable. It was more

980
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:45,260
complex. I aspire to do that kind of evolution with this. I don't mean to compare it to the

981
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:49,900
godfather 2, I just mean that, well, it's not exactly what the audience expects, but I think

982
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:54,940
it'll scratch the itch. Any comparison to the godfather, even one that was walked back,

983
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,660
can come across as a bit of a boast, but at the time, it seemed defensible.

984
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,340
Season 4 had some very heavy expectations on its shoulders.

985
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:13,020
Fourth season of Arrested Development is so densely layered that even writing about it is

986
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,900
a challenge. The first three seasons of the show had smaller story arcs that usually only ran for

987
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,380
about half a season, and the only long-term stories were either directly tied to the constant

988
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:28,220
perils of the Bluth Company or ongoing personal concerns like Tobias trying to find an acting job.

989
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:32,700
In other words, they were just reiterating the situation of this situation comedy.

990
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:37,180
Season 4 took things to a much grander scale, with the show's premise changing from a family

991
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,660
being held together to one that had been split apart. Each character had their own distinct

992
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:46,140
narrative, only occasionally intersecting with the other characters, and even though the episode

993
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:52,860
count was 15, the actual episodes ran considerably longer, ranging from 29 to 38 minutes. Its total

994
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:58,460
runtime is slightly longer than season 1's, even though that one ran for an additional 7 episodes.

995
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:04,300
Season 4 opens with a tease of where this story will take us, to a night called Cinco de Quatro,

996
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:09,660
originally created by the Bluths to undermine the Hispanic festival Cinco de Mayo, only to have

997
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:14,940
Cinco de Quatro claimed by that same community. And it's the sight of the murder of Lucille

998
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:20,140
Austero. To unravel how this all happened, the series goes back several years, picking up

999
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,540
immediately where season 3 left off, with the Bluths recovering at a Coast Guard headquarters

1000
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,980
after having been rescued from sea when Lucille, fleeing the authorities, took the boat that most

1001
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:35,340
of the family was on off course. Michael, having discovered at the end of season 3 that George

1002
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:40,060
Sr. had stowed away on the boat he and George Michael were escaping on, also heads back to be

1003
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:45,100
reunited with the family. The scene in the Coast Guard headquarters is one of the few that featured

1004
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,900
all of the Bluth family in the same place at the same time, and it serves as a staging ground for

1005
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:54,220
the stories to come. This scene is revisited multiple times throughout the season. Here's

1006
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:11,660
how one moment is portrayed across several episodes. From this scene, each of the characters

1007
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,700
goes off on their own adventures, rather than try to follow all the twists and turns of each of them,

1008
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,500
and there are a lot. Instead, let's look at what it means for this family to fall apart.

1009
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,740
One pattern among every member of the family is that their lives all start to break down

1010
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:30,460
when they're separated, with no Michael or Bluth company holding them together. All the characters

1011
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:34,940
almost immediately begin to self-destruct, even Michael's new development company quickly fails

1012
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:40,140
and he's stuck living in George Michael's dorm until he's pathetically voted out. With his son

1013
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:44,780
as the sole exception, Michael believes he'll be able to find a happier life for himself without

1014
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,380
his family, and the other Bluths all believe the same thing. Tobias' story has him busking on the

1015
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,940
street dressed up as The Thing from The Fantastic Four. This leads him to getting registered as a

1016
01:13:54,940 --> 01:14:10,940
sex offender when he pays a visit to Maybe. In Tobias' story, there's a genuinely sweet

1017
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:16,620
moment between him and his new friend, Debris Bardot, played by Maria Bamford, a former actress

1018
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:33,820
who is now in treatment for a chemical addiction. As the only outsider in the Bluth family,

1019
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,060
Tobias is starving for positive support, the sort you might expect from a family,

1020
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:42,700
but not if that family is the Bluths. It's a reminder of how non-typical this family is,

1021
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:47,660
and Tobias being a part of it for over 20 years has borne the brunt of that reality.

1022
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,980
Tobias spends much of his story assembling a new family, ostensibly to put on a production of a

1023
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:57,420
Fantastic Four musical, but in reality he really loves being surrounded by a positive, caring group

1024
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:02,700
of people who are willing to indulge his dream of becoming an actor. It still doesn't end well,

1025
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,340
because Tobias is terrible at acting, but in spite of his loss of fortunes, he seems happier

1026
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:11,820
struggling to get by with Debris than he ever did with Lindsay, who never appreciated his better

1027
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,900
qualities. Lindsay's plotline is perhaps the most political the show has gotten up to this

1028
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:22,780
point. She leaves Tobias for a young activist named Marky Bark, played by Chris Diamantopoulos.

1029
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:28,700
Although things are nice at first, she eventually realizes that a life of a simple ostrich farmer

1030
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:34,780
isn't for her. She eventually drops Marky to be with Herbert Love, played by Terry Crews. Perhaps

1031
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:39,900
dating the show, Herbert is a reference to Herman Cain, who is running for the Republican nomination

1032
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,860
in 2012, before dropping out after he was accused of sexually harassing multiple women.

1033
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:49,340
Lindsay, charmed by his wealth, doesn't realize Herbert Love has hired her as an escort,

1034
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:53,420
with payment going to maybe as her pimp. It would take too long to explain how that happens,

1035
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:57,980
so let's keep moving. Jumping ahead to the conclusion, eventually Lindsay leaves Herbert,

1036
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,220
only to end up replacing him on the campaign trail. After being robbed by someone she

1037
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:06,300
thought was a Mexican man, Lindsay gives a speech that will sound very familiar.

1038
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,060
This episode aired over two years before Donald Trump would announce his bid to become the

1039
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:26,220
president, though the wall on the southern border had long been a talking point in right-wing

1040
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:32,140
politics. Ironically, Lindsay was in some ways meant to model Hillary Clinton, as seen by the

1041
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:37,660
distinct hairstyle she sports at the close of one episode. This storyline about building a wall on

1042
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,020
the southern border ran through a number of characters' plotlines, but the connection

1043
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:46,380
to Lindsay was particularly interesting as it spoke to the potential popularity of reactionary

1044
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:52,220
politics. As parody, it seemed fitting, but in our current reality, it comes across as prophetic.

1045
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:57,340
One thing season four simply can't escape is how utterly confusing it is. Although it somehow makes

1046
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:01,500
sense when finished, the experience going through each episode can be frustrating,

1047
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:07,180
particularly if it's your first time. Plot twists often get no explanation, jokes aren't paid off,

1048
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:12,220
and it's easy to miss familiar faces that would take several episodes to reappear. It also didn't

1049
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:17,100
help that each episode had such a lengthy runtime that even watching a single episode felt more

1050
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,820
taxing than perhaps it should have. In an effort to explain the plot, episodes are packed with

1051
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:26,940
flashbacks, flash-forwards, and heavy narration. Narration that gets disorienting when Ron Howard

1052
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:32,060
himself shows up for a subplot involving Michael trying to sell his family's story to imagine

1053
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:37,100
entertainment, only for Michael to imperil the deal when he mistakenly assumes his new girlfriend,

1054
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,860
Rebel, played by Isla Fisher, is Ron Howard's mistress. The truth comes out in one of Tobias'

1055
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:52,300
episodes. Did you not know that I'm Rebel's dad? I thought that you might also be her

1056
01:17:52,300 --> 01:18:02,460
a lover? I get it. I was arrested as a sex offender, but at least I knew it was my daughter

1057
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:08,620
I was arrested for coming on too. The other guy Rebel is dating is George Maharis. Who was that?

1058
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:16,940
No one. George Michael, looking for a new identity, is going by George Maharis now,

1059
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,420
and Rebel was impressed by his software company that would hide your online footprint.

1060
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:26,860
Fakeblock, which doesn't exist. At least not as a software company, it's actually just an app

1061
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:31,500
that's a fake woodblock. I hope you can see how confusing this is all getting. The season's

1062
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,820
fixation on individual characters does have some strength though. The plot lines dive deep into

1063
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,060
who these characters are, and these include moments of realization for these characters,

1064
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,620
occasionally summed up by other characters. You know, your whole life is an escape act,

1065
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,580
and this girl seems like she really likes you. Why don't you just try to work it out and just stop

1066
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:57,020
running? What you are is the invisible girl. You'll make it impossible for people to see

1067
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:03,580
you in order to protect yourself. And that's when maybe who had spent so long lying to others,

1068
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:09,900
and even herself, finally had to admit she had made a huge mis- I know I'm fine. Well,

1069
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:14,140
not everyone has a moment of realization. There was also an intriguing plot line involving a

1070
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,460
private investigator really emphasizing how the family was dissolving. Where the hell am I going

1071
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:27,420
to find a PI? Jean Parmesan. At your service. AHH! Jean! He does this to me every time!

1072
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,660
This guy gets me every time. The season does have a unique ending compared to every other

1073
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:36,620
season of Arrested Development though. Michael, through some sly maneuvering, tries to get George

1074
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:41,180
Michael out of Rebel's life without George Michael finding out they're dating the same woman.

1075
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:46,060
And when the truth comes out, instead of closing with father and son somehow taking off from the

1076
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:58,460
family once again as seen in previous seasons, this happens instead. And that's how the season

1077
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:04,060
ends. With George Michael finally standing up to his father and, we hope, possibly breaking the

1078
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:10,380
Bluth family cycle. By lying to his son and being even more like his father than he had been before,

1079
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,780
Michael was setting up George Michael to be the same put-upon son that Michael was.

1080
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:19,260
George Michael punching his father in the face is him rejecting that role for himself.

1081
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,260
There are a few post-credits scenes with Buster being arrested for murdering Lucille too,

1082
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:27,740
and Rod Howard excitedly talking about a movie based on him, but it would be some time before

1083
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,660
those particular threads would be followed up on. The season ended as one of the most

1084
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:37,420
densely structured seasons of a sitcom I have ever seen. Storylines layered on top of one another,

1085
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:42,300
intersecting almost randomly, and a single joke could happen simultaneously across multiple

1086
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:47,500
episodes. It was ambitious, uneven, and deeply polarizing. Even though Arrested Development

1087
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:52,060
had returned, its fourth season wasn't the universal triumph the hype was demanding.

1088
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:59,340
Netflix doesn't publish its viewing numbers, so we can't know for certain how well this season

1089
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:05,500
performed. A third party that measured numbers at the time reported that 36% of devices connected

1090
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,780
to Netflix on the Sunday premiere watched at least part of one episode of the series.

1091
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,220
That's three times the number of people who watched House of Cards, which was one of the

1092
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:19,580
strongest Netflix originals at the time. A few months after the show premiered, Netflix's chief

1093
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:24,940
content officer, Ted Sarandos, apparently pleased with the show's performance, said that Arrested

1094
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:29,420
Development would be returning to the streaming service at some point in the future. They just

1095
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:34,220
weren't sure when or what form it would take. Mitch Hurwitz also discussed plans he had for

1096
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:39,100
the series on Netflix, possibly airing material that had been filmed but not used in the fourth

1097
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:44,700
season. He also described some kind of long-term plot for Tracy Bluth, Michael's deceased wife,

1098
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:50,620
who very briefly appeared in season four on an old tape. She also looks like Isla Fisher, which

1099
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:56,060
makes the whole relationship Rebel had with Michael and George Michael extra creepy. When

1100
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:00,380
discussing the end of the season with George Michael punching his father, Hurwitz said in

1101
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:05,100
an interview, What is the next step if you were to have that kind of situation with your father,

1102
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:10,940
the closest person to you? What does happen next? As it turns out, I do have answers to that,

1103
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:15,740
but I just need someone to let me make them. The original plan of doing a movie next was

1104
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:21,100
still very much in Hurwitz's mind, though unlike the period after season three ended,

1105
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:26,380
he said that there would be less teasing until plans were firmly in place and he had some idea

1106
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:31,180
of a release date. Not all the reactions to the fourth season were quite so optimistic for the

1107
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:35,900
future, though. In contrast to the overwhelmingly positive response of the original, the fourth

1108
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:41,100
season proved to be more polarizing. Some felt it was too much of a departure from the original,

1109
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,660
others appreciated its novel approach to storytelling. Regardless, the fact remains

1110
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,700
that it was a divisive season. After season four aired, Mitch Hurwitz posted a handwritten note

1111
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,580
to the show's Facebook page. It read in part, We are also grateful for another chance to bring

1112
01:22:55,580 --> 01:23:00,860
these characters to life and could not have done so without your consistent effort to

1113
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:06,700
spread the word about it. Although obviously in the case of the enemies, the words you spread were

1114
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,820
don't watch this show. You know, I probably shouldn't have even included them in the

1115
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:14,780
salutation, but I'm writing this in ink plus making all sorts of mistakes. Did you notice the

1116
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:19,340
S at the end of the word done? While it's obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek, it's clear

1117
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:23,820
that Hurwitz was hearing a round of criticism about the fourth season, unlike the first three

1118
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:28,700
seasons. In an interview several years later, Hurwitz reflected on some of the criticisms the

1119
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:34,540
season got. It got positioned in the press saying, even Hurwitz thought it wasn't his best work.

1120
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,340
Well, actually, I did think it was my best work, but I did acknowledge that it was and wasn't.

1121
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:44,780
The other thing that was interesting about it is that some articles will say,

1122
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:51,260
so-so reception, but it wasn't so-so. It was, this is great, or this is horrible. And even that

1123
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:55,900
is what you hope for. I mean, you don't hope for this is horrible, but you do hope to do something

1124
01:23:55,980 --> 01:24:00,780
that's novel enough at a certain point in your career that people have strong reactions to it.

1125
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:05,420
It's hard to map out the overall interest in a TV series over the span of years,

1126
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:10,460
particularly when it isn't on the air and there are no ratings to consult. But as a show that

1127
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:15,740
lived off the hype of the internet, interest in arrested development can be seen, at least in part,

1128
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:21,260
on a Google Trends graph. Looking at how interest has changed since 2004, we can see it regularly

1129
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,060
scoring above 10 for over a decade, shooting up slightly when news broke about its return at the

1130
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:32,300
New Yorker festival reunion. Interest in the show exploded for its fourth season debut, but then

1131
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:37,420
dropped entirely. What's most interesting, though, is that while previous years had the show scoring

1132
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:43,020
a 10 on the interest scale, give or take one or two, after season four it was scoring either a six

1133
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:48,460
or seven. That's a drop of roughly 40% of interest in the show. While it's probably the case that

1134
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:53,580
stories about the rumored movie helped bolster interest earlier on, it's also true that, for

1135
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:58,620
some fans, season four undercut a lot of their interest in this series. The late spike in the

1136
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:03,260
interest chart does point to something else, though, and that's the show's eventual return for fifth

1137
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:09,020
season on Netflix, split into two parts, each being eight episodes. In spite of the mixed response to

1138
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:13,740
the fourth season, there was no hesitation on all the parties involved creatively to do more,

1139
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:18,700
Hurwitz explained, saying, the studio wanted to do it, Netflix wanted to do it, the actors wanted

1140
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:23,500
to do it, I wanted to do it, but we all have to want to do it at the same time. Ahead of the release

1141
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:28,460
of the fifth season, we did get a second look at the fourth, though. On May 3rd, 2018, Netflix

1142
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:33,980
released a re-edited version of the fourth season called, Fateful Consequences. This version of the

1143
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:39,180
season would remix the series so that the story was told in a more chronological order. Instead

1144
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:43,820
of focusing on a single character, episodes would include scenes from the stories of multiple

1145
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:49,180
characters. So what was once an episode that only followed Job would be replaced by an episode that

1146
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:54,940
followed Job, George Sr., and Buster. Episodes were also much shorter, being kept to a stricter 22

1147
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:59,580
minute length. The season also ended up running for a few episodes longer because of that. A few

1148
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:04,620
scenes were cut, including jokes that no longer made sense with the newly edited versions, and

1149
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:09,260
a few were added in using additional audio that was recorded. It also introduced a lot more

1150
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,060
narration to help fill in the blanks created when future events no longer had teases in earlier

1151
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:19,580
episodes. There were aspects of this series that simply couldn't be changed, such as how few scenes

1152
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:23,740
featured the Blue Family interacting with each other, and for jokes that fell flat the first time

1153
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:30,060
around, they didn't really get better the second. The reaction to the remix was, well, mixed. Five

1154
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:34,620
years after the original had aired, it found a loyal group of fans who enjoyed its structural

1155
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:39,020
departure from the first three seasons, and there were fans of the early seasons who appreciated it

1156
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:43,180
feeling more like those ones. If you're interested in watching the fourth season on Netflix,

1157
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:48,140
it's the remixed version that's presented on its page for season four. To find the original

1158
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:53,020
cut of the fourth season, you have to look under the trailers and more sections just to spot it.

1159
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:58,060
While the original cut had five years for people to ponder its significance, the remix would not

1160
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:02,940
have nearly as much time as only days after it was released, Netflix announced that the first

1161
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:08,300
half of season five of Arrested Development would be aired a few weeks later, on May 29th,

1162
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:14,300
2018. But there would be a few bumps on the way to that release. A few months before the release

1163
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:19,900
of the fifth season, Jeffrey Tambor, who had been starring in the series Transparent, was fired

1164
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:24,140
after he was alleged to have sexually harassed several women working on the production.

1165
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:28,940
Afterwards, in an interview about the incident, Tambor admitted to having been difficult on the

1166
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:34,140
set, though he insisted that he had not crossed the line into sexual harassment. When the news

1167
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:39,020
broke, filming for the fifth season of Arrested Development had already been completed, and Tambor

1168
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,420
was too integral to the series to be edited out, so it was never seriously considered to do that

1169
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:48,460
season without him. In an interview, Mitch Hurwitz said, We were done shooting. There was no version

1170
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:53,020
of cutting him out of the show, or there would be no show. Am I going to cut Jeffrey out of the show

1171
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:58,220
based on allegations that he disputes, that Amazon hasn't shared, and that we have never experienced

1172
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:03,100
any complaints about? No, of course I am not going to. I'm going to support Jeffrey.

1173
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:07,740
Netflix head of content Ted Sarandos also expressed that Tambor had never been anything

1174
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,900
but professional in their history working together. However, ahead of the premiere,

1175
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:16,140
Jeffrey Tambor sat down for an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where he mentioned that he had

1176
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:21,100
a blow-up on the set of Arrested Development while filming its fifth season with Jessica Walter.

1177
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:26,540
He added that he profusely apologized afterwards, but it raised a question that would come up in

1178
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:31,740
several interviews with the press as the fifth season was being promoted, and most crucially,

1179
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,900
in an interview with The New York Times. The interview included Jessica Walter,

1180
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:41,340
Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Bateman, David Cross, Tony Ale, and Aliyah Shawkat. During the interview,

1181
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:45,900
the subject came up of Jeffrey Tambor's behavior on the set of Arrested Development's fifth season.

1182
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,380
Although Jessica Walter was the subject, Jason Bateman and David Cross talked over her,

1183
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,940
coming to the defense of Tambor. It went on for a bit, until we finally got to hear

1184
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:58,540
from Jessica Walter. Here's audio from that moment in the interview.

1185
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:29,580
I have to let go of being angry at him. He never crossed the line on our show with any,

1186
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:36,620
you know, sexual, whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize. I have to

1187
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:44,300
let it go, and I have to give you a chance to, you know, for us to be friends again. But it's hard,

1188
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:49,820
because honestly, Jason says this happens all the time. In like almost 60 years of working,

1189
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:55,420
I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it's hard to deal with it, but I'm

1190
01:29:55,420 --> 01:30:01,660
over it now. I just let it go right here for The New York Times. She didn't give it up for anybody

1191
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:07,500
else. Hearing the emotion in Jessica Walter's voice and just how extreme the harassment, and

1192
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:12,620
as she plainly says, the worst she's experienced in her career, it does bring the incident into

1193
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:17,580
perspective. And it's unfortunate that in that moment of the interview, Jason Bateman, David Cross,

1194
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:22,460
and Tony Hale all had moments where they seemed more concerned about repairing Jeffrey Tambor's

1195
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:27,980
reputation than giving Walter the space she needed to tell her story about what happened.

1196
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:32,700
Although Walter herself was ready to move on, there was significant backlash to the interview.

1197
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,740
Jason Bateman, David Cross, and Tony Hale all issued apologies. Bateman's apology on Twitter

1198
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,580
was particularly frank, saying,

1199
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:43,740
I was so eager to let Jeffrey know that he was supported in an attempt to learn, grow,

1200
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:48,700
and apologize that I completely underestimated the feelings of the victim, another person I deeply

1201
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,940
love. And she was sitting right there. I'm incredibly embarrassed and deeply sorry to have

1202
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:57,900
done that to Jessica. This is a big learning moment for me. There's never any excuse for

1203
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:03,420
abuse in any form from any gender, and the victim's voice needs to be heard and respected.

1204
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:07,740
In response to a greater understanding of the incident, Hurwitz said in an interview,

1205
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:13,180
I realize now I clearly misread the situation, given how Jessica has revealed she felt about it.

1206
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,380
There was more to it than I realized, and it's not my place to opine about what I believe was the

1207
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:23,100
weight of it. I misinterpreted what I understood to have played out, and more importantly, the depth

1208
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:28,300
of Jessica's pain about it. I felt so bad about that. I feel bad because I love these people.

1209
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:32,620
I feel bad for very personal reasons. And because I had been viewing this through the lens of a

1210
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:38,380
family member who assumed that any discord, regardless of who was upset with who, existed

1211
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:42,540
within the context of a family that cared about each other. And that was a mistake.

1212
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:46,860
Of course we were at work, and we're not really related. That's why we have different last names,

1213
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:51,980
and I wish I'd known or made a greater effort to know the pain it caused. Speaking to Vice a few

1214
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:56,780
weeks later, Aaliyah Shawkat, the only person in the interview who seemed to intervene on behalf

1215
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:01,180
of Jessica, offered more reflections on the incident. I looked at Jessica and I could see

1216
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:05,820
how it was sitting with her, and it wasn't good. She comes in and she tries to speak for a little

1217
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:11,340
while, and again they keep going. In that room, when I look back on it, I wish I was able to

1218
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:16,780
gather myself to not be afraid to speak out war and realize that I wouldn't be hurting anybody,

1219
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:21,580
but actually helping. I know I said a little, but what I wish I had said was,

1220
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:27,980
stop talking, stop, Jessica, go on. There's a lot of men who have not been accused of anything that

1221
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:32,700
haven't taken the time to think about this. What's more important to me is that these men,

1222
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:36,620
whether they've been accused of anything or not, need to start looking at this movement and

1223
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:41,580
realizing it has a lot to do with them. I hope that the guys on the show and now all these men

1224
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:46,140
of all different ages start to communicate with the women in their lives, the women they work with,

1225
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:51,820
and just ask openly with no shame, what can I do to be better? One response to the interview,

1226
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:57,020
from Linda Holmes writing for NPR, cut to the heart of why this particular interview managed

1227
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:02,300
to resonate so strongly. It's not the worst story, not by a mile. It may not even be Tambor's

1228
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:07,420
worst story, but seeing a woman so brilliant withstand repeated efforts by people who say

1229
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:14,060
they love her to recast her experiences as normal when she knew they were not, it was a lot to take.

1230
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:18,940
It should also be mentioned that Jessica Walter never stepped forward with her story of her own

1231
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:24,300
will. It was revealed by Jeffrey Tambor and she was then forced to comment on it directly herself.

1232
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:29,260
Whether it was a positive story or not, it really is their own personal right to tell their story,

1233
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:33,820
including whether or not they want to share it at all. The incidents regarding Tambor were not the

1234
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:38,220
only popular subjects that came up during the press tour though. Many connections had been made

1235
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:42,700
between the Blue family and the Trump family at the time. A group of immoral developers, one of

1236
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:47,020
whom was running for office with a slogan about building a wall in the southern border, the

1237
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:51,180
connection was pretty clear and the show wasn't going to pretend it didn't exist. This was also

1238
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:56,060
seen as a way for bringing Arrested Development back to its roots, making it the way it once was.

1239
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,460
In another interview Hurwitz elaborated saying,

1240
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:02,620
nobody has quite dealt with the mess they've made. It makes me think of what was going on with

1241
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:07,020
America. We're all growing. We're finally having an African-American president. We're finally

1242
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:11,740
acknowledging transgender people and allowing gay marriage. And then it's like, no, let's pretend

1243
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:16,220
none of that happened. Let's just go back to what it was. It's just easier. So that's a big

1244
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:22,060
undercurrent in this. He laughs. Which is also funny because it's what the fans want. Just go back.

1245
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:27,260
Make it great again. Make Arrested Greedy again. One other change that would face the fifth season

1246
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:32,460
of Arrested Development was the absence of Portia de Rossi. In 2017, at her request,

1247
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,660
she was written off the series scandal and had intended to step away from acting entirely to

1248
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:43,020
focus on her new business, an art curation and publication company called General Public. However,

1249
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:48,140
she did make an exception for Arrested Development. Although her appearance would be very limited,

1250
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:52,540
only appearing in a handful of episodes, making her storyline of running for Congress far less

1251
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:57,340
prominent than originally planned. The lead in to the fifth season didn't generate nearly as

1252
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:01,340
much buzz as the fourth season. The atmosphere around the show was almost a night and day

1253
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:11,340
difference heading into the fifth season premiere. Because of its connection to the previous season,

1254
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:16,780
there are quite a few recaps in the early episodes of season five. The first episode opens with four

1255
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,500
minutes worth of them. Although season five was an attempt to return Arrested Development to its

1256
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:26,780
earlier formula, it did carry over the idea of a season-long narrative that season four used. The

1257
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:31,500
first three seasons have arcs that lasted multiple episodes, but they were often discrete and not part

1258
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,900
of a larger narrative that many of the arcs in season four and five were. It makes for a more

1259
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:41,180
cohesive experience, though it does cost the show some of the manic energy of those earlier seasons.

1260
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:46,540
The attempt to shift back to an earlier format and not being able to get there reflects a major theme

1261
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:51,580
through the season, feelings of regret of trying to recapture the past. After being punched in the

1262
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:56,780
face by his son, the dynamic between them now carries the implicit threat of violence.

1263
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:14,540
The uniquely American character of the Bluths is reflected in George Michael's trip to Mexico,

1264
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:17,500
made comfortable with how Americanized the country is.

1265
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:30,620
To make it even more explicit, the show also makes direct references to the U.S. government.

1266
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:45,420
The Obama call-out, at a time when the Trump administration was being criticized for its border

1267
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:50,380
policy, is especially clever. It reveals how partisanship blinds people to the cruelty that

1268
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:56,060
is consistent in American policies towards its southern border, regardless of the party and power.

1269
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:01,260
One side may be worse, but neither is good. In that way, the show is critiquing the right-wing

1270
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:06,300
shift in American politics and the response to it during the Trump years. Going back to the way

1271
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:11,820
things were isn't enough of a correction. People need to demand genuine political change, or as seen

1272
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:16,300
in the case of Maybee, take matters into their own hands the way she did and start helping out

1273
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:21,660
directly. Not that Maybee really sticks with it. One thing that the show is very quick to remind

1274
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:26,860
people of is that the Bluths will never be our saviors, even though they certainly project the

1275
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:39,580
idea that they've grown. But their left-wing politics are entirely performative.

1276
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:58,460
This is being used to criticize a narrative that was being built at the time. The Bluths

1277
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:03,340
represent conservatives who were, supposedly, turning into liberals as a response to the

1278
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:08,460
hard-right turn of the Republican Party. The show is revealing these people, like the Bluths,

1279
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:14,140
to be grifters cynically using the Trump backlash liberals express to accrue power for themselves,

1280
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:18,380
acting the part of a sensitive, caring family while literally building a wall on the southern

1281
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:23,180
border. These are people who feed on the politics of hate. And to nail this point home, we see

1282
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:28,700
Lindsay lean into the cruelty once Maybee, her campaign manager, realizes it plays well to a

1283
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:43,820
certain part of the electorate. And just like that, the liberal posturing fades away when there's

1284
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:48,460
an opportunity to seize real power. It isn't that the Bluths find someone like Donald Trump

1285
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:52,940
objectionable. As former pals with the Bush administration, they just don't like the idea

1286
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:57,660
of another odious person taking the party from them. This cynical form of politics, where people

1287
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:02,140
are motivated to vote through hatred, either towards a group of people or a political candidate,

1288
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:07,340
is highlighted when Debris, posing as Lindsay during a parade, wears a sheet because of her

1289
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:27,100
anxiety. Arrested development is taking a very hard stance against the politics of hate,

1290
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:32,540
and how it exists across the electoral spectrum. Rather than simply admonish the Bluths entirely,

1291
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:37,260
the season does offer an interesting insight into why that family is so broken.

1292
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:41,660
It's foreshadowed early on when Tobias has some surprisingly wise words for Lucille.

1293
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:59,100
In the second half of the season, we go back in time to get an idea of where some of this hurt

1294
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:03,900
comes from. We see the Bluths in their summer home, back when Job, Michael, Lindsay, and Buster

1295
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:20,140
were all children. We also meet Grandma Mimi, played by Jean Smart, who reveals where Lucille

1296
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:32,300
got her mean streak. The younger Lucille is played by Cobie Smulders. These scenes set in the past

1297
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:37,580
unfolded the episode surrounding Buster's trial, as he's the top suspect in the murder of Lucille,

1298
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:47,660
too. There's a subtle hint that the jury is turning against him. Luckily, one surprise witness

1299
01:40:47,660 --> 01:41:05,580
starts to turn the trial on its head. Jean's testimony did not help Buster. The trial also

1300
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:10,700
reveals that the flashbacks we had seen in several episodes were actually a TV series being produced

1301
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:32,220
by Ron Howard based on the life of Buster and the death of Mimi. Although things look grim for

1302
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:37,180
Buster having been accused of murdering his grandmother and Lucille, too, Michael, fulfilling

1303
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:53,020
his dream of being a lawyer, manages to turn the whole thing around. In this moment, Michael is

1304
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:58,140
fulfilling his destiny of holding the Bluth family together, being the hero he always imagined himself

1305
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:17,420
to be by revealing himself to be a murderer. Michael's idea of himself as a hero, coupled

1306
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:22,780
with doing something monstrous, helps him reveal what it means to be a hero in the Bluth family,

1307
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:26,620
and that can be extended to reframe his domineering parenting of George Michael as

1308
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:31,580
monstrous as well. He treats his son the way his father treated him, thinking he was a hero

1309
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:37,260
doing it the whole time. So while George Michael consistently resists his father, Michael tries to

1310
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:42,540
hold his son even closer. George Michael struggles to create distance and hold on to his family

1311
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:47,820
identity, wanting to stay connected in this relationship that's shaping him into someone

1312
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,820
more like his father than he'd like to admit.

1313
01:42:56,620 --> 01:43:06,460
Michael and George Michael finally decide to settle things.

1314
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:22,140
Except this is a scheme, too, because if there's one thing the Bluths excel at, it's scheming.

1315
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:41,260
George Michael and Michael have learned to work together, not against one another,

1316
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,740
and while that still takes the shape of being Bluths, screwing over some other people,

1317
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:49,820
they seem to have made it work well enough that at least they aren't hurting each other,

1318
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:55,100
and maybe by trusting each other they can start to rebuild their lives into something better.

1319
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:59,820
And in the finale we find out the truth about Lindsay's parents. She's actually Lucille's

1320
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:19,100
half-sister. And as it looks like the family is coming together, Michael and George Michael do

1321
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:23,420
what they do best, and that's take-off. And it wasn't Michael that killed Lucille, too. That

1322
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:34,460
was Buster. And that's how season 5 came to an end. Plotlines colliding, traditions being

1323
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:39,260
upheld, and a stark reminder that the Bluths are everything that's bad with America. We don't get

1324
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:44,540
a tease for the next season, there is no epilogue, and there are no other signs we might see the

1325
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:50,780
Bluths once again in the future. Just a stair car exiting stage left, leaving Sudden Valley,

1326
01:44:50,780 --> 01:45:00,860
perhaps forever. The fifth season of Arrested Development did not receive nearly as much

1327
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:06,860
attention as the fourth, and was similarly not as passionately hated or appreciated. Although the

1328
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:11,260
interview in the New York Times got a lot of attention, that didn't translate to people

1329
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:16,460
talking about the show's return very much. The content of the show didn't do much to help,

1330
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:21,980
while it may not have been bad, and in some ways it was pretty good. It was clear that the show

1331
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,900
wasn't going to have the impact it once did, and while it was clever to weave that into the

1332
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:31,260
narrative, it may not have come together as well as had been intended. In the third episode of the

1333
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:35,500
fifth season, there's a reference to a very old internet meme, the Star Wars Kid.

1334
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:48,060
This was referenced in the original run of Arrested Development, as well as the season

1335
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:54,460
for revival. Not only is this joke now 16 years old being an internet meme, it feels even more

1336
01:45:54,460 --> 01:46:00,140
dated. Arrested Development is similarly starting to feel tired. While I appreciate a long-running

1337
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:05,820
gag as much as anyone, even Jean Parmesan, not every joke is built to last, and comedy is

1338
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:11,500
infamous for aging poorly. The Star Wars Kid joke, for example, is not just an early meme,

1339
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:16,380
but one of the first major incidents of a teen being bullied by the internet. The poor kid's

1340
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:21,180
life got turned upside down because a video that was posted by someone else made him a laughing

1341
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:25,900
stock. While in some ways the series was fairly good about growing over time and discarding some

1342
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:31,020
of its more controversial material, there were still moments like this that really made the show

1343
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:36,860
feel trapped in the past, and all for preserving a cruel joke that was long past its expiration

1344
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:41,580
date. More than a stale joke, the series itself felt like it was treading water. The Bluths are

1345
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:46,620
terrible people, and it's an intergenerational phenomena that can be extrapolated to the American

1346
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:52,300
experience. Lovely, but does it need to return every five years to deliver that message again?

1347
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:57,180
The fifth season is, of course, not irredeemable. The political commentary was sharp, the Michael

1348
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,820
and George Michael story did take some interesting steps forward, and there were some genuine laughs

1349
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:06,780
to be had. But as a show, it struggled to capture anyone's attention, as can be seen in much of the

1350
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:11,740
audience's reaction. In an article for The Verge, Keith Phipps summed it up nicely, saying,

1351
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:16,860
Arrested Development was once a special show, now it's a show struggling to remind viewers why

1352
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:22,540
it's special. This raises the important question, is this the end for Arrested Development? In an

1353
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:28,060
interview, Mitch Hurwitz expressed a desire to do more. Here's an excerpt from a 2018 article.

1354
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:33,340
It flows so easily out of this cast. It's hard not to want to do more. It may be another epic

1355
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:38,540
way. We've always been underdogs, he says. Nobody ever got cocky. Really, we're all still

1356
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:44,140
trust-trying so hard. So actually, the every few years thing works great for me, because it's hard

1357
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:49,660
to get a laugh through to that screen. The cast was less committed, though Will Arnett offered an

1358
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:59,340
interesting perspective, saying, Mitch has written out versions where each one of us is the last

1359
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,660
person, depending on who lasted the longest. And I predict it will be me. Yeah, I'm gonna

1360
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:08,620
outlive everyone. David Cross, speaking on a podcast, seemed less convinced that the show

1361
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:13,180
would ever return. In particular, he cited the challenging work schedule and the hardship of it

1362
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:18,060
on the cast. Now, you can definitively say it's over. It's over. How do you know that?

1363
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:27,900
I know. Yeah, we didn't have full scripts. It was a terrible way for actors to try to do what they

1364
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:34,380
do. And there were a lot of frustrations early on. The shoot kept extending. You're asking a

1365
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:40,300
lot of people, and especially older people, who just don't have the physical stamina that some

1366
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:48,140
younger cast and crew do. And it led to some tensions, and it was a very bad way to

1367
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:53,980
work. David Cross also said he believed the show was over back in 2010, though clearly,

1368
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:59,500
Fate had other plans for the show. Sadly, this time it seems like Fate took another turn,

1369
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:04,940
and it's unlikely that Arrested Development will return, or at least, it can never be the same show

1370
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:13,580
again. Jason Bateman's career trajectory changed completely after Arrested Development ended its

1371
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:18,860
third season. He went from appearing in sitcom pilots destined to fail to appearing in big-budget

1372
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:24,940
movies such as Horrible Bosses, Hancock, and Zootopia. Most notably, he starred in and directed

1373
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:31,740
several episodes of the Netflix series Ozark. Will Arnett's career experienced a big boost

1374
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:36,780
after appearing on the show, going on to appear in movies and TV shows, though perhaps it's voice

1375
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:41,980
work that's given him the most acclaim, having starred in Bojack Horseman and portrayed Lego

1376
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:47,420
Batman in multiple Lego movies. Portia de Rossi would go on to appear on the shows Better Off

1377
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:52,620
Ted, Niptuck, and Scandal, though as mentioned earlier, she would leave acting in 2018 and is

1378
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:58,140
now currently focusing on her new business venture, General Public. Michael Cera starred in the movies

1379
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:03,580
Superbad, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Juno, and a host of other projects that needed an awkward

1380
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:08,860
teen boy. In many ways, his style of teenage boy became a trend in the 2000s. Most recently,

1381
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:14,300
he voiced Hank in the movie Paws of Fury, The Legend of Hank. Aaliyah Shawkat has been very

1382
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,860
prolific since Arrested Development gave her career its first big break. She's appeared

1383
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:23,900
in dozens of TV shows and movies, most recently starring in the series Search Party, which ended

1384
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:29,580
its fifth season in early 2022. Tony Hale would appear in a number of projects after Arrested

1385
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:34,140
Development changed his career, including a lengthy run on the series Veep. Most recently,

1386
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:39,420
he's appeared in Hocus Pocus 2 and done voice work for the Harley Quinn TV series. Jeffrey

1387
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:44,700
Tambor's career has come to a halt after he was fired from Transparent for allegedly sexually

1388
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:50,060
harassing several of the women who worked on the production. Jessica Walter would take on another

1389
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:55,500
Lucille Bluth-esque role as Mallory Archer on the show Archer. In interviews promoting the

1390
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:00,220
fifth season of Arrested Development, when asked if she would return to the show, she believed that

1391
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:05,660
within five years she would be too old to keep acting. Sadly, she would only be around for

1392
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:12,860
another three. She plastered away in her sleep on March 24, 2021. Classic is a term that's given

1393
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:18,860
to a work of art that either has or is expected to pass the test of time. Remembered well after

1394
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:24,060
its debut and often outliving the artist or artists who created it. Arrested Development

1395
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:28,700
had the immense advantage of achieving a cult's status amongst a passionate viewership and critics

1396
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:34,380
with its first three seasons. In 2012, its position as a classic might have been guaranteed,

1397
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:40,460
depending on who you asked, but its divisive return in 2013 and its less-noticed return in 2018

1398
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:46,300
have complicated that confidence in its classic status. Art isn't created in a vacuum, and it's

1399
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:51,580
through influencing new art that older works are often remembered, and by being remembered,

1400
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:56,540
become more likely to be thought of as a classic. So in that sense, those are the viewers who may

1401
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:01,580
matter the most. Arrested Development will be remembered as a great work of art by being

1402
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,580
remembered by artists who will go on to create great works of art of their own,

1403
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:12,140
creating a vast tapestry of classic television. Arrested Development may or may not be over,

1404
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:16,860
or at the very least, if it comes back, it certainly can't be the same without Jessica

1405
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:22,060
Walter. But its status as a classic doesn't seem to be under a serious threat. It may speak to the

1406
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:26,060
strength of the original three seasons, but perhaps more importantly, it speaks to the

1407
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:30,220
strength of the memory of those seasons in the minds that made the show a classic.

1408
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:37,820
Can you tell that this video took nearly seven hours to record? Yeah, it's one of my longest ever,

1409
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:44,620
and it was a challenge writing something this big for a show that didn't even last 100 episodes.

1410
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:50,060
All of this coming together in one big package. I really hope it is good and people enjoyed it.

1411
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:53,180
If you are someone who enjoyed it and you're thinking, I'd like to see more of those,

1412
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,220
well, I've got a bunch of other TV show retrospectives you can check out,

1413
01:52:56,220 --> 01:53:01,020
and you can also make sure I keep making more in the future by supporting this channel financially.

1414
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:05,660
You can become a patron or a member, and you'll get your name floating up the screen, like all

1415
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:10,700
these lovely people here. In addition to that, you'll get early access to new videos as I make

1416
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:15,580
them, plus other fun extras that I throw in every now and again. If you would like to support the

1417
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:20,940
channel in a non-monetary fashion though, you can do that by liking, commenting, and subscribing if

1418
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:25,340
you haven't already, and do hit the bell for notifications. I want to thank everyone so much

1419
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:31,180
for watching all the way until the end, and this was a real challenge to narrate, and I

1420
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:34,300
want to ask Ron Howard, how do you think I did?

1421
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,540
Real shoddy narrating, just pure crap.

1422
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,940
F*** you, Ron.
