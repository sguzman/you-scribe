1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
In 2009, James O'Keefe hoodwinked a number of media outlets, activists, and politicians

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,980
when he circulated recordings he had secretly made of employees working at Acorn.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,000
In the recordings, a disguised O'Keefe and his associate, Hannah Giles, got advice on

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,240
everything from how to avoid paying a pimp to effectively trafficking children across

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,520
the US-Mexico border.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,720
What O'Keefe kept secret is that this footage was heavily edited and completely misrepresents

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,440
the discussions he had.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,920
The Acorn workers, in many cases, were simply playing along with O'Keefe, and after the

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,600
conversations alerted police to his activities, they weren't actively giving advice to criminals.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,720
Unfortunately, the doctored tapes were enough to convince conservative media outlets that

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,440
Acorn was an agency committed to helping child traffickers and street pimps.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,640
The backlash was enough to scare the US Census Bureau and the IRS into terminating their

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,300
contracts with Acorn.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,460
By November of 2010, Acorn had to liquidate all of its assets and closed up for good.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,640
How did this deceptive footage convince so many people?

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,300
And how did a phony journalist like O'Keefe seem so credible?

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,160
The hidden camera tactic has long been a favorite of news outlets, and the O'Keefe tapes cashed

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,320
in on that well-accepted strategy.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,080
By adopting the appearance of a genuine journalist, he was able to falsify a degree of credibility

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,200
he never had and advance his particular conservative agenda.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
In this case, shutting down a non-profit that helped register voters in low and moderate

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
income neighborhoods.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Pretending to be a reporter covering a story is the perfect disguise for anyone who has

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,280
an agenda to push.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,860
They simply need to look the part and engage what appears to be journalism, all the while

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,120
leaving out facts, editing out context, and providing commentary that distorts reality

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
to fit their worldview.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,240
And that brings us to Lauren Southern.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Lauren's Southern is a great example of someone creating narrative-driven pseudo-journalism

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,900
that poisons our understanding of the world.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,220
In demonstrating how this type of pseudo-journalism works, I want to take a quick trip through

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,040
Southern's career and the many tactics she's employed to push her particular narrative.

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,820
That narrative being a mix of nationalism, white victimhood, and a desire to pull the

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,120
Western world back to the 1950s.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
But to understand where Southern came from, we have to talk about the Toronto Sun.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,040
This daily newspaper launched in Toronto in 1971 and became a prominent voice for conservative

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
news in the city.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,260
A tabloid both in its format and content, the Toronto Sun eventually spread to television.

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,720
The cable news channel, The Sun News Network, launched in 2011.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,240
Its format was similar to Fox News, where it had reporting on during the day and commentary

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
on in the evening.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:01,320
The channel did not do well.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,440
In three years, it lost $46.7 million dollars Canadian, and by 2015, it went off the air.

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,480
But the story of the conservative channel didn't end there.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
One of the personalities of The Sun News Network was a conservative commentator named Ezrilevant,

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
the nationally known champion of free speech.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,960
For those who don't know, Ezrilevant is a cheery fellow who is best known across Canada

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,580
for his defense of free speech, most notably when he has to defend his own free speech

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,320
when he sued for libel or when he sues newspapers for publishing the details of the horrible

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,560
things he says.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Three days after Sun News Network was shut down, Ezrilevant launched the YouTube channel,

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
The Rebel Media.

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
The Rebel Media has been home to many odious faces, such as white genocide conspiracy theorist

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,880
Faith Goldie, white genocide conspiracy theorist Gavin McInnes, and great replacement conspiracy

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
theorist Lawrence Southern.

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
The great replacement is a code word for white genocide.

57
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,640
For the record, all three of these people have left The Rebel Media, but it was the

58
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,160
platform that propelled them into the limelight.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,400
So it's important to know to understand why we have these characters running around making

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,320
the world a generally shittier place.

61
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,720
Which brings us back to Lawrence Southern, who was recruited by Levant when he noticed

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400
her at a conference he had organized.

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Levant was apparently impressed by the tough questions she was asking during a panel discussion,

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,120
and later on he gave her a spot with The Rebel Media when it opened.

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,560
In time, she became one of the YouTube channel's biggest stars, appearing in incredibly successful

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,160
videos that, at first glance, have the appearance of journalism.

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,280
Until you look a little closer.

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,640
Lawrence Southern made her big internet debut in June of 2015, when she starred in a video

69
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,960
titled Lauren Southern Clashes with Feminists at Slutwalk.

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Filmed at a Slutwalk in Vancouver, British Columbia, the video features Southern breathlessly

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,000
walking around asking questions of the participants, a tactic you often see used by real journalists

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,400
on a wide number of different outlets.

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,200
But much like the undercover O'Keefe tapes, copying the style of real journalists doesn't

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
make what you're producing real journalism.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,960
For an example of real journalism, of the on-the-ground variety, here's a video covering

76
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,800
the Umbrella Revolution protests of 2014 in Hong Kong, as reported by Phoebe Greenwood

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
for The Guardian.

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,960
This is Admiralty in Hong Kong.

79
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,360
It is the heart of the Umbrella Movement, which is now in its seventh day.

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,200
Tens of thousands of people have come to the streets here, asking Beijing to allow them

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,680
a greater democratic say in who leads them.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
It's an extraordinarily peaceful movement.

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,840
It's perhaps the most polite bunch of protesters I've ever come across, but tonight is the

84
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,300
deadline that they've given the chief executive, C. Y. Leung, to resign.

85
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,480
No one here really thinks that he will, but no one here really knows what will happen

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
if he doesn't.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, this is a great opening.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,040
Greenwood presents the video of the protesters and provides some context for why the protest

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
is happening.

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,280
You really feel like you just learned something about the politics of Hong Kong and the people

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
who live there, and all of that's just in the opener.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,180
Now, let's compare this to Lauren Southern's supposed report on the 2015 Vancouver Slut

93
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
Walk.

94
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,920
Hello, it's Lauren Southern here with Rebel, and I've just gotten a huge confrontation

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,040
with the Slut Walk, which we are following right now.

96
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,800
Essentially, I held a sign that said, we are not living in a rape culture in the West,

97
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
which we are not.

98
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,960
It is intellectually dishonest to think that we are living in a rape culture.

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,680
Rapists do happen, but the majority or the minority, the vast minority of men and women

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
are rapists.

101
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,360
And when we do find out they're rapists, they go to prison, they are punished.

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Whereas in the third world countries and other places, men can get away with rape there.

103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,640
And it's insane to focus on this one issue and say that we are living in a rape culture.

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Rapists don't get high fives.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,160
We don't have the government funding rapists.

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,120
And men get fired from their jobs just for making rape jokes.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
Not even raping.

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,600
So to say we live in a rape culture is quite frankly ridiculous.

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,340
All right, let's go follow the walk.

110
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,560
So there's a difference here.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,160
Southern immediately begins talking about herself and how her counter-protest wasn't

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,680
warmly met.

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,180
Southern also makes no effort to explain why the Slut Walk is happening or what the stated

114
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,560
goals of the organizers are.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,020
He bare minimum when introducing a subject.

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,260
He instead launches into a response about how wrong they are.

117
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,420
A reporter not believing the claims of protesters is fine.

118
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,960
But they have to first present the claims of the protesters, expanding on what protesters

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,260
mean when they say rape culture and addressing criticisms to that explanation is far more

120
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,260
useful than responding to what the reporter imagines they mean.

121
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,780
Back to the Greenwood example.

122
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,820
I really like this little snippet.

123
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,940
Ah, you're recycling.

124
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,780
You don't think violence can help us in any way?

125
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,500
But recycling bottles can.

126
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,180
Um, sort of.

127
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,540
Now this question seems almost superfluous, but what it's subtly doing is presenting

128
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,200
the innocence and perhaps naivete of the protesters.

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,020
It could be interpreted as a subtextual criticism in expecting the notoriously anti-democratic

130
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,460
Chinese federal government to respect the demands of the citizens of Hong Kong.

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,860
But it also shows the importance of hope in a protest movement and the earnestness of

132
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,180
the people involved.

133
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,460
It's a simple question and a simple response, but it tells you quite a bit about the people

134
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
there.

135
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,940
Now contrast this with the segment in the rebel media clip.

136
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,420
Well, how do you believe your outfit is going to stop perpetuating rape culture?

137
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
It's my body.

138
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
It's my choice.

139
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
I can wear what I want.

140
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
And it shouldn't.

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,340
This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene, like wearing the caution tape that they would

142
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,500
normally put around a physical crime scene with when it's not regarding a person, but

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,780
regarding me.

144
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Regarding people, it's not considered a crime scene, that's f***ed up.

145
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
It should be.

146
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
It's a violation of a person's rights.

147
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,380
So is this stopping rapes?

148
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,940
Now this exchange was generally a train wreck, and it ended with a terrible loaded question.

149
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,940
For those who aren't aware of what a loaded question is, it's one that often includes

150
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,380
an unfair assumption.

151
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,580
A popular example is if you ask someone, when did you stop beating your wife?

152
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,740
The assumption in the question is that the person being asked abuses their wife.

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,180
Being someone is your outfit stopping rapes, includes the assumption someone is dressing

154
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,180
up to change the action of rapists.

155
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,860
That's not why this woman is dressed up.

156
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,460
She'll tell you why she dressed up.

157
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,660
In fact, she did.

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,300
Right before you ask that question.

159
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
It's my body.

160
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
It's my choice.

161
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
I can wear what I want.

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
And it shouldn't.

163
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,540
This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene.

164
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,380
If someone believes a rape culture is failing victims of rape and sexual assault, and providing

165
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,740
cover for abusers and rapists, generating conversation would be a good way to address

166
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,100
that problem.

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,660
This is a conversation Southern could have actually engaged in, but she wasn't listening.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,220
She was more interested in asking a question that made her subject look silly.

169
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,500
She didn't attend this protest report on the sled walk.

170
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,460
She came to push an agenda.

171
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,420
But I want to highlight this delicious little moment that happens immediately afterwards

172
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,180
when another member of the sled walk confronts Southern with some heavy facts.

173
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm going to play the whole exchange because it's just great.

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,580
Any stats to back up anything that you've said this afternoon?

175
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Absolutely.

176
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,060
You said that rapists go to jail.

177
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,580
Can you give me a stat to back that up based on the number of rapes that are reported,

178
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,180
the number of rapes that get taken to the cops, the number of rapes that get prosecuted?

179
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,980
Could you give me some stats to back up your pseudo reporting here?

180
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, first of all, out of the amount of rapes that happen out of 100,000 people, 1.7 of

181
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,900
Canadians actually even just that's just reporting rapes.

182
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,220
You know that less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.

183
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,620
Okay, where's that?

184
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,620
To the cops.

185
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,900
It's from all of the women's organizations.

186
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,260
You can look it up online.

187
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,940
You can find it through the socialized organizations that study rape.

188
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,460
I participate with an organization that works as a rape crisis center.

189
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,220
We base that on the number of calls.

190
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,380
The police know based on the unofficial reports, the third party reporting and the direct reports.

191
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,860
This is not a secret that about 10% of rapes are reported.

192
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,460
So how do you know 10% of rapes are reported if the others aren't?

193
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,620
Because those people call the women's centers, they ask for help, they seek medical attention.

194
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
So they are reported.

195
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,580
And the segment ends with a response that's a bit of a gotcha that really just proves

196
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,860
Southern isn't really engaging with what the person is saying.

197
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,340
It basically evaded all of that useful information the woman in sunglasses gave.

198
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,820
Look at the first thing she says.

199
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,700
Less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.

200
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,260
Okay, where's that?

201
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,300
To the cops.

202
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,340
And then she goes on to mention all the other avenues in which rape is reported.

203
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,620
So they are reported.

204
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,900
The two police part is the crucial difference here.

205
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,060
A rape can't be prosecuted unless it's reported to the police.

206
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,020
This woman is giving you evidence and a clear claim as to why police aren't hearing about

207
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,740
the vast majority of rapes out there.

208
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,140
Southern is either refusing to engage with the person she's interviewing or simply can't

209
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,020
understand the point the woman in sunglasses is making.

210
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,900
The last third of this video is dedicated to Southern's counter-protest and the response

211
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,980
it generated.

212
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,500
This is perhaps the most ridiculous part of the video.

213
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,980
If you're truly there to report on something, how can you justify starting a second demonstration?

214
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,620
You're no longer covering the story, you're part of the story.

215
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,820
She ends the segment the same way it began, and nothing was learned.

216
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,700
This video wasn't successfully reporting anything.

217
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,980
Its only accomplishment was making Lauren Southern an internet star who advances a right-wing

218
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,140
agenda.

219
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Take a look at how CBC News in Vancouver covered the story.

220
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,900
And apologies for the quality, I got this off the channel of someone who doesn't know

221
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
how to capture footage off a TV.

222
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,580
Dozens gathered in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery this afternoon.

223
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,860
Their hope was to raise awareness of victim blaming around sexual assault, many holding

224
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,060
signs carrying messages about rape culture, a problem the group says is pervasive in our

225
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,300
society.

226
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,020
The things went sideways when one woman arrived with a message of her own.

227
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:32,540
So, the story that was about the Slut Walk became a story about Lauren Southern, or

228
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,740
as the CBC reported, one woman.

229
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,180
I have to imagine this is something Southern either intended, or something she takes pride

230
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,180
in.

231
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,420
Overall, I got the poorly captured video from her YouTube channel.

232
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,660
This pattern of dreadful on the ground pseudo reporting continued through much of Southern's

233
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
early career.

234
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,820
She went to another Slut Walk in Edmonton, a third in Los Angeles, and no valuable reporting

235
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
happens.

236
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,380
She tries to capture protesters with poorly thought-out loaded questions, and she goes

237
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,820
the extra mile to make sure we always know how poorly she's being treated.

238
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,800
Our cameraman got shoved and pushed, my sign was ripped up, and I got a few middle fingers

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,680
and got called a bitch.

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,640
She always underscores how she feels afraid or frightened, and that the people she disagrees

241
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,160
with aren't just people she disagrees with, they're people who are, in some way, rude

242
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,660
or physically dangerous.

243
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,680
In other words, she's undermined their arguments by attacking their supposedly boorish characters.

244
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
That said, there is some unintentional comedy here.

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,600
This time, they did know who I was and did not want to speak to me because of that, so

246
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,080
they kept saying she's not a real reporter and don't talk to her.

247
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,620
They were right.

248
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,240
Someone who goes to a protest, holds up a sign countering their message, and then asks

249
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,640
them loaded questions on camera to make them look silly isn't a reporter, they're someone

250
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,880
with an agenda, someone who is desperately trying to make their political opponents look

251
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,760
terrible.

252
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,160
Before we move on, I want to provide a little bit of extra context here.

253
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,020
The Slutwalks began in 2011 in Toronto as a response to the comments of Toronto Police

254
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,440
Constable Michael Sanguinetti.

255
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,840
He was addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum and said,

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,320
I've been told I'm not supposed to say this.

257
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
However, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.

258
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,080
The public was justifiably concerned that some officers were blaming the victims of

259
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,920
sexual assault, and to voice their displeasure, the first Slutwalk was held in Toronto on

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
April 3rd, 2011.

261
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,000
These demonstrations quickly spread across Canada and through the United States.

262
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,480
And there you go, you just learned more in the last 30 seconds about why the Slutwalk

263
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,680
was happening than in a half hour's worth of Southern's pseudo-reporting.

264
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Also I should give a little more credit to the woman in sunglasses because as far as

265
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,120
I know, she was the first one to ever refer to Lauren Souther's work as

266
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
your pseudo-reporting here.

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,600
When Southern added context to her videos, perhaps portraying the views of protesters

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,200
in their oral words rather than trying to trap them with loaded questions, Southern

269
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,080
could have engaged with them honestly rather than trying to shape them into the strawman

270
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,040
she was more comfortable tackling.

271
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,240
By not sharing this information with her audience, Lauren Southern is presenting the protesters

272
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,080
as a bunch of eccentric weirdos who have spontaneously decided we live in a rape culture.

273
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,880
And that's the whole point of why the video was made in the first place.

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,880
It's not to report on the event as it happens, but to distort the event to fit a right-wing

275
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,960
narrative through a deceptive omission of facts.

276
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,460
Southern moved away from covering protests in North America and took her grand circus

277
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,240
to Europe for more pseudo-reporting.

278
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,920
This time it was on something she was even less qualified to cover, the role of immigration

279
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,360
in Europe.

280
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,200
Southern's video about a demonstration in London campaigning to remain in the EU is

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,320
titled Lauren Southern Attacked by Anti-Fascist Thugs in London.

282
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,440
And to be honest, the title gives away everything that's wrong with this video.

283
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,840
This isn't, as the description claims, Lauren Southern reporting for The Rebel Media.

284
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,480
This is a video about Lauren Southern being attacked by supposed thugs.

285
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,600
The video opens with text.

286
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,840
Not about the demonstration, but about how Southern was in danger at the rally.

287
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,640
The first images we see are of a camera pointed at the ground as the cameraman tries to orient

288
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
himself.

289
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,200
The rest of the video is a garbled mess, and it creates the impression that as soon as

290
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Southern showed up, things got messy and violent.

291
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,280
Now this is a real problem if you're a journalist.

292
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,920
How do you cover an event that includes a hostile element?

293
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,240
If you step into an area and get immediately attacked, you might need to rethink your strategy

294
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,520
and maybe find a go-between or maybe you have to reach out to people indirectly to get their

295
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,180
comments and opinions.

296
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,300
But I did leave out an important fact there.

297
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Southern's crew didn't get attacked as soon as they entered the park.

298
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,260
I know this for a fact because a few days later, The Rebel Media uploaded a video titled

299
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,620
Full Length Version.

300
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,660
Lower and Southern attacked by anti-fascists at London Brexit Rally.

301
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,380
There are two problems with this title, aside from the fact that it's schlocky clickbait.

302
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,940
It isn't the full length version of events because it's missing about a minute that

303
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,740
was included in the first video.

304
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,140
Also, it's not a Brexit rally, it was a rally against the Brexit movement.

305
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,180
A small detail, but a sloppy mistake nonetheless.

306
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,500
What's far more interesting is how this video opens where we hear Southern describing

307
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,700
her strategy for covering this rally.

308
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,380
I literally don't even have to interview anyone, I can just stand here and it exposes

309
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,940
what this group is like.

310
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,620
That's a damning thing for a journalist to say.

311
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,100
And more damning, Southern freely admits to not having interviewed a person the whole

312
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
time she was there.

313
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,300
Of course, she doesn't literally mean she hasn't talked to anyone because there's

314
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,820
some footage of her talking to a guy who went up and took her hat and threw it in the garbage.

315
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,940
He shouldn't have done that, but it's a far cry from the impression the first video

316
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,500
gives you of Southern being attacked by anti-fascist thugs.

317
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,180
As best I can tell from the second video, Southern's strategy on covering this rally

318
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,260
was to stand around in a silly hat and make commentary about people while a cameraman

319
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,420
filmed them.

320
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,020
How can a supposed journalist justify describing the opinions and views of people around her

321
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,180
without taking a moment to speak to them?

322
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Even if all she has are her loaded questions, that's better than not talking to someone

323
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
who's only a few meters away from you.

324
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,060
Aside from the clown who stole her hat and a few heated confrontations, it's difficult

325
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,860
to see just how viciously Southern and her crew were actually attacked.

326
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,340
And speaking genuinely, it's a shame that some demonstrators weren't on their best

327
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,540
behavior.

328
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,780
But this doesn't for a second let us Southern, who's reporting amounted to her standing

329
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,740
around making fun of people and then acting surprised when people got upset.

330
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,300
While the first video got nearly 2 million views, this longer version struggled to get

331
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,340
even 70,000.

332
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,660
The rebel media put out the edited one for a reason, and the headline gives it away.

333
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,060
This was an honest reporting about the anti-Brexit protesters.

334
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,220
This was done purely to frame them as dangerous and violent.

335
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,580
The con of placing Lauren Southern in supposed danger is a pattern you'll see in many of

336
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,580
her videos.

337
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,980
There's always something that comes up in a video that scares her.

338
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,620
As another example, in her video, Why Lauren Southern Needed Security to Walk Through Mowland

339
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,540
Beak, Belgium, she begins to panic when her film crew gets stares while they wander around

340
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,060
at 11pm.

341
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,900
The idea that a woman with a camera crew, speaking English, wandering around the street

342
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,820
in the middle of the night, catching a few glances, doesn't seem particularly strange

343
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:49,060
to me.

344
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,740
Southern is clearly scared here.

345
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,220
It makes me wonder why she just didn't pack it in while there was still daylight.

346
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Filming at night is always harder because you need to lug around heavy lighting equipment,

347
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,140
and there aren't as many people around to speak to.

348
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,820
It's almost as if she was trying to manufacture a situation where it would look like she's

349
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
in danger.

350
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,500
Let's listen to what she says when she starts discussing people who don't want their faces

351
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,540
filmed.

352
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,820
This could suggest a number of things, but before you have any reasonable ideas like

353
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,420
maybe people just don't want to appear on camera and they're going about their day,

354
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:34,220
Southern is ready to speculate with something else, something less generous.

355
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,100
Without a grossly irresponsible bit of commentary, not wanting your face on camera doesn't make

356
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,580
someone a criminal.

357
00:21:40,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Does Southern have any reason to believe there's a crime issue in Mullenbeek?

358
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:11,860
Listen to what Southern said before she asked the guy the question.

359
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,580
Why did she decide to show this guy instead of the other people she mentions who say there's

360
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
no crime?

361
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,860
I'm not sure what gives this shopkeeper special knowledge of the situation, but wouldn't

362
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,740
actual crime statistics help here?

363
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,260
Here's a crazy idea, let's actually look at those.

364
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,140
According to the Brussels Institute for Statistics and Analysis, the total number of criminal

365
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:40,660
offenses in Mullenbeek actually went up in 2016 from 9,184 to 10,087.

366
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,380
An increase of about 10% isn't really a crime wave, and of course it should be noted that

367
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:52,380
it went back down in 2017 to 8,818, but this video is from 2016, so I'm not going to criticize

368
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,660
it for not knowing the future.

369
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,420
It's better to look at stats when they have a bit of context to them, so is Mullenbeek

370
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,740
especially dangerous as a neighborhood compared to other locations in Brussels?

371
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,120
A look at the numbers suggests no, definitely not.

372
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,200
With a population of 96,629 and a total number of crimes of 10,087, that works out to one

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,220
crime per 9.6 citizens, or as it might be more commonly presented, 1,044 crimes per

374
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
10,000 people.

375
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,820
Out of 19 neighborhoods in Brussels, Mullenbeek is ranked 6th as most crimes per capita.

376
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,140
So while it certainly isn't the safest place to be if you're in Brussels, there's no

377
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,460
real evidence to suggest it's especially dangerous.

378
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,340
Or more dangerous than say, downtown Brussels, which saw 40,191 crimes in 2016 working out

379
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,140
to roughly one crime per 4.4 citizens, or 2,277 crimes per 10,000 people.

380
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,940
So Mullenbeek is safer both proportionally and in total crime than walking around the

381
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,540
most populous area in Brussels.

382
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,540
But why did Southern choose Mullenbeek to begin with?

383
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,380
This was part of a popular right-wing narrative at the time that Mullenbeek was a no-go zone

384
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
in Brussels.

385
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,300
A small number of residents who had lived in the area had committed terror attacks in

386
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,880
Europe, most notably the 2015 attack in Paris that killed 130 people.

387
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,100
This tragedy was used to demonize an entire neighborhood as the breeding ground for jihadis.

388
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,820
Southern's contribution to this body of journalism was to walk around the neighborhood, talk

389
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,080
to a few people, and then get very scared in the evening.

390
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,540
Did we learn anything in her video?

391
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,380
Did it provide any real context that might inform its audience?

392
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,980
No, we just got another sample of a right-wing narrative designed to portray the Mullenbeek

393
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,820
neighborhood as dangerous without any substantive evidence.

394
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,700
This is part of a larger anti-immigrant narrative, especially in anti-Muslim immigrants, that

395
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,460
runs throughout right-wing media.

396
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,620
You can see even lazier examples of this in Southern's video of her walking around

397
00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:00,820
a German town in 2016, titled Lauren Southern, I Thought I Was in Germany, Turkey, and her

398
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:08,020
infamous 2017 video, The Streets of Paris, both of which feature no interviews, no substantive

399
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,080
research, and nothing more than someone walking around with a camera gawking at things, completely

400
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,860
devoid of the speculative commentary found in the Germany video.

401
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,420
Southern's Paris video in particular is a shining example of meaningless footage.

402
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,460
Walking through Paris while gawking at the non-white people is not only not journalism,

403
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,500
I am struggling to describe it as anything other than racist.

404
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,500
What precisely is someone supposed to get out of this?

405
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,900
What's suggested in the video is that the face of Paris is changing, and the only real

406
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,140
change that this video demonstrates is that there are a larger number of faces that are

407
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,060
not white.

408
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,960
There is literally nothing else you can get from this video.

409
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,460
The description tries to provide cover by pointing out how no one was speaking French,

410
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,860
but since the audio is a music track, we have to take Southern's word on that, and being

411
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,980
bilingual hardly seems like a threat.

412
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,100
The point she raises about French braids is mystifying.

413
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,260
She could have also mentioned that no one was eating French toast.

414
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Sources such as this one emphasize how uninterested Lauren Southern is in reporting anything.

415
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,820
She may be adopting the on-the-ground style you often see real journalists use, but instead

416
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,860
of reporting anything, she is using it to smuggle right-wing talking points under the

417
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,640
guise of journalism.

418
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,860
The videos are designed to hide facts and distort realities, so you'll buy into the

419
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:40,580
worldview Southern is pushing.

420
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,300
If you aren't familiar with right-wing talking points and narratives, videos pretending to

421
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,820
be reporting like Lauren Southern's might seem compelling.

422
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,140
Perhaps it may even seem like I'm projecting some right-wing stereotype on a woman who's

423
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,640
honestly trying her best to report the facts.

424
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,460
So to try to push back on that, I'm going to spend a bit of time looking at the ideology

425
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,400
that drives Southern, which she happily illustrates for us in a short book published in 2016.

426
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,260
It has the friendly title of Barbarians, how the baby boomers, immigration, and Islam screwed

427
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,820
my generation.

428
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,260
It's a mere 82 pages long, with one of the biggest fonts and margins I've ever seen

429
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,520
in such a tiny book.

430
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,800
If you got rid of the citations, it would be slightly under 20,000 words.

431
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,700
It's more like a long essay rather than a book, or maybe more accurately, a series of

432
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,800
very short essays.

433
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,900
Much of the book is populated with poorly sourced ideas, personal stories, and misreadings

434
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,420
of history, art, and current affairs.

435
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,560
I couldn't possibly detail everything she gets wrong, so I'll narrow it down to a few

436
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,380
points that describe the narrative in Southern's mind.

437
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,180
Towards the end, Southern offers four recommendations on how to save the West.

438
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,780
And they are building border walls, an immigration policy based on merit and national origin,

439
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,020
protecting free speech, and making people ashamed for needing welfare.

440
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,620
The welfare one has just a really shitty thing to do, but I want to focus in on the national

441
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,140
origin part of the second point.

442
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,700
Although Southern claims not to be a racist, points like this make me pause.

443
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,100
She also writes this.

444
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,660
Immigration policy in the West simply fails to be remotely meritocratic.

445
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,460
Immigrants are not let in to fill niches where our countries need help or to contribute in

446
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,300
some way to society.

447
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,300
It's even considered controversial in some circles to suggest that immigrants should

448
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,420
be able to pull their own weight.

449
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
All of this must be reversed.

450
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,120
In the US, a good start would be repealing the Immigration Act of 1965 so that things

451
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,340
like national origin can be factored into our calculus, and so that the limits of immigration

452
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,300
from other Western countries can be removed.

453
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,580
Everywhere else, the same sort of measures must be taken.

454
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,260
The first thing you'll notice is that no sources are cited for any of this.

455
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,940
While Southern does on occasion provide them, I counted 33 sources out of 48 footnotes

456
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
provided.

457
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,460
Every look at any Western nation's immigration process will show you the hoops foreign national

458
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,100
has to jump through in order to immigrate.

459
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,540
It often involves interviews, providing documentation for skills, and other requirements that demonstrate

460
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
merit.

461
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,180
And Lauren Southern completely contradicts herself when she talks about how national

462
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,900
origin should be factored into the calculation.

463
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,220
She isn't even subtle about when she says limits on Western countries should be removed.

464
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,100
She wants immigrants not coming from Western nations to be subject to greater selection

465
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,140
pressures.

466
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,700
If potential immigrants are being chosen based on their merit, what does their nationality

467
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,220
have to do with that?

468
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,860
If two doctors are applying to immigrate to Canada, one from Norway and the other from

469
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,660
Pakistan, and all things about them otherwise are equal, why would Lauren Southern want

470
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,540
to turn away the doctor from Pakistan?

471
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,420
Or at least, why does that Pakistani doctor have to face restrictions that the Norwegian

472
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,860
one wouldn't?

473
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,740
I won't pretend I'm the first person to notice Lauren Southern saying something about immigration

474
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,300
that, at the very least, sounds a little racist.

475
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,020
For a more comprehensive look at this, check out Sean's excellent video, The Great Replacement

476
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,820
Isn't Real, featuring Lauren Southern.

477
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,540
Another popular theme in Southern's commentary is an appeal to a traditional lifestyle for

478
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
women.

479
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,060
That is to say, women should dedicate themselves to raising children in order to be happier.

480
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,620
She often cites science she doesn't understand to produce opinion pieces that, instead of

481
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,860
engaging with scientific evidence, distort it to fit a right-wing narrative.

482
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,100
For a more thorough examination of this, I highly recommend another video by Sean titled,

483
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,060
What Every Girl Needs to Hear, a Response to Lauren Southern.

484
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,060
And after two shoutouts, I hope Sean sends me a nice check for putting him on the map

485
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
like this.

486
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,060
You're welcome.

487
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,660
I really only highlight these two ideologies that exist in Lauren Southern's commentary

488
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,460
to draw a connection to her pseudo-reporting.

489
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,700
Everything she does is in service to this right-wing narrative, and how it hearkens

490
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,900
back to a golden age, specifically the 1950s, as best I can narrow it down.

491
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,740
Her book specifically takes aim at Baby Boomers, who squandered the success of, as they're

492
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,340
labeled in the media, The Greatest Generation, that is, the generation that fought the Nazis

493
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,540
in World War II, which, I will admit, was pretty nice of them.

494
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,260
Southern is trying to pull the West back to the time before the Baby Boomers supposedly

495
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,900
ruined everything.

496
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,660
In the interests of charity, I'm not certain the Jim Crow laws, rampant sexism, and rampant

497
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,220
homophobia of the era enter into Lauren Southern's imagination when she says she and her fellow

498
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
travelers are,

499
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,980
We're longing for an age we've never lived in, and we're trying to recreate something

500
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,740
that we never grew up being taught or understood.

501
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:45,740
To be as generous as possible, Lauren Southern may not be a traditionalist hiding her secret

502
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,460
racism and sexism, but in the best-case scenario, she's a traditionalist who doesn't understand

503
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,140
the racism and sexism that were implicit parts of the era she longs to be a part of.

504
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,680
And her ignorance does not excuse the harm inherent in her message.

505
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,860
And that message is important to understand when it's being pushed to you through the

506
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,380
context of pseudo-journalism.

507
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,860
Are you a racist?

508
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,420
No, I'm not a racist, and the alt-right hates me.

509
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,340
They don't have any idea what they're talking about, these are just names that they throw

510
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
around.

511
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Quite frankly, when I went to South Africa...

512
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,140
Now that we've taken a look at Lauren Southern's early attempts at journalism and the ideology

513
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,000
that her pseudo-reporting masks, I want to look at some of the more advanced techniques

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,140
she's recently employed.

515
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,020
The slickly-produced documentary titled Farmlands uses Southern's tactic of throwing her into

516
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,900
a new environment with little knowledge or research to advance a right-wing narrative.

517
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,020
Perhaps most disturbingly, though, she uses real subjects to advance this narrative and

518
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,100
push for this idea of an impending race war.

519
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,700
A full debunking of this film may be necessary at some point, but in the interest of keeping

520
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,900
this video under an hour, I'm just going to highlight a few specific points.

521
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,140
First off, Southern freely admits that she has no statistical proof for her claims.

522
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:17,220
About the most gruesome murders imaginable, with almost no statistical proof of their

523
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,020
existence.

524
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,900
By that, she means there are no hard numbers for how many white farmers are being killed.

525
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,580
But a lack of specific data doesn't always mean an absence of data, so she almost cleverly

526
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,360
finds a different source for her information.

527
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,900
She interviews several people from Blood Sisters Crime Scene Cleanup, an outfit that is responsible

528
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,700
for cleaning up various crime scenes across South Africa.

529
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,780
Southern is basing much of her claim on numbers she gets from CSC in this interview.

530
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,300
But they don't really provide any real numbers.

531
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,580
In fact, they will tell you that they don't have a full set of data.

532
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:02,020
Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm

533
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:10,540
or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9 percent.

534
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,820
The figures that I've just given you is, according to our statistics, government statistics will

535
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
differ.

536
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,220
I don't suppose you can tell us much about white others.

537
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:30,780
Well, we don't work closely with them because we don't do every scene, but their figures

538
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,580
are funnily a lot lower than ours.

539
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,560
I don't have a particular reason for that.

540
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,260
What this answer is actually evidence of is not that farm murders are going up, but that

541
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,700
the number of crime scenes CSC has been called into has gone up.

542
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,740
This could mean everything from CSC's market share expanding, or the number of murders

543
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,540
actually going up.

544
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,060
Not an open and shut statistic, it's vague.

545
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,040
If I were to hazard a guess, the reason CSC has been getting more calls is because their

546
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,260
business has been expanding.

547
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,940
They started their business in the mid-2000s and are currently franchising it, so more

548
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,420
people have been operating under the CSC banner and therefore covering more crime scenes.

549
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,300
There's also the success of the book written by the two sisters who founded the CSC, and

550
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,900
its reception in the media might also be leading to a few new jobs.

551
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,740
This stat needs more context.

552
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,500
Instead, Southern says this.

553
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:35,920
This was the first time on camera a qualified government associate had confirmed my worst

554
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,320
fears.

555
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:45,020
Not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers are much higher than we imagined.

556
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,780
Are they though?

557
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,260
Didn't Southern say there was no data to begin with?

558
00:35:51,260 --> 00:36:00,100
So what are these government numbers that don't

559
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
seem accurate?

560
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,540
We're never told as the audience, but don't worry, I'll fill you in on this a little bit

561
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
later.

562
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,340
The questions as to why the CSC crews are getting more work are never really asked,

563
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,620
and we're only shown a few pieces that build this race war narrative that the film is advancing.

564
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,300
This is best revealed when the CSC reps are asked about the motivation of the murders.

565
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,140
How on earth can you expect them to be able to credibly answer that question?

566
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,580
These people aren't law enforcement investigating the murders, they are literally just people

567
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,780
who wipe the blood off the floor.

568
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:42,940
90% of the increase we found is due to unemployment, racial discrimination, and there's no hope.

569
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,740
If you don't start your own business in South Africa, where are you going to work?

570
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,460
There's no work.

571
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,740
Racial discrimination against who, if you don't mind me asking?

572
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,940
Yeah, I have to be careful.

573
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Careful?

574
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Yeah, well, I have to be a little bit careful.

575
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:06,300
We work very closely with government, and I spoke to Simon about it outside.

576
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,020
Racial discrimination against people.

577
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,300
What's suggested here, of course, is that they don't want to risk their government

578
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,460
contract by saying racial discrimination against white people is the cause for the

579
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,780
supposed increase in murders.

580
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,140
This right here is a perfect example of how the film provides just enough evidence to

581
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
let the audience fill in the gap.

582
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,100
But was there more evidence here that could have been provided to give a little more context

583
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,460
to the segment?

584
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,980
Something that maybe would have contradicted the narrative Southern and her crew are trying

585
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,300
to push?

586
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,060
During this interview we see some B-roll of Lauren Southern researching the farm murders

587
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
claim.

588
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,020
Hey, I know that website!

589
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,320
Southern claims she found evidence that these murders were racially based from the far corners

590
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
of the internet.

591
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,260
And by this far corner, I think she means the third result to pop up when you type in

592
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,060
South African farm murders into Google.

593
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,620
AfricaCheck.org is a website dedicated to thoroughly examining issues in Africa, and

594
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,580
as best I can tell, does a good job of looking at the issue of farm murders, explaining what

595
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,980
is and is not known about them.

596
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,860
The page Southern was looking at is an article titled, Fact Sheet, Statistics on Farm Attacks

597
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,960
and Murders in Essay, obviously being South Africa.

598
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,940
So does this website suggest that murders on farms in South Africa are based on race?

599
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,580
Southern should have scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page because, under the

600
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,740
section titled, Is There a Political Agenda Behind These Attacks?, you can see a breakdown

601
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,940
of the motivations of farm attacks as of 2001, where 52 attacks, or 2% of the total, were

602
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,780
motivated by race.

603
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,900
And keep in mind, these numbers only reflect attacks and not murders.

604
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,740
These are the only numbers on this page that discuss race as a motivating factor, and may

605
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,300
not even be reliable according to the 2003 National Operating Coordinating Committee.

606
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
Who are they?

607
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,060
They're the group responsible for this little bit of text here that was underneath the graph

608
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,620
that Southern was supposedly reading.

609
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,020
The 2003 Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks included that none of the statistics collected

610
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,240
between 1991 to 2001 were completely accurate and should be viewed and interpreted with

611
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,860
caution.

612
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,780
Looking through the AfricaCheck.org website, I couldn't find a single article that suggested

613
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,300
that these crimes were motivated by race.

614
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,500
Maybe Southern was looking somewhere else.

615
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,140
I'd be curious to know where.

616
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,260
And of course, journalists always cite their sources, which is exactly why the description

617
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,540
box has none.

618
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
But the murders are surely real, right?

619
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,900
The website can at least confirm that.

620
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,260
The stats on the page, which are the official government stats on murder I mentioned, were

621
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,740
right there for Lauren Southern to check the whole time.

622
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,980
If only she had scrolled a little bit further.

623
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,760
The stats on the page Southern was looking at show murder rates are rather flat for farmers

624
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,280
in South Africa, or according to police data, might be going down slightly.

625
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,920
But more importantly, AfricaCheck describes the data is impossible to calculate, not just

626
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,680
because murders may not be adequately reported, but because of how difficult it is to calculate

627
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,160
the number in farmers in South Africa.

628
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,520
Maybe this is what Southern meant when she said there weren't any real stats to consult.

629
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,220
So where did she get the idea that there was a problem in the first place?

630
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,680
It might have been useful to ask someone at crime scene cleaners how many murder scenes

631
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,760
they clean up in the air, and not just how much it's gone up by.

632
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,280
If the numbers were higher than what was reported by the police, you'd have some

633
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,280
actual evidence for your claim that the government is lying about the number of murders.

634
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,880
Imagine if someone did that, though.

635
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,080
If someone actually did some real journalism to check the claim out and see how many sites

636
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,280
CSC covered in a year that were murders, that'd be pretty good, right?

637
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,040
That'd be great journalism.

638
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
So I did it.

639
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,680
According to a portfolio published by CSC, on average, they clean up 33 murder sites

640
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,920
a year.

641
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,760
That's presumably all murders, since they don't specifically state farm murders.

642
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,280
The most recent number for annual farm deaths, according to the police of South Africa, is

643
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
74.

644
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,520
So the government's numbers are actually over twice as high.

645
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,360
So what did that guy say again?

646
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:14,800
Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm

647
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:23,680
or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9%.

648
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,440
He's not even talking about murders here.

649
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,160
He's talking about violent attacks.

650
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,480
So why does Lauren Southern say, not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers

651
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,040
are much higher than we imagined.

652
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,600
It's because she's trying to twist what he says into her narrative of farmer murder

653
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,200
rates going up.

654
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,080
In other words, she's distorting data to push forward this idea of an impending race

655
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
war.

656
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,640
A huge portion of this film is dedicated to interviewing people in dire living conditions

657
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,720
or people who have lost loved ones in violent crimes.

658
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,720
These are powerful stories and my heart goes out to people who have to live in really terrible

659
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
conditions.

660
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,240
These anecdotes are meant to suggest the overall message of the film that white people are

661
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,600
being wiped out across South Africa.

662
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,420
The stories in this film are presented in a way to push that idea forward and certain

663
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,560
details that may contradict that narrative are conveniently left out.

664
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,920
When a film's thesis is clearly about a supposed race war and then it just drops an interview

665
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,240
where a family member is crying their eyes out over the murder of a loved one, the audience

666
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,720
is left to assume that this is another piece of evidence that a race war is on its way.

667
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Here's an example.

668
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,160
Janine Eichenfelt is interviewed about the murder of her father, Schlock Featherstone.

669
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,560
She recounts the gruesome details and understandably becomes emotional having to tell her story.

670
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,440
Her pain is important to acknowledge as a reminder of how a murder impacts not just

671
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,600
the victim but everyone around them.

672
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,520
And as a quick preface to everything I'm about to say, I genuinely feel awful for her

673
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,480
and she has my deepest sympathies.

674
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,800
I see no reason to think that she was in any way responsible for what Lauren Southern did

675
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,160
with this interview.

676
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,760
She is deserving of our sympathy rather than our scorn as someone who has lost someone

677
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,880
in such a horrible way and then had that loss exploited by a duplicitous filmmaker.

678
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,520
The murder of Featherstone actually fits the alleged purpose of this documentary looking

679
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,240
at various farm murders that happened across South Africa.

680
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,000
But does it fit Southern's narrative of black South Africans attacking white South African

681
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,900
farm owners in an attempt to right a perceived political injustice?

682
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,620
The actual facts surrounding this murder are not difficult to find online.

683
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,740
A quick google of the murderer's name, Winston Boyson, gives you the result of an appeal

684
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,540
that was made earlier this year and that appeal quite helpfully includes some of the details

685
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,620
of the murder.

686
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,700
The first important fact not mentioned in the film is that Boyson killed two people.

687
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,420
The first victim, Brenda Finnis, was Boyson's girlfriend at the time.

688
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,220
A violent interaction between the two left her dead of a stab wound.

689
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,700
The police were on the scene and attempted to arrest Boyson, but he managed to escape.

690
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,660
He spent several days on the run and made his way to Featherstone's farm, where Boyson

691
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,460
had worked in 2014.

692
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,420
Boyson went there in an unsuccessful effort to convince one of his former colleagues to

693
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,260
help him evade the police.

694
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,180
Featherstone was unaware of his presence, but before he departed the farm, Boyson entered

695
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,100
the house to steal a firearm.

696
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,420
When he tried to leave, he was discovered by Featherstone, and in response, Boyson

697
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,420
shot him.

698
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,180
Featherstone attempted to make his way to a phone to call for help, and as he was doing

699
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,340
that, Boyson shot him several more times, murdering him.

700
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,020
Afterwards, Boyson stole some food and Featherstone's vehicle.

701
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,300
He was later apprehended in the bush after fleeing from the vehicle when he saw some

702
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,340
lights that he assumed were law enforcement.

703
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,580
Those are the events according to the court document.

704
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,820
Now I have to ask, does this sound as though Featherstone's death was the product of

705
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,100
racial hatred?

706
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,860
Does it sound like race had anything at all to do with the murder?

707
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,980
Or perhaps this story was as simple as a man on the run from the law who murdered an innocent

708
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,180
bystander.

709
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,460
In what way does this event back up Southern's claim that white farmers are being attacked

710
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,700
by the black majority in South Africa for their land?

711
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,100
These details, which took seconds to find online, are omitted from the film.

712
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,340
Even the claim that Boyson got 15 years in prison is false.

713
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,580
He was sentenced to 15 years for the murder of Finis, a lifetime in prison for the murder

714
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,980
of Featherstone, and another 15 years for the theft, so the point about the government

715
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,540
trying to protect the murderer, as subtly suggested by the film, is also not true.

716
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,820
Of course, this appeal happened in February of 2018, and farmlands debuted in August

717
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,380
of 2018.

718
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,380
And it should be noted that this interview was certainly done before February of 2018.

719
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,820
It's possible Lauren Southern was too far in production to update the story with additional

720
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,460
narration or captioning.

721
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,300
But I don't personally believe this, as an update would have undercut the whole point

722
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,540
of the film and why this interview exists within it.

723
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,700
I also believe Southern was at least partially aware of the facts surrounding this case,

724
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,500
and she purposely chose to omit them.

725
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,100
Here's some additional context that was given to this interview when Southern originally

726
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,820
published it to her YouTube channel as a teaser for the documentary in January of 2018.

727
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:18,900
Janine and other families like hers have told me they are not convinced these brutal attacks

728
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,560
are just random acts, but that the South African government may very well be complicit in allowing

729
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,580
them to happen as they continue their political agenda to drive out white farmers and take

730
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,580
their land.

731
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,180
There is no evidence in the interview or any of the facts surrounding the case that this

732
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,940
murder had anything to do with government rhetoric.

733
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,260
So on what basis was she advancing this talking point?

734
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,980
What evidence did she have that this murder was motivated by racial tensions?

735
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,340
Southern removed this bit of commentary from the actual film, but the subtext remains and

736
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,880
it makes it a more subtle and deceptive film.

737
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,880
The message is the same, that the South African government is motivating its citizens with

738
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,740
its rhetoric to murder white farmers.

739
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,340
And there is evidence to suggest that Southern knew more details about this particular murder

740
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,780
than she might let on.

741
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,980
The original clip lets slip into crucial detail when the second victim, Brenda Finnis, is

742
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:21,980
mentioned in passing.

743
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,400
Why is this the only mention of a second murder victim?

744
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,340
It makes perfect sense for Eilhem Felt to want to focus on her father, but even she

745
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,780
mentioned the second victim.

746
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,740
I simply don't have enough charity in me to assume that Southern was such a poor interviewer

747
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,140
that she had no follow-up questions about a second murder.

748
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,860
What seems far more likely here is that she omitted the details so she could lie about

749
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,940
the reason Featherstone was murdered.

750
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,940
She used an innocent man's death to advance a racist narrative.

751
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,300
After the victim exploitation, Southern goes as far as saying that segregation might be

752
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,020
the only way to prevent a race war.

753
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:04,060
On and off camera, many people, both black and white, did suggest segregation as a potential

754
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,580
solution to this crisis.

755
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:13,180
And even more worrying is the growing number of people preparing for a race-based civil

756
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,300
war if another solution cannot be found.

757
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,500
And interviews members of Sweetlanders, a group that is preparing for just that thing.

758
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,840
And it's here where the race war narrative I kept mentioning really comes together.

759
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,540
And obviously, it's not something you would open the film up with.

760
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:38,380
It's something you have to slowly guide someone to by presenting bad stats and personal stories,

761
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,500
anecdotes that are horribly manipulated and misrepresented to advance this narrative.

762
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,380
So when you're finally here, at the end, where the race war thing comes up, you're

763
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,900
ready to believe it because you've been primed to believe it.

764
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,580
This bit of information is the poison pill this whole film was designed to pass to you.

765
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,820
One gets a strange response from Simon Roche where he gives vague rationalizations as to

766
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,680
why the race war is coming.

767
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,260
This is almost certainly covering for the real reason that the Sweetlanders' preparations

768
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,900
are based on prophecies from a guy's name, Steiner von Rensberg.

769
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,140
Another fact that conveniently gets left out of the film.

770
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,380
Instead of another digression about the many right-wing conspiracies that surround South

771
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,620
Africa, I highly recommend this excellent video, South Africa and the Far Right, part

772
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,380
one by Rational Disconnect.

773
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,820
He goes into the history of this race war narrative and how it's used by the Far Right

774
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,780
to advance a specific narrative that white people and black people can't get along.

775
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,780
He also debunks Lawrence Southern's film in about a minute, which makes me feel like

776
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,540
I'm being really inefficient here.

777
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,540
This is not reporting.

778
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,820
This is a careful distortion of facts used to advance a false dichotomy.

779
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,500
This film is utterly convinced that the black and white populations of South Africa simply

780
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:01,220
can't live together, and the reason for that lies with the anger of the black population.

781
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,340
In one of her most recent videos, Lawrence Southern declared that she would be leaving

782
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,700
the world of YouTube to focus on making larger documentary films, like Farmlands.

783
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,780
We can expect a highly polished production that's deeply deceptive and advances a hateful

784
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,340
narrative, one that exploits real victims and suffering and coops it to fit her narrative

785
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,380
of white people under attack by the non-white world.

786
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,580
These documentaries are not factual or honest.

787
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:30,380
Much like her earlier reporting, they are advancing a particular right-wing narrative.

788
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,940
After I finished recording and editing most of this video, Lawrence Southern announced

789
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,140
her newest documentary film project, Borderless.

790
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,620
And it more or less matches up exactly with what I thought it would be, specifically that

791
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,700
narrative of white people under attack by the non-white world.

792
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,780
Borderless once again sends her to Europe, where she'll probably conflate immigrants

793
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,580
and refugees, include scenes where she feels like she's in danger, and feature heavily

794
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:03,700
edited interviews that are anecdotes designed to make immigrants appear like evil threats.

795
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,180
Things she probably won't touch on are stats that show the positive impact of immigrants,

796
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:14,260
socially and economically, how European anti-immigrant sentiment often includes white immigrants,

797
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:20,740
and that Europe is not a homogenous culture that she so cheerfully describes as the West.

798
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,220
After she passes around the donation hat and lovers of pro-white people documentaries throw

799
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,100
in their money, she could produce something of value that critically engages with the

800
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,100
subject.

801
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,020
That would even be nice to see, I mean, I like surprises.

802
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,900
But I'm not holding my breath here.
