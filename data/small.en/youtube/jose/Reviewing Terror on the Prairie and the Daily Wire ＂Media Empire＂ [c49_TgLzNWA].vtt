00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Beginning is a right-wing news outlet in 2015, and I use the term news very loosely here.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.760
In 2021, The Daily Wire took its first steps into the world of entertainment, with the

00:09.760 --> 00:14.480
release of Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that answers the question, what if Die Hard took

00:14.480 --> 00:16.000
place at a school shooting?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.760
I already went over that movie, including its very sordid history, in another video.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.280
It was an important milestone for the outlet, as it moved them away from news coverage that

00:24.280 --> 00:29.440
was heavily biased in favor of the right, towards entertainment that was, supposedly,

00:29.440 --> 00:32.040
devoid of any kind of political agenda.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.860
Since then, The Daily Wire has expanded its offerings to four movies on its streaming

00:35.860 --> 00:39.640
service, including one starring Gina Carano called Terror on the Prairie.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.560
This is the first movie Carano has appeared in since being fired off The Mandalorian by

00:43.560 --> 00:46.080
Disney for her social media activity.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.360
In addition to movies, The Daily Wire's streaming service, recently renamed Daily

00:49.360 --> 00:54.520
Wire Plus, has been rapidly expanding its catalog, moving into kids' shows, documentaries,

00:54.520 --> 00:57.280
sports podcasts, and daytime chat shows.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.200
What we're seeing is a well-financed operation that is attempting to create a media landscape

01:01.200 --> 01:04.880
that will, supposedly, compete with mainstream entertainment.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.120
But I don't think that tells us the whole story.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.000
I'm sure they'd love to be making more money than Disney, but they must know how incredibly

01:11.000 --> 01:12.080
unlikely that is.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.120
Instead, I think something else is being built here.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.040
But before we dig into that, we first need to take a trip to the movies.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.920
When I made that video about Run, Hide, Fight, I considered making reviews for all of the

01:22.920 --> 01:24.240
Daily Wire movies.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.760
And that was the plan until I watched them.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.400
And I realized that, while that first movie had an absolutely bonkers premise, the rest

01:31.400 --> 01:34.880
would be far less provocative and about just as boring.

01:34.880 --> 01:38.680
Run, Hide, Fight was produced by Bonfire Legend, and of the three movies that followed the

01:38.680 --> 01:42.720
school shooter one, two of them were produced by Bonfire Legend.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.320
Formerly known as Sin Estate, they changed their name after one of their producers was

01:46.320 --> 01:49.360
charged with allegedly sexually assaulting an underage girl.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.080
They were a small production company operating out of Texas that would make low-budget movies,

01:54.080 --> 01:57.620
and as we go through some of these movies they bay with the Daily Wire, you'll likely

01:57.620 --> 02:01.640
not be shocked to find out you haven't heard of any of them, and we'll likely forget them

02:01.640 --> 02:02.760
soon after.

02:02.760 --> 02:07.000
Della Sonnier, who founded Bonfire Legend, said in an email to IndieWire,

02:07.000 --> 02:12.240
Bonfire Legend reflects the spirit of my firebrand of moviemaking and my personal vendetta against

02:12.240 --> 02:16.620
disingenuous morality amidst a deeply polarized body politic.

02:16.620 --> 02:21.240
The first major effort between Bonfire Legend and the Daily Wire was shut in.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.440
Starring Rainy Qualey, J. Carlwitz, and Vincent Gallo.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.600
It's about a recovering addict, Jessica, who is trying to escape the influence of the

02:28.600 --> 02:32.640
father of her children, Rob, and his creepy friend Sammy.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.140
The movie has a surprisingly decent first two acts, offering some pretty good tension,

02:37.140 --> 02:41.300
but ultimately falls apart in the third act with some weak action sequences and a slightly

02:41.300 --> 02:42.960
awkward religious message.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.680
Although as a thriller it didn't amount to anything too memorable, its production

02:46.680 --> 02:48.520
does tell a more interesting story.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.520
The script for shut in was originally bought by New Line Cinema, and at one point Jason

02:52.520 --> 02:54.520
Bateman was even attached to direct.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.880
But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it languished in development limbo long enough for the deal

02:58.880 --> 02:59.880
to fall through.

02:59.880 --> 03:04.040
Della Sonnier, who had been shopping a script around, brought it to the Daily Wire.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.680
The script was written by Melanie Toast.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.240
This script was the first one she ever sold, and while it had been optioned by New Line

03:10.240 --> 03:12.660
Cinema was facing a lot of changes.

03:12.660 --> 03:17.060
When it was brought over to Daily Wire though, it was left untouched so that the movie produced

03:17.060 --> 03:19.100
was as it was written on the page.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.940
While that was nice of them to do, the fact that this was the first screenplay Toast had

03:22.940 --> 03:27.420
ever sold makes me think it might have benefited from some input from others, especially when

03:27.420 --> 03:29.140
you look at Final Product.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.560
It had some good ideas that just didn't come together in the final release.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.820
And while I personally wasn't overwhelmed by the movie, I do want to acknowledge that

03:35.820 --> 03:39.600
the writer, Melanie Toast, had no intention of working with the Daily Wire.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.860
In a tweet from Twitter user avishaiwineburger, he wrote about shut in,

03:43.860 --> 03:47.340
having the rights to your script get tied up with these guys without your knowing what

03:47.340 --> 03:51.260
they are, and then they sell it as an exclusive on an alt-right site.

03:51.260 --> 03:54.380
Again, unless you asked for this, you didn't ask for this.

03:54.380 --> 03:55.960
What a nightmare.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.660
Toast replied with a simple, I didn't.

03:58.660 --> 04:03.620
Happily for her, she now has a deal with Paramount working on a horror film titled Rabbit Rabbit

04:03.620 --> 04:04.620
Rabbit.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.860
I'm sure her work will keep getting better and I do wish her all the best.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.940
Other people were involved with this production though, not so much.

04:10.940 --> 04:14.900
In particular, Vincent Gallo, with shut in being his first appearance in a movie in

04:14.900 --> 04:16.300
nine years.

04:16.300 --> 04:22.140
Gallo first achieved some notoriety in 1998 with his movie Buffalo 66, making him something

04:22.140 --> 04:23.760
of an indie darling.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.500
After that though, he really struggled to find any sort of success, and over the years

04:27.500 --> 04:30.060
has gotten into some trouble because of his behavior.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.260
The Daily Wire characterized him saying,

04:32.260 --> 04:37.020
"...his brash persona rubbed plenty of people the wrong way in La La Land.

04:37.020 --> 04:41.660
Plus he's a loud and proud Republican unwilling to play by Hollywood's rules."

04:41.660 --> 04:45.540
Let's just get a quick sample of that brash persona.

04:45.540 --> 04:49.380
Gallo has made a distinct impression with his online merch store where he sells one-off

04:49.380 --> 04:55.980
t-shirts for $666, with Sogans such as F*** Black Lives Matter, and one with a picture

04:55.980 --> 05:00.020
of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a homophobic slur printed on it.

05:00.020 --> 05:03.620
He also sells his sperm for $1 million.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.080
Here's an excerpt from that section.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.760
This is kind of a long excerpt, but it's pretty wild, so I feel as though I have to

05:09.760 --> 05:10.760
read the whole thing.

05:10.760 --> 05:16.480
Mr. Gallo maintains the right to refuse sale of his sperm to those of extremely dark complexions.

05:16.480 --> 05:22.200
Though a fan of Franco Harris, Derek Jeter, Lenny Kravitz, and Lena Horne, Mr. Gallo does

05:22.200 --> 05:25.320
not want to be part of that type of integration.

05:25.320 --> 05:30.840
In fact, for the next 30 days, he is offering a $50,000 discount to any potential female

05:30.840 --> 05:34.800
purchaser who can prove she has naturally blonde hair and blue eyes.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.200
Anyone who can prove a direct family fling to any of the German soldiers of the mid-century

05:39.200 --> 05:41.280
will also receive this discount.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.360
Under the laws of the Jewish faith, a Jewish mother would qualify a baby to be deemed a

05:45.360 --> 05:47.280
member of the Jewish religion.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.760
This would be added incentive for Mr. Gallo to sell his sperm to a Jew mother, his reasoning

05:51.760 --> 05:55.600
being that the slim chance that his child moved into the profession of motion picture

05:55.600 --> 06:00.400
acting or become a musical performer, this connection to the Jewish faith would guarantee

06:00.400 --> 06:05.240
his offspring a better chance at good reviews and maybe even a prize at the Sundance Film

06:05.240 --> 06:07.840
Festival or an Oscar.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.440
According to Sornier, this is some kind of satire.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.800
I'm not entirely sure what it is, it's satirizing though.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.840
In 2020, Gallo made a post on Instagram to show his support for Donald Trump and included

06:19.840 --> 06:21.280
in the message he wrote,

06:21.280 --> 06:25.640
Granting women the right to vote was a mistake, and that mistake is clearer now than ever

06:25.640 --> 06:26.640
before.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.840
If this is all meant as some sort of elaborate performance, it's a bit strange to think

06:30.840 --> 06:36.080
that Gallo has basically burnt his career to the ground for the sake of these outbursts.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.340
And in the case of The Daily Wire, the joke seems to be partially lost on them.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.240
Or perhaps these reasons are simply emblematic of why no one wants to work with this guy,

06:45.240 --> 06:49.960
aside from those who at least partially share some of these opinions.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.060
Of course it should also be said if The Daily Wire is willing to work with a production

06:53.060 --> 06:57.780
company that turned a blind eye to a sexual predator who was only stopped after allegedly

06:57.780 --> 07:02.220
assaulting an underage girl, hiring a washed-up actor who is messed up views on gender and

07:02.220 --> 07:05.000
race might not seem so extreme.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.940
After Shut In, the next movie released by The Daily Wire was The Hyperions starring

07:08.940 --> 07:10.380
Carrie Ellis.

07:10.380 --> 07:14.260
This is similar to Run, Hide, Fight in that it was produced well before The Daily Wire

07:14.260 --> 07:19.340
had any hand in the creative process, and they're only acting as the movie's distributor.

07:19.340 --> 07:23.400
The movie took a long and complicated route going through multiple entities before ending

07:23.400 --> 07:27.440
up on the streaming platform, but that story isn't so interesting.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.100
So to get straight to the point, it had been languishing for three years before finally

07:31.100 --> 07:35.260
getting released, and no one involved in this production had any idea it would end up on

07:35.260 --> 07:36.540
The Daily Wire.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.340
So we don't have to hate Carrie Ellis, and we can still celebrate him dunking on Ted

07:40.340 --> 07:41.340
Cruz.

07:41.340 --> 07:45.780
Sadly, the movie doesn't quite come together in what seemed, at first, like a thoughtful

07:45.780 --> 07:48.980
attempt to address Disney's commodification of superheroes.

07:48.980 --> 07:53.300
The style owes a lot to Wes Anderson, but without the charm or authenticity.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.940
Ultimately, it's just not a very captivating movie.

07:56.940 --> 08:00.420
At least there were no creepy sex pests working on this one though.

08:00.420 --> 08:04.780
Which finally brings us to the latest movie from The Daily Wire, the Gina Carano-led Terror

08:04.780 --> 08:06.300
on the Prairie.

08:06.300 --> 08:11.280
Back in 2020, while working on The Mandalorian, Carano made a series of tweets comparing

08:11.280 --> 08:15.780
being a conservative to being Jewish in Nazi Germany amidst pushing conspiracy theories

08:15.780 --> 08:19.620
of voter fraud along with other talking points you would see in more conspiracy-minded

08:19.620 --> 08:21.400
right-wing media outlets.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.100
So when her behavior led Carano to being fired off The Mandalorian, she rebounded very quickly

08:26.100 --> 08:28.420
signing a deal with The Daily Wire.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.020
If you'd like to learn more about the situation, Council of Geeks has a good video going over

08:32.020 --> 08:36.500
the controversy that details how Gina Carano wasn't fired because she expressed the wrong

08:36.500 --> 08:41.860
ideology, but because her stirring up controversy made Disney think she might affect how profitable

08:41.860 --> 08:42.860
their show would be.

08:42.860 --> 08:46.980
Regardless of what the Daily Wire crew tell you, it's not being woke these corporations

08:46.980 --> 08:50.940
care about, it's making money, and Gina Carano was fired because her behavior might

08:50.940 --> 08:53.020
affect Disney's bottom line.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.540
Although the first movie Carano was supposed to work on was titled White Knuckle, about

08:56.540 --> 09:00.980
a woman who was targeted by a serial killer trucker, this was supposedly put on hold because

09:00.980 --> 09:02.940
of COVID requirements for filming.

09:02.940 --> 09:07.340
So instead, The Western, Terror on the Prairie, which was filmed in Montana, became the first

09:07.340 --> 09:09.820
movie Carano would star in for The Daily Wire.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.700
According to producer Dallas Sonnier, it was the looming federal vaccine mandates that

09:13.700 --> 09:15.700
made him put White Knuckle on hold.

09:15.700 --> 09:20.780
Why a federal mandate wouldn't also apply to Montana, which last I checked was still

09:20.780 --> 09:23.180
in the United States, wasn't explained.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.340
Let's actually go into some detail about the content of this movie.

09:26.340 --> 09:31.060
Terror on the Prairie is about Hattie, the wife of a struggling farmer who has to defend

09:31.060 --> 09:35.940
herself and her two children from four men while her husband is in town looking for work.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.860
It's a siege of a small wooden cabin in the wilderness.

09:38.940 --> 09:43.740
Eventually, the good characters end up happily and the bad unhappily because, as Oscar Wilde

09:43.740 --> 09:46.860
once wrote, that is what fiction means.

09:46.860 --> 09:51.740
Like Run, Hide, Fight, and Shut In, this movie resists interpretation as it exists largely

09:51.740 --> 09:54.340
to service action sequences and tension.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.740
But that doesn't mean it isn't saying anything.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.460
Taking place shortly after the Civil War, we find out that Hattie's husband Jeb, played

10:00.460 --> 10:04.980
by UFC fighter Donald Cerrone, was a former Confederate soldier who apparently turned

10:04.980 --> 10:06.540
on his commanding officer.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.100
When he and some of his fellow soldiers tried to murder their captain, they ended up killing

10:10.100 --> 10:15.140
his daughter instead, leading the captain, played by Nick Cersei, to hunt them all down.

10:15.140 --> 10:18.500
Which is how these four men ended up outside his Montana home.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.340
The pride of Jeb and Hattie's son, of being an American, is contrasted with Jeb's shame

10:23.340 --> 10:28.020
being a former Confederate, introduces an interesting tension in a post-Civil War America,

10:28.020 --> 10:30.660
where the losing side has to reckon with their actions.

10:30.660 --> 10:34.980
Whether it's shame for fighting on the wrong side or the humiliation for having lost, Jeb

10:34.980 --> 10:39.020
still has to look his son in the eye knowing that he once fought against what his son holds

10:39.020 --> 10:40.740
up as pure and good.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.500
And Jeb's whole project to move to Montana further cements the westward expansion of

10:44.500 --> 10:45.660
the United States.

10:45.660 --> 10:50.500
So in addition to that shame or humiliation, Jeb is now in service to the state he once

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
fought against.

10:51.500 --> 10:57.040
It's a thorough emasculation in a time and genre where a rugged masculinity would be

10:57.040 --> 10:58.980
highly valued.

10:58.980 --> 11:02.700
Had this movie been about Jeb, I think it might have been more interesting.

11:02.700 --> 11:07.260
But instead we focus on Hattie, a character who doesn't seem to be quite as interesting

11:07.260 --> 11:11.380
aside from the fact that she seems to come from a wealthy family and has given it up

11:11.380 --> 11:14.200
to run off with Jeb to Montana.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.580
She is the housewife who holds the family together while her husband is off trying to

11:17.580 --> 11:18.940
make something of himself.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.340
And it could have been an interesting look at the role women played in the 19th century

11:22.340 --> 11:24.700
and the heavy burden of maintaining a household.

11:24.700 --> 11:28.940
But by exploring that through a violent confrontation, it could struggle in survival in the west

11:28.940 --> 11:32.620
with masculine signifiers, like fighting off bandits.

11:32.620 --> 11:37.180
There is an irony here that I almost agree with the Daily Wire crew who generally seem

11:37.180 --> 11:42.260
to get upset at female characters who star in action movies, especially those who adopt

11:42.260 --> 11:56.460
male traits as some form of female empowerment.

11:56.460 --> 12:00.460
The difference between us is that the action movie dynamic isn't interesting to me because

12:00.460 --> 12:05.400
it traps displays of strength in a movie behind very old masculine-coated tropes.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.300
Instead of letting female and male characters alike find other ways of demonstrating their

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
inner strength.

12:10.300 --> 12:14.460
The only time we see Hattie making an impact where she isn't wielding a gun or in some

12:14.460 --> 12:18.860
way fighting off bad guys is early on when we see her treat an indigenous character's

12:18.860 --> 12:21.900
injuries, an experience that seems to rattle her.

12:21.900 --> 12:25.940
Which is strange because in 50 minutes she'll be quite competently setting up barricades

12:25.940 --> 12:28.580
and smashing windows to fight off the captain and his goons.

12:28.580 --> 12:33.340
Still, her ability to treat someone medically is an interesting and thoughtful way of showing

12:33.340 --> 12:37.740
how important and crucial a character like her is in this kind of environment.

12:37.740 --> 12:42.620
And the fact that these are the only indigenous characters we see in the movie is also interesting.

12:42.620 --> 12:46.380
This scene can be seen as a whitewashing of sort of the westward expansion of the United

12:46.380 --> 12:50.940
States, doing a little bit to help the indigenous populations and then having their own wacky

12:50.940 --> 12:53.860
adventures on land that was recently stolen.

12:53.860 --> 12:57.380
Back to those action scenes that make up the bulk of the movie though, it's strange that

12:57.380 --> 12:59.860
they're not scarier for Hattie.

12:59.860 --> 13:04.220
Perhaps they seem scarier written down, but they don't really come across on camera.

13:04.220 --> 13:08.020
That's probably because one of the biggest issues this movie has is that Gina Carano

13:08.020 --> 13:11.060
just doesn't seem up to the task of leading the film.

13:11.060 --> 13:15.260
I'm not deeply familiar with her acting history, so I don't know how this compares to her

13:15.260 --> 13:20.100
previous work too much, but this performance on Terror on the Prairie is flat and lifeless.

13:20.100 --> 13:24.180
She has the steely attitude of an action hero in the context of a western thriller.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.540
As an example of how little she seems to be trying, consider the fact that Hattie is supposed

13:28.540 --> 13:31.060
to be from Missouri and should have an accent.

13:45.060 --> 13:49.500
It really seems that if Gina Carano was not going to do an accent for this movie, they

13:49.500 --> 13:52.420
perhaps should have just dropped that line entirely.

13:52.420 --> 13:56.860
Speaking of bad acting, the scenes between Carano and Cerrone are an absolute struggle

13:56.860 --> 13:57.860
to watch.

14:13.540 --> 14:17.580
Nick Cersei does an okay job as the captain, but otherwise the acting in this movie really

14:17.580 --> 14:18.780
takes it down some.

14:19.140 --> 14:23.260
It's bad enough to be distracting and undermined what I suspect is a movie about the role women

14:23.260 --> 14:27.460
in the West had in holding households together, albeit awkwardly presented through the language

14:27.460 --> 14:28.460
of violence.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.860
It might be easy enough to ignore the clumsy messaging of this movie if the action were

14:32.860 --> 14:36.780
interesting or exciting, but much of it is slow and clumsy.

14:36.780 --> 14:40.580
Since it's the 19th century, we see a lot of people running around from not very far

14:40.580 --> 14:43.700
distances as their guns struggle to hit anything.

14:43.700 --> 14:47.300
The captain and his gang try a few schemes to get Hattie and her kids out of the house,

14:47.300 --> 14:51.020
with varying degrees of failure, and we see our heroes eventually triumph while ignoring

14:51.020 --> 14:52.020
their gunshot wounds.

14:52.020 --> 14:55.380
In other words, basic action movie cliches.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.660
It's a real shame we couldn't get a better female-led Western out of this thing, because

14:58.660 --> 15:02.380
that is one of the few unique things Terror on the Prairie brings to the table.

15:02.380 --> 15:06.860
Of the many, many Westerns produced in the last century, a minuscule number of them feature

15:06.860 --> 15:07.860
female leads.

15:07.860 --> 15:12.220
Ahead of this movie, I tried watching the few I could find, and it was a challenge just

15:12.220 --> 15:15.060
to locate any female-led Westerns.

15:15.060 --> 15:19.700
Some of the classics include Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane, both musicals respectively

15:19.700 --> 15:24.060
about Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane, who were both popular acts from the Buffalo Bill

15:24.060 --> 15:27.340
traveling Western show from the early half of the 20th century.

15:27.340 --> 15:31.820
There is also Annie Colder, starring Raquel Welch, about a woman who hunts down some outlaws

15:31.820 --> 15:32.820
who wronged her.

15:32.820 --> 15:36.980
In the 90s, there was The Quick and the Dead, starring Sharon Stone, about a female gunfighter,

15:36.980 --> 15:40.820
and the most recent female-led Western I could find was Meeks Cut-Off, which, to be honest,

15:40.820 --> 15:44.700
felt a little more like an ensemble piece than having a strong female lead.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.780
Although it was certainly the best of the movies I watched.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.740
Terror on the Prairie owes something to Annie Colder, as it has a similar premise, although

15:51.740 --> 15:56.460
when it comes to Annie Colder, that movie is all over the place with its tone.

15:56.460 --> 16:01.060
But through that madness, I still see Annie as a more believable character, as her journey

16:01.060 --> 16:06.100
in this movie takes her from being a housewife to becoming a gunfighter, driven by her vendetta.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.300
It's an old Western cliché, but it makes more sense than Terror on the Prayer's Hattie,

16:10.300 --> 16:14.100
who somehow is able to fight off a siege at her farmhouse.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.020
There's no development or growth.

16:16.020 --> 16:20.700
Just the bad guy shows up, she fights them, and eventually, through a few twists of fate,

16:20.700 --> 16:21.700
she wins.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.580
It's not much of an arc.

16:23.580 --> 16:27.760
Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane both being musicals means they center on love stories,

16:27.760 --> 16:31.620
but both tell fun stories about women who are underestimated by them and around them,

16:31.620 --> 16:34.020
gradually building respect amongst their peers.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.780
Calamity Jane in particular says a lot of interesting things about gender roles, with

16:37.780 --> 16:39.740
people often treating Jane like a man.

16:39.740 --> 16:44.080
Her relationship with Wild Bill Hickok is built on a strong mutual respect, though romance

16:44.080 --> 16:48.960
and feelings between the two can only be reciprocated when Bill finally sees Jane fit

16:48.960 --> 16:51.120
into a more traditional gender presentation.

16:51.120 --> 16:55.760
There's even a scene where a male actor is forced to pretend as though he were a woman.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.960
In other words, this movie is making a lot of claims on how superficial gender roles

16:59.960 --> 17:03.160
are, even in the very sharply defined world of the Western.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.160
Terror on the Prairie could be implicitly making many of the same claims, but it's

17:07.160 --> 17:11.760
so enraptured with its violence and intestinity that it never really pauses to explore these

17:11.760 --> 17:12.760
questions.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.480
It's read as an inversion in the characters of Hattie and Jeb, but everything else is

17:16.480 --> 17:20.880
such a standard Western cliché that it struggles to say anything of substance, even when its

17:20.880 --> 17:24.720
very premise is a direct challenge to gender roles in Western movies.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.480
It makes the whole thing feel like a wasted opportunity.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.920
So in short, I didn't like this movie very much.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.200
I give it a 2.34 out of 12.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.960
If you're wondering where Terror on the Prairie ranks amongst the female-led Westerns I've

17:35.960 --> 17:39.760
seen, I'd place it roughly here, slightly below Handy Calder.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.320
Maybe it seems like being the worst is a harsh criticism, but when there are so few

17:43.320 --> 17:47.280
of these to begin with, it's actually not saying that much at all.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.540
I just didn't like it.

17:48.540 --> 17:53.000
The Daily Wire likes to characterize its movie and productions as being politically neutral.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.240
That is, they want to make movies for everyone, not just a conservative audience, and they're

17:57.240 --> 17:59.840
willing to work with anyone regardless of their politics.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.200
And while I'm sure they would accept any celebrity who would help raise the profile

18:03.200 --> 18:07.440
of their productions, they are quite obviously building a very conservative group of creative

18:07.440 --> 18:11.360
people to work for them and are deliberately targeting a conservative audience.

18:11.360 --> 18:24.320
Here's The Daily Wire's co-founder Jeremy Boring lying through his teeth.

18:24.320 --> 18:29.320
As I showed you a few moments ago, Gina Carano's politics are not a mystery.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.600
She is obviously and clearly conservative.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.020
For Jeremy Boring to say this, in 2022, must be dishonesty.

18:36.020 --> 18:40.540
She's not sure how far right she is, but she's clearly somewhere on the right.

18:40.540 --> 18:44.260
Ahead of Terror on the Prairie's premiere, Dallas Sonnier, who was a producer on the

18:44.260 --> 18:47.380
movie, posted on Instagram to thank his supporters who,

18:47.380 --> 18:51.800
"...keep us motivated as we fight the commies for the right to live our lives freely and

18:51.800 --> 18:54.580
watch our movies without garbage indoctrinations."

18:54.580 --> 18:59.700
And when the crew took a photo in production, they posed with a giant red flag that read,

18:59.700 --> 19:01.540
Let's Go, Brandon.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.540
I wonder if that person regrets buying such a big memento for a dead meme mocking Joe

19:05.540 --> 19:06.860
Biden.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.940
Nick Cersei, who played the captain on Terror on the Prairie, is an outspoken conservative,

19:10.940 --> 19:13.100
never letting a tired meme go to waste.

19:13.100 --> 19:17.620
He joked on Twitter that while shooting Terror on the Prairie, he named his horse Brandon.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.980
So he could say, Let's Go, Brandon, while riding.

19:20.980 --> 19:24.460
For all the talk about keeping politics out of movies and how little they care about the

19:24.460 --> 19:28.360
politics of the creative people they work with, the actual productions of these movies

19:28.360 --> 19:30.540
have a distinctly right-wing flair to them.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.780
It may just be that no one wants to work with The Daily Wire because they spread white-wing

19:33.780 --> 19:37.140
propaganda, or it could also be that no one wants to work with them because their movies

19:37.140 --> 19:42.460
are on a streaming service with a subscriber base less than 1% of Netflix or Disney+.

19:42.460 --> 19:46.260
But still, they are getting talent to sign up with them, and there must be a reason.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.940
And I think we got a pretty good indication why at the red carpet premiere for Terror

19:49.940 --> 19:51.420
on the Prairie.

19:51.420 --> 19:55.500
Here's Gina Carano being interviewed as to why she chose to work with The Daily Wire.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.620
Why was it so important for you to work with The Daily Wire?

19:57.620 --> 20:00.180
I'm sure you had tons of people knocking down your door.

20:00.180 --> 20:01.180
Why'd you pick The Daily Wire?

20:01.180 --> 20:06.860
Well, there was a big massive company that fired me.

20:06.860 --> 20:07.860
I didn't hear about that.

20:07.860 --> 20:08.860
It was a big deal.

20:08.860 --> 20:12.860
They didn't want to work with me, which made the rest of the industry not want to work with

20:12.860 --> 20:13.860
me.

20:13.860 --> 20:14.860
And then all of a sudden, Daily Wire popped up and they were like, We want to work with

20:14.860 --> 20:15.860
you.

20:15.860 --> 20:18.020
And I was like, Wow, I want to work with you too.

20:18.020 --> 20:22.460
And that's basically how it happened.

20:22.460 --> 20:25.540
It's very cute that the interviewer tried to make it sound as though Gina Carano was

20:25.540 --> 20:29.980
being highly sought after, and her response is that she actually didn't have many other

20:29.980 --> 20:30.980
options.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.900
Outside of her work with The Daily Wire, Carano is also set to appear in another movie, this

20:34.900 --> 20:39.460
one titled My Son Hunter, which is about Hunter Biden.

20:39.460 --> 20:43.100
In spite of the production photo of Hunter living a blessed life, this movie sounds like

20:43.100 --> 20:47.020
it's capitalizing on the right wing obsession with Hunter Biden.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.900
Gina Carano's options as an actress seem pretty limited.

20:50.900 --> 20:55.020
Another familiar face at the red carpet premiere, and the only person you might have heard of

20:55.020 --> 21:04.860
who is not currently on the Daily Wire's payroll, as far as I know, was Rob Schneider.

21:04.860 --> 21:08.900
I got a bit of heat on Twitter saying Rob Schneider was the only celebrity not in the

21:08.900 --> 21:10.820
movie to show up to this premiere.

21:10.820 --> 21:16.140
And I want to once again sincerely apologize for using the term celebrity to describe Rob

21:16.140 --> 21:17.140
Schneider.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.140
I'll try to do better.

21:18.140 --> 21:22.060
There are creative people who work on these movies who haven't had much mainstream success.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.580
And considering how tough it is to make it in show business, it's understandable someone

21:25.580 --> 21:29.060
taking whatever work might come their way, and hopefully some of them will move on to

21:29.060 --> 21:30.580
bigger and better things.

21:30.580 --> 21:34.580
But when it comes to these known quantities in Hollywood, it seems the only people who

21:34.580 --> 21:39.060
want to do work with The Daily Wire are conservative celebrities who can't get a job anywhere

21:39.060 --> 21:42.980
else or who aren't really quite on the A-list.

21:42.980 --> 21:46.780
Using their shared ideology to get a quick payday for a series of movies that are forgotten

21:46.780 --> 21:48.580
halfway through watching them.

21:48.580 --> 21:52.740
After all the bravado of competing with Hollywood, so far The Daily Wire's attempt at making

21:52.740 --> 21:54.660
movies has been a bit of a thud.

21:54.660 --> 21:59.460
But feature films are only one part of a much larger enterprise that this right-wing outlet

21:59.460 --> 22:01.420
is embarking on.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.940
First off, not all of their movies are feature films.

22:04.940 --> 22:09.580
While everyone is aware of Matt Walsh's abysmal documentary What is a Woman because

22:09.580 --> 22:13.980
of the blanket advertising it saw here on YouTube back in June, The Daily Wire has also

22:13.980 --> 22:19.700
made several other movies in that vein, including Choosing Death, The Legacy of Ro, China,

22:19.700 --> 22:22.820
The Enemy Within, and Bouchie Unmasked.

22:22.820 --> 22:27.500
Hilariously on the Daily Wire website, above this section it reads, The only agenda is

22:27.500 --> 22:28.660
entertainment.

22:28.660 --> 22:33.440
As if the upcoming movie from Candace Owens, called The Greatest Lie Ever Told, about George

22:33.440 --> 22:37.980
Floyd and the rise of Black Lives Matter, is somehow going to be devoid of any agenda

22:37.980 --> 22:40.300
or in any way be entertaining.

22:40.320 --> 22:45.340
But The Daily Wire doesn't just stream bad movies and publish right-wing propaganda masquerade

22:45.340 --> 22:46.340
in his news.

22:46.340 --> 22:50.740
Of course, the major hosts of The Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Matt Walsh, Andrew

22:50.740 --> 22:54.180
Clavin, and Michael Knowles all have their own shows.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.580
Although for some reason Candace Owens is the only one who doesn't get her full name

22:57.580 --> 22:58.580
in the title.

22:58.580 --> 23:02.540
They've also got several regular programs you've probably never heard of, such as

23:02.540 --> 23:06.940
Ben Shapiro's Debunked, where he spends 15 minutes or less misreading science to explain

23:06.940 --> 23:10.060
how climate change is no big deal or that God exists.

23:10.060 --> 23:14.980
There's also Daily Wire Backstage, where Jeremy Boring assembles the bros to engage

23:14.980 --> 23:20.160
in the classic manly pastimes of drinking scotch, smoking cigars, and crying about someone

23:20.160 --> 23:21.940
being mean to them on Twitter.

23:21.940 --> 23:26.420
And then there's Crane and Company, sports coverage that is supposedly not woke.

23:26.420 --> 23:31.180
I've never quite figured out what this means, and looking at the descriptions of their programming,

23:31.180 --> 23:33.860
it mostly seems like pretty standard stuff.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.900
Like when they say the Toronto Maple Leafs are going to blow it in the playoffs, it's

23:36.900 --> 23:38.700
what Leafs fans have known for decades.

23:38.700 --> 23:42.580
The reason they might appeal to the right-wing Daily Wire audience is that part of their

23:42.580 --> 23:45.060
sports coverage includes things like this.

23:45.060 --> 23:50.020
For some context, this little tirade from Jake Crane comes after LeBron James criticized

23:50.020 --> 23:53.940
the US government for not doing enough to free Brittany Greiner, who was arrested in

23:53.940 --> 23:59.020
Russia in February of this year on drug charges, and she has been detained there for over five

23:59.020 --> 24:00.020
months.

24:00.020 --> 24:04.080
Now in most countries around the world, LeBron would have never had the chance to reach the

24:04.080 --> 24:05.620
heights that he has.

24:05.620 --> 24:10.180
But maybe it's time we the people start to push back a little bit on this diva, this

24:10.180 --> 24:16.060
propaganda puppet for the CCP, this race hustler, and the same guy who told an innocent cop,

24:16.060 --> 24:17.100
you're next.

24:17.100 --> 24:21.140
Maybe we should trade LeBron for Brittany so he can start to form an appreciation for

24:21.140 --> 24:22.880
the greatest country on earth.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.660
This is what ESPN is apparently missing.

24:25.660 --> 24:29.460
Long rant about how athletes don't love America enough.

24:29.460 --> 24:33.780
Even if you want to step away from the screen, the Daily Wire is now publishing books, much

24:33.780 --> 24:37.600
in the way their movies are courting conservatives who have talked themselves out of work.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.020
Their book publishing wing is picking up books that were dropped by mainstream outlets.

24:41.020 --> 24:46.140
For example, in April of 2021, Simon & Schuster decided not to publish a book by Sergeant

24:46.140 --> 24:50.760
Jonathan Mattingly, who was one of the officers who fired shots during a narcotics raid that

24:50.760 --> 24:52.140
killed Breonna Taylor.

24:52.140 --> 24:57.020
It was published by the Daily Wire under the title, 12 Seconds in the Dark, a police officer's

24:57.020 --> 24:59.580
first-hand account of the Breonna Taylor raid.

24:59.580 --> 25:02.840
While they've published four books so far, none of them have cracked the New York Times

25:02.840 --> 25:04.160
bestseller list.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.920
I will tell the Daily Wire right now, though, that if they publish another Ben Shapiro novel,

25:07.920 --> 25:10.560
I will make that book a bestseller.

25:10.560 --> 25:15.320
On June 29, 2022, the Daily Wire made another announcement that they were expanding even

25:15.320 --> 25:16.320
further.

25:16.320 --> 25:21.360
To do this, they hosted Daily Wire Backstaged Live at the Ryman, which is a theater in Nashville,

25:21.360 --> 25:23.640
this city where the Daily Wire currently operates out of.

25:23.640 --> 25:28.880
The first hour and 50 minutes of this presentation is a long, drawn-out series of appearances

25:28.880 --> 25:33.760
from many of the faces of the Daily Wire, featuring a lengthy version of their backstage

25:33.760 --> 25:37.480
program live, this time including special guest Candace Owens.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.600
You might have seen that clip of her online talking about how abortion wasn't happening

25:40.600 --> 25:42.080
during the time of slavery.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.520
Amy Schumer, same thing.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.120
She came out and gave a statement about this is exactly what the slaveholders wanted.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.640
And I was like, I would like a further explanation as to what you are talking about when you

25:51.640 --> 25:56.480
make that statement, because there was there was no abortion happening when we had slaves.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.920
What are you what are they saying?

25:57.920 --> 26:01.280
Anyone with some knowledge of history knows that this simply isn't true.

26:01.280 --> 26:05.040
Many forms of abortion have existed for thousands of years, and there were no laws regarding

26:05.040 --> 26:08.080
abortion at all in the United States until 1821.

26:08.080 --> 26:12.320
And it wasn't until the 1860s when abortion became illegal before quickening.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.800
Quickening is when you can first feel kicking inside the womb, roughly 16 to 20 weeks into

26:16.800 --> 26:18.000
a pregnancy.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.480
The real purpose of this evening was to make several special announcements about the Daily

26:21.480 --> 26:26.400
Wire's newest projects and to present the rebranding of their streaming service as Daily

26:26.400 --> 26:27.400
Wire Plus.

26:27.400 --> 26:35.680
I'm proud to announce that as of this very moment, we are launching Daily Wire Plus.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.240
One of the announcements that was completely expected was their kids content initiative,

26:40.240 --> 26:44.400
something that was already announced back in March when they pledged to invest $100

26:44.400 --> 26:47.200
million into the project over three years.

26:47.200 --> 27:00.740
The big reveal here was a trailer for their newest series, Chip Chillas.

27:00.740 --> 27:05.920
This looks completely generic and uninteresting, but hey, I'm an adult, so it's not really

27:05.920 --> 27:06.920
for me.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.840
I do suspect it might get a little political in its content because the kids division is

27:10.840 --> 27:17.180
being fronted by Eric Branscom and Ethan Nicole, who are respectively responsible for the Christian

27:17.180 --> 27:20.460
themed series Veggie Tales and the Babylon Bee.

27:20.460 --> 27:24.180
At the very least, it seems likely that there will be some religious messaging in these

27:24.180 --> 27:25.180
shows.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.620
Also, they already announced this show over two months before this event, except they

27:29.620 --> 27:32.860
were calling it Chilla Time back then.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.940
Suspiciously absent from this event was the other kids show they had already announced,

27:35.940 --> 27:37.980
Doodle with Noodles.

27:37.980 --> 27:41.240
Perhaps they've just run into some legal trouble with the YouTube channel Gourmet Quilter

27:41.240 --> 27:43.540
for stealing the name of one of its segments.

27:43.540 --> 27:47.740
The next announcement was The Daily Wire's continuing partnership with PragerU, where

27:47.740 --> 28:02.860
all of PragerU's content would be made available on Daily Wire Plus.

28:02.860 --> 28:08.460
This announcement seems even stranger, as PragerU's content is largely free already,

28:08.460 --> 28:12.420
and they also announced they would be featuring PragerU content back in 2020.

28:12.420 --> 28:17.140
But there is at least one new exclusive, something called the PragerU Masters Program

28:17.140 --> 28:22.160
with Dennis Prager, videos in which, I imagine, Dennis Prager will offer pearls of wisdom,

28:22.160 --> 28:23.900
such as why marital rape is okay.

28:23.900 --> 28:31.660
If your husband is a good man, if you respect him, if he treats you beautifully, then don't

28:31.660 --> 28:35.720
only allow your mood to determine whether you sleep with him.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.200
That was the thesis of it.

28:37.200 --> 28:41.700
Of course there are times when obviously that will determine, but not always.

28:41.700 --> 28:46.780
Just as mood cannot determine, almost anything good that we do, I don't determine whether

28:46.780 --> 28:49.180
I go to work based on my mood.

28:49.180 --> 28:53.420
Comparing having sex with your spouse with going to work really reveals a lot.

28:53.420 --> 28:57.340
I did take some time to read the article Prager wrote when he was referencing this ridiculous

28:57.340 --> 29:00.940
statement though, and it's even more wild than that clip suggests.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.580
Here's a deranged excerpt.

29:02.580 --> 29:07.620
A husband knows that his wife loves him first and foremost by her willingness to give her

29:07.620 --> 29:09.620
body to him.

29:09.620 --> 29:14.580
This seems not only disrespectful to women, placing their primary value in a relationship

29:14.580 --> 29:20.500
as their body, it also degrades men as deciding to be with someone primarily because of said

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
body.

29:21.500 --> 29:26.060
And this article was actually a two parter where he just digs himself deeper and deeper,

29:26.060 --> 29:29.660
and it reads like this despicable emotional blackmail.

29:29.660 --> 29:32.700
But it does include one section that did make me laugh.

29:32.700 --> 29:36.300
If most women wait until they are in the mood before making love with their husband, many

29:36.300 --> 29:39.820
women will be waiting a month or more until they next have sex.

29:39.820 --> 29:44.380
If a woman is only in the mood once a month or less, I'm going to take a wild guess

29:44.380 --> 29:49.580
that she either has a very unusually low sex drive or perhaps more likely the man in her

29:49.580 --> 29:52.220
life isn't appealing to her sexually.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.940
It is very funny to me that Dennis Prager wrote this.

29:54.940 --> 29:58.820
Going back to the Daily Wire thing, the big announcement that evening wasn't some forgettable

29:58.820 --> 30:03.100
cartoon or Dennis Prager once again revealing himself to be a monster, it was the announcement

30:03.100 --> 30:16.460
that the Daily Wire would be producing content with Jordan Peterson.

30:16.460 --> 30:21.100
The crowd, as you can tell from that reaction, are very excited.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.740
At this event, Jordan Peterson seemed a bit off.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.460
His usual word salad wasn't full effect, but he struggled to lift his gaze from the

30:27.460 --> 30:31.740
ground and seemed to be spending less time on building caveats to everything he was saying

30:31.740 --> 30:34.980
and instead drifted into entirely different subjects.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.340
Maybe it was an off night for him, though considering his recent health concerns, we

30:38.340 --> 30:41.460
might be seeing some of the lasting impact of those challenges.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.100
Either way, it was kind of sad to watch.

30:44.100 --> 30:48.180
This announcement did mean we would be getting more slickly produced Jordan Peterson content,

30:48.180 --> 30:55.300
including one of the best new memes of the year.

30:55.300 --> 30:59.380
And that was about all the new content people can expect on Daily Wire Plus.

30:59.380 --> 31:04.100
A kid show that was already announced, a new PragerU show, and a new Jordan Peterson

31:04.100 --> 31:05.100
series.

31:05.100 --> 31:09.820
We didn't get a trailer for their next upcoming movie or any information on their TV series

31:09.820 --> 31:11.820
that they teased a year and a half ago.

31:11.820 --> 31:15.960
The main reason for this event seems more like a push to generate as many subscribers

31:15.960 --> 31:33.320
now so they can afford the content they want to make in the future.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.880
The Daily Wire doesn't sound like the storming success they act like.

31:36.880 --> 31:41.440
If they were a startup, it would be more understandable, but it's been a year and a half since they

31:41.440 --> 31:43.200
announced their plans to go into movies.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.580
And if their new initiatives are as compelling as Shut In or Terror on the Prairie, it hardly

31:47.580 --> 31:49.120
seems like a wise investment.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.080
It's really hard to know how well the Daily Wire is doing financially.

31:52.080 --> 31:57.360
I found a few numbers detailing their performance, but since their records are all private, it's

31:57.360 --> 31:59.120
tough to really piece together anything.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.560
Here's what level I could find.

32:01.560 --> 32:05.440
According to their website, when the Daily Wire was launched in 2015, it did so with

32:05.440 --> 32:09.000
investment from Ferris Wilkes, a billionaire in the fracking industry.

32:09.440 --> 32:13.440
It's a bit unclear if they still receive any funding from Wilkes, though reading their

32:13.440 --> 32:15.800
former About section on their website, it reads,

32:29.800 --> 32:33.680
This statement, of course, doesn't mean that the Daily Wire isn't still receiving money

32:33.680 --> 32:38.480
from Ferris Wilkes separately or through one of the other entities controlled by the brothers.

32:38.480 --> 32:42.080
And the Wilkes brothers have a long history of supporting right-wing causes in the past,

32:42.080 --> 32:47.480
such as providing funding for PragerU and the 2016 presidential campaign for Ted Cruz.

32:47.480 --> 32:51.200
This very defensive-sounding About section has since been replaced with something more

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
generic.

32:52.200 --> 32:57.200
In 2022, speaking to Axios, co-founder of the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring claimed that

32:57.200 --> 33:03.200
they had a 12-month revenue of $100 million in January of 2022, up from $65 million in

33:03.200 --> 33:04.720
the previous year.

33:04.720 --> 33:09.160
According to Forbes in April of 2022, Boring claimed that the Daily Wire had a run rate

33:09.160 --> 33:15.120
of $150 million a year, a run rate being a predictor of future performance for the company.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.720
He also said they had 600,000 subscribers.

33:18.720 --> 33:25.280
At the June live event, he revealed that the current subscriber count is now 890,000.

33:25.280 --> 33:31.440
We have hit a huge milestone, 890,000 active subscribers.

33:32.000 --> 33:39.200
A nearly 50% increase in subscribers in the space of two months is pretty stunning, though

33:39.200 --> 33:43.340
aside from Matt Walsh's documentary, I'm not sure what changed for the streaming service

33:43.340 --> 33:46.080
between April and June to lead to such a big jump.

33:46.080 --> 33:50.440
In a press release, the newly revised run rate for the company was up to $200 million

33:50.440 --> 33:51.440
a year.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.880
It does seem strange that, with a subscriber increase of nearly 50%, the run rate has only

33:55.880 --> 33:57.760
gone up by 25%.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.880
But I have no idea how they're calculating their future growth, so maybe it all makes

34:00.880 --> 34:03.520
sense if you can see their actual numbers.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.600
Subscribers aren't the only source of revenue for the company, they also run a number of

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
ads in their content.

34:07.600 --> 34:11.360
It's hard to estimate exactly what they're earning in these ad spots, but presumably

34:11.360 --> 34:14.040
it must be a sizable portion of their revenue.

34:14.040 --> 34:18.360
So of the few metrics we have, the Daily Wire seems to be making decent money.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.360
Whether or not they're covering their expenses, which includes producing several movies and

34:22.360 --> 34:27.720
documentaries, web shows, kids programming and their book publishing, selling razors,

34:27.720 --> 34:31.440
and of course, paying their 200 employees, it's not entirely clear that they can afford

34:31.440 --> 34:33.280
all of these enterprises.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.680
Boring was adamant about not taking the company public, though.

34:36.680 --> 34:43.240
Where does this $100 million come from?

34:43.240 --> 34:47.440
I'm wondering myself.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.480
I can tell you this.

34:48.480 --> 34:53.080
The Daily Wire has been approached by six different entities in the last three months

34:53.080 --> 34:56.760
about doing a public offering by way of a SPAC.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.520
And we have said no.

35:00.520 --> 35:04.160
Not being publicly traded also means that their financial statements will not be readable

35:04.160 --> 35:05.160
by the public.

35:05.160 --> 35:09.040
So while Boring did tease that the company may go public in the future, it remaining

35:09.040 --> 35:13.120
private lets them operate without us having any real insight to how they're doing financially,

35:13.120 --> 35:16.760
aside from what they say in their marketing, which obviously is going to put them in their

35:16.760 --> 35:18.360
best light possible.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.880
Boring also had fun sharing less helpful statistics.

35:21.880 --> 35:27.320
And for 18 months over the last two years, we were the number one publisher in the world,

35:27.320 --> 35:32.000
the most engaged publisher in not the most engaged conservative publisher, not the most

35:32.000 --> 35:37.360
engaged news publisher, the most engaged publisher of any kind in the world on the number one

35:37.360 --> 35:41.360
platform, Facebook.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.480
This is a very convoluted stat.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.440
For one, those 18 months are not consecutive if they were across two years.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.920
And while social media traction is important, it's strange to mention Facebook and only

35:51.920 --> 35:56.160
Facebook and engagement doesn't mean getting the most views on the platform, but rather

35:56.160 --> 35:58.760
getting the most reaction from viewers.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.320
That is getting people to click one of those little reaction buttons on the page.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.640
Unsurprisingly, political content designed to enrage or rile people up gets a lot of

36:06.640 --> 36:07.640
clicks.

36:07.640 --> 36:12.040
In October of 2020, Facebook pushed back against the idea that engagement reflects overall

36:12.040 --> 36:16.440
popularity with an article that shows how political content is more likely to get engagement

36:16.440 --> 36:21.200
but tends to rank much lower in overall reach compared to content from more neutral sources

36:21.200 --> 36:23.480
such as videos with cute animals.

36:23.480 --> 36:28.200
The data being from 2020 may not be entirely applicable to the present, but it does underscore

36:28.200 --> 36:33.200
how engagement is a selective stat that doesn't necessarily reflect overall popularity on

36:33.200 --> 36:34.400
the platform.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.880
Of course, that doesn't mean that it's a meaningless stat or that the Daily Wire is

36:37.880 --> 36:38.880
doing poorly.

36:38.880 --> 36:42.000
High engagement is obviously a very good thing for them.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.760
Much like their financial numbers, we should just take this stat with a grain of salt as

36:45.760 --> 36:47.660
it's obviously part of their marketing.

36:47.660 --> 36:52.040
But there is an interesting strategy being deployed by the Daily Wire regarding its social

36:52.040 --> 36:54.840
media success, particularly on Facebook.

36:54.840 --> 36:59.320
According to research from The Markup, a non-partisan, non-profit data research organization, the

36:59.320 --> 37:04.160
Daily Wire strategy isn't really to target all Americans, but instead be the destination

37:04.160 --> 37:05.480
for conservatives.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.140
And their online marketing reveals their partisan approach.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.960
This is in stark contrast to other media outlets which cast a wider net.

37:11.960 --> 37:16.800
The Markup article includes comments from Francesca Tripodi, an assistant professor

37:16.800 --> 37:20.800
at UNC School of Information and Library Sciences at Chapel Hill.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.800
She said,

37:21.800 --> 37:25.400
As you're looking at this dataset, to me it shows that mainstream media outlets like

37:25.400 --> 37:29.400
the New York Times are still approaching the internet as a collective space in which you

37:29.400 --> 37:34.920
could potentially learn about anything, from research or science to family and relationships.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.800
But Daily Wire, if you're saying, we only want to target people who are interested in

37:38.800 --> 37:43.600
conservatism in America, that creates this bifurcated or dual internet, and that allows

37:43.600 --> 37:46.200
for information to circulate unchecked.

37:46.200 --> 37:50.080
This means the Daily Wire's success isn't necessarily coming from the mainstream, but

37:50.080 --> 37:54.920
rather it's targeting a specific audience, and that audience is incredibly receptive

37:54.920 --> 37:55.920
to their message.

37:55.920 --> 38:00.080
The Daily Wire is behaving less like a traditional media outlet, attempting to spread news to

38:00.080 --> 38:04.520
everyone and more like a corporation targeting potential customers looking for a very specific

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
product.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.160
An example used in the article is that they're acting like a food brand serving ads to people

38:09.160 --> 38:10.840
who like potato chips.

38:10.840 --> 38:15.080
The Markup also found that the Daily Wire uses a lot of tracking tools.

38:15.080 --> 38:21.240
Using Blacklight, a website privacy inspector, on August 4th, 2021, they found 41 ad trackers

38:21.240 --> 38:25.320
and 117 third party cookies on the Daily Wire's homepage.

38:25.320 --> 38:30.120
In comparison, looking at the 100,000 most popular websites in September of 2020, on

38:30.120 --> 38:34.920
average they used 7 ad trackers and 3 third party cookies.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.720
In addition to making use of tracking tools and targeting specific communities, the Daily

38:38.720 --> 38:42.800
Wire also invests a lot of money in sponsored posts promoting its content.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.720
Earlier this year, Vice published an article detailing how the Daily Wire spent between

38:46.720 --> 38:53.180
$35,000 and $47,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads promoting articles about the lawsuit between

38:53.180 --> 38:54.860
Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.

38:54.860 --> 38:59.280
One article in particular about the supposed character assassination of Johnny Depp had

38:59.280 --> 39:04.560
somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000 alone promoting it by the Daily Wire.

39:04.560 --> 39:09.000
Unsurprisingly, these articles included misinformation about the trial with the major article I

39:09.000 --> 39:13.200
just mentioned having to include an embarrassing editor's note correcting the fact that Johnny

39:13.200 --> 39:17.200
Depp did not disprove 12 of the 14 allegations against him.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.720
But I want to highlight just how much money is being spent by the Daily Wire to promote

39:20.720 --> 39:22.560
their coverage of a single news story.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.120
While we don't have concrete numbers on how much the Daily Wire spent on social media

39:26.120 --> 39:30.920
ads in general, we can be sure their engagement is being driven by more than organic interest

39:30.920 --> 39:32.680
in their content.

39:32.680 --> 39:37.000
While this may paint the picture that the Daily Wire is particularly good at gaming

39:37.000 --> 39:41.920
Facebook systems to build an audience further content, we also need to take into consideration

39:41.920 --> 39:46.000
its history with the platform and how it built such a following on Facebook.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.760
A 2019 article on popular information highlighted 14 large Facebook pages that seemingly operated

39:52.760 --> 39:56.080
as independent outfits, sharing right-wing news stories.

39:56.080 --> 40:00.600
These 14 pages were fairly popular with a combined total of 8 million fans, and they

40:00.600 --> 40:06.560
all had generic names such as conservative news or don't mess with America.

40:06.560 --> 40:11.640
Only these supposedly independent outlets exclusively reposted Daily Wire articles,

40:11.640 --> 40:16.360
with many of them making identical posts down to the same minute, meaning these 14 pages

40:16.360 --> 40:21.720
all, coincidentally, only thought the Daily Wire posted anything worth sharing and all

40:21.720 --> 40:24.840
shared new articles the second they went live.

40:24.840 --> 40:29.360
Or what was more likely here is that these supposedly independent pages were all being

40:29.360 --> 40:35.160
secretly operated by the Daily Wire, which would be in violation of Facebook's rules.

40:35.160 --> 40:39.160
When this 2019 article was published, all of these pages would eventually update their

40:39.160 --> 40:42.960
about sections to include the line, proudly managed by the Daily Wire.

40:42.960 --> 40:47.400
Although for some reason don't mess with America's page only reads, proudly managed

40:47.400 --> 40:48.620
be.

40:48.620 --> 40:52.360
This newfound pride over their management only became clear after Facebook updated its

40:52.360 --> 40:56.580
transparency standards and only after this strategy was exposed.

40:56.580 --> 41:01.100
The popular information article also highlights how, by not disclosing this relationship,

41:01.100 --> 41:04.240
the Daily Wire was in violation of Facebook's terms of service.

41:04.240 --> 41:08.820
In the past, similar behavior from other groups had led to those pages being banned, but the

41:08.820 --> 41:12.060
Daily Wire seems to have been given a pass.

41:12.060 --> 41:15.600
Also in this same article, they spoke to a former Facebook employee who identified a

41:15.600 --> 41:21.000
bias towards right-wing media by Joel Kaplan, Facebook's head of global public policy

41:21.000 --> 41:24.320
and a former member of the George W. Bush administration.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.080
The former employee is quoted saying,

41:26.080 --> 41:30.720
"...anytime there is an issue with Breitbart or Daily Caller, Joel made the decision, and

41:30.720 --> 41:32.880
he always acted to protect them."

41:32.880 --> 41:37.960
There was also that well-documented 2019 dinner between Ben Shapiro and Mark Zuckerberg that

41:37.960 --> 41:42.040
was held to supposedly talk about free speech on the platform.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.720
It also puts into perspective that Facebook story I mentioned a bit earlier about the

41:45.720 --> 41:47.560
limitations of engagement.

41:47.560 --> 41:51.480
I do still think it has valid information highlighting that engagement isn't the end

41:51.480 --> 41:56.720
of the story and it isn't the best stat to monitor success on Facebook, but it could

41:56.720 --> 42:00.820
also be that Facebook is instead trying a way to spin the news that their algorithm

42:00.820 --> 42:03.360
is pushing right-wing media so hard.

42:03.360 --> 42:08.820
Far from being silenced by big tech, allying the Daily Wire love saying it by themselves,

42:08.820 --> 42:13.980
when it comes to the Facebook platform specifically, the Daily Wire seems to be given more space

42:13.980 --> 42:18.140
to break the rules and they have access to the biggest guy in the company.

42:18.140 --> 42:22.780
Even though these days, those 14 aforementioned Facebook pages aren't the driving force

42:22.780 --> 42:27.340
and don't get quite as much engagement as, say, Ben Shapiro sharing a story would, I

42:27.340 --> 42:29.880
think it's important to remember their foundational work.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.340
It was crucial in building up the Daily Wire's audience in its earliest years and it reveals

42:34.340 --> 42:38.980
that the secret to their growth isn't genuine organic interest in their content, but rather

42:38.980 --> 42:42.980
the Daily Wire exploiting their relationship with Facebook to cheat the system in ways

42:42.980 --> 42:44.980
other publishers couldn't.

42:44.980 --> 42:48.920
Forgettable movies, the gnashing of conservative teeth, and an aggressive social media campaign

42:48.920 --> 42:50.900
that courts a right-wing audience.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.800
What does any of this mean?

42:52.800 --> 42:56.220
What the Daily Wire is attempting to do is create an all-encompassing bubble for right-wing

42:56.220 --> 42:57.220
media.

42:57.220 --> 43:01.860
They may talk a big game about taking on Disney or Netflix and when it comes to profits, maybe

43:01.860 --> 43:03.380
that really is the dream.

43:03.380 --> 43:06.940
But looking at their current strategy, it's less built on appealing to the mainstream

43:06.940 --> 43:12.260
in some kind of bid to replace them and instead appealing directly to conservative audiences.

43:12.260 --> 43:16.100
Looking back on its movies, content they allege is politically neutral, they market

43:16.100 --> 43:20.900
this content as rejecting the mainstream supposedly woke voices of Disney.

43:20.900 --> 43:24.780
They say quite explicitly that these movies are for people who feel as though Hollywood

43:24.780 --> 43:25.780
hates them.

43:25.780 --> 43:29.620
They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their

43:29.620 --> 43:33.540
sports, but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content, at least

43:33.540 --> 43:35.860
everyone at the top, hates you.

43:35.860 --> 43:39.860
You have to watch it knowing that every dollar you spend on theater tickets, on cable bills,

43:39.860 --> 43:43.500
on streaming subscriptions is going to the people that hate you, funding their hatred

43:43.500 --> 43:44.500
of you.

43:44.500 --> 43:47.860
Not only that, but they're going to spend every day on Twitter, every spare moment at

43:47.860 --> 43:53.060
every award show, and just about every second of every show that they make reminding you

43:53.060 --> 43:55.220
of the fact that they hate you.

43:55.220 --> 44:00.300
Their concept of the average American happens to be the American who agrees with them.

44:00.300 --> 44:02.360
In other words, conservatives.

44:02.360 --> 44:06.580
By offering a program that includes sports, kid's shows, political commentary, documentaries

44:06.580 --> 44:10.860
and TikTok-style videos, they are trying to appeal to as many people as possible, who

44:10.860 --> 44:12.860
adhere to their conservative values.

44:12.860 --> 44:16.060
And once they have these people, I suspect the goal is to keep them trapped in their

44:16.060 --> 44:19.740
media bubble, and to own the conservative media niche.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.960
This isn't a new strategy, and we can see something similar when it comes to the world

44:22.960 --> 44:24.700
of Christian media.

44:24.700 --> 44:35.460
The Left Behind books, which tell the story about how the rapture will affect the world,

44:35.460 --> 44:37.940
have sold over 65 million copies.

44:37.940 --> 44:41.380
Unless you're a fan of the cinematic stylings of Kirk Cameron or Nicolas Cage, there's

44:41.380 --> 44:44.180
a pretty good chance you haven't heard of them, but they've sold more copies than

44:44.180 --> 44:47.420
the Magic School Bus, the Hardy Boys, and Tarzan.

44:47.420 --> 44:51.500
The Christian music scene, which, while often a punchline in the mainstream, has been chugging

44:51.500 --> 44:55.500
along for decades, making stars and earning millions of dollars.

44:55.500 --> 44:59.220
And if you watch certain videos here on YouTube, you might even be familiar with the Christian

44:59.220 --> 45:03.900
movie scene, which includes the classics God's Not Dead, Christmas with a capital C, and

45:03.900 --> 45:05.340
Heaven is for Real.

45:05.340 --> 45:09.300
And naturally, Christian movies have their own streaming service, Pure Flix.

45:09.300 --> 45:12.980
The Christian media scene has existed for decades, and it's been making huge amounts

45:12.980 --> 45:14.340
of money the whole time.

45:14.340 --> 45:18.100
Part of what makes it work is that it has a faithful audience that is, sometimes, ready

45:18.100 --> 45:21.460
to spend big money for media that reaffirms their worldview.

45:21.460 --> 45:23.780
Although in the world of Christian media, there are many different stakeholders and

45:23.780 --> 45:26.420
platforms offering their own services.

45:26.420 --> 45:30.700
Products and industries with their own ecosystems have always existed, of course, usually occupying

45:30.700 --> 45:31.700
niches.

45:31.700 --> 45:34.900
If you're a fan of anime, you get your own little section on Netflix, or you can get

45:34.900 --> 45:36.660
streaming services directly for that.

45:36.660 --> 45:39.940
And of course, there's merch, movie screens, and other fun bonuses that come with being

45:39.940 --> 45:40.940
into it.

45:40.940 --> 45:44.680
What separates Christian media from niche interests like these, though, is that it builds

45:44.680 --> 45:49.740
this strange parallel universe by explicitly rejecting the mainstream, unless the mainstream

45:49.740 --> 45:53.020
accepts them, to create its own bubble of content.

45:53.020 --> 45:57.140
A random person can probably name an anime, but unless someone is in that Christian media

45:57.140 --> 46:01.380
bubble, whether they're enjoying it as an insider or mocking it as an outsider, you'd

46:01.380 --> 46:05.340
be hard-pressed to find many people who have even heard of the biggest hits in that space.

46:05.340 --> 46:08.780
If you took a random sample of people, I think the odds are pretty good that more of them

46:08.780 --> 46:12.340
would recognize Dragon Ball than they would Gods Not Dead.

46:12.340 --> 46:15.100
Also for the record, I'm pretty sure Goku could beat up Kevin Sorbo.

46:15.100 --> 46:18.780
The Daily Wire is taking this strategy of creating an insular bubble of content and

46:18.780 --> 46:23.020
going a step further, creating a parallel landscape for conservative media, but trying

46:23.020 --> 46:27.180
to do it all themselves in what might become one giant company.

46:27.180 --> 46:31.780
They want to be the one-stop-shop for anything and everything in the conservative media space,

46:31.780 --> 46:35.180
and to capture that audience that supposedly feels threatened by the mainstream.

46:35.180 --> 46:38.660
And if they aren't feeling threatened, then the Daily Wire is happy to publish all the

46:38.660 --> 46:41.060
propaganda they need to create that fear.

46:41.060 --> 46:44.300
I'm not enough of a media expert to make any predictions on whether or not they'll

46:44.300 --> 46:45.300
be succeeding.

46:45.300 --> 46:49.140
It is pretty plain that they are spending a lot of money, not just on production, but

46:49.140 --> 46:51.100
on marketing for all of their content.

46:51.100 --> 46:54.580
One of the things they touted during their media presentation, and in many other instances

46:54.580 --> 46:58.620
when they speak to the public, is their platform's ability to market content.

46:58.620 --> 47:02.620
Part of that seems to be the unwavering devotion their core audience seems to have, willing

47:02.620 --> 47:06.740
to buy razors or children's books if the Daily Wire tells them to.

47:06.740 --> 47:11.100
How else can one explain them selling these ridiculous truth bombs on their website for

47:11.100 --> 47:12.100
$174?

47:12.100 --> 47:16.700
Though it does remain to be seen just how large this core audience is, and how much

47:16.700 --> 47:19.340
more the Daily Wire can expand it.

47:19.340 --> 47:23.220
The success of the Daily Wire's media venture rests on the idea that they can continue to

47:23.220 --> 47:26.260
expand their audience and recoup all these expenses.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.620
Jeremy Boring repeatedly emphasized the need for the Daily Wire to keep growing.

47:30.620 --> 47:34.220
Some of that, I'm sure, is motivated by the profit they want to make, but it's probably

47:34.220 --> 47:38.300
a necessity to pay for all these projects that are likely in need for funding.

47:38.300 --> 47:42.220
The fate of this media venture may reflect, in dollars and cents, the strength of the

47:42.220 --> 47:44.140
conservative movement in America.

47:44.140 --> 47:47.700
If it truly does have the popular support it would require to fund all of this, then

47:47.700 --> 47:53.200
it may very well be that the niche of American conservatives is enough to build a media empire.

47:53.200 --> 47:57.320
But if it fails, it would instead reflect how the American public isn't as conservative

47:57.320 --> 47:59.640
as the Daily Wire imagined them to be.

47:59.640 --> 48:03.680
Or it might fail and prove that the Daily Wire was never any good at producing media

48:03.680 --> 48:06.600
outside of hate-fueled clickbait.

48:06.600 --> 48:10.880
This video is a little different from my previous ones as it kind of feels like two videos squished

48:10.880 --> 48:15.240
together, but I just felt as though the two subjects complimented each other really well

48:15.240 --> 48:19.680
and when talking about the Daily Wire, I wanted to go a bit deeper than just looking at a

48:19.680 --> 48:23.000
movie or only looking at their business ventures.

48:23.040 --> 48:26.400
So I hope this fits together well enough and that you enjoyed it.

48:26.400 --> 48:30.360
And if you really enjoyed it, do consider becoming a patron or a member for the channel.

48:30.360 --> 48:33.200
You can see the names of some of those people on the screen right now and don't they look

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
lovely?

48:34.200 --> 48:38.520
They also get early access to videos along with some other fun bonuses that I surprise

48:38.520 --> 48:40.160
them with every now and again.

48:40.160 --> 48:44.320
If you would like to support this channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,

48:44.320 --> 48:48.040
subscribe, hit the bell for notifications, and also consider sharing it on social media

48:48.040 --> 48:49.040
because that helps out too.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.800
If you'd like to leave a comment and don't know what to say, how about pitching your

48:52.800 --> 48:58.440
idea for a movie for the Daily Wire and maybe they'll read it into it.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.600
Thank you all so much for watching.
