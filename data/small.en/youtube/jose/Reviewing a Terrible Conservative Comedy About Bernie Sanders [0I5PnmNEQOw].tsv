0	5200	I didn't expect this movie about Bernie Sanders' life to have so much sex stuff.
12880	16880	In December of 2020, the world was given a satirical movie about the life of Bernie
16880	21840	Sanders titled Free Lunch Express. It follows Sanders from his early days,
21840	26560	starting with his blood pact with Joseph Stalin to his more recent years where he was
26560	30720	nearly murdered by Hillary Clinton. Most movies about the lives of politicians don't have a lot
30720	35360	of laughs in them, and Free Lunch Express is no exception. Unlike a serious drama such as
35360	40320	Spielberg's Lincoln, this movie about the life of Bernie Sanders was supposed to be a comedy.
40320	45120	According to its writer-producer-director Lenny Britton, its mission first and foremost
45120	47920	was to be funny. Here's how the movie does a joke.
56560	64640	It's only going to get worse from here.
64640	69040	The relationship a biopic has to historical facts tells us a lot about what the filmmaker's
69040	74320	concerns are. Most politicians have very rich, complex lives, and the details a filmmaker decides
74320	79360	to focus on reveals what part of their lives we as an audience are being told are most relevant to
79360	83760	whatever point the movie is trying to make. A satire is obviously going to take some liberties
83760	87840	with the subject's history for the purposes of humor. I'm sure no one watching this movie is
87840	91920	going to think that the whole blood pact thing with Stalin actually happened, nor would anyone
91920	96400	assume Bernie Sanders is actually having these Jojo Rabbit-esque moments where he talks to
96400	102960	an imaginary Stalin. This stuff is all fine. Well, not fine. It's completely devoid of humor,
102960	107680	but conceptually I can understand this attempt at humor being in a satire movie. It still makes
107680	112400	sense. The interesting parts of this movie start cropping up from the supposed facts that inform
112400	118480	some of these satirical twists, the true events that one would need to make a biopic. These changes
118480	122960	to Bernie Sanders' life seem less like an attempted humor and more like a misunderstanding
122960	126240	of the basic facts of his life. Here's one example. In the movie,
126240	129360	Sanders goes to Moscow with his first wife for their honeymoon.
129360	134480	We're going to Moscow on a honeymoon. Oh, Moscow? Really? You sure you don't want to just go to
134480	142480	Youngstown? Youngstown? Ugh. Seeing Moscow has always been my lifelong dream.
142480	146720	The right-wing character of Bernie Sanders is that he's such a committed communist that he went to
146720	151680	Moscow for his honeymoon. This isn't the joke. This is the setup for the joke. And if Bernie
151680	156080	Sanders' life is supposed to be setting up this comedy, it makes some glaring mistakes with the
156080	161200	facts here. Let's go over some of the problems. First off, Sanders and his first wife, Deborah
161200	165920	Schilling, never went to Moscow. They were married in the 1960s and the only traveling they
165920	170720	did I could find was a trip to Israel to work on a kibbutz, which was before they married.
170720	175600	They were only married for a few years, divorcing in the 1960s. The next problem is Bernie's trip
175600	180320	to Moscow happened in the 1980s. And even though it did happen the day after a second marriage to
180320	184720	Jane O'Meara, it wasn't a honeymoon, but actually a part of his official business as mayor of
184720	190320	Burlington, Vermont. And I should also mention that Sanders' second marriage is depicted in this movie
190320	197440	after he becomes senator in 2007, when in reality it was in 1988. That's a lot of stuff to get wrong.
197440	202800	And all of these facts were completely butchered so we can get this scene in Moscow where Sanders'
202800	207360	first wife is so disgusted with her honeymoon destination that she divorces him on the spot
207360	211840	and Bernie fakes having sex with her to impress his Soviet comrades who are listening in on them.
211840	223200	This exemplifies the movie's relationship with its subject history.
223200	228000	The joke isn't, let's pretend Bernie went to Moscow on his honeymoon. The joke is,
228000	233280	Bernie faked having sex on his Moscow honeymoon. You have to accept the lie in the premise to get
233280	238000	the joke. And the joke isn't even funny, so why bother with any of this? We aren't watching a
238080	241760	movie about the life of Bernie Sanders, we're watching a movie about a right-wing caricature
241760	247520	of Bernie Sanders with some bad jokes thrown at. Here's another example. In 1972, Bernie Sanders
247520	252880	wrote an essay about gender roles titled Man and Woman for an alternative newspaper that used some
252880	258320	rather tasteless creative imagery. It resurfaced in 2015 as part of an article in Mother Jones.
258320	262480	And while the spokesperson from his campaign distanced Sanders from the nearly 50-year-old
262480	267760	article, some hate was made about Sanders being some kind of S&M fanatic. Free Lunch
267760	271840	Express takes that misunderstanding from the right and makes this version of Bernie Sanders
271840	276320	some kind of sexually repressed guy who's constantly trying to get his S&M erotica published.
276320	294800	This, I suspect, is the basis for another tasteless joke where we meet Sanders' parents
294800	299760	who, for some reason, are really into hooking up. We meet them once in the opening scenes,
299760	303760	and then later on in the movie when Bernie is campaigning for political office. The joke,
303760	307520	I guess, is that older people with an active sex life are funny.
308080	313280	The truth is Sanders' parents had passed away before he was 22, well before he became a
313280	319440	politician. Keeping them alive for this lame joke seems pointlessly cruel and a needless explanation
319440	325120	for a lie about Bernie Sanders having some kind of repressed sexuality. There are so many instances
325120	328880	like this that I'm not sure how someone can really understand what this movie is saying without
328880	332800	having that right-wing caricature of Sanders in mind. And if you went into this movie having
332800	336720	never heard of Bernie Sanders, you would be no closer to understanding most of the basics of his
336720	341680	life, aside from him being a politician. I should reiterate that a movie, especially a satire,
341680	345920	doesn't need to be completely historically accurate, but when the real parts of a subject's
345920	350880	story that are highlighted are complete fiction, it reveals how worthless this movie is in depicting
350880	355920	its subject's life. It's a huge waste. And speaking of huge wastes, much to my own personal
355920	360880	heartbreak, Malcolm McDowell is in this movie as the narrator. He recently gave an interview about
360880	365120	this role in the movie and, to hear him tell it, he was apparently bored sitting at home without
365120	368880	much to do, thought the script was funny enough, and signed on to be the narrator.
369040	372480	They asked me to do it, and it was right in the middle of the pandemic, so
373200	379200	when there was nothing happening at all, and they all came up, everyone was in a bubble 12 feet away
379200	388640	and massed, whipped the mass off just to do the shoot. So it was sort of fun. It was fun doing it.
389280	393200	I wouldn't be surprised if he had only worked a day or two to deliver all his lines.
393200	395200	And, wow, to see deliver.
411280	415840	Hammy, over the top, and constantly silly, it's a performance that's both delightful and
415840	421680	completely above the likes of this movie. And I feel I have to defend McDowell's honor here.
421680	426160	While I don't know for certain what Malcolm McDowell's politics are, I suspect he's not a huge
426160	431600	fan of Donald Trump. From what I could gather in that recent interview, he's a Kamala Harris guy.
431600	439840	And, of course, the vice president nomination, now the elect, who is a terrific candidate, I think,
439840	445200	I mean, she's really wonderful. So I guess Malcolm McDowell's in the K hive. That's better than being
445200	450400	MAGA. And in an interview with Salon, McDowell's philosophy on making movies is beautifully summed
450400	455680	up by this quote. The whole point with careers is, and I learned this at a young age, you are not
455680	460240	going to make that many great movies in your life. So what's one more to the pile, I guess?
460880	465680	The narration was designed to fill in the gaps of the plot, sometimes jumping years into the future.
466320	471360	Strangely, there are these weird mockumentary type interviews with a few figures supposedly
471360	477840	from Sanders past. These interviews only exist in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, though,
477840	483200	and then it just stops using them. Is this movie still a mockumentary if it only keeps
483200	487760	it up for the first quarter of the movie? It makes me suspect some ball was dropped during
487760	497360	a script rewrite and no one bothered to fix it. And speaking of lazy, let's look at some more of
497360	502000	the humor in this movie. Here's one example where Bernie is getting political advice from Ben and
502080	508800	Jerry of Ben and Jerry Ice Cream fame while getting high in the park. Ben and or Jerry gave
508800	517760	Bernie the most unfortunate of ideas. But you're hot. The joke here, I guess, is that Ben and Jerry
517760	523760	are gay. How is this a joke, though? In real life, they aren't, but why would it be funny if they were?
524320	529280	Another example of this movie's humor comes when we meet Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez late in the movie.
529280	534800	Here we are, two people of different generations trying to take the country downtown to socialism
534800	541440	town, Cory. Yeah, sure, sure. Sounding completely unlike herself, we see AOC speaking with an
541440	546560	accent and dropping it in some casual Spanish. It doesn't really sound like her at all. And even if
546560	552400	she did sound like this, why is it funny that she would have an accent? The idea here seems to be
552400	556640	that the left is hiding their identity and when the cameras stop rolling, they reveal the parts
556640	561360	of their identity that would supposedly hurt their popularity. But if anything, I think being
561360	566000	gay would win Ben and Jerry, who are very supportive of gay rights, more support within that community.
566000	572720	And AOC having an accent probably wouldn't bother a district that's 56% Hispanic. But I suspect this
572720	578160	movie isn't targeting an audience that might not find humor in two men being gay or a Hispanic
578160	583440	woman having an accent. It speaks volumes as to what this movie is trying to pass off as humor.
584160	588480	And speaking of that, did you really think a lazy right-wing movie mocking Bernie Sanders
588480	591280	wasn't going to have a little bit of anti-Semitism in it?
606720	610320	It's the adjectives that really hammer home the Jewish stereotypes here.
610320	614640	Ultimately, I think the reason this movie fails so completely is, aside from the lack of talent of
614640	619200	almost everyone involved, is it makes no effort to understand its subjects beyond the right-wing
619200	623920	caricature of him. Creating a movie that presents its subject in a way only those who despise Bernie
623920	628880	Sanders the most would be able to appreciate. And the humor is crafted with this audience in mind.
628880	633120	To the average person, at least based on the audience reviews for this movie, none of this
633120	638560	stuff is funny. But perhaps we need some perspective. Let's look at a similar movie.
638560	643760	In Oliver Stone's W, we get a satirical look at the life of George W. Bush, following him from
643760	648800	his days in college right up to his time in office as the 43rd president of the United States.
648800	653280	Although a film limited in its scope and perhaps not as attached to reality as it often presents
653280	657840	itself, W does distinguish itself from Free Lunch Express in that it presents a more complete
657840	662480	picture of its subject. It shows us the influence of George Bush Sr. on his son and how W's
662480	666720	relationship with him supposedly motivated his drive to be more than a perpetual failure,
666720	670560	and to right the wrong he believes his father made in Iraq. We also get a portrait of how
670560	675120	the Bush family's privilege carried a mediocre man to the highest office in the land as he's
675120	679920	surrounded by skilled political operatives and bequeathed his spot in politics by his very
679920	684880	successful father. And a number of scenes within this movie are created using verifiable moments
684880	689440	from Bush's past, sometimes recreating famous speeches or hearings with the film's performers.
690000	695040	Comparatively, Free Lunch Express never explores Sanders' motivation aside from being upset that
695040	699920	he was bullied in school. His political ambitions are supposedly driven by stealing campaign money,
699920	704240	something I couldn't find any evidence of him having done, and his political success is largely
704240	709040	presented as a lucky accident. One interesting similarity these two movies have is how they
709040	714000	explain the rises to power by their respective subjects. Sanders and Bush aren't presented too
714000	718960	favorably in their respective movies, so their rises to power are similar in that they're both
718960	724080	shabby dudes who fail upwards into their success. Both movies advance the idea that neither of these
724080	729520	two earned their way into future success. In W we see a shocking ambivalence at times, such as
729520	734480	President Bush giving out t-shirts to soldiers wounded in Iraq and in Free Lunch Express. Bernie
734480	738960	never even whispers about Medicare for All until it's time to make a deal with Hillary Clinton.
738960	743600	The idea that either of these men could care at all about the people they represent is never
743600	749200	seriously considered. Considering Bernie's whole brand is standing up for the little guy and he has
749200	753680	a history of activism and political engagement, ignoring these parts of his history seemed like
753680	759360	a deliberate effort to not understand him as a subject or at least not present these very real
759360	764880	parts of his history. These movies have a lot in common in that respect and it reveals that making
764880	769040	a movie like this is often designed to be a political statement rather than strictly a
769040	774560	comedy or a depiction of history. In W there are some notable omissions regarding the Bush
774560	779440	presidency. There's no mention of the terrorist attack on September 11th or the devastation of
779440	784160	Hurricane Katrina. It's a movie primarily concerned with trying to understand how the invasion of Iraq
784160	788560	happened. And even though it ultimately comes down hard on Bush for his role in the invasion, there's
788560	793360	still some strange affection for former President Bush, as we have moments of sympathy for a guy
793360	798320	doing the best he can with his limited faculties. In Free Lunch Express we see Bernie constantly
798320	803200	being a scheming, conniving, lazy villain. He's never portrayed as a sympathetic character,
803200	807440	with one exception. The only time you'll feel sympathy for Bernie in this movie is when he's
807440	811760	faced with an even greater villain. And of course I'm talking about Hillary Clinton. Although late
811760	816800	arrival into the movie it's amazing how terrifyingly she's portrayed. She bullies him, mocks him, and
816800	821280	even threatens his life. It seems like the Free Lunch Express's hatred for Hillary is so strong
821280	826240	that even a movie primarily built around mocking Bernie Sanders has to go out of its way to make
826240	831680	sure the audience knows Hillary Clinton is so much worse. And of course instead of offering a
831680	837360	sensible criticism of Clinton, something that's very easy to do, it instead shrapes into conspiracy
837440	841920	theories, like the Clintons supposedly having Vince Foster murdered. It's also another example
841920	847040	of how this movie is really built around right-wing caricatures and an alternate perspective of
847040	852720	reality. So of course Hillary Clinton is presented as the most evil person in politics. I've been
852720	856480	going pretty hard on Free Lunch Express, but it's also important for us to take a step back from
856480	861840	these movies and examine ourselves as the audience. Or since this is my video, examining myself as
861840	867040	the audience. A movie like W. Wood seemingly play better to a left-wing person such as myself,
867040	871920	and an obviously right-wing movie like Free Lunch Express would not. So my political leanings may
871920	876240	be coloring my interpretation here, since these movies are quite clearly shaped by the politics
876240	880960	of their respective filmmakers. But while I think W. is a better movie than Free Lunch Express,
880960	886800	I wouldn't call it good either. It felt long, with way too much emphasis on George W. Bush's
886800	892640	daddy issues, and wasn't really that funny. While it was comparatively the funnier of the two movies,
892640	897680	being funnier than Free Lunch Express isn't a very tough thing to do. But let's take a look at
897680	903600	another satirical biopic about a politician, or in this case eventual politician, one that was made
903600	909920	by actual comedians. Funnier Dies' 2016 movie Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal the movie gave
909920	915280	us a brief history of the eventual 45th president of the United States. Presented as if it were a
915280	922160	movie created by Donald Trump back in the 1980s, it has a very 80s aesthetic. The movie has cameos
922160	927280	from Alf and Christopher Lloyd. It even has Kenny Loggins' track over the credits. It's a reminder
927280	932240	that we used to think of Donald Trump as this ghost from the 80s, desperate to stay relevant
932240	937760	in the modern day. But now we think of a lot of other things when talking about this guy. You might
937760	942640	not recognize Johnny Depp as Donald Trump, but that's him under all that makeup. He's joined by
942640	947280	a host of other performers, many of them quite experienced in doing jokes. And I even popped
947280	960240	in myself for a brief cameo. So was the NFL violating antitrust laws? Although well received
960240	966000	at the time, this movie has not aged well. The Trump jokes, which must have felt fresh in 2016,
966000	970320	now come across as boring and stale. The movie does reflect something very important though.
970320	974640	How we look at the lives of these figures is defined largely by the moment in which we look
974640	979200	back. Freelance Express gives us a look at the life of Bernie Sanders, based on a caricature
979200	984480	of him taken directly from the present. With his past life rewritten, to lead us towards this
984480	990720	bumbling communist who secretly loves Stalin. And W is very much the same, giving us a selective
990720	995680	look at George W. Bush's history based on the version of him we were seen as president at the
995680	1001440	time, with the failure of a rock looming especially large as his second term in office drew to an end.
1001520	1006400	And the Trump movie is, as I mentioned, a look back at Trump before he assumed office when he
1006400	1011520	was simply an 80s relic. These movies are moments in time trying to stamp a specific understanding
1011520	1015520	of these politicians into the minds of their audience. This understanding will reflect the
1015520	1019600	politics of the filmmaker, and if we're really lucky, it will give us a greater understanding
1019600	1024800	of the subjects. We know Freelance Express is no good to us, and W is fixated on one major
1024800	1029920	aspect of the Bush presidency, and the Donald Trump movie only looks at who Trump was before
1029920	1035040	he assumed his role in office. So let's look at one more political satire biopic that very
1035040	1040160	deliberately looks at one politician from a moment in time that might give us a better look at the
1040160	1046800	impact they had on the world. Armando Nucci's 2017 movie The Death of Stalin offers a more
1046800	1052160	interesting take on the satirical political biopic based on a graphic novel from 2012 by Fabian
1052160	1057680	Nury and Thierry Robin, which subject Joseph Stalin spends most of the movie dead, or almost
1057680	1062080	dead, and we spend the bulk of the movie watching the many men in his orbit scramble to make sense
1062080	1067760	of a nation held together by this one man. It, of course, takes a lot of liberties with historical
1067760	1072000	facts, but it does so in service to a greater narrative about how authoritarian rule does not
1072000	1077280	abide sharing power, and how Stalin structured his government around fear of him. You learn much about
1077280	1083120	the stature he grew to in his final days by seeing the effect his sudden absence had on those around
1083360	1088080	him. We may never understand the any workings of these political figures, especially when they're
1088080	1092480	dead, but we can learn something of them through art that highlights how silly it is to have a world
1092480	1097520	where the death of one guy can bring the ruling structure of an entire nation to a screeching halt.
1097520	1102400	No doubt there are plenty of historical inaccuracies in The Death of Stalin, and it's
1102400	1107120	jarring to see men who help to commit atrocities being portrayed as bumbling fools, even when the
1107120	1112240	movie makes no attempt to hide their more monstrous sides. Thousands of people died during this movie,
1112320	1118000	and execution scenes are played for laughs. It's a wonderful embodiment of a dark comedy. And it
1118000	1123200	gets away with all of this, because it managed to do one thing that Free Lunch Express failed at
1123200	1126480	miserably. The death of Stalin is funny.
1126480	1143840	All the faults I found with Free Lunch Express might have seemed like nothing had it made me
1143840	1149920	laugh throughout its runtime. But instead, I sat there with a bored expression, counting each
1149920	1154320	excruciating minute. If you're curious to know what joke got me the closest to laughter,
1154320	1170640	it was this one. That's as good as it got. The reasons for Free Lunch Express not being funny
1170640	1176160	vary. One of the main problems is how exhaustively conservative it is. Not with its politics,
1176160	1181040	although it is conservative politically, but rather, it's conservative with its humor. The
1181040	1186160	jokes amount to nothing more than Bernie constantly smoking pot, old people getting frisky,
1186160	1190960	and ham-fisted caricatures. It all feels like something ripped from a comedy 20 years ago.
1191520	1197120	One of the taglines of this movie is that it comes from the creators who saw Airplane too many times.
1197120	1202320	That movie came out 40 years ago. And while it holds up in some ways, largely due to the talent
1202320	1206880	of the people who created it, comedy and film has evolved quite a bit since then. Free Lunch
1206880	1212800	Express doesn't seem to have gotten that message. Comedy generally doesn't age well, so boring from
1212800	1217760	the past can be a risky thing to do. While sometimes humor is lost through changing values
1217760	1222240	in a culture, and when it comes to making fun of people for their ethnicity or sexuality, that
1222240	1226480	definitely seems like a good thing to me. There's also the simple fact that the more often you hear
1226480	1232160	the same joke, even one that's acceptable, the less funny it gets over time. Some comedy holds
1232160	1237920	up and some does it, and it takes a sound comedic mind to know when to replicate and when to innovate,
1237920	1243440	not pushing the envelope in a way that drags comedy back towards tired cliches, but instead pushing
1243440	1248560	it into new exciting directions. There is no innovation in Free Lunch Express. It rehashes
1248560	1252960	jokes that have been in movies for decades, and it doesn't do a particularly good job of retelling
1252960	1257520	them. It would be unfair to say politically conservative artists can't be funny, but to be
1257520	1262160	funny to a modern audience, it requires them to be less conservative artistically.
1262160	1268240	There you have it. A tale so curious. It may seem quite spurious.
1268240	1272480	The choices made surrounding the making of this movie raise important questions about the
1272480	1278000	filmmakers involved. Who is writer-director-producer Lenny Britton, and what does he have against
1278000	1283760	Bernie Sanders? Leonard Wheeler Britton currently serves as the lead writer-director for a production
1283760	1289680	company called Right and Funny, a name which is only half right. In his younger days, he worked as
1289680	1295520	a writer before taking over his father's business, Britton Lumber Landscape at Feed. I couldn't figure
1295520	1300880	out exactly what he was writing though. The most interesting part of his CV is that Britton ran for
1300880	1306560	office in 2010 in Vermont, for the Senate. And while it would have been too perfect had his
1306560	1311600	opponent been Bernie Sanders himself, he instead ran against the other senator from Vermont, Patrick
1311600	1317200	Leahy, who's been holding that seat for decades. Naturally, Britton lost, though the 30% of the vote
1317200	1321680	he got was more than Leahy's last Republican challenger could achieve. And Britton gave us
1321680	1329040	several memorable campaign ads. This is a bill for your family share of the national debt. It's $168,000.
1329040	1334800	This is a joke, right? Miss, we're from the government. There is no joking. That's a lot of money,
1334800	1340000	mister. Better get a paper route, Billy. When one of these ads proved a minor viral hit,
1340000	1344800	nabbing tens of thousands of views compared to the usual few hundred, it convinced Britton and
1344800	1349600	his partner, Bradford Broyles, to step into the world of comedy. So they decided to make some
1349600	1354800	scripted comedy from a conservative standpoint. As to how a former senatorial candidate got the
1354800	1359600	funding to make a movie, the answer to that lies with the executive producer for the film, Lenore
1359600	1365200	Broughton. Broughton is an heiress living off the fabulous wealth of her late grandfather,
1365200	1370640	Sue Lavery, a businessman from the early half of the 20th century, whose fortune was estimated to
1370640	1376720	be 327 million dollars when he retired in 1955. Although very little is known about Broughton,
1376720	1382160	as she's a very private person, one thing very much publicly available is her extensive support
1382160	1386560	of Republican politicians, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle,
1386560	1391280	typically on hard-right candidates. And naturally one of those candidates included Britton's run
1391280	1395840	for Senate in 2010. Broughton has helped finance a number of right-wing media outlets,
1395840	1400640	such as True North Reports, which a brief glance at reveals plenty of right-wing nonsense right down
1400640	1405760	to reposting clips from Tucker Carlson's Nightly Hour of Trash. Broughton apparently saw some value
1405760	1409920	in Britton's vision for a movie mocking Bernie Sanders, and as is predictable, this isn't the
1409920	1414880	first time she's financed his antics. Aside from those campaign contributions, she's also financed
1414880	1420400	a few of his other projects, such as a web series, News Done Right, mocking Vermont Republican
1420400	1425600	governor Phil Scott for being far too moderate, and she also financed a web series that I've been
1425600	1430960	told is a comedy starring Kevin Sorbo, titled The World According to Billy Potwin. Although the
1430960	1436560	series was originally Sorbo-less, he joined in its second season, replacing the previous actor
1436560	1442080	who had the role of Nate Potwin, the patriarch of the Potwin clan, and of the four shorts produced
1442080	1446880	in the Sorbo era, three were cut into a single episode, which seems to be serving as a pilot for
1446960	1450320	the series. Here's a little taste of what this show is like.
1450320	1455280	And if we do not reduce our carbon footprint, the polar caps will melt,
1455280	1460320	and the rising sea level will put major American coastal cities underwater.
1460320	1466320	So New York, Miami, and Los Angeles underwater. What's the downside?
1466320	1467120	Billy!
1467120	1472320	Billy's grandfather is played by Barry Bostwick of Rocky Horror and Spin City fame. I can only
1472320	1477280	hope he just really needed the money, especially since they spelled his name wrong in the credits.
1477280	1481200	You may recognize the actor who played young Bernie Sanders in Free Lunch Express,
1481200	1486160	taking on the role of Billy Potwin. This young man is named Jonah Britton,
1486160	1491040	and he is the son of series creator Lenny Britton. Although it had a very brief run online,
1491040	1494800	this web series got a full season with at least eight episodes produced so far,
1494800	1499520	though they have yet to air, it doesn't seem to have a distributor yet. But if it gets one,
1499520	1503120	I'll make a whole video looking at what I'm sure will be a fantastic sitcom.
1503120	1508000	There's some sweet irony here where a wealthy financier who didn't earn a cent of her own money
1508000	1512720	is financing an unfummy former politician to make bad entertainment for a right-wing audience who
1512720	1517200	wants to fuel their hatred for Bernie Sanders. When Bernie is presented as a hopeless slacker
1517200	1521440	who locked his way into his position, it seems a more fitting description for those responsible
1521440	1526880	for this lazily put together movie, financed on the back of inherited wealth, and constructed
1526880	1531840	by someone who doesn't appear to have any talent whatsoever for comedy. Free Lunch
1531840	1536960	Express is a movie that demands a response that's as lazy as the effort that went into making it.
1536960	1542000	A waste of time for everyone involved, I encourage all of you to keep not watching it.
1545280	1549520	Originally, this video was actually going to be entirely about the whole Billy Potwin series,
1550240	1554000	but there were only a few shorts and it didn't feel quite so meaty,
1554000	1557440	and I wasn't sure there was enough content there for me to make a whole video.
1557440	1561360	While doing my research, I decided to watch Free Lunch Express just to get a sense of what
1561360	1566080	Britain is all about in his creative work, and there was so much there that I just felt like
1566080	1570400	it would make a much better subject for a video. And there were so many things in this movie I
1570400	1576000	didn't even get to touch that were just absolutely atrocious. So consider this a sanitized reading of
1576000	1581760	the movie that doesn't bombard you with every last morsel of its garbage. If you enjoyed this movie,
