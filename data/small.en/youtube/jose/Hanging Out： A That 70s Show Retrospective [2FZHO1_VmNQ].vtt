00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Through the haze of time gone by, and a loose spliff or two, came one of the first sitcoms to

00:04.880 --> 00:09.600
take a nostalgic look back at the 1970s. With a knowing laugh at the fashion and trends of the

00:09.600 --> 00:14.080
day, that 70s show served as a reminder of how things had changed over the last two decades,

00:14.080 --> 00:19.440
and how much had stayed the same. When it debuted in 1998, the series was an instant hit,

00:19.440 --> 00:23.840
becoming one of the breakout comedies for Fox in the late 90s, and launching the careers of its

00:23.840 --> 00:28.800
cast. Many shows have imitated it since, but the unique chemistry of the characters and the

00:28.800 --> 00:33.440
inventive style of its production made it a tough act to follow. The idea for the series began with

00:33.440 --> 00:38.080
a business meeting at the Carsey-Warner Company, a production company that had been responsible for

00:38.080 --> 00:43.040
such hits, including The Cosby Show, Roseanne, and Third Rock from the Sun. During the meeting,

00:43.040 --> 00:46.880
it was suggested that they should start focusing their attention on producing a show for men from

00:46.880 --> 00:53.040
ages 18 to 49. Karen Mandebach, who was working for the company, was struck with a sudden inspiration.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.360
Mandebach pitched the idea of doing a show set in the 70s to Bonnie and Terry Turner, who had

01:03.360 --> 01:08.800
recently created Third Rock from the Sun for NBC. The husband and wife duo teamed with writer Mark

01:08.800 --> 01:14.160
Brazil to create a pitch for what would eventually become that 70s show. The series drew heavily from

01:14.160 --> 01:18.560
the lives of its creators, hearkening back to their days growing up in the 1970s, though

01:18.560 --> 01:24.000
crucially what made the series what it was, was not its reliance on making references to the decade,

01:24.000 --> 01:29.040
but rather a memorable cast of characters who just happened to be living in the 1970s.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.120
Memories of the era would appeal to an older demographic, while the drama of the teens would

01:33.120 --> 01:37.680
appeal to a younger one. The show's creators produced a script for a series called Teenage

01:37.680 --> 01:42.160
Wasteland, and while it wouldn't keep that name, it did reflect the idea of a group of teenagers

01:42.160 --> 01:46.800
trapped in a small town with nothing to do but hang out. Set in the fictional town of Point Place,

01:46.800 --> 01:51.680
Wisconsin, shows were less about cheering on the Packers, although they did that on occasion,

01:51.680 --> 01:56.720
and more about creating a dynamic that was driven by its characters rather than its premise.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.640
Topher Grace was chosen for the role of Eric Foreman through an odd twist of fate. He was

02:00.640 --> 02:04.240
starring in his school's production of Our Town with the daughter of the show's creators,

02:04.240 --> 02:08.320
Bonnie and Terry Turner. He impressed them so much, they brought him into audition,

02:08.320 --> 02:12.160
and he got the part. The character is loosely based on writer Mark Brazil.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.920
Eric is an awkward everyman teenage boy in Love with the Girl Next Door.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.520
Laura Prepon played the role of Donna Pinciotti. Prepon was working as a model before trying her

02:27.520 --> 02:31.840
hand at acting, and she turned out a movie role after becoming enamored with a part of Donna.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.160
Donna is the tomboy of the group, with dreams outside the small town of Point Place.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.880
She's also exploring her feelings for her neighbor Eric.

02:39.760 --> 02:53.840
Ashton Kutcher took a direct route to his role of Michael Kelso. He had been working as a model

02:53.840 --> 02:58.400
for about a year and was incredibly lucky with one of his earliest auditions being for Teenage

02:58.400 --> 03:03.600
Wasteland. He was immediately a favorite of the show's creators. Kelso is the handsome,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.400
yet deeply naive member of the teenage group of friends.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.760
Danny Masterson was cast as Stephen Hyde. He had been performing on stage since he was eight,

03:21.760 --> 03:25.920
when he had a role on Broadway, and had since gone on to appear in hundreds of commercials.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.760
His input helped define the character, giving Hyde a harder edge.

03:29.760 --> 03:34.560
Hyde is the street smart troublemaker of the group. He has a healthy distrust of authority

03:34.560 --> 03:48.080
and an even healthier stash of pot. Wilmer Valderrama was cast for the role of the foreign

03:48.080 --> 03:52.960
exchange student Fez. Although born in Miami, he grew up in Venezuela, giving him an authentic

03:52.960 --> 03:57.760
accent that made him appeal to the show's creators. Fez is the perpetual fish out of water,

03:57.760 --> 04:01.600
taken under the guidance of his new American friends. Although we never quite learn where

04:01.600 --> 04:05.920
Fez is from, or what his name even is, he's still embraced as part of the gang.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.640
Mila Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhardt. Originally born in Ukraine, her family moved

04:18.640 --> 04:22.880
to America when she was seven, and she took acting classes to help with her English.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.040
She quickly found success with a number of parts but went on auditioning for the role of Jackie,

04:27.040 --> 04:40.960
which was looking for a 16-year-old. She lied about her age to get cast. Jackie is a spoiled

04:40.960 --> 04:45.760
rich kid, only barely tolerable in the group because of her romantic connection to Kelso.

04:46.560 --> 05:00.960
Deborah Jo Rupp was cast as Eric's mother, Kitty Foreman. Although a very experienced actress,

05:00.960 --> 05:05.600
she had largely been doing guest roles on shows such as Seinfeld or in movies like Big. Kitty is

05:05.600 --> 05:09.680
the picture-perfect image of a mother figure, holding her family together through freshly baked

05:09.680 --> 05:14.480
cookies and a well-kept home. Although she's not exactly a homebody, as she also works as a nurse

05:14.480 --> 05:31.840
to help the family through some tough financial times. Kurtwood Smith was cast as Eric's father,

05:31.840 --> 05:36.240
Red Foreman, a longtime veteran of the screen. At the time, he was probably best remembered

05:36.240 --> 05:40.960
for his role in Robocop. Red is the perpetual hard-ass, determined to make his son into the

05:40.960 --> 05:45.360
man he expects him to be. When the show begins, he's struggling to put food on the table as his

05:45.360 --> 05:58.960
job as manager at an auto parts factory is in peril. Don Stark was cast as Bob Pinciati,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.960
Donna's father. Another prolific actor, he had appeared in numerous shows and movies in the

06:02.960 --> 06:07.600
years leading up to this role. Bob is the trendy appliance store owner next door who's not afraid

06:07.680 --> 06:24.240
of wearing his heart on his sleeve. Midge Pinciati, played by Tanya Roberts, was the final member of

06:24.240 --> 06:29.120
the Pinciati household. An actress plucked from the 70s, Roberts joined Charlie's Angels in the

06:29.120 --> 06:33.520
show's fifth season. She was also one of the Bond girls in A View to a Kill and starred in the movie

06:33.520 --> 06:38.240
Sheena. Midge is the flighty lady next door who is exploring the exciting world of feminism.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.840
Although the principal cast was quite large, it would grow larger still in later seasons,

06:51.840 --> 06:56.720
and it would also shrink when some of the actors departed. But the action was primarily driven by

06:56.720 --> 07:01.280
its main cast of teenagers, always ready to assemble in the formant basement. The theme

07:01.280 --> 07:06.880
song of the series was a cover of the Big Star song In the Street. The cover was originally

07:06.880 --> 07:11.040
performed by Todd Griffin for the first season of the series, but a new version was recorded by

07:11.040 --> 07:15.280
Cheap Trick that would be used in seasons two through eight. When a music video is released

07:15.280 --> 07:20.720
for the song, the cast even appeared alongside Cheap Trick. After the pilot was filmed, one of

07:20.720 --> 07:25.360
the few things still missing was the title for the show. Teenage Wasteland was out as the show's

07:25.360 --> 07:29.520
creators couldn't get the rights to that from The Who. Several other titles inspired by popular

07:29.520 --> 07:34.320
music of the era faced similar problems, including such names as The Kids Are All Right.

07:34.320 --> 07:39.600
Eventually that became Feelin' All Right, but Fox didn't particularly like the sound of that.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
During test screenings of the pilot, audiences kept calling it That 70s Show.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.880
That's what the audience kept calling it. They had no clue what the title was. They just

07:47.520 --> 07:52.080
referred to it as That 70s Show. So we stopped fighting it and went with it.

07:56.080 --> 08:05.280
Point Place, Wisconsin, May 17th, 1976, 847 p.m. Location, Eric Forman's Basement.

08:05.920 --> 08:11.440
This is how we're introduced to the gang of That 70s Show, debuting in the real world on August

08:11.440 --> 08:19.280
23rd, 1998. This first episode was called That 70s Pilot. We meet Eric, Donna, Hyde, and Kelso

08:19.280 --> 08:24.400
in the basement, with the latter three encouraging Eric to do his teenage duty and steal some beer

08:24.400 --> 08:34.480
from his parents who are having a party upstairs. As Eric goes upstairs, we get our first look at

08:34.480 --> 08:38.480
That 70s Show's unique style with a first-person view from Eric's perspective.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.160
One fun bit of trivia here is that we get the first appearance of Kitty's iconic laugh,

08:50.160 --> 08:52.160
a laugh that was done accidentally.

09:04.480 --> 09:20.160
We also get our first sign that Donna and Eric are into each other.

09:34.480 --> 09:48.160
The Jackie and Kelso relationship is also established.

09:48.160 --> 10:07.280
We also get our very first circle, which is how the teens on the show would gather while getting

10:07.280 --> 10:13.040
high. You couldn't show someone smoking pot on a TV show, but That 70s Show got around this by

10:13.040 --> 10:17.760
moving the camera on someone just after they had taken a puff. That way it simulates a joint,

10:17.760 --> 10:22.480
being passed around in a circle without actually showing the joint itself. You can even see the

10:22.480 --> 10:27.360
characters break into laughter a few times, which was kept in because it seemed authentic. They just

10:27.360 --> 10:31.840
have the giggles because they're high. The show had some fun with high Eric when he has to speak

10:31.840 --> 10:36.480
to his parents, and he finds out that he's getting the vista cruiser. This is another fun example of

10:36.480 --> 10:46.080
its creative style. Future episodes would also take liberties with split screens and

10:46.080 --> 10:50.480
voiceovers and edits to create something that you often didn't see in sitcoms of the day.

11:08.480 --> 11:12.640
With a new set of wheels, Eric and his friends go out of town to a concert and get up to some

11:12.640 --> 11:17.840
shenanigans. But the key part of this episode happens at the end with a pivotal moment for Don

11:17.840 --> 11:40.640
and Eric. This first episode establishes the characters very quickly. We know who they are

11:40.640 --> 11:44.880
and how they relate to one another. This show will be primarily about Eric discovering his

11:44.880 --> 11:49.440
first love and rebelling against a domineering father. What also makes the show feel genuine

11:49.440 --> 11:53.600
is that, while you can certainly tell it's set in the 70s, the kids aren't slavishly following

11:53.600 --> 11:58.000
the trends to set up cheap jokes. They have their own tastes, and the humour is built around that.

11:58.000 --> 12:14.720
In this example, Eric and Donna are mocking the Brady Bunch, but Jackie is a fan. It shows us that

12:14.720 --> 12:19.360
Jackie is into the trendy sitcoms of the day, whereas Eric and Donna are more outsiders to

12:19.360 --> 12:24.480
pop culture. Jackie is conventional, while Eric and Donna aren't. This is how the decade informs

12:24.480 --> 12:29.200
us about the characters, rather than using the characters as a vessel to explore the decade. In

12:29.200 --> 12:34.160
other words, it's how it establishes itself as a character-driven comedy rather than a premise-driven

12:34.160 --> 12:39.120
one. It's also interesting how it reframes memories of the 70s. It's not a show from that decade,

12:39.120 --> 12:44.720
after all. Rather, it's a show about what people from the 90s remembered about the 70s. And sitting

12:44.720 --> 12:51.120
here, over 20 years later, were even more removed from the era. As someone who wasn't alive in 1976,

12:51.120 --> 12:55.520
I have no idea if teenagers mocked the Brady Bunch or not. But I do remember what it was like

12:55.520 --> 12:59.840
to have my first kiss, which is a big part of why the show is so fondly remembered. Not because it

12:59.840 --> 13:04.640
captured an era, but because it presented memorable characters whose experiences transcended that time

13:04.640 --> 13:09.360
period. We get another example in the very next episode, Eric's birthday. Eric wants a cassette

13:09.440 --> 13:12.640
player for the Vista Cruiser, and not an eight-track player.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.240
The point is, I don't want an eight-track tape player.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.200
Then you won't get one.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.480
Oh, but honey, he wants one.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.680
No, I want a tape player, just not an eight-track.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.600
So naturally, he gets this.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.000
I mean, yeah.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.200
It's an eight-track tape player.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.600
I see that.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.800
Just what you asked for.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.800
You made such a big deal about it, I wrote it down.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.440
If a 17-year-old was watching this episode, would they know the difference between an

13:39.440 --> 13:43.680
eight-track and a cassette player? Here's a picture of both of them. A lesser show would

13:43.680 --> 13:47.520
have had the characters hold up a cassette player and make a comment about it being cutting-edge

13:47.520 --> 13:52.560
technology, never to be surpassed. That might get a chuckle, but it's a laugh you probably wouldn't

13:52.560 --> 13:57.120
remember. On that 70s show, it's not about laughing at the technology of the past. It's

13:57.120 --> 14:01.200
about laughing at growing up with parents who don't listen. That's something you can laugh at

14:01.200 --> 14:05.840
and relate to, and it's what makes this show particularly memorable. Eric's birthday also

14:05.840 --> 14:10.560
introduced another important first, Eric's sister, Laurie, played by Lisa Robin Kelly.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.000
Hello, Laurie.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.040
Red treats Laurie a little differently than he does Eric.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.120
Laurie, you're not driving a vista cruiser.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.600
It's old and undependable.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.800
It could break down, you'd be at the mercy of any maniac who came along.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.440
That's okay for Eric, but you're taking a Toyota.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.680
And I should mention, not every scene in the circle involved passing a joint around.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.000
That 70s show ran for eight seasons, though it only took place over roughly three and a half

14:38.000 --> 14:42.080
years. If you've ever been watching an episode and wondering when exactly you are, at the end

14:42.080 --> 14:45.680
of the opening credits when we see the vista cruiser's license plate, the renewal sticker

14:45.680 --> 14:49.920
tells us which year the episode is set in. This does make things a little awkward at times,

14:49.920 --> 14:55.520
as the timeline, particularly because of episodes with holidays, doesn't always line up. By honing

14:55.520 --> 15:01.040
in on each year, we can split the series up into four distinctive eras. And as we follow the lives

15:01.040 --> 15:06.320
of these characters, we'll see how the series gradually evolves. That 70s show spends only a

15:06.320 --> 15:12.240
brief stretch in 1976. In fact, only the first 12 episodes of the series take place in that year,

15:12.240 --> 15:18.880
before we move on to 1977 for the second half of the first season. One exception is Episode 23 of

15:18.880 --> 15:24.160
Season 1, which also takes place in 1976, in part because the order of the episodes was

15:24.160 --> 15:29.360
shuffled around while airing. This creates a few instances of confusing continuity, like Eric

15:29.360 --> 15:34.880
mentioning he and Hyde hadn't yet sprayed the water tower when we had seen them do just that

15:34.880 --> 15:38.720
in the episode that aired the previous week. In addition to Eric and Donna's love affair,

15:38.720 --> 15:43.840
one of the big overarching themes in these early episodes is the precarious economic spot of the

15:44.800 --> 15:48.960
I've noticed that the pop selection has really went downhill since your dad got laid off.

15:48.960 --> 15:56.560
He's not laid off. He's just part-time. And shut up. When the president comes to visit point

15:56.560 --> 16:00.720
place, Red is selected to ask the president a question. When he's given a question,

16:00.720 --> 16:08.800
rather than being allowed to ask his own, Red gets frustrated. A man has to stand up and be heard.

16:08.800 --> 16:14.720
I will not sit quietly by while everything is taken away from me.

16:16.560 --> 16:23.760
They took my job, my stability, and now they want to take away my right of free speech.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.360
You still have the Toyota, it gets great mileage.

16:28.960 --> 16:34.720
It being 1976, the president right now is Gerald Ford, who assumed office after Richard Nixon

16:34.720 --> 16:39.200
resigned. This is why Nixon was on the cusp of being impeached and removed from office.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.720
What Red is feeling here is not just the indifference towards him from the federal

16:42.720 --> 16:47.440
government, but the general sense that America is leaving him behind, and that the country is

16:47.440 --> 16:52.560
corrupt from top to bottom, letting him lose his job as he's lost in the shuffle of the marketplace.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.800
What Red doesn't realize is the America he thought he knew as a boy wasn't a whole lot better,

16:56.800 --> 17:01.680
or at least not as free as he imagined it was. It's not so much that the country has changed,

17:01.680 --> 17:06.240
as he just happens to be one of the people it's left behind. And the show doesn't make it such

17:06.240 --> 17:11.360
a big secret here that the problem lies much with a business class that uses people like Red as pawns.

17:11.360 --> 17:16.320
Bob, a member of the local community of businessmen, represents that world when he thinks of Red to

17:16.320 --> 17:21.440
ask the president a question. The important thing is to choose the right person. You know,

17:21.440 --> 17:26.720
a working class guy, your average Joe. I guess someone you and I would call a loser.

17:26.720 --> 17:32.160
So, of course, I thought of you.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.920
Although Red planned to go off script at the presidential event,

17:35.920 --> 17:40.880
at first he seems a bit too nervous to ask any question at all. But after Erica makes

17:40.880 --> 17:44.960
a rash political protest by streaking the president, Red finds his nerve.

17:44.960 --> 17:51.600
Hey, Jerry. Here's my question. How the hell could you pardon Nixon?

17:51.600 --> 17:59.120
Sometimes a man's gotta do what he thinks is right.

18:00.400 --> 18:05.280
These early episodes probably have Red at his most relatable, perhaps because of the economic

18:05.280 --> 18:09.280
insecurity that people are feeling in the present day, and something that people in the 90s might

18:09.280 --> 18:14.240
have felt as well when this show was first airing. And back then, it was when a booming economy was

18:14.240 --> 18:20.240
raising questions about who the economy is exactly booming for. One of the early plot lines, just to

18:20.320 --> 18:24.800
get the obvious out of the way, was having the gang go disco dancing. One part of this

18:24.800 --> 18:36.960
episode has Fez noticing one of the disco's inspirations. And Fez is revealed to be a fantastic

18:36.960 --> 18:41.760
dancer. Although Fez is a mystery throughout the series, it's early on when he's at his best.

18:41.760 --> 18:46.240
He seems like he's genuinely from somewhere, with a history and culture that only seems

18:46.240 --> 18:50.960
especially foreign in contrast to the relative ignorance of the largely white small town in

18:50.960 --> 18:55.200
middle America. There's something sweet seen Fez struggling to understand American culture,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.960
and it offers members of the audience less familiar with 70s culture the chance to have

18:59.040 --> 19:21.440
it explained to them in a less heavy-handed way. There will be much more to say about Fez as the

19:21.440 --> 19:26.000
series progresses, but over time this innocence would vanish, and we'd be left with another

19:26.000 --> 19:38.000
early trait he showed in these episodes, being a bit of a creep. The early episodes of That 70

19:38.000 --> 19:44.080
Show also featured a landmark moment in TV history. In the episode, Eric's Buddy, We Meet Buddy,

19:44.080 --> 19:49.200
played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eric's lab partner and one of the most popular kids in school.

19:49.200 --> 19:54.240
As their friendship grows, so does a misunderstanding, at least in Buddy's mind.

19:54.240 --> 19:58.480
And I feel like I'm playing this part, right? But it's not me.

20:07.280 --> 20:13.280
This is the first kiss between two men on network TV. Although sometimes that's credited to the

20:13.280 --> 20:18.240
Dawson's Creek episode True Love, Eric's Buddy beat its air by about five months.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.480
Eric being straight has to turn Buddy down, but the two agree to stay friends.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.840
If you don't want to be my lab partner anymore, then I'll understand.

20:25.840 --> 20:35.520
No, no. Oh, I didn't mean it like that. Um, look, we're still friends. Really? Yeah.

20:36.320 --> 20:41.840
And as the rules of sitcoms go, with a one-off guest star destined to be a one-off guest star,

20:41.840 --> 20:46.960
we never see Buddy again. At the time, this moment was heralded as a very positive depiction of a

20:46.960 --> 20:51.600
gay character. Buddy is cool, popular, and charming, not at all living up to any of the

20:51.600 --> 20:56.240
stereotypes of gay characters you might see on other shows, including this one in later seasons.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.280
The episode was even nominated for a GLAAD Award as an outstanding TV individual episode.

21:01.280 --> 21:05.200
What's probably most notable about this moment is the audience's reaction, though,

21:05.200 --> 21:09.040
which is genuine shock from something they likely hadn't seen on a TV show before.

21:09.040 --> 21:13.200
Looking at it 20 years later, it seems almost tame compared to modern television,

21:13.200 --> 21:17.600
and it's a little disappointing to see Buddy play the token gay character who's there and gone now

21:17.600 --> 21:22.400
that the gay episode has been handled. It does reveal how little representation there was for

21:22.400 --> 21:27.360
gay characters on TV at this time, and perhaps what makes it age less gracefully is that it was on

21:27.360 --> 21:32.080
the cusp of a growing change in television, which would see an increase in the number of gay

21:32.080 --> 21:36.960
characters on sitcoms. Buddy wasn't even the first character to appear on the series, as the pilot

21:36.960 --> 21:42.000
featured a gay couple, one of whom was a mechanic who traded a car part for concert tickets to the

21:42.000 --> 21:55.760
gang. Aside from these brief moments, the romance on the show was overwhelmingly heterosexual,

21:55.760 --> 22:00.240
and one of the top concerns for its characters. Jackie and Kelso, being the established couple

22:00.240 --> 22:04.880
in the beginning, struggle to stay together. Or rather, Kelso is constantly trying to convince

22:04.880 --> 22:17.760
his friends he's about to dump his very annoying girlfriend. Knowing that Mila Kunis is only 15

22:17.760 --> 22:22.320
throughout season 1 does make a few of the scenes a bit uncomfortable to watch, though because of

22:22.320 --> 22:26.960
the age difference between her and Ashton Kutcher, who was 20 at the time, most of the scenes where

22:26.960 --> 22:31.600
they're making out happen hidden behind car seats and other obstacles. Kelso's attraction

22:31.600 --> 22:36.720
to Lori in particular reveals he's not entirely committed to Jackie, and while Lori is no stranger

22:36.720 --> 22:53.760
to hooking up, Kelso's chances largely only exist in his head. Of course, the biggest romantic

22:53.760 --> 22:58.640
plotline in the early episodes is the Eric and Donna relationship. It's immediately obvious from

22:58.640 --> 23:02.720
the first episode that these two would be getting together, so a bit of intrigue is thrown into the

23:02.720 --> 23:07.440
middle of it, with Hyde attempting to create a love triangle. A few flirtations from Hyde

23:07.440 --> 23:12.160
doesn't really do much to interrupt Eric and Donna getting closer, often in the most embarrassing

23:12.160 --> 23:31.280
way possible. As the year comes to an end, Eric and his friends hold their own Christmas party.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.400
It's about as close as Hyde gets to winning Donna's affections.

23:42.160 --> 23:57.680
Even with this magical Christmas, Eric and Donna still seem like the couple destined to be together,

23:57.680 --> 24:01.840
and by the time Valentine's Day rolls around next year, this subplot is put to bed,

24:01.840 --> 24:04.640
with Hyde backing off after being rejected by Donna.

24:12.160 --> 24:31.440
Throughout 1976, the innocence of the series is apparent, with Brad losing a kind of innocence

24:31.440 --> 24:36.480
when he learns that America isn't the land of dreams he once imagined. Through Fez's ignorance

24:36.480 --> 24:41.600
of his new homeland, in Eric and the gang learning about gay people, and Eric and Donna discovering

24:41.600 --> 24:46.240
their first love. The world is becoming a more complicated place, and the idealized version of

24:46.240 --> 24:50.800
the world these characters imagined is fading away. This is a common theme in most coming-of-age

24:50.800 --> 24:55.120
stories, but it feels even more prominent on that 70s show, because we in the audience have the

24:55.120 --> 25:00.160
advantage of knowing a future that these characters don't. We may not know what happens in our future,

25:00.160 --> 25:03.520
but we know at least some of the major events that will happen in theirs.

25:12.080 --> 25:16.720
And their ignorance of those facts helps make the impression of innocence even more pronounced.

25:20.800 --> 25:25.840
Once Hyde stepped aside from the Eric and Donna pairing, it gave his character the

25:25.840 --> 25:30.960
chance to grow into something more interesting. In the season 1 episode Career Day, we meet Hyde's

25:30.960 --> 25:36.320
mother Edna, played by Katie Seagal. She works as the school's lunch lady, and she has a troubled

25:36.320 --> 25:37.360
relationship with Hyde.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.880
This is sadly the last we see of Hyde's mother Edna, though he would have a number

26:10.880 --> 26:15.280
of father figures throughout the years, including Red. In the episode Punk Chick,

26:15.280 --> 26:19.840
when Hyde falls for Chrissy, played by Jade Gordon, he's tempted to follow her to New York,

26:19.840 --> 26:21.600
where she plans to start a punk band.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.880
Red and Kitty try to convince Hyde not to run off to New York.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.920
And so does Eric.

27:06.320 --> 27:23.760
Hyde eventually decides to stay in point place.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.720
Although it's never made clear whose advice convinced Hyde to stay,

27:32.720 --> 27:36.960
we do learn that what Hyde is missing most in his life is the good influence of the Foreman

27:36.960 --> 27:42.160
household. Something that becomes essential when Edna runs off with a trucker at the end of season

27:42.160 --> 27:44.000
1, leaving Hyde without a home.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.120
Even though Edna's not coming back, Hyde rejects help at first.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.040
But Eric goes to his parents, who are struggling to afford the kids they already have.

28:03.520 --> 28:12.720
Ultimately, it's Red who has to step up and make the decision to help Hyde,

28:12.720 --> 28:14.240
with some encouragement from Kitty.

28:32.720 --> 28:40.240
And Hyde quickly makes himself the model son in the Foreman household.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.400
What this consistently reinforces is that Hyde needs a stable family life,

28:58.400 --> 29:02.640
and in particular a father figure like Red to keep him on the straight and narrow path.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.240
It's a very old-fashioned message. A young boy needs a father figure.

29:06.240 --> 29:10.240
In the second season, Hyde even gets a second quasi-father figure in Leo,

29:10.240 --> 29:12.720
played by Tommy Chong, who gives Hyde a job.

29:28.400 --> 29:38.720
The money goes towards the noble goal of supporting the Foreman household.

29:50.560 --> 29:55.520
Hyde is the model wayward child, taken under the wing of a strong father who sets him on the right

29:55.520 --> 30:00.480
path, and by season 2 he's slowly transforming into a respectable member of society. It's a sort

30:00.480 --> 30:05.120
of arc you might see in a family drama from the 70s, though thankfully that 70s show doesn't fit

30:05.120 --> 30:10.240
so neatly into that sentimental cliché. In the season 2 finale, moon over point place,

30:10.240 --> 30:13.920
Jackie is busted for holding marijuana, and Hyde takes the fall for her.

30:14.880 --> 30:25.920
And then Red finds out.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.400
Red threatens to kick Hyde out, but Jackie eventually takes responsibility for what

30:36.400 --> 30:40.880
happened, and Hyde is allowed to stay in the Foreman household. Hyde was on a promising path,

30:40.880 --> 30:45.280
but to save Jackie, he throws himself in harm's way. What's particularly interesting is how he

30:45.280 --> 30:50.560
does it, though. He calls himself a dirtbag, and in some ways Hyde still sees himself like that,

30:50.560 --> 30:54.480
in spite of all of the work he's done on improving while living with the Foreman's.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.240
The Foreman's can take him in and give him a home and give structure to his life,

30:58.240 --> 31:03.600
but in his heart he still sees himself as an outsider. Hyde is a strong representative for

31:03.600 --> 31:10.160
1977, because if 1976 was about the loss of innocence, 1977 is about finding this new

31:10.160 --> 31:15.120
sense of home in a strange new world. Only Hyde has felt that way through most of his life.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.880
As much as he had hoped his mother would pull herself together and be a better parent,

31:18.880 --> 31:23.360
going so far as to be the bigger person and apologize first when they fight, he ultimately

31:23.360 --> 31:27.120
can't get her to be the mother he needs, and when the Foreman's offer him a new home,

31:27.120 --> 31:31.600
he can't see himself as a part of it. At least, not right away. The show's answer,

31:31.600 --> 31:36.400
at least in this year, takes the shape of Bud, Hyde's father, played by Robert Hayes.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.440
He returns to point place, and after he's discovered by Hyde,

31:39.440 --> 31:41.840
tries to make amends for abandoning his son.

31:42.800 --> 31:49.040
Bud, you're doing great now, huh? Color TV? I remember when I was a kid, I didn't even have

31:49.040 --> 31:53.840
a father. I got no excuse. I was a jerk. I've been a jerk my whole life.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.720
And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry and hope that you'll believe me.

32:00.720 --> 32:05.680
But even if this seems like recreating the childhood he lost, there are hints that this won't last

32:05.680 --> 32:34.720
either. There is this strange episode where Red tries to teach Bud how to be a better father.

32:35.680 --> 32:40.640
Steven doesn't need another friend, Bud. Steven needs somebody to ride his ass.

32:40.640 --> 32:46.320
It seems as though the answer to Hyde's feeling of alienation is… more strict fathering,

32:46.320 --> 32:51.360
from a blood relation this time. But as we'll see in later years, Hyde's life is not so easily

32:51.360 --> 32:55.680
fixed with that, and his rebellious streak isn't something that needs to be disciplined out of him,

32:55.680 --> 32:59.600
but rather channeled into something more productive, such as protecting a friend,

32:59.680 --> 33:05.920
the way he stood up for Jackie. Jackie and Kelso had had something of a rocky year in 1977. In the

33:05.920 --> 33:11.360
very first episode of that year, Season 1's ski trip, Jackie breaks up with Kelso after finding

33:11.360 --> 33:15.360
out he was making out with Pam Macy. They get back together by the end of the episode, though,

33:15.360 --> 33:20.400
but this would establish a pattern. Four episodes later, in the episode titled The Pill,

33:20.400 --> 33:25.440
Jackie has a pregnancy scare. After Kelso melts down in response, they break up again.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.920
Only to get back together in the episode, Prom Night.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.800
In Season 2, their relationship is tested once again with Eric's sister Lori becoming a part

33:36.800 --> 33:40.320
of the main cast. She takes an interest in Kelso and his new van.

33:40.320 --> 33:56.800
This isn't Lori falling for Kelso, though. It's something a bit more basic than that.

33:57.760 --> 34:10.320
Much of the season then focuses on Kelso trying to balance

34:10.320 --> 34:13.280
dating Jackie with cheating on her with Lori.

34:21.680 --> 34:26.560
While Kelso was clearly the bad guy in all of this, he might be mistaken as being a hapless

34:26.560 --> 34:31.600
fool being used by Lori. Eventually, the truth comes out in Kiss of Death. Kelso has finally

34:31.600 --> 34:36.400
realized that the genuine love of Jackie means more to him than the lust represented by Lori,

34:36.400 --> 34:56.400
and he decides to break things off with her. While Lori is

34:56.400 --> 35:01.760
always insufferable, it's pretty clear that this is, and has always been, Kelso's fault.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.320
More than just being a fool, he actively hurt Jackie, and when she ends things with him,

35:06.320 --> 35:09.920
it looks like it will be sticking around for longer than an episode or two this time.

35:09.920 --> 35:26.880
And so ends the show's first relationship.

35:39.920 --> 35:56.720
Jackie seemed like a challenging person to date, but it doesn't excuse what Kelso did to her,

35:56.720 --> 36:00.640
and with naive Kelso being the more affable character in the affair, it's interesting

36:00.640 --> 36:05.200
that he was the bad guy in the whole thing. Often in stories of an infidelity, characters are more

36:05.200 --> 36:09.680
helpfully coded as heroes or villains of the story, but especially for a sitcom, the dynamic

36:09.680 --> 36:15.600
here is surprisingly not straightforward. It shows us how trust is broken by deeds rather than persona,

36:15.600 --> 36:20.880
and that someone's personality doesn't always tell you who they are as a person. At least, not

36:20.880 --> 36:26.000
entirely. Although it took many twists and turns to get here, Jackie and Kelso both get the chance

36:26.000 --> 36:30.960
to grow beyond the high school romance they had. Jackie moves on to other romantic interests,

36:30.960 --> 36:36.240
as the show teases her possibly dating Hyde or Fez, while Kelso tries to date Lori for real.

36:36.240 --> 36:40.960
This leads to some classic confrontations between the two ladies in the Foreman basement.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.040
Eventually, and completely unsurprisingly, Lori cheats on Kelso,

37:16.480 --> 37:18.240
and he apologizes to Jackie.

37:30.960 --> 37:42.800
Kelso's apology is pretty good, and in time he realizes that the only woman he wants to be with

37:42.800 --> 37:48.480
is Jackie. Jackie still might be interested in him, so she tests Kelso to see if he's truly changed.

38:01.360 --> 38:06.880
And we're back where we started. Albeit with Kelso seeming to have grown up a little, and Jackie

38:06.880 --> 38:11.520
deciding to forgive him again. Although it's nice enough for Kelso to have become a more mature

38:11.520 --> 38:15.760
character, it does reveal that the show wasn't entirely sure how to evolve Jackie. While her

38:15.760 --> 38:19.680
being a year younger than everyone else in the gang, and two years younger than Kelso who is held

38:19.680 --> 38:24.400
back a grade, it still seems odd that she's only been able to identify herself based on whether or

38:24.400 --> 38:29.600
not she's dating someone. She's of course rich and popular, but after the first season, these

38:29.600 --> 38:34.080
aspects of her character seem less important, as neither are quite as relevant when she's hanging

38:34.080 --> 38:38.400
out with the other characters. Aside from being fodder for a few jokes here and there. Much in

38:38.400 --> 38:43.040
the same way Hyde's answer to the alienation he felt was to end up back with his father, Jackie and

38:43.040 --> 38:48.080
Kelso respond to their separation in the same way. Fear of the new normal certainly makes sense, and

38:48.080 --> 38:52.880
it reveals that perhaps these teens aren't quite ready to step into adulthood just yet. They've

38:52.880 --> 38:57.120
still got some growing to do. Another reason Jackie and Kelso may have been put together is because

38:57.120 --> 39:02.240
Lisa Robin Kelly, who played Laurie on the show, exited the series in season 3. Although her

39:02.240 --> 39:07.280
character was adding a lot to the show, the actress was having personal issues behind the scenes. In

39:07.280 --> 39:12.080
an interview with ABC in 2012, she described having had a miscarriage at the time and then falling

39:12.080 --> 39:16.320
into alcoholism. Although she would briefly return in season 5 for four more episodes,

39:16.320 --> 39:20.560
Laurie would eventually be recast, with Christina Marr taking over the part.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
Eric and Donna's relationship becomes official in the second half of season 1,

39:24.560 --> 39:28.080
with the first step being Eric giving Donna his class ring.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.960
And in season 2, they finally say they love each other.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.880
Well, Eric says it eventually.

39:44.880 --> 39:54.400
And after nearly two seasons, the two of them finally do it in the episode, the first time.

39:54.400 --> 39:59.360
Eric and Donna have largely made the journey comfortably, and 1977 is probably their best

39:59.360 --> 40:03.520
year as a couple. They handle most challenges that come their way pretty well, with my favorite being

40:03.520 --> 40:08.640
the episode, Eric's Panties, where Donna finds a mysterious pair of panties in the backseat of

40:08.640 --> 40:13.280
the Vista Cruiser. She assumes they belong to Shelly, a girl who had been flirting with Eric,

40:13.360 --> 40:14.960
played by Mamet Patterson.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.440
Even with things mostly going well for the two, the third season's episode,

40:41.440 --> 40:47.280
Baby Fever, did give us a hint that Eric and Donna might not have the happy ending they imagined.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.840
And the comfort Donna gets from Midge has an ominous undertone.

41:11.440 --> 41:27.040
One interesting part of why Donna and Eric clash is that Donna wants more for herself

41:27.040 --> 41:31.600
than to be a housewife, unlike what happened to her mother, whereas Eric is modeling his future

41:31.600 --> 41:35.840
on what he sees with his parents. One of the keys to understand Donna and Eric's mindsets

41:35.840 --> 41:40.000
is to look at what their parents were going through in the same year. In 1976, Red was

41:40.000 --> 41:44.240
struggling to put food on the table as his hours were reduced at the auto plant. In a special

41:44.240 --> 41:48.880
Star Wars themed episode called A New Hope, we find out that the plant is going to be shut down

41:48.880 --> 41:53.760
for good, leaving Red without a job. This leaves the Foreman's in a rough spot.

42:10.000 --> 42:21.040
While it seems dire, Red gets an opportunity to turn things around when a Price Mart opens up in

42:21.040 --> 42:32.800
town. On the other side of the property line, Bob is threatened by the arrival of Price Mart.

42:33.200 --> 42:43.280
While Red may not seem like the best of friends to Bob, his reasons for going after that job

42:43.280 --> 42:57.040
make a lot of sense, as his family heads closer to going broke. For Bob though, Price Mart is the

42:57.040 --> 43:07.440
beginning of the end of his appliance store, and it goes under in season 3. Red throughout his life

43:07.440 --> 43:12.560
is at the mercy of the big businesses that come and go through point place. When the auto industry

43:12.560 --> 43:17.680
started outsourcing abroad for its parts, his plant got shut down and he was out of work. But

43:17.680 --> 43:22.320
when a big box retail store opens up, he suddenly has a job again. There isn't much room for him to

43:22.320 --> 43:27.680
decide where his life will go. At first it seems as though Bob is the wiser person, investing in

43:27.680 --> 43:32.400
his own business and providing comfortably for his family, until a big business comes in and turns it

43:32.400 --> 43:37.040
all upside down, leaving him without a job. Bob isn't quite the master of his destiny that he

43:37.040 --> 43:41.680
imagined, and even though he was a big wheel in the business community in point place, there are

43:41.680 --> 43:46.960
always bigger fish outside that very little pond. When we look at Eric and Donna, we can see their

43:46.960 --> 43:51.520
parents' outlooks reflected in their own lives. Eric has a more traditional conservative vision

43:51.520 --> 43:56.080
for his future because the system seems to be keeping his family afloat. Even if times can get

43:56.080 --> 44:01.680
tough, eventually it all works out. For Donna, her father's failure reflects a system that shows how

44:01.680 --> 44:06.320
a bigger force can wipe you away in an instant. This is compounded by Eric growing up as a boy

44:06.320 --> 44:12.080
and Donna as a girl. Eric is comforted in the idea that society has been built for someone like him,

44:12.080 --> 44:17.200
and challenges are temporary roadblocks. Whereas Donna knows she has an uphill battle. When luck

44:17.200 --> 44:21.520
turns against Bob, she's reminded of a system that doesn't work for her, but rather only values

44:21.520 --> 44:25.520
her as a commodity. And when she looks at her mother, she sees someone who's opportunity at

44:25.520 --> 44:29.920
being something other than a housewife taken from her because she happened to get pregnant at a young

44:29.920 --> 44:35.200
age. So Eric assuming he and Donna will just get married and settled down, while Donna dreams of

44:35.200 --> 44:40.240
something more, explain why there might be some confusion on where the relationship is headed.

44:40.240 --> 44:45.200
The irony for Eric is that he's wrong to have any faith in the system. Red getting a job at

44:45.200 --> 44:50.640
Price Smart, saving their family from financial peril, is pure luck. To be fair, Red had originally

44:50.640 --> 44:55.680
been offered a job as a cashier, and then insisted on a management position. But even with the benefit

44:55.680 --> 45:00.720
of his hard head, that opportunity would be nothing if Price Smart hadn't chosen to open up a store

45:00.720 --> 45:06.160
in point place. But Eric does have the opportunity to learn better, and that comes in the shape of

45:06.160 --> 45:11.040
his mother Kitty. Kitty works as a nurse at a nearby hospital, a job she took on to help the

45:11.040 --> 45:15.920
family with her finances. When Eric goes to the hospital with Kitty for career day, he learns just

45:15.920 --> 45:21.040
how capable she is. You know, your mom does the work of five nurses. This place would fall apart

45:21.040 --> 45:28.240
without her. And she's so funny. Oh yeah, she is. Um, wait, no, she's not. And even more than that,

45:28.240 --> 45:33.200
Eric learns about one of the real challenges of working at a hospital. I mean, for Mr. Anderson,

45:33.200 --> 45:36.400
but you knew this guy, mom. How do you deal with all of this?

45:49.840 --> 45:54.560
While Eric and his mother would bond as the seasons went on, Kitty never quite becomes the

45:54.560 --> 45:59.280
force in the foreman household that Red is. If her job as a nurse symbolizes her strength,

45:59.280 --> 46:03.920
it's telling that she seems to quit and go back throughout the series, which reflects an

46:03.920 --> 46:10.080
insecurity in her status. That insecure status manifests in Eric, who has a less than perfect

46:10.080 --> 46:15.120
understanding that Donna wants to be more than a homemaker. Eric assumes his mother is happiest at

46:15.120 --> 46:21.120
home, when we'll see in later seasons that isn't really the case. For Donna, her faith in relationships

46:21.120 --> 46:25.760
is also reflected in how her parents seem to be falling apart in theirs. As Midge empowers herself

46:25.760 --> 46:30.480
through attempting to understand feminist theory, Bob grows worried that it may make her want to

46:30.480 --> 46:36.160
start becoming a radical and do something crazy, like get a job. Well, I'm the man of the house,

46:36.160 --> 46:42.720
and I say you're not going to community college. You can't tell me what to do, you big ass.

46:44.960 --> 46:49.520
Midge's interest in feminism is a bit fleeting, though, as she and Bob seem to drift with

46:49.520 --> 46:53.280
every fad that comes their way, from fondue to nudism.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.360
They used to be normal. What the hell happened to them?

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
Well, I don't know. How can she not eat meats? That can't be healthy.

47:02.800 --> 47:06.960
And over time, we find out that Bob and Midge just aren't happy together.

47:06.960 --> 47:10.800
Donna, your mother was fine until she met those feminists and started thinking.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.080
Well, excuse me, Bob, but I'm not happy.

47:16.080 --> 47:20.640
With her parents constantly fighting, the last thing Donna wants to create is a mere image of

47:20.640 --> 47:24.880
them with Eric. And without that positive role model for a happy relationship, she wants to

47:24.880 --> 47:29.200
create something new and different. Although feminism was a passing interest for Midge,

47:29.200 --> 47:34.480
it seems to have had a stronger impact on Donna. Hyde, Red, Jackie, and Kelso all respond to the

47:34.480 --> 47:40.400
changes of 1977 with a return to the familiar. For Hyde, it's a chance to have a father again.

47:40.400 --> 47:44.800
For Red, it's back to working as management in the corporate machine. For Jackie and Kelso,

47:44.800 --> 47:50.000
it's giving their troubled relationship another chance. But for Bob, he can't go back to running

47:50.000 --> 47:54.320
a store again, and he and Midge aren't returning to the happy marriage they once had. So Eric and

47:54.320 --> 47:59.040
Donna have to ask themselves where they are in this year of change, going down the familiar

47:59.040 --> 48:02.560
path of Eric's parents, or finding something completely new.

48:06.400 --> 48:12.000
1978 brought with it some major changes to the show. Eric is slowly realizing the relationship

48:12.000 --> 48:17.760
he has isn't like the one his mom and dad have. Eric tries to escalate his relationship with Donna

48:17.760 --> 48:23.120
by giving her a promise ring in the season 3 finale. As Donna considers the meaning of this

48:23.120 --> 48:29.200
promise ring, she realizes she's not ready for the commitment it represents. So she gives it back to Eric.

48:29.200 --> 48:34.560
The important thing is when you see yourself in Paris, or wherever, I'm there, right?

48:39.040 --> 48:50.960
Right? I don't know. Not always. We're together now. Isn't that enough? No! I mean...

48:53.600 --> 48:57.360
I mean damn, Donna! If you can see a future for yourself without me,

48:57.360 --> 49:00.880
and that doesn't like break your heart, then we're not doing what I thought we were doing here,

49:00.880 --> 49:05.120
and you know what? Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all. Are you breaking up with me?

49:06.160 --> 49:09.040
Well, are you getting back that ring?

49:12.080 --> 49:13.920
That's... Then...

49:18.320 --> 49:25.280
Yes. It's ironically not the present that breaks up Eric and Donna, but the future,

49:25.280 --> 49:30.400
and their different visions for it. Donna wants to see where life will take her, and Eric wants

49:30.400 --> 49:36.000
to start building a life he already imagines. And ironically, they end up heading into a direction

49:36.000 --> 49:41.120
neither of them wanted. After the breakup, Eric is left shattered in a way that anyone who's

49:41.120 --> 49:46.640
gone through their first breakup can probably relate to. Geez, huh? You look like you've just

49:46.640 --> 49:54.000
been dumped! Later on, Red actually offers some good advice. Listen, I'm gonna give you a few

49:54.000 --> 50:03.360
days to pull yourself together. You can stand bad and sleep, watch TV, whatever you need to do.

50:05.680 --> 50:11.680
Thank you, Dad. The fallout of Donna and Eric's split would play out over several episodes,

50:11.680 --> 50:16.960
with the two of them learning how to live among one another after some really nasty post-breakup

50:16.960 --> 50:22.160
feelings. But this moment where Eric and Red bond is surprisingly sweet, and in many ways

50:22.160 --> 50:26.800
emblematic of how the two have been growing increasingly close over the previous seasons.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.920
Sometimes it took the shape of Eric standing up to Red.

50:29.920 --> 50:33.040
Now you screwed yourself when you didn't return those books! Now go!

50:34.080 --> 50:36.160
Okay. No.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.400
Sometimes the bonding happened on a hunting trip.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.160
I think you're angry, because life didn't turn out exactly the way you wanted it to.

50:46.720 --> 50:52.400
And, uh, maybe you think if you yell at me, I won't let life push me around, too.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.840
You came up with that answer awful fast.

50:59.520 --> 51:05.440
Eric and Red's relationship is built on Eric's rebellion while understanding who his father is,

51:05.440 --> 51:11.600
and Red trying to make Eric who he thinks Eric needs to be. By reconciling all of these things,

51:11.600 --> 51:16.720
Eric is able to grow himself. Red is both a role model and cautionary tale for Eric,

51:16.720 --> 51:22.080
and he takes the lesson to heart. But Red is also a father to him that offers comfort and love when

51:22.080 --> 51:26.480
he needs it the most, like in that moment after his breakup with Donna. But there is something

51:26.480 --> 51:31.520
in the relationship that's shaped by the less enlightened era Red comes from, where emotions

51:31.520 --> 51:36.400
aren't so easily shared, such as when Red lies about crying after being dumped.

51:36.400 --> 52:05.200
It's a major event when Red tells Eric he loves him.

52:06.400 --> 52:15.760
I'm sorry, what?

52:16.720 --> 52:19.280
When Kitty finds out Red was hopped up on medication,

52:19.280 --> 52:23.200
she tries to stop Eric from returning the gesture.

52:36.400 --> 52:40.640
Go to your room.

52:42.080 --> 52:46.320
Red tries to explain the rules around saying I love you for men.

52:46.320 --> 52:49.200
When he's drunk, when he's dying,

52:50.160 --> 52:52.480
or when he's in big trouble and it's the only way out.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.400
Other than that.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.600
Other than that, it's just a given.

52:58.560 --> 53:03.520
While the idea that love is simply understood is nice, but it's clear from the rest of this episode

53:03.520 --> 53:08.240
that everyone understands that saying it out loud means something too, something more than that

53:08.240 --> 53:13.760
implicit understanding offers. That outward expression of emotion is not something Red can

53:13.760 --> 53:19.040
offer Eric. The relationship of a cold father to an emotionally needy son is an old trope,

53:19.040 --> 53:24.080
and by setting it in the 70s, maybe it seems more acceptable. But being a show from the 90s,

53:24.080 --> 53:28.800
it was aware of how limited this relationship could be, and watching 20 years on, it becomes

53:28.800 --> 53:32.800
more apparent. Fathers and sons should be able to say they love one another without

53:32.800 --> 53:37.120
slamming face first into this cliché of what masculinity should be.

53:37.120 --> 53:41.600
There's still a lot of positives between Eric and Red, but something as simple as them being

53:41.600 --> 53:46.080
open with their feelings is a sad limit for what could have been a more meaningful relationship.

53:46.080 --> 53:50.880
1978 brought with it the departure of Mitch. Growing so frustrated with her marriage to Bob,

53:50.880 --> 53:52.720
she takes off for California.

53:52.720 --> 53:55.920
I can't believe she would just take off without even a hint or a warning.

53:56.720 --> 54:00.560
No warning? Dad, she was always saying I'm unhappy and I'm gonna leave.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.280
I mean, that's just what married people say.

54:06.640 --> 54:10.080
Donna luckily has kitty to be there for her as a mother figure.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.880
But it's been so nice having someone to talk to since my mom left.

54:13.600 --> 54:17.920
I know. Someone who understands what I'm going through.

54:17.920 --> 54:21.520
Behind the scenes, the reason Tanya Roberts loved the show was to care for her husband,

54:21.520 --> 54:25.920
who had become terminally ill. Roberts would appear in later seasons in a handful of guest

54:25.920 --> 54:31.040
spots. We don't get nearly as much insight into how Donna handles the breakup, since the show

54:31.040 --> 54:36.080
focuses on Eric. But it's interesting that both of them turn to his parents for help getting

54:36.080 --> 54:40.160
through it, and the comfort they offer in some ways reinforces the idea of a happy ending in the

54:40.160 --> 54:44.880
future, that one day they'll find someone they won't break up with. They both try dating other

54:44.880 --> 54:50.000
people, with Donna dating Kelso's brother Casey, played by Luke Wilson. And Eric dates a few other

54:50.000 --> 54:55.120
girls, sometimes sneaking off with Red's new Corvette to attract them. None of these girls

54:55.120 --> 55:00.080
last long, and while Donna continues to date Kelso, Eric realizes he's still in love with her.

55:00.080 --> 55:06.720
And now, Donna, all of a sudden, it's like the day after we broke up. All over again.

55:06.720 --> 55:11.360
Casey is revealed to just be toying with Donna, leaving her heartbroken. So she runs off to

55:11.360 --> 55:16.560
California to be with Midge at the end of season 4. In the season 5 premiere, Eric goes to California

55:16.560 --> 55:24.880
to get her back. I love you. And I have so much to say, but I just... And a few episodes later,

55:24.880 --> 55:30.480
Eric and Donna get engaged. And the rest of season 5 largely see these two trying to win

55:30.480 --> 55:35.440
approval from everybody else for their decision to get married in their final year of high school.

55:35.440 --> 55:40.720
It's a very strange series of events when, in the space of roughly half a year, we go from

55:40.720 --> 55:45.680
Donna and Eric breaking up to getting engaged. In terms of real-world time, this played out on

55:45.680 --> 55:50.240
television over roughly a year and a half, which seems more reasonable, but the sheer volume of

55:50.240 --> 55:55.920
episodes crammed into each show's annual time span creates a real decompression of time. This

55:55.920 --> 56:00.080
can be understood as time feeling much longer when you're younger, and your teenage years

56:00.080 --> 56:04.880
seeming so grand and important that everything can change in the course of a few days or weeks.

56:04.880 --> 56:09.520
And two people can go from not knowing what their future might hold to knowing they'll be together

56:09.520 --> 56:14.960
forever over the course of a few months. It also reinforces how quickly Eric and Donna are growing.

56:14.960 --> 56:18.880
They manage to gain a lot of maturity in their time apart, and through the process of trying

56:18.960 --> 56:23.520
to convince everyone that their engagement is a good idea, we see what feels like the ultimate

56:23.520 --> 56:29.120
conclusion of the Eric and Red dynamic. As a disapproving Red throws numerous roadblocks to

56:29.120 --> 56:34.080
stop the wedding from happening, Eric refuses to back down, and Red has one final confrontation

56:34.080 --> 56:40.480
with him. You're stuck to your guns, and I admire that you're willing to go out on your own.

56:40.480 --> 56:52.720
Eric is now a man. And ironically, it wasn't by obeying Red that he got there,

56:52.720 --> 56:57.440
but by rebelling against him. And also by emulating him. Because Red Foreman is not

56:57.440 --> 57:03.040
a man who backs down, and now, neither is Eric. It's a bit strange how this relationship stopped

57:03.040 --> 57:08.560
being about Eric and Donna and gradually became more about Eric and Red. Eric's path to adulthood

57:08.560 --> 57:13.120
meant he has to move beyond his father and grow into something better. It's an uplifting message

57:13.120 --> 57:18.960
that reveals that Red can be a role model, but can't be a limit on who Eric can be. And Eric manages

57:18.960 --> 57:24.800
to make it to adulthood, not losing that sweeter, kinder, gentler side of himself. Donna's dreams

57:24.800 --> 57:29.040
of doing more outside of Point Place don't seem to come up as much in these episodes, and she

57:29.040 --> 57:33.200
doesn't think the marriage will somehow hinder that. The loss of Eric, her mother, and being

57:33.200 --> 57:38.160
messed with Casey has dropped her back into the arms of Eric, holding on to what certainty she

57:38.160 --> 57:43.760
can find in life. In some ways, this reflects the limited options of women of the era. If Donna

57:43.760 --> 57:48.880
represented this bold new feminist force ready to take on the world, a few bad turns are all it

57:48.880 --> 57:53.520
takes to leave her ready to move into a trailer and begin living the domestic life. Although she

57:53.520 --> 57:59.600
and Eric plan on going to college together, when Eric's plans change, so do hers and she stays in

57:59.600 --> 58:04.160
Point Place. Comparing her and Eric, it seems Eric has the brighter future with the path to happiness

58:04.160 --> 58:08.960
he wants right there for him when he's ready to take it. Donna has to compromise for him.

58:08.960 --> 58:13.760
But all of this started happening in season 5 is important because that seemed like the season

58:13.760 --> 58:19.040
where the show became more cynical and less thoughtful in its depiction of its characters.

58:19.040 --> 58:25.120
Season 5, which starts in the summer of 1978, has a strange feel to it. The characters seem to behave

58:25.120 --> 58:31.040
in a more exaggerated way. Red has always been mean to all of Eric's friends, Fez included, but

58:31.040 --> 58:36.400
he seems nastier to him starting in this season, often drifting into outright racism.

58:36.400 --> 58:41.040
Thanks for the help. You seem to have a natural talent for handling luggage.

58:42.400 --> 58:46.240
And speaking of comments like that, we'll see characters casually drop in gross stuff

58:46.240 --> 58:50.160
like this in random conversations. I'm starting to get into the Asian ladies.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.560
I know what you mean. The mystery of the Orient. I'm very sexy.

58:55.840 --> 59:00.720
Characters seem to bit flatter too. Eric, for example, started becoming far more nerdy in

59:00.720 --> 59:05.280
this season. In season 1, we found out he really enjoyed Star Wars. But in the following three

59:05.280 --> 59:11.040
seasons, it never really comes up. But starting in season 5, he's suddenly collecting action

59:11.040 --> 59:15.840
figures and getting very upset when Red makes a homophobic comment about Luke Skywalker.

59:15.840 --> 59:20.880
Luke Skywalker, this Luke Skywalker, that I'm sick of hearing about that little fruit.

59:20.880 --> 59:31.520
Luke Skywalker is not! He and Leia, clearly!

59:33.680 --> 59:38.960
Eric was never particularly cool, but he also wasn't so aggressively nerdy. By the way,

59:38.960 --> 59:44.480
the future has some bad news for Eric about the Luke and Leia thing. Red becomes increasingly

59:44.480 --> 59:48.640
patriotic in this season, even for some reason becoming a Nixon defender.

59:48.640 --> 59:50.640
Thank God for the honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh?

59:56.320 --> 59:57.120
What did you say?

59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.360
I said that Nixon was framed and Kennedy was a commie?

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.000
That's right.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.160
While Red always had a degree of patriotism in him, this is a far cry from the Red Forman

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.160
who confronted Gerald Ford about pardoning Nixon. Red's patriotism is now more of a cliche.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.280
The biggest change in season 5 though is with Kitty, when she mistakenly thinks she's pregnant

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.800
but is actually going through menopause. She reveals this in front of her parents,

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:38.960
played by Betty White and Tom Poston. This major moment in her life might have led to her character

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.080
growing beyond motherhood and evolving to someone different. And while we do see some nice moments

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.160
between her and her parents, what we get far more of in season 5 are a series of bad menopause jokes.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.240
Season 5 flattened its characters into cliches, making the dynamics less compelling than they

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.960
were in earlier seasons. Part of this is that the show's premise is literally trapping them

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.200
in this decade, meaning these characters are limited in the way they can grow or change.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.400
If they have to forever be teens, it doesn't really offer the opportunity to truly become

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.360
adults. Not every change in season 5 was a bad one though, as it did also include the introduction

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:30.960
of Kitty's new dog, Shotzi. Shotzi even joins a very special circle.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:43.920
At the beginning of season 4, Hyde is back living with the Four Men's.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:18.800
When Jackie pressures Kelso to get married, he runs away to California with Donna,

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.640
finally ending his relationship with Jackie for good. With Kelso gone,

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.080
Jackie goes into season 5 in a very different direction.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.760
This comes out of nowhere in the series, but there were a few hints leading up to this moment.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.880
As you saw earlier, Hyde took the fall for Jackie's pop possession,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.600
and between one of Jackie and Kelso's breakup, Hyde realizes he might have some feelings for her.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.160
But it doesn't get too much further than a kiss.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.880
A season and a half later, the two of them are exploring those old feelings for real.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.600
Although a new development, the spark for their relationship isn't terribly inspired.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:32.320
But it does offer a few nice moments that speak to their history,

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.720
like Jackie taking the fall for Hyde's pop possession. But when Jackie reveals she still

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.720
has some kind of attachment to Kelso, it puts a strain on her relationship with Hyde.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:51.040
Although they smooth things over, Hyde's concerns get the better of him when he thinks

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.520
he's caught Jackie and Kelso being intimate when she was really comforting him after Fez

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.160
had an erotic dream about Kelso. Hyde responds by cheating on Jackie.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.240
When the truth comes out, Hyde is left apologizing, and Jackie breaks things off.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.000
They get back together early in season six.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.160
If you note that when Jackie and Hyde got together, it was the summer of 1978. And now

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.760
looking at Donna and Jackie enjoying an afternoon run at the pool, it's still the summer of 1978.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.360
Not literally, of course. The show has actually gone through an entire season where the gang

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.920
finished their final year of high school. Yet, for some reason, the license plate still reads

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.200
1978. The kids of the show are trapped in the 70s and trapped in the show's cyclical storylines,

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.120
in a sense making a commentary about how shows like these are limited. Instead of its characters

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:00.080
growing over time, they're stuck. Even a show that was primarily designed to be driven by its

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:06.080
characters is eventually trapped by its premise. Season 5's trip to California had that 70s show

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.600
trap its characters in its own version of Hotel California, which, by the way, was originally

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:18.080
recorded in 1976, the first year covered in that 70s show. While Hyde continuously tries to escape

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.200
his circumstances, constantly getting pulled back into where he was before, Jackie's struggle is

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.800
a bit sadder. She only seems to ever be defined by who she is or who she isn't dating. While her

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.000
character is very much the vehicle for discussing relationships early on, particularly for Donna,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.840
who needs someone to help her make sense of her feelings for Eric, Jackie doesn't get a chance

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.760
to be much more than the relationship character. Jackie is very much carried by Mila Kunis'

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.960
performances, who manages to make the character both lovable and obnoxious in near-equal measures.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.560
She's a great part of the series, but the series doesn't do well enough to give her more varied

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:57.600
things to do. One change I haven't mentioned yet is that Tommy Chong joined the principal cast in

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:21.520
season 4 but left the show in season 5. The reason Chong left the show is because he was arrested

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.440
for selling 7,500 bongs through a company he partially owned. He had to pay a fine of

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.480
$20,000 and was sentenced to 9 months in prison, but he would eventually return to the show once

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.640
he had been let out. Another change we have to talk about is one that had built building for the

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:43.440
last few seasons. Fez was starting to get really weird. As the last in the gang to lose his virginity,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.680
one of the running gags for Fez was how his perpetual quest to hook up with someone never

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.160
seemed to work out. His dating life is a series of amusing fails, with my personal favorite being

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.600
Caroline, who he briefly dated in season 3. Caroline is not quite as sweet as she first appears.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.640
As you might have guessed, they break up. When Fez isn't failing in the dating world,

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.160
he is making numerous jokes about how horny he is. And the more he jokes,

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.880
the more the bar gets raised where what counts as creepy.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:59.520
Fez starts off as a little weird, but as the audience gets used to him, he has to say or do

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.240
something strange to remind everyone that he's not like everyone else, raising the bar for what

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.760
counts as weird. As the cycle repeats, the bar keeps getting raised, but at this point it isn't

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.360
as shocking because Fez has been building to this level for years. Fez also seems less like he's

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.440
from a real place anymore. In the early seasons whenever he speaks his native language, he defaults

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:45.120
to speaking Spanish. But now we're getting jokes like this. Fez seems more like a cartoon

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.520
character than an actual foreign exchange student. Fez's transformations is one of

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.000
the only ones that felt gradual in season 5 though. Even if the other characters all have some

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.040
degree of backstory, they still seem noticeably different as the show keeps them frozen in this

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.280
70s moment, while using a heavy hand to keep this impression that things are still fresh.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.720
But Fez was frozen very early on in the series as the series struggled to give him any lasting

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:15.440
changes to his character. He was just weird, and he kept getting weirder and, as a consequence,

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:21.840
creepier. As season 5 moves along, Lori makes her surprise return. And as Fez is under threat of

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:32.960
deportation, having graduated high school, Lori does something drastic. In the season 6 premiere,

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.840
the kids are alright, we found out that Lori's newly turned over leaf of being a better person

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.480
immediately turns back over and she returns to being horrible, leaving Fez to be her husband

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:55.440
in name only as she dates around. And that's about it. We don't get much more out of this plotline,

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.360
and Fez continues to putter along. One of the recurring themes for 1978 is how the characters

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.560
have become frozen. If the previous two years were about discovering a new world, stepping out into it,

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.960
and then saying maybe that wasn't such a great idea and heading back the way they came,

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.720
this year was very much about being frozen in place, deciding that where the show needs to be

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:23.200
is not in the brave new world of adulthood, but frozen in time in the waning years of the gang's

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.600
teenage life. This is part of what makes it difficult for sitcoms to maintain an audience

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.880
over time. One of the remaining draws is the original situation in the Situation Comedy.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.360
That 70s show was always meant to be character driven, which usually helps a sitcom overcome

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.760
that hurdle. But when those characters aren't allowed to grow, it means they can't drive the

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.440
series the way they were intended to. Because moving forward requires characters to grow,

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.240
and that 70s show's very premise means these characters have to stay locked in their teenage

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.960
years. Five years into the show should mean that Eric and Donna have gone off to college and be

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.520
halfway through it, but they're still only just graduating high school. Hyde should be striking

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.920
out on his own, but he's still learning lessons on growing up from the foreman's. Jackie should

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:11.440
be beyond her high school crushes, but she still hasn't even graduated yet. And Fez should be more

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.480
than this strange foreign exchange student, but none of his arcs ever amount to more than half a

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.920
season of antics. What this show does do well, though, is preserve the memory of who these people

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.960
should be. Much in the way it's looked back at the 1970s is preserving the memory of what that

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.680
decade was in the minds of certain people who experienced it. Maybe that's why this show had

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.520
such solid radiance around most of its run, because it was always about holding onto that

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.840
nostalgic moment, where you can hang out with your friends from high school and never worry

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.560
about them growing up and becoming completely different people. If sitcoms are comfort food,

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:53.680
maybe that's the way that 70s show is best memorialized. One of the hallmarks of that 70s

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.400
show was its frequent use of fantasy cutaways. That included parodies of pop culture from the

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.520
decade. There were some visual quirks that predated these parodies, though, with season one using

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.680
tableaus of famous works of art such as The Last Supper and Night Hawks. But it was the Star Wars

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.160
themed episode, A New Hope, that put characters in special costumes and sets, and really got the

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.040
parody ball rolling. From there on, there were dozens of other parodies, from I Love Lucy to

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:22.160
Charlie's Angels. I Love Lucy is obviously from the 1950s, not the 70s, but it worked because it

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.560
was something these characters were familiar with. And it was a necessity because, as the series

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.040
moved along, parodies from the 70s were harder to come by. It would be tough to include every

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.400
single parody, so here are my top three. The soap opera parody in season two's Van Stock episode

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:43.280
was an instant classic for me. I am leaving you for Dr. Cloak. Or should I say...

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.280
Eric's real father.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:13:01.360
He has a job. What do you have, Red Forman? What do you have?

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.840
After Red discovers the gang is smoking up, we get a great Reefer Madness parody in the season

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.680
three episode titled Reefer Madness. You've been, you missed choir practice. Sorry dollface, but now,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.720
thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.400
And the Happy Days parody in Jackie Says Cheese is double fun because it also makes a sly reference

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.480
to jumping the shark. Fez, you jumped that shark and you're not even wet!

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:46.480
One of the biggest changes in 1979 was Hyde learning that his father isn't the man he thought

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.560
he was. At the start of season seven in the episode, Let's Spend the Night Together,

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.320
we finally meet Hyde's father, William Barnett, often turned to WB, played by Tim Reed.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:05.760
At first, everyone is a bit unsure of how to talk to a black man.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:29.440
Considering this is a small town in Wisconsin in 1979, it makes some sense

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.320
that no one on the show knows how to talk to a black person, as the town is almost certainly

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.520
mostly white. But Hyde does take an immediate shine to his new father.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.720
Although there's a little friction at first, the two eventually start forging a relationship,

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.680
with Hyde working at one of the record stores his father owns. The introduction of WB introduces a

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.480
new dynamic to the mostly white show, though only insofar as we get a lot of jokes like this.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.560
Hyde also meets his half-sister Angie, played by Megalyn Etchikunwoke.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.160
It is interesting to see the introduction of a black family that's not only wealthy,

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.880
but so wealthy they're on a higher class level than any of the white characters. The impact of

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.440
race on these characters doesn't really come up though aside from the many jokes about how they

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.880
are, in fact, black. Though that might reflect how wealth offers some degree of protection from

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.120
more common types of bigotry, none of the black characters are a big enough part of the series to

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.920
really explore that issue though. What this means for Hyde is that he once again has a new father

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.240
figure. His fourth of the series, it's not too difficult to parse that the show is telling us

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.800
what a troubled young man needs, is a father giving him some kind of guidance and structure,

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.920
a lesson so important it's repeated four times. Five if you count Eric in red. And with Tommy

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.360
Chong out of jail, the show brings back another father figure for good measure.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:15.040
In season seven we see Hyde and Jackie once again back together, only to break up once more. Then

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.720
get back together again. And then break up one last time. That last breakup is particularly

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:26.560
galling as it happens with Hyde walking in on Jackie and Kelso, again, mistakenly thinking they

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.600
slept together. This moment reinforces how cyclical the narratives on this show can get as

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.080
they're trapped in this decade repeating the same mistakes over and over as their show gets

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.560
extended long beyond its expiration date because of its need to make a profit for its corporate

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.160
overlords. Or at least that's how I suspect Hyde would phrase it. In season eight we find out Hyde

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.840
is permanently moved on from Jackie and married a stripper he met in Las Vegas. His new wife Samantha

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.600
is played by Jude Tyler. The marriage doesn't last when Hyde finds out his new wife already has

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.200
a husband. Heading into 1979, Kelso was making some major strides towards growing up. He had

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.200
decided on the career path of becoming a police officer. I'm gonna be a cop!

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.760
Not too long after, when Kelso was trying to convince everyone he hooked up with Donna's

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.560
friend Brooke, played by Shannon Elizabeth, the truth comes out in an unexpected way.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.160
Although Brooke tells Kelso he doesn't have to be involved with the baby since she doesn't see

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.160
him as father material, Kelso eventually decides he wants to be a part of the life of his child

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.120
when they're born. Brooke's mother, played by Morgan Bearchild, plans on taking Brooke to Chicago

01:17:45.120 --> 01:18:04.720
to raise the child. When the baby is born, she's named Betsy. And eventually Kelso decides he can't

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.760
stand to be away from his daughter, and after the police fire him, he moves to Chicago. Kelso's

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.400
maturing is difficult to pin down. If having a career wasn't the path to adulthood for him,

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.560
but being a father was, it does suggest the value of family over one's career. Though the

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.360
idea of Kelso being a cop is more a nightmare scenario than a standard career path. Kelso's

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.840
departure was more likely triggered by Ashton Kutcher deciding to leave the series after its

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.520
seventh season, although he would make a few guest appearances in season eight to give his

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.440
character a proper send-off. And Kelso leaves point place for good. Well, I guess it's time to go,

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.480
so, see ya.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.640
After his marriage to Laurie, Fez finally becomes an American citizen. He would go from working at

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:55.120
the DMV to getting a job as a shampoo boy at a salon, and of course being increasingly weird and

01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:07.360
creepy. And this is the stuff he talks about when he's not hiding in Donna's club.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.880
Yeah, it's starting to get really weird with Fez. Jackie's life gets complicated after her

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.440
father goes to prison, and Jackie is left to fend for herself. This eventually leads to her and Fez

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.520
moving in together. For a brief moment, it seemed as though Jackie would have a story arc that wasn't

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.800
about her dating life when she starts working in television for local TV star Christine St. George,

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:36.560
played by Mary Tyler Moore. But the job doesn't last, and eventually Jackie's story intersects

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:51.040
with Fez for yet another romance. There are better reasons not to date Fez, mostly because

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.360
he has no boundaries in impressing himself upon women. But one of the strange quirks about Fez's

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.920
gradual change over the years is that it simply gets put in the bucket of him being odd. It was

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.920
his character trait at the beginning of the series, and even though it's elevated dramatically,

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.400
to the point where he's creeping around in the closet of his friend, he's still covered by the

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.440
odd foreigner label, and it's the second part of that Jackie has trouble with. Or at least she does

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.080
for a little while until she gets over it and decides to pursue Fez in earnest, heading toward

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.040
the show's finale. In the final year of the show, Kitty's journey through menopause finished,

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.920
and she went on another journey into heavy drinking. It's a far cry from the woman who

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:33.040
once struggled with her need to nurture and how it led her to nursing. Post-menopause, most jokes

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:47.520
from Kitty were about her drinking problem. Kitty going from being the mother who brings

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.160
her kids cookies and cocoa to the one who spends most of her time mixing drinks for herself would

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.960
be an incredibly sad character arc on most other shows, but it's played with some levity here.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.800
It does raise the question of what menopause did to Kitty's psyche,

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.680
but that's never really explored on the show. Kitty's menopause and drinking reveal how tragedy

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.080
is molded through the candy colors of a sitcom to make things seem brighter, and maybe they're

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.280
doing the same thing with the whole decade of the 1970s. That could be why people love this show so

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.000
much. It lets you smile through tragedy. It's good for coping. If it was too real, it would be too

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.280
heartbreaking. If it wasn't real enough, it wouldn't resonate. The balance is key. In earlier seasons,

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.840
I think the show did a better job of that, but even in later ones, it does attempt to strike

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.720
some kind of balance. Red manages to find some new ventures when he stops working at Price Mart

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.360
and ends up opening a muffler shop. You might wonder where Red got the money for a muffler shop,

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:50.080
but he was creative with that. Red struggles to keep the shop open when a rival store from a big

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:55.920
chain opens up nearby, but luckily for him, they make an offer and Red decides to sell the muffler

01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:11.120
shop. So now Red has enough money to retire. What might have been some bad luck hitting Red

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.920
once again ends up in his favor since he's the guy who owned the muffler shop and not just someone

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.560
who worked there. Although Bob wasn't quite so fortunate in previous seasons, Red does show at

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:25.440
once odds improve if you can position yourself as the business owner than its worker. Although

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:31.360
looking at this in totality, it really seems like business is something of a crop shoot. Maybe

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.200
you'll succeed, maybe you won't. It all depends on whether or not big businesses come in and

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.320
stomp you out of business or decide to buy you off. Although there is one consistent that remains

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.880
true for all business ventures on this show, the only way Red could get into this position is that

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.280
he had to sell out his own son's future. It certainly says something that all the major

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.320
business successes on this show involve screwing over another person. The Eric and Donna saga

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.360
continued with the wedding at the end of season 6 being called off when Eric got scared and ran

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.440
away before it could happen, in part because he realized the wedding was keeping Donna from

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.080
pursuing her dreams since she chose to stay in point place to be with him instead of going to

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.400
college. The pair spend season 7 together unsure of how their life will move forward. Donna decides

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.120
to dye her hair. The real reason for Laura Prepon doing this was because she needed to be blonde for

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.920
an upcoming movie she was starring in called Carla. Eric spends most of season 7 trying to

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.400
figure out what to do with his life before finally settling on becoming a teacher. Since

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:33.040
Red spent all of Eric's college money on the muffler shop, Eric needs to find some other way

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.760
of paying for college, and he comes up with an unorthodox solution. There's this program where

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.960
you go and teach an impoverished area for a year and then they pay for your college. I signed up.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.520
That's wonderful. So where then? Africa.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.800
Africa, Wisconsin?

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:57.280
Eric will be spending next year teaching in Africa. We don't know where exactly,

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.000
and the show never quite goes into detail. We only know it's somewhere in the second biggest

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.960
continent on the planet. I need these shots. Africa is very strict about these things,

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.720
and they're not strict about anything. I mean, the women walk around with their hooves hanging

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.440
on. There's something that needs to be addressed that occurs constantly throughout this series,

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.240
particularly in the later seasons. Characters are increasingly ignorant or sometimes outright

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.040
disrespectful and racist towards any culture outside of their Midwest bubble. This is excused

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.240
by the context of the series, since it's just assumed that people in the 1970s were more likely

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.760
to be culturally insensitive. While that may be true, that 70s show in its inception seemed to

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.400
want to be a little more enlightened than that. For example, Fez being welcomed into the gang of

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.560
friends was a gesture of kindness that was at odds with more ignorant characters such as Red,

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.400
and while they often didn't understand his cultural references, as his oddness perhaps

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.880
became too central a point of his character, there was a genuine attempt to not just make him a

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.440
walking collection of stereotypes. Similarly, when the first season introduced gay characters,

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.840
they resisted being tired cliches or harmful stereotypes, and the characters around them are

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.640
far more accepting than one might expect from a group of straight teens in the 1970s. But by

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.360
season 7, some of that care had faded away, and in the interest of letting us, the audience,

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.920
laugh at the racism of the past in the presumed comfort that it doesn't exist in the present.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.040
Something that certainly isn't true, and breeds a degree of complacency towards racial issues.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.680
When the show has its fun making fun of Africa in a broad context, it's nudging the audience with

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.560
a knowing wink saying, isn't it great people aren't this ignorant anymore? When the truth is,

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.400
a lot of people would struggle to come up with the name of African countries where Eric might

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:40.160
be headed to. On the flip side, the ready acceptance of Hyde's new black family is lovely to see,

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.280
even if, in the case of characters like Jackie, it's motivated by greed. So, like many things in

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.840
the later seasons of the series, there is a generous mix of good and bad that complicates

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.440
characters that, ironically, behave very simply. It's an uneven tone that speaks to the strange

01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.720
lens sitcoms use to make the word simpler, yet complex enough to be convincing. At least for a

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.240
couple of laughs. As Eric prepares to head out to somewhere in Africa, he waves goodbye and is on

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:16.640
his way east, across the Atlantic. The real reason Eric has to leave the show is because

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.760
Topher Grace had been looking to go beyond the series and would soon be appearing in movies.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.560
To replace him, the character of Charlie Richardson, played by Brett Harrison, was introduced.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.080
And when Harrison was offered the lead in his own show, The Loop,

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.800
he was quickly killed off at the beginning of season 8.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:45.440
To replace him, the character Randy Pearson, played by Josh Myers, was introduced.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.800
When Eric breaks up with Donna over a letter,

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.880
Randy becomes her love interest through some of season 8. The fan reaction to Randy was not great,

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.360
and while Randy's presence wasn't the sole reason, ratings for season 8 were on a steady

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:10.240
decline. Without Eric and Kelso, that 70's show just didn't have the magic it once had.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.240
It was then that the network decided to cancel it, with its final two episodes airing together,

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.400
Love of My Life and That 70's Finale, ended the decade for good on May 18th, 2006.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.400
In the penultimate episode of the series, characters are quickly moved into place for

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.200
the finale, so they can finally escape the 70's. Hyde is given a record store by his father.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.000
Yes, you're the proud owner of the last remaining grooves.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.960
Holy crap, I own this place?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.480
Jackie and Fez get together.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.520
And we find out that Eric is coming back to point place.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.440
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.240
The final episode of the series takes place, as you might expect, on New Year's Eve,

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.840
1979. But the surprise return we get isn't Eric. Rather, it's Kelso.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.240
There you guys are. Kelso!

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.520
Hey man, why don't you get back?

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.760
Man, come on, I'm not gonna spend New Year's without my friends.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.360
Come on! It's like, the turn of the century!

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:30.000
As everyone celebrates the coming New Year inside, Donna waits outdoors,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.160
before finding out that Eric was coming back, she had already made a remind to finally go to

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.280
college. But with him returning, she can't bring herself to get on that bus out of town

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.760
just yet. Not without seeing him first.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.000
And as she reminisces about all the time they spent together, Eric returns.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:47.920
Happy New Year.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.320
Eric.

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.040
Red was right.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.120
I am a dumbass.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.140
Donna.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.160
I'm sorry.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.040
And we end the series with one final circle.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.920
Did you guys hear about that car that runs on water?

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.400
It's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine and it runs on water, man!

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.680
It's like we never run out of things to talk about down there.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.560
And we count down the end of 1979.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.680
Three, two, one!

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.520
Eric going away made his relationship with Donna so much more meaningful.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.920
They both understood what they were missing in a way that a breakup doesn't quite match when

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.800
they see each other all the time. And it's that old saying of, if you love something, set it free.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.360
If it returns, it was meant to be.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.840
As the show sends everyone away for the new decade, it seems to be telling the audience that

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.760
everyone is gonna be okay. They'll all be fine no matter what might lay ahead.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.080
One touch I really liked was that the ending credits of the series are the same as the first

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.080
episode of the series. The gang is singing Tom Rungren's Hello It's Me. At the end of the pilot,

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.720
seeing this was an endearing introduction to these teenagers making their way through a decade

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:16.000
that was only vaguely familiar to me. But here at the end of the series, it's nostalgia for the

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.520
beginning of a show that was built on nostalgia. That 70 show is about these kids driving down the

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.640
street, taking their first step into the big new world. But this show isn't about that journey in

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:31.760
the new world. It's about being in that moment on the cusp of that journey. It's why everyone in the

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:37.200
series is trapped in high school, in their teen years, in the 70s. It's a memory of that moment

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.600
that stretches for as long as the series can hold on to it, when you felt like the world was going

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:46.880
to be something new and exciting. While it didn't always have the best grasp of its premise, it did

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.080
have a firm hold on that feeling it wanted to evoke. And those final lyrics we hear from Hello

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:58.800
It's Me sound even clearer. It's important to me that you know you are free, because I never want

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.160
to make you change for me.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:17.760
The success of that 70 show spawned a spin-off a few years later. Although a lot of the same

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:22.000
creative talent was responsible for the show behind the scenes, that didn't manifest itself

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:29.120
into another hit. That 80s show debuted on January 23rd, 2002, to a warm response initially,

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.920
but quickly sank in the ratings throughout its first season. It was quickly cancelled after 13

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:39.440
episodes. There are a number of reasons cited for why the show failed, leaning a bit too hard on

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.880
gags about the decade instead of having characters drive the series. Also, people had less nostalgia

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.840
for the 80s than they did the 70s, and the cast didn't quite have the same chemistry as the ones

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.280
on that 70s show. Watching it again 20 years later, I personally didn't think it was as bad as I

01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.000
remembered it being, but it definitely doesn't have the magic of the original series it spun

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.120
off of. One interesting bit of trivia about the series is that it stars a young Glenn Howerton

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.160
who would go on to play Dennis in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's rumored his character,

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:16.000
Corey Howard, supposedly was Eric Borman's first cousin, but this never actually comes up in the

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:27.920
series itself. On February 12, 1999, another That 70s Show program aired in England, under the name

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:34.560
Days Like These. This is a nearly identical remake of the American series, except subtly changed to

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:39.920
move the show from Point Place, Wisconsin to Blutton, England. The scripts were kept nearly

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:45.040
identical aside from a few cultural references being changed. Only the British cast didn't quite

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.520
perform it with the same energy as the American one. Here's an example of two scenes and how they

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.800
played out in each show.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:35.840
It's not quite the same, is it? British audiences weren't very impressed and the show only aired

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:46.800
at 10 of the 13 episodes produced. In October of 2021, Netflix announced they were producing

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.920
a new spin-off of That 70s Show titled That 90s Show. It would bring Kurtwood Smith and Deborah

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.800
Joe Rupp in their roles as Red and Kimmy Borman back. The premise of the series was that Eric

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:02.480
and Donna's daughter Leah was spending the summer of 1995 in Point Place. Aside from Smith and Rupp,

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:08.960
the rest of the cast is made up of Callie Heverda, Ashley Afterhide, Miss Coronel, Maxwell A.C.

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.960
Donovan, Rainn Doy, and Sam Morales. Other original cast members slated to appear are

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.800
Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama. Although, as of

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.440
the time of writing this, it seems they'll only be making guest appearances. Running for 10 episodes

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.240
and shot in the multi-camera style of the original, it's already been filmed and is currently waiting

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:40.160
for its premiere date on Netflix. Topher Grace left That 70s Show to star in Spider-Man 3 as

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.880
Eddie Brock slash Venom. He would go on to star in a number of other movies as well, including

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.800
In Good Company and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton. Most recently, he's been a part of the TV series

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.720
Home Economics. Laura Prepon would appear in several TV and film projects following the end

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.440
of That 70s Show, most notably as the character Alex Vance in the Netflix series Orange is the

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.520
New Black. Most recently, she and her husband celebrated the birth of their second child in

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.360
February of 2020. Mila Kunis has been featured in several projects following the end of That 70s

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:17.760
Show, including Black Swan, Bad Moms, and Voice in the Character Meg in nearly 400 episodes of Family

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:22.720
Guy. In 2012, she began dating her former co-star, Ashton Kutcher, and the two would eventually

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:29.120
marry in 2015. They currently have two children together. Ashton Kutcher starred in a number of

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.240
movies and TV shows, notably No Strings Attached, What Happened in Vegas, and he replaced Charlie

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.520
Sheen on Two and a Half Men. He's most recently starred in The Branch on Netflix, which ran for

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.560
four seasons, split into eight parts. In his personal side, in addition to marrying Mila Kunis

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.080
and having two children, he's also in the process of treatment for a recent diagnosis of vasculitis.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.520
Wilma Roald Rama went on to appear on several TV shows and movies following the end of That 70s

01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.440
Show, perhaps most notably as the character Nick Torres on NCIS. He's also currently cast as Don

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.360
Diego de la Vega, better known as Zorro in an upcoming Zorro TV series. Kurtwood Smith would

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.320
continue his very prolific acting career with appearances on 24, Agent Carter, and doing voice

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.560
work on a number of different animated projects. Although it was a role he had before That 70s

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.720
Show, I personally remember him most fondly for his role in the Star Trek Voyager two-parter,

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.520
Year of Hell. Deborah Jo Rupp has been working both on screen and on stage, including several

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.240
productions on Broadway. One of her most recent high-profile roles was on the WandaVision series.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.800
She was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her portrayal of Dr. Ruth in the stage

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:40.240
production Becoming Dr. Ruth. Don Stark has been consistently working since the end of That 70s

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.920
Show, often with guest spots on a number of different TV programs. He also had several

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.600
reoccurring roles on Hit the Floor and Marin. Tanya Roberts had largely stepped away from

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.680
the world of acting following her departure from That 70s Show to take care of her husband,

01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:01.280
her final roles in 2005 in the TV series Barbershop. Sadly, on January 4, 2021, she passed away due to

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.640
complications from an advanced case of sepsis. Lisa Robin Kelly left the world of acting after

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.560
That 70s Show, only to briefly reappear in two shorts. She had a series of high-profile arrests

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:17.120
related to substance abuse and domestic violence. She passed away on January 3,

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.040
2014, while in rehab, and her cause of death is reported as multiple drug intoxication.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.400
Tommy Chong has been working regularly since the end of That 70s Show, including a reunion with his

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.640
longtime partner, Cheech Marin, to revive their classic stoner duo of Cheech and Chong. In 2012,

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:39.280
he announced that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was receiving treatment. As of 2019,

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.440
he announced that he is currently cancer-free. In 2017, Danny Masterson had three separate

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:51.680
allegations of sexual assault filed against him, and on June 17, 2020, he was charged with three

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.960
separate instances of rape. He is currently scheduled to be criminally tried on October 11,

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.920
2022. This is the part of the retrospective where I give you all some parting thoughts

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.120
to close this off, hopefully fostering some understanding of the good and bad of a classic

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.600
series. Maybe one you might want to go watch yourself and come up with your own reading for,

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.480
or maybe one you'd just be happy knowing a little more about. I want to try something a little

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.080
different, though, with this one. While working on this video, one problem I could not solve was

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.920
how to talk about Danny Masterson. Unlike Roseanne Barr or Bill Cosby, Masterson was not the driving

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.200
force behind this production. His alleged sexual assault happened in his personal life and seemingly

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.480
didn't impact the production of the series. But even so, if you believe the women who have accused

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.640
him, and I am inclined to do that, it makes it difficult to watch without that knowledge

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:47.760
constantly floating around in your mind. While researching this video, I also learned one of the

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.840
women who accused him, Chrissy Carnell Bixler, appeared in an episode of the series. What seems

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.720
to be just a fun little throwaway line in an episode takes on a different tone when you

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.880
understand the context behind it. There's also the claims that Masterson is being protected by

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.840
the Church of Scientology, which is such a messy and complicated claim that I can't possibly do

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.720
it justice in this video. There's lots of other resources, I'll link a few below if you'd like

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:18.240
to learn more about this case. It raises important questions, like do the actions of this one man

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.640
wipe out an entire series? That 70s show wouldn't be the same without Hyde, but it wasn't exactly

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.520
his show. And the work of all those people being forgotten because of the actions of one man seems

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.840
unfair. If you're someone who wants to enjoy the show in spite of knowing what's been alleged

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:39.840
against Masterson, I think that's okay. But for some people, that just isn't possible. They can't

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.120
watch this series without that knowledge tainting it and in some way undermining the experience,

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.240
and I think that's okay too. People are allowed to have complicated relationships with art,

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:56.000
and you're allowed to take what you want, or skip the process entirely if you don't want to deal

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.280
with it at all. Regardless of how you feel about that 70s show, though, I do think what is very

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:07.040
important is that all claims of sexual assault should be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.920
Ultimately, I think that's far more important than whether or not you can sit down and enjoy

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.600
a sitcom without feeling guilty about it. That 70s show can decolored nostalgia, holding onto

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.640
that naive optimism of your waning teen years. It's a show that helps you remember the good parts

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:28.000
of the past while forgetting the bad. Just remember to keep one foot in reality, and get

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:36.960
ready to face it again when you're ready to leave the circle. The ending to this retrospective is

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.640
making me think there is a video that will one day need to be made about how to engage with art

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.200
that was, at least in part, created by people who have done harmful and sometimes heinous things

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:55.600
behind the scenes. Speaking of values, though, if you think this video had any sort of value,

01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.320
do consider becoming a patron or member like the lovely names you see scrolling up the screen.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.640
You'll have early access to videos in the future and a little extra say on what the next sitcom I

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.120
cover will be, and there are other little bonuses I've thrown along the way. If you would like to

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:15.120
support this channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment, subscribe, and do hit the

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.960
bell for notifications. Thank you all so much for watching. And for sticking around to the end of

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.400
the credits, I want to share one of my favorite jokes from that 70s show. This is Red counseling

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.960
Eric after he accidentally ran over Donna's cat, Mr. Bonkers.
