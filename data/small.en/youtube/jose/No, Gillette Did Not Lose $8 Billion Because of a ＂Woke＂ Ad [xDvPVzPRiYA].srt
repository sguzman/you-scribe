00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
My sponsor for this video is not Gillette and their razors suck.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
In January of 2019, Gillette released an ad titled,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,120
We Believe The Best Men Can Be Gillette short film about the danger of toxic masculinity.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
And to sell razors, of course.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,640
In some corners of the internet, this was taken as a direct assault on men and masculinity,

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
and the outrage helped fuel this ad to reach millions of viewers.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
The story of using socially progressive messaging in advertising has already been told in a great

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
video by Hbomberguy. You can go watch that if you want a bit more detail on how these companies

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
use these methods to sell their products. This video isn't about that, though. It's about what

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,960
happened with the Gillette outrage a few months later. In July of 2019, Procter & Gamble, Gillette's

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,040
parent company, announced in its fourth quarter earnings report that it was writing down the

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,200
value of its Gillette assets by $8 billion. The reaction from the outrage mob was predictable,

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,440
lots of crowing and patting themselves on the back, and people were hurriedly adding

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,640
yet another entry to the spurious list of things that went woke and got broke.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
Which is still ridiculous, because this write-down has nothing to do with the ad in question.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,760
One of the common misconceptions about this $8 billion loss is that it reflects a dramatic

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,640
drop in sales of Gillette products. A quick look at the sales figures tells us this is impossible.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
Gillette is part of Procter & Gamble's grooming division, a division that, in all of its 2019

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,320
fiscal year, had sales of $6.2 billion, roughly a 5% drop from last year's $6.6 billion. So,

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,880
obviously, that's not a drop of $8 billion. And even though the ad came out in January,

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,800
Procter & Gamble's fiscal year actually ends in June, so it would only have about five months of

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,040
sales to lose $8 billion. This write-down wasn't about millions of people leaving the Gillette brand

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,760
en masse. Unlike certain critics, let's actually read the whole article to get a better understanding

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,880
of what happened here. It quite clearly calls this $8 billion write-down. This is when a company

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
looks at the assets it has and lowers their value based on demand in the market. Here's a small

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,000
example to explain that. Let's say we have a piece of clothing such as jorts, and you're a company

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
that has a warehouse full of jorts in the midst of a jorts craze sweeping the world. You would

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
record that stash of jorts as an asset in your books, and you'd value it based on the high price

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,600
people are currently paying for jorts. As time goes by, humanity comes to its senses and realizes

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,880
that jorts are, in fact, ugly clothing no sane person would wear. As demand goes down, the average

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,120
price for jorts goes down with it, and that warehouse full of jorts you have is now worth

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,640
substantially less. While the physical asset of jorts remains completely unchanged throughout

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,200
this time period, their value in the marketplace has gone down, and a responsible company would

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
need to update this value in its books by writing it down. And we're seeing something similar happen

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,680
here with razors. Although razor technology hasn't changed dramatically, it's men's fashion that has

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
been changing over the last decade, and beards are very fashionable these days. Less guys shaving

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,520
means less guys are buying razors. There's also the fact that the population, at least in the

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,320
United States, and older men generally don't shave themselves as frequently as younger men.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Add into the fact that Gillette, which once had very little in the way of competition, is now

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,880
facing some serious resistance from companies like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. Suddenly,

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,720
you've got a brand that's having a much tougher time sell in its products, and Gillette's sales

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,440
over the past decade reflect that, showing a steady decline in year-over-year sales. Proctor

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,680
and Gamble also reported that its global sales are less profitable due to currency fluctuations

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,800
around the world. That's a whole other topic in finance that I'm even less qualified to speak about.

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,600
The point is that Gillette's trouble as a brand had been well known for some time. Here's an article

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,280
from back in 2017 demonstrating that Gillette as a brand was having a tough time. Let's keep one

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
thing straight though. Gillette still has a massive mortgage share. There are a lot of different

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,360
estimates of this, but I've seen numbers from everywhere between 50 to 60%, but that's a far

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,360
cry from the 70% at once claim. It means that this incredibly profitable business is now only

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,600
fairly profitable. It stands to reason that a brand that doesn't make as much money as it used

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,400
to isn't going to be worth as much in the marketplace. Proctor and Gamble purchased Gillette

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,600
in 2005 for the enormous sum of $57 billion, and while Gillette showed strong growth in the years

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
that followed, in the early 2010s it demonstrated a sizable decline, meaning if Proctor and Gamble

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,160
were to try and sell Gillette on the market today, it's quite likely it wouldn't fetch quite as high

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,040
a price. A write-down is an accounting technique used to reflect this new reality. It also lets

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,760
the parent company, in this case Proctor and Gamble, lower its tax burden. If it's reporting

57
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,400
to its government that its assets are worth $8 billion less than previously reported, that's

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,720
$8 billion they won't have to pay taxes on at the end of the year. The annual earnings report this

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
was all announced and also announced very strong sales and overall growth for the Proctor and Gamble

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,640
company. So when this news went public, the market, being aware of how all this works,

61
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,280
wasn't dissuaded by the write-down and instead focused on the strong sales growth, decided to

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
buy up shares of Proctor and Gamble and sent the stock to a record high. This, obviously, flies in

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
the face of the idea that a commercial about toxic masculinity ruined Gillette and cost them

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,320
$8 billion. Not that right-wing media outlets let it stop them from running countless stories about

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,920
just that. My absolute favorite comes from the Washington Examiner, which originally ran an

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,880
article with a headline reading, Gillette CEO, $8 billion loss is price worth pain over hashtag

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,040
me too campaign, which would later be updated with this correction. Correction. The Washington

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,680
Examiner has updated the story to remove the suggestion that Gillette lost $8 billion due to

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,480
its me too inspired advertising campaign. We regret that this article did not adhere to the

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Washington Examiner's normal standards and procedures and the headline had to be changed to

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,240
Gillette CEO losing customers over hashtag me too campaign is price worth pain. How many customers

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
were lost? Did it have a meaningful impact? This article can't really tell us and that's kind of

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,000
the point. It's just a bunch of noise. But did this ad actually have an impact? I want to look

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,040
at the sales numbers one more time. In this annual data, we can see sales for Gillette have been going

75
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,440
down for a long time. The last eight years in particular have not been kinds of the brand.

76
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,680
And when did this commercial debut? Right about here. When trying to measure the value of the

77
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
Gillette brand and its associated assets, one of the key metrics is going to be how much it earns

78
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,960
via sales. And if poor sales are responsible for lowering its value, this has been a problem long

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,920
before the ad about toxic masculinity. You could argue that unlike Nike, this ad didn't do much

80
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,040
to help Gillette. And that seems like a fair assessment. It's not like this ad and the media

81
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,120
storm that followed really turned the brand's fortunes around. There's all sorts of reasons

82
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,800
why this could be true. People are probably more likely to make a political statement through

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
their fashion choices rather than through whatever grooming products they have in their washroom.

84
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,440
But the argument that being woke destroyed Gillette's business, especially when it still

85
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
makes over six billion dollars a year, isn't anywhere close to true. And with that, we can

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,720
put this story to bed. Another bad argument in the long line of trash fire arguments about

87
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,960
getting woke and going broke. So why the hell am I talking about a story that's nearly a year old?

88
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
One of my most downvoted videos is why get woke, go broke is a lie. While I'd like to think it's

89
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,400
because the title should obviously have been get woke, go broke is a joke, the truth is,

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,080
according to the comments, that I was avoiding the much stronger examples of how inserting woke

91
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,080
politics into anything turns off a mainstream audience. Chief among those examples is the Gillette

92
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,560
eight billion dollar loss, which dribbles into the comments section of that video on a regular

93
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,360
basis. I always found it strange that I kept seeing these comments and obviously false story

94
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,400
about a single ad costing a company eight billion dollars should make someone skeptical or at least

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,120
raise some alarms. That's obviously a sensational story. Even if you're someone inclined to believe

96
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,160
the whole get woke, go broke thing, this should still make you pause. Doesn't it seem a little

97
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,520
far fetched? I think what we need to consider is that when people spread this talking point,

98
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,440
they aren't trying to demonstrate their knowledge of a subject, but rather their membership in a

99
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,960
group. In recent years, psychologists have been anxiously studying the expansion of fake news

100
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,760
ever since social media started becoming such a pervasive spreader of it. Recent research shows

101
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,480
us quite depressingly that false news not only spreads widely on the internet, it also spreads

102
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,360
much quicker than real news. This is especially true for anything considered political. According

103
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,240
to a review of the research published by the American Psychological Association, facts tend

104
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
to be spread by partisans on the left and the right at the same rate, regardless of whether or

105
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
not that information is true. Part of the reason this information is spread on social media

106
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
is not the desire to inform our contemporaries, but to signal that we are, in fact, part of the

107
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,560
same political group. Daniel Kahane, a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School, offers

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,280
some insight using the politically contentious topic of climate change. If you take an ordinary

109
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,080
member of the public, his or her carbon footprint is too small to make an effect on climate change.

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
If they make a mistake on the science in that part of their life, nothing bad happens to them,

111
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,360
but they can be adversely affected if they're holding a deviant view on an identity-defining

112
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,720
issue inside their social group. In other words, when someone shows up to my comments section to

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
mention a talking point that never had any way behind it, they aren't honestly hoping to change

114
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,360
my mind. They're just letting me and any other commenters know that they belong to a certain

115
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,880
political group, one that opposes the group I represent. And when watching some of the videos

116
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,360
on YouTube pushing narratives like Get Woke Go Broke that have a tenuous connection to any sort

117
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,760
of evidence, you can see how they're constructed not to provide greater context or understanding,

118
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
but instead taking a news story and placing it into a more exciting narrative,

119
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,400
one that binds its audience together. They're going there to have their opinions reinforced,

120
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,880
and to see other people in the comments section or on Twitter who feel the exact same way that

121
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,640
they do. They may go on to other social media platforms where they continue to signal to one

122
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
another that they're in the same social circle. No one really understands anything that they're

123
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,240
talking about, but they've at least identified their compatriots, their friends, their community.

124
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
And that's what this is all about. It's about building communities and making friends. And on

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
its face, that's a lovely thing. Making friends and building a community is something everyone

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,360
wants and I generally recommend. But where it goes wrong is when it's centered around blindly

127
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,080
following someone who's deeply ignorant of politics, or worse yet, misrepresenting the

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,880
news of the day to advance a toxic political agenda. Some of the most successful YouTube

129
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,520
and Twitch channels are built on this idea of community, and some creators use that language

130
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,160
quite openly. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but what I would hope that you as a viewer

131
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
do is take some time to consider what positions are required to be a member of that community

132
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,120
and what cost is associated with ignoring them. And then ask yourself, have I really thought about

133
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,920
this? Have I spent the time really digging into and trying to understand these issues that are

134
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,920
apparently central to my social circle that I'm now a part of? And that's true of commentary

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
channels on the right and left. A recent piece of research to come out of the University of

136
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada argued that it isn't political affiliation alone that's to blame

137
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,280
for the spread of fake news on the internet. Researchers argue that it's actually a case of

138
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,520
lazy thinking, and that when people think more critically about the news they're seeing,

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,720
they're less likely to engage with the spread of fake news, regardless of the political affiliation.

140
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,120
David Rand, PhD, Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, explains.

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,920
Our findings suggest that getting people to reason more is a good thing. When you're on social media,

142
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,280
stop and think. So the next time you're on social media and you see a sensational news story,

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,120
especially when you're inclined to agree with, take some time to think about it before rushing

144
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
to share it with your friends. It's probably too much to expect this one video to change someone's

145
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
deeply held political beliefs, but I hope anyone watching will at least be less willing to spread

146
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,680
bogus news stories in an effort to take the other side down a peg. And when it comes to your own

147
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,360
personal beliefs and the arguments that sustain them, never be afraid of an honest challenge or

148
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,240
conversation or debate. At the end of the day, you'll either make your existing beliefs stronger

149
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,640
or you'll be able to adopt something that's better and more accurately reflects the truth.

150
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,080
And if you're in one of those communities where you have to believe something that's either

151
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,080
obviously not true or can only be believed if you refuse to actually engage with evidence or facts,

152
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,800
maybe consider that this group isn't the one for you.

153
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,040
For the longest time, I've been meaning to make a video about how to disagree

154
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,120
amongst our own side, that is to say, within the left. I'm a very big believer that debate

155
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,720
and conversation, and when I say debate, I don't necessarily mean live debates, which

156
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
often feel more like theater than anything else. Not that there's anything wrong with theater,

157
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,640
of course. Theater is a lovely and sometimes necessary thing. But I think it's very important

158
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,840
that we create a space where we feel free to debate and discuss our ideas in a way to make

159
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,480
them better, stronger and more resistant to challenge from parties who we may find ourselves

160
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,480
at odds with politically. Sometimes that means ideas we have aren't great. They need to grow,

161
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,280
evolve, or sometimes they need to be dropped entirely depending on the arguments involved.

162
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,960
Sometimes we might need to bring them back if there's some new argument is brought for them.

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,000
That's one of the lovely things about discussion and discourse. And when I say debate, I'm talking

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,400
about real issues, not stuff like let's talk about, like climate change, as if that's not

165
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,800
an obvious scientific reality. This video initially wasn't supposed to be about any of that,

166
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
but the Gillette thing, it just really bugged me and I wanted to talk about it. Not because I

167
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,360
care about Proctor and Gamble and Gillette. I actually don't like them at all. I don't use

168
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,560
the razors usually. And I think they're pretty bad and overpriced. If you take anything away

169
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,520
from the Gillette section of this video, it's just don't buy their products or do. I don't care.
