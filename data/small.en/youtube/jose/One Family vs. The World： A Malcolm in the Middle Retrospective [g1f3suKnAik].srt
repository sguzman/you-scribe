1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Debuting in the year 2000, Malcolm in the Middle had a profound impact on the world

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,320
of television sitcoms.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,920
The show centered its stories around an over-the-top family while popularizing a single-camera style

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,160
of filming on network television.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,360
Throughout its run, it was nominated for multiple awards, was a critical darling, and achieved

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,680
rating success before finally becoming to an end in its seventh season.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,960
The series was created by Linwood Boomer.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,620
Originally an actor, he broke into the TV world as the character Adam Kendall on the

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,080
series Little House on the Prairie.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,620
He gradually moved towards writing and producing, soon finding himself working on a number of

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,060
TV sitcoms.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,220
In the writers' room, he would entertain his colleagues with stories of his family

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,920
growing up, and eventually he'd put together a pilot based on those early years of his

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
life.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,000
Boomer was considered gifted and put into special classes, much like the main character

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,440
on his show, Malcolm.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,080
My mom would never tell me what my IQ was, so when I wrote Malcolm, I said his IQ was

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,680
165.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,600
My mom then told me that mine was never that high.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,760
The idea of a child prodigy in less-than-ideal circumstances was at the center of Boomer's

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
pitch.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,560
It was easy to write because I knew the material.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
I'd been thinking about it for a very long time, and a lot of those pieces in the pilot

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
were pieces of my life.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
I'd spent a lot of time telling them as anecdotes.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
They were polished.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
Although it was shown to several different networks, the show ultimately landed on Fox,

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,320
a network with a history for depicting non-traditional family dynamics, at least non-traditional when

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,640
it came to what you would see on network television.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,960
The role of Malcolm was given to Frankie Muniz.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,120
Originally written as a 9-year-old, Malcolm's age was instead made vague to accommodate

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,000
the 13-year-old Muniz.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Although Boomer considered himself at that age to be more antagonistic, Malcolm was written

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
to be more of a charming eccentric, a genius living in a family of underachievers, trying

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:02:12,680
to understand a world that demeans people like him.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,800
Jane Kaczmarek was cast as Malcolm's mother, Lois.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,680
It was a role that earned Kaczmarek seven Emmy nominations for a lead actress in a comedy

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,360
series, one for every year the show is on the air.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Though sadly she would never win the award, she does hold the record for most nominations

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,840
within that category without actually winning it.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,600
Along with Malcolm, Lois was one of the two characters left largely unchanged from the

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,840
original script for the pilot, a fierce matriarch of her family that holds them together through

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
sheer force of will.

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:58,400
Brian Cranston was cast as a father of the family, Hal, and unlike the other characters,

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240
was radically transformed by the actor.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,560
Originally a ghostly presence in the series, Cranston played Hal as a character motivated

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
by fear.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,080
This opened him up to some of the more absurd plot lines and physical gags, with stunts

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:34,880
often performed by Cranston himself.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,200
The oldest child of the family, Francis, was played by Christopher Masterson.

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Having been sent away to military school, Francis typically appears in his own self-contained

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,080
plot lines, disconnected from the stories back in his family's household, though he

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:04:00,120
does appear in a handful of episodes that bring everyone together for some chaos.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,640
Justin Burfield played the second oldest brother, Reese, although technically younger than

55
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,880
Frankie Munes, his character was a year older on the show.

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,280
Reese is the dimmest member of the family.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,480
He would only be caught using his head to solve the problem if it meant smashing it

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,600
against something.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:32,800
The final member of the family is Dewey, played by Eric Per Sullivan, the youngest member

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
of the family, at least in the beginning.

61
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,760
He began the series as a cute bit of comic relief, and gradually grew into a budding

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:48,680
musical virtuoso by the series' end.

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,360
In the pilot episode of the series, the family was given the name Wilkerson, though this

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,320
was dropped afterwards to avoid any specific ethnic label for them.

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,640
In the interest of sticking to how they are most often presented in the series, I am going

66
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,240
to avoid using any last name for the family.

67
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
The cast was joined by a host of other characters, such as Craig Feldspar, played by David Anthony

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,040
Higgins, Malcolm's friend Stevie Carnarbon, played by Craig Lamar Traylor, and Lois'

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,500
mother Ida, played by Cloris Lechman.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,440
Another vital aspect of the series was its style, which was unique on network television

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,160
at the time, breaking the tradition of a multi-camera setup, where a scene was filmed from multiple

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
angles at once.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Malcolm in the middle opted to use a single camera for filming, something more akin to

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,760
dramas on network television or comedies on cable television.

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,080
There was no studio audience, or laugh track for that matter, and to compensate, the series

76
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,240
used a number of techniques, camera movements, montages, and lots of changes in filming locations.

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Although commonplace among comedies today, back in 2000, this was incredibly rare for

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,120
network television sitcoms.

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Malcolm in the middle premiered on January 9, 2000, on Sunday night, between The Simpsons

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
and The X-Files.

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
It was a plum spot, and an advertising blitz ensured that this show would have every advantage

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,080
possible to make a strong first impression, and a strong first impression is exactly

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,920
what it made.

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,520
The first episode of the series, creatively titled Pilot, begins with Malcolm offering

85
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,720
some narration to the camera.

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,000
A rarity for TV sitcoms, Malcolm offers us a running narration throughout the series,

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,280
giving us some insight into how his mind works in any given scene.

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,880
But this does more than provide context, it lets us see into the mind of a genius to

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,400
realize that the things he cares about in life aren't all that different from what

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
we care about.

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,120
After the opening credits, with a song performed by They Might Be Giants, we meet the rest

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,760
of Malcolm's family.

93
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,280
Malcolm and his brothers have two states of being in their home.

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,840
They're either fighting with each other, or they're asleep.

95
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,160
While the boys walk to school, Francis is introduced through a short montage.

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:07:18,120
It's here we see two strengths of the show's style.

97
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,760
On your standard sitcom, there are usually only a handful of locations, due to the cost

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,280
and effort of building new sets for a multi-camera setup.

99
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,320
A single camera lets them film on various locations more easily, so we get to see things

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,080
that would otherwise be summarized by dialogue.

101
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,680
In this example, it's the many exploits of Francis, shown through a series of quick

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,000
cuts, watching the chaos of his teenage years unfold, rather than having it summarized by

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,280
a character describing his antics.

104
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,040
This moment would have far less impact if it was someone talking about how Francis lit

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,840
a car on fire and hooked up with a girl, instead we actually get to see it.

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,200
The episode's plot introduces the premise of Malcolm's genius finally being noticed

107
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:05,160
in school, and him being brought into the gifted class.

108
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:19,000
We meet Malcolm's eventual friend Stevie, and Malcolm reluctantly connects with him.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,040
The idea of being normal comes up a lot in this series, and Malcolm is desperate to hold

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:36,720
on to that.

111
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,240
By the end of the episode, we realize that this is Malcolm's first step into realizing

112
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:52,280
he doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the world, that he isn't quite normal.

113
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,880
Although most of us aren't geniuses, what's relatable here is the feeling of not quite

114
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,520
fitting in at school, of being unsure of where exactly your place is in the world.

115
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
In Malcolm's case, he's a genius.

116
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,880
But for other kids, it might mean braces, an unexpected growth spurt, or having to move

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
somewhere new.

118
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,280
This episode's resolution sees Malcolm embracing Stevie as a friend, standing up to a bully,

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,680
and deciding to make the most of his new situation.

120
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,780
Although rough around the edges, Malcolm is a good kid, and now he's stuck trying to

121
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,720
figure out his new status as a krellboying.

122
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,680
In the series krellboying is a term used to describe kids in the gifted program.

123
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,680
It gradually fades away over time, as Malcolm's krellboying friends become a less prominent

124
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,940
part of the series.

125
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,440
The name is a reference to the Rick Moranis character in the 1986 movie Little Shop of

126
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Horrors.

127
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,160
It's hard to imagine kids in the year 2000 having strong memories of a fourteen-year-old

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
horror musical.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
This is one of those little details that remind us this is a show written by adults about

130
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,960
kids who don't necessarily have their finger on the pulse of pop culture in the 2000s.

131
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,560
This episode includes the first and only appearance of the family's last name, Wilkerson, seen

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,960
here on Francis' nametag.

133
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,200
The pilot was a huge success, winning Primetime Emmy Awards for Writing for a Comedy Series,

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,960
awarded to Linwood Boomer, and Directing, awarded to Todd Holland.

135
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,880
In the ratings, it pulled in 22.4 million viewers, and the following week's episode,

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,320
Red Dress, set a series high for 23.3 million viewers, although the first season would eventually

137
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,520
settle to an average of roughly 15 million viewers per episode.

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,320
The episode Red Dress also includes one of the most obvious shots of a crew member in

139
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,680
an episode I've ever seen.

140
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
Another thing that made Malcolm in the Middle different was how it structured its episodes.

141
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,200
While other sitcoms would have a main plotline and a shorter backup plotline in each episode,

142
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Malcolm in the Middle could sometimes include up to four different plotlines running through

143
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,440
a single episode.

144
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,960
It ensured that, even though Malcolm was the main character, he would never have to shoulder

145
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,720
the bulk of each episode, and really emphasize that the show was an ensemble cast.

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,520
Malcolm's teacher, Caroline Miller, played by Catherine Lloyd Burns, is credited as a

147
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,760
principal member of the cast, though that would only last for the season.

148
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,840
She serves as a guide for Malcolm into his new surroundings in the gifted class.

149
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,960
Malcolm's world in the gifted class, self-contained in the first few episodes, comes crashing

150
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:23,200
up against the reality of his family in the episode Crawl Boyin' Picnic.

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,480
Up to this point, Malcolm's intelligence has largely just been an abstract IQ score,

152
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,760
but the climax of this episode shows us what his brain is truly capable of.

153
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:57,120
And, much to Malcolm's relief, he finds out his family, while shocked, isn't about

154
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:09,600
to treat him like a completely different person.

155
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
One interesting distinction here is that Malcolm isn't entirely alone.

156
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,240
Throughout this episode, the Crawl Boyins are constantly fawning over him.

157
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,960
He's the smartest kid in class, and they're all deeply impressed, and it's heavily implied

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
in the series that these nerds being bullied in the present are destined for great things

159
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
in the future.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,480
Malcolm is literally being welcomed into a new class of people, and he's afraid of

161
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,240
losing his place in the world he would have to leave behind, represented by his family.

162
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,160
Malcolm's family is not rich.

163
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,460
Far from it, in fact.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,640
One of the running themes of the series is just how little money they have for anything.

165
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Malcolm shares a room with his two brothers, both parents work dead-end jobs, and their

166
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,400
house is in a constant state of disrepair.

167
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,160
The outside world is a cruel place for the family, and while they may torment one another,

168
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,280
they also protect each other as well.

169
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,500
Malcolm's fear of losing that connection and being swept up into that new world is

170
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,880
another reason his family is so important to him.

171
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
He's seen enough of the world to know that even if he has an edge, he's just a few

172
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
mistakes back into that same rut his family ended up in.

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,840
While the Crawl Boyins are convinced the world will get better for them in the future, Malcolm

174
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,200
is well aware that it isn't good for them in the present.

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,680
The laws of the playground don't favor the smart, they favor the strong.

176
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,000
The Crawl Boyin kids are constantly bullied.

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,460
While Malcolm's family can make him feel like he's been cursed, it's all he really

178
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
has to hold onto.

179
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,160
There's no winning for Malcolm.

180
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,320
He can only lose the least amount possible, and in this case, it's about not losing

181
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,400
his family.

182
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,880
The dynamic between Hal and Lois is interesting insofar that you have this very strong mother

183
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
figure taking charge of the family, and a father figure who is a bit more fearful and

184
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
timid.

185
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,640
Not afraid of his wife, of course, but more the world around him.

186
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,120
This unique dynamic invites a conversation about gender roles on the show.

187
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,260
Men in this series are generally presented as uncivilized brutes, only tamed by the presence

188
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
of women.

189
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,420
For a season, we can see two examples, with Reese going from schoolyard bully to queried

190
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,460
mess when dealing with a crush.

191
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,380
Eventually, Hal sits him down, along with the other boys, for a talk.

192
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:36,580
The idea of this destructive behavior being genetic is a bit worrying, and we actually

193
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,820
see it challenged in the episode where Reese, instead of acting like a maniac, takes an

194
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,180
interest in his crush's cheerleading and then trying to talk to her.

195
00:14:51,260 --> 00:15:07,940
The pyramid, a symbol of ancient civilization, is a fitting metaphor for gender roles.

196
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,860
As Reese and Wendy decide to connect in a meaningful way, instead of the more primal

197
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,380
fashion described by Hal, it risks the very pillars that hold this social order together.

198
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,580
Even if society is brought down around them, the bond between two people survives.

199
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,820
And isn't that more meaningful than some dumb pyramid?

200
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,740
We can see the impact of Lois and Hal in the episode, The Bots and the Bees, where Lois's

201
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,820
departure causes Hal to regress into the person he was before he met her.

202
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,700
Hal is a dangerous rebel, untamed and wild, so long as Lois isn't around.

203
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,220
Hal and Reese are interesting to contrast in these two episodes.

204
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,240
The show presents rebellious behavior as a method of attracting women and as a product

205
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,780
of being outside their influence.

206
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,140
It's an outward sign that a man needs a woman to civilize him.

207
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,420
In one generation, we see this script followed unthinkingly, and in another, it's contradicted.

208
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,380
Reese ends up with a potential to love interest, and Hal ends up covered in bees.

209
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,700
It's the difference between critically examining yourself and internalizing what you think

210
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,060
society is telling you a man should be, reducing it to some kind of biological imperative.

211
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,420
Season 1 ended with the episode, Water Park, part 1.

212
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,380
The plot lines here are mostly concluded at the end of the episode, with the exception

213
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,740
of Dewey, who had been left all at home with a babysitter who dies by the end of the episode,

214
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,640
leaving Dewey completely unattended.

215
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,520
The season 2 opener, Traffic Jam, part 2, has the family stuck in traffic while trying

216
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,880
to return home from the water park.

217
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,000
While technically a continuation of the previous episode, the plot lines are all new, with

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,960
every member of the family and their own storyline, the Dewey plot line carried over from last

219
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,360
season is resolved when he's finally brought home by some bikers.

220
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
But the one plot line from this episode I want to highlight is how Lois tries to resolve

221
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
the Traffic Jam through sheer force of will.

222
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:07,340
Lois, who is such a dominant force throughout the first season, is starting to show the

223
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,880
limits of her power.

224
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:33,120
Can this notice it again this season in the episode, Traffic Ticket?

225
00:17:33,120 --> 00:18:02,200
The

226
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,180
contrast between Lois being the voice of authority and her using that voice to stand up to a

227
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,220
greater authority reveals that at the heart of the character, Lois believes in a higher

228
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,100
form of morality.

229
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,900
There's a theory of moral development created by American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg

230
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,980
that describes how we grow as moral beings, moving from understanding morals as rules

231
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,300
we use to achieve certain outcomes to applying a system of universal ethics.

232
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,100
Lois operates at the post-conventional level, certain of her morals and bucking at the system

233
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,780
when it won't let her express them.

234
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,760
And when Lois is disciplining her children, she's trying to move them up that ladder.

235
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,400
In later seasons, we'd see examples of Lois' bending to the rules, but this is typically

236
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
a product of her needing something from the system, like keeping her job.

237
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,060
Although Lois is trying to instill a higher order of morality in her kids, she's also

238
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,080
capable of realizing that a system requires some degree of conformity for survival.

239
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,520
Going back to Howe's response to Lois about the world working against the family, this

240
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,900
is brought into sharp focus throughout the series, and this season has some great examples.

241
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,340
In the episode, New Neighbors, we find out the family has had a less-than-positive relationship

242
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,700
with most of the other families on their street.

243
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Families keep moving in and out of that house, I wonder why?

244
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,720
The neighbors here represent the world at large.

245
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,660
One important part of this episode is how it shows just what brings the family together,

246
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,140
an outside threat, like new neighbors.

247
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,540
I think the word everyone is tiptoeing around is feud.

248
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:42,100
Some of the better episodes intersect their various plotlines using this very principle.

249
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,300
The ending to Lois' birthday uses a similar conclusion, where the family bands together

250
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,420
to fight off a group of clowns.

251
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,140
The show never explains why so many clowns are hanging out at the batting cages, unless

252
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,000
that one birthday party had four clowns, which seems excessive to me.

253
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,880
The economics of hiring clowns aside, the family's ability to hold together against

254
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,760
outside threats is a frequent theme throughout the series.

255
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,520
It echoes other sitcoms featuring working-class families, where an external conflict, symbolizing

256
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,600
the hostility of the outside world, requires the family to band together as a single unit.

257
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,720
Season 2 also introduced a few memorable supporting cast members, including Cynthia, played by

258
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Tanya Raymond, a girl in Malcolm's gifted class he has a crush on.

259
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,560
Although not the first or last girl Malcolm would explore his feelings for, Cynthia is

260
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:39,160
probably the most memorable.

261
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,240
Sadly Cynthia would only hang around until Season 4, and was replaced before then by

262
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,480
a rotation of increasingly forgettable love interests.

263
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
And Season 2 introduced us to another special talent held by one of the boys, Reese, who

264
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:14,080
is a gifted chef.

265
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
But Season 2's most celebrated episode, by far, is bowling.

266
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,120
The episode uses the premise of either Hal or Lois taking the boys out bowling, and displaying

267
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,440
two stories in parallel that represent the different timelines created depending on which

268
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,720
parent takes the boys out on that trip.

269
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,640
While the respective stories offer a few interesting twists and turns, it's the novelty of how

270
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,640
they're presented that really sets this episode apart, using creative editing techniques

271
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,780
to highlight each timeline transition.

272
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,880
The fortunes of the characters vary, and the episode contrasts Hal's loose parenting

273
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,160
style with Lois' stricter style to create happy endings for different boys.

274
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,280
A good night out is a roll of the dice, and neither parent is necessarily better than

275
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,920
the other, but each one has their own strengths and weaknesses.

276
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,480
Highly praised at the time, it won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing and Writing

277
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
for a Comedy Series for Todd Holland and Alex Reed, respectively.

278
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,560
To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle for me to find much to say about this episode

279
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
outside of its style.

280
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
The randomness of parenting and the largely forgettable nature of both storylines makes

281
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,440
me think a lot of the acclaim this episode got was for its technical achievement.

282
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,200
Episodes like this make me feel as though Malcolm in the Middle's more interesting

283
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,400
aspects were overshadowed by its style.

284
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,060
The better episodes did have some interesting commentary in them, but the show was so unique

285
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,560
in its presentation at the time that it garnered most of the critical attention.

286
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,960
The last episode I want to highlight from this season is Flashback, where we see how

287
00:22:34,960 --> 00:23:01,920
Parenthood ruined the family's fortunes through a series of flashbacks.

288
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:26,640
The episode ends with Hell and Lois reminding each other of why they're in love.

289
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,420
This is such a sweet episode.

290
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,280
Love holds the family together in the face of their increasingly dire circumstances.

291
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,100
The episode is an inversion of the threats highlighted in the episodes like New Neighbors.

292
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,300
This shows how families create disruptions in their own lives, but unlike the hostile

293
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,380
world, a family can offer the very real reward of comfort and love.

294
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,060
Even when the world is literally raining on you and the only dry space is a house with

295
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,260
three screaming boys, it's not so bad when you know there's some love in there too.

296
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,020
Part of why I think this show struck a chord with so many people is because of that.

297
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,660
Most people's families are messy and complicated, but there's still a core of love in there.

298
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:08,340
This was a sitcom that dared to show an unvarnished version of that love.

299
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,300
Unlike the other boys in his family, Francis' plotlines are typically far removed from the

300
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,060
other characters in the household.

301
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,380
Starting the series off in a military economy, his plotlines contain their own unique supporting

302
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,580
cast where Francis and his buddies are constantly at odds with the demanding common-dense Spangler,

303
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,980
played by Daniel van Bergen.

304
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,780
Season 3 completely changes Francis' circumstances as he emancipates himself, letting him leave

305
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,940
the military academy, and heads to Alaska for promises of riches with his friend Eric

306
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,780
Hansen, played by Eric Neninger.

307
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,340
Francis' stories in the first two seasons center around rebellion against authority,

308
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,900
and the third is no exception.

309
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,820
When he travels to Alaska in season 3, he finds himself working a rough job under the

310
00:24:47,820 --> 00:25:04,180
auspice of the hot-tempered Lavernia, played by Brenda Well.

311
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,060
Season 3 also meant the introduction of the most prominent member of Francis' supporting

312
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,540
cast, Piyama, played by Emmy Coligado.

313
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,180
Piyama introduces a shift in Francis towards more responsible behavior, eventually leading

314
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,100
him to work as a ranch hand in season 4, though he never quite gets it together in

315
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,740
a way suggested by her early appearances.

316
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,500
And while I think it's neat that the show included an indigenous character of an unspecified

317
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,220
tribe, and Coligado does do a great job in her performance, it's a little awkward seeing

318
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,880
an indigenous character portrayed by someone whose background is Filipino, which is literally

319
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,100
on the other side of the world.

320
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,580
Francis as a character is a symbol of unfocused rebellion.

321
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,980
While it might be tempting to write him off as a bad seed, Francis demonstrates kindness

322
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,700
and intelligence throughout the series, though it never manifests itself in the special ways

323
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,220
we see in his brothers.

324
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,060
Reese has his cooking, Malcolm is a genius, and Dewey eventually blossoms into a musician,

325
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,620
but Francis never gets any special skills.

326
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,420
As we only see him in his futile struggles against a military school trying to shape

327
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,500
him and a low-paying job exploiting him, this is a commentary on how the world punishes

328
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
rebellion.

329
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,060
With his brothers as a comparison, it appears though the family space is the one that affords

330
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,700
the chance to explore possibilities and push limits in a safe way, and one thing all the

331
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,900
boys in this family do is consistently push the limits through their acts of rebellion

332
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,420
against authority.

333
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,620
After his family sent him to military school, Francis was more or less at the mercy of the

334
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,820
system, and this show demonstrates that the system does not care about him at all.

335
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,300
He can either become a military drone or work a dead-end job in misery.

336
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,460
The closest we see to Francis living a happy life is in season 4, with the boss who treats

337
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,860
him with kindness and respect, though in this case it's an outsider to that system,

338
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,900
Otto Mankuser, played by Kenneth Mars.

339
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,420
Eventually Francis drops the ball there too, perhaps it was just too late for him to learn

340
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,340
how to function in society, or perhaps more accurately, Christopher Masterson would have

341
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,860
less of an on-screen presence on the show in later seasons.

342
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,980
Either way, his character remains an indictment of a system that abandons those who buck up

343
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,020
against it.

344
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,700
One moment I want to highlight in season 3 is the synthesis of some of the ideas presented

345
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,940
in earlier seasons.

346
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,860
In Los' makeover, when the boys play against Hal in a game of basketball, they come into

347
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,300
one of the few domains where Hal feels comfortable being a domineering patriarch.

348
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:29,860
The boys bend together to fight back.

349
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:40,860
But Hal then starts to play dirty.

350
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Eventually they play a final game where the boys unveil their secret weapon.

351
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,580
The boys take down the system by punching it in the balls.

352
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,260
It's a nice little story about how the rules are stacked against the younger generation

353
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,020
until they bound together to hit it where it hurts.

354
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,100
So simple and so effective, this little moment I think embodies so much of what this series

355
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
is.

356
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,860
And in Mayan Pagan, this is where the series peaks, with its strongest message about uniting

357
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,900
together against an unjust authority.

358
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,820
It isn't pretty, but it's a response in kind, and one Hal certainly won't be forgetting.

359
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,780
Hal is the past and the boys are the future.

360
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,780
One they'll be making more just by working together.

361
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,300
There was still much more Malcolm in the middle to go, and season 3 had a major one-hour special

362
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,780
that included a number of guest stars, including Terry Bradshaw, Heidi Klum, Tom Green, Howie

363
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,140
Long, Christina Ricci, Magic Johnson, Bradley Whitford, who was married to Jane Kaczmarek

364
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,060
at the time, and Susan Sarandon, who was nominated for an Emmy in this appearance in the episode

365
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Company Picnic.

366
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,940
While ratings for season 3 were strong, and Company Picnic in particular was a great performer,

367
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,180
the gentle decline was starting to show.

368
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,620
The series still had some important things to say, and would of course return to some

369
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,300
of its earlier themes as well.

370
00:28:51,300 --> 00:29:00,420
Much of the impact it had made in its debut was starting to wear off.

371
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,420
As the series progressed, Malcolm's stories tended to be less about his krull-boying friends

372
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,340
and more about his dating life.

373
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,780
He had numerous love interests over the years, like the blonde one, the other blonde one,

374
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,180
and another blonde-haired girl.

375
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,000
These stories tended to downplay his intelligence, revealing that being a genius can come hand-in-hand

376
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,220
with being ignorant of how to act around a girl you have a crush on.

377
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,020
In the episode Stupid Girl, we see Malcolm actively hide his intelligence to attract

378
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:43,660
a girl named Allison, played by Brittany Finnimore.

379
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,340
More importantly than his love interests, Malcolm's relationship with his mother is

380
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,920
afforded the rare opportunity to grow when she traps him for a special talk about dating.

381
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,120
Malcolm's conversation with Lois was really great.

382
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,800
It shows us a parent-child connection that's rarely seen on sitcoms and presents it as

383
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,760
something healthy and productive.

384
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,360
Growing up involves seeing your parents as adults and learning from all their experiences.

385
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,720
It's hard to imagine Lois having this conversation with Reese, so maybe it's not a perfect fit

386
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,160
for every kid, but it's a nice contrast to seeing the boys at odds with their parents.

387
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,280
Sadly, this wasn't followed up in any meaningful way throughout the series, which is an example

388
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,960
I think of how the show was capable of producing great episodes, but couldn't change its dynamic

389
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,100
enough in a meaningful way to capitalize on them.

390
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,320
Another example of some of the limitations of the show appeared in the episode, if boys

391
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,460
were girls were Lois fantasizes what her life would have been like if she had had daughters

392
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,660
instead of sons.

393
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:23,520
Reese has become Renee, Mimi Paley, Malcolm is Mallory, Lisa Foyles, and Dewey is Daisy,

394
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Jeanette McCurdy.

395
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:41,840
Lois's fantasy eventually makes a turn for the realistic.

396
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,940
The episode ends with Lois still wanting a girl, so the conclusion is satisfying enough

397
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,740
as it shows parental love accepts the good with the bad, but a sign of the show losing

398
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,160
some of its edge was watching the girls deliver the message of the episode so bluntly.

399
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,620
Having the moral of the story delivered in such a ham-fisted way is a lot less clever

400
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,680
than those earlier episodes.

401
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,700
One interesting bit of trivia about this episode is that the story credit went to Alexandra

402
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,380
Kaczynski, the 11-year-old niece of the show's costume designer Heidi Kaczynski.

403
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,940
I wish they had done a better job of bringing this 11-year-old visionaries idea to life.

404
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,280
One new idea introduced in season 4 that the series actually built upon was Dewey's special

405
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:28,680
talent, being a musical prodigy.

406
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:48,400
And we find out that Hal was a YouTuber before YouTube was even a thing.

407
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,280
But the most important change for the series was, undoubtedly, the birth of Jamie.

408
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,760
Early in this season, we found out Lois was pregnant, much like Jane Kaczmarek was at

409
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
the time.

410
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,400
Kaczmarek would miss several episodes because of her pregnancy, although we would see her

411
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,640
getting increasingly pregnant on camera as well.

412
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:27,880
This pregnancy came to the explosive finish in the two-parter titled, Baby.

413
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:50,600
The baby is named Jamie.

414
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,200
And while initially there is some mystery around the baby's gender, Jamie is eventually

415
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,020
revealed to be a boy at the beginning of season 5.

416
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,420
The new child undoubtedly means new hardships for the family, and perhaps that's why

417
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,500
the season ended not with the baby being born, but instead an episode trying to find Jamie

418
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,340
Daycare in an episode appropriately titled, Daycare.

419
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:16,060
In need of some assistance, the family turns to the church.

420
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,940
The completely non-religious family has suddenly become inspired by the word of God.

421
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,160
It's a simple dramatization of how religion can sometimes be less a product of spiritual

422
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,960
discovery and more a necessity for people who need community connections to make ends

423
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
meet.

424
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:55,800
It also introduces an interesting moment where Lois realizes something about Jamie.

425
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,440
In an episode where we see the family reject religion, we also see a mother who doesn't

426
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,480
instantly turn into a maternal force upon meeting her baby.

427
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,760
That's a couple of very big conventions this episode turns on their head, a rarity compared

428
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
to sitcom's past.

429
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,600
One of the great strengths of this show is that it takes very common ideas that might

430
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
pop into people's minds, like not loving your child as much as you think you should

431
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,520
or not being religious when it's expected of you, and presents these thoughts as things

432
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,600
not to be ashamed of, but instead to be addressed.

433
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,360
But living up to some unrealistic sitcom perfection is not only okay, but more realistic

434
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,560
than the more commonly depicted happy family on the quiet street with the picket fence.

435
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,920
This was a huge part of the appeal of Malcolm in the Middle, it portrayed a family that

436
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,160
not only behaved in ways that felt more real, it also included characters with psychology

437
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,720
that felt more real as well.

438
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,360
The birth of Jamie is often described as the point where the show began its decline in

439
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,400
quality, and while I'd personally say it happened a bit earlier, a decline in quality

440
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,100
doesn't necessarily mean the show has gotten bad.

441
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,380
One later season still had a few interesting things to say.

442
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,220
My parents tell me this is going to be a very special Thanksgiving.

443
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,500
In season 5, Malcolm finally gets a job.

444
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,100
Even though he's still in high school, he's drafted into an entry-level position at The

445
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,280
Lucky Aid, which is the same drugstore Lois works at.

446
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,340
Work is presented as boring and lacking in challenge, what's even more depressing is

447
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,780
that by working alongside his mother, Malcolm is getting a glimpse into his possible future.

448
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,020
We're proud of our 95% employee retention rate.

449
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,300
You may think you're just starting a job, but when you join the Lucky Aid family, you're

450
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,980
here for life.

451
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,660
He also sees a side of Lois that he hadn't before.

452
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,060
One minute you're telling me I'm doing a great job, and the next minute you're writing

453
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
me up.

454
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
You broke the rules, Malcolm.

455
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,140
Come on, that box-planting area is a stupid rule.

456
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,140
You know I'm right.

457
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,460
Albert is a grade 5 employee, he has put in 20 years of service time.

458
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,980
Sometimes that's more important than what's right or wrong.

459
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,740
Who are you?

460
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,660
Lois manages to convince Malcolm not to share her secret, but when the favor needs to be

461
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,700
returned, Lois stitches Malcolm right up.

462
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,900
It's not what it looks like.

463
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,380
Lois, are you in there?

464
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,380
I'll explain later.

465
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,540
I know exactly what this looks like to you, but I'm asking you for a little flexibility.

466
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Trust me.

467
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,060
Lois, where's the- what's going on here?

468
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,980
Well, I'll have to write Malcolm up again.

469
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,340
He's flattened another box outside of the box-flattening area.

470
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
And he has no recourse.

471
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,660
You're growing up.

472
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,180
You're sick of living under my authority.

473
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,580
You want me to cut you some slack?

474
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,700
You're wondering when I'll finally see you as an adult.

475
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,140
Well, that's never going to happen.

476
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,780
That's just not the way it works.

477
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,980
You can move away from home, you can get married, you can have kids of your own.

478
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,100
You can even become a professor of physics at MIT.

479
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,860
I will always be your mother.

480
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,740
And that's just the way it is until one of us dies.

481
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,300
After all this time, seeing Lois go from strict but ultimately just to becoming another tool

482
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,340
of the system is disappointing.

483
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,060
This is probably the saddest lesson learned in the series, that the world that's so unfair

484
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,600
to Malcolm can also include his parents.

485
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,620
They have to live under the same system that imposes their rules on him, and in many ways

486
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,980
this is another example of Malcolm seeing his parents as adults, as he enters adulthood

487
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,100
himself.

488
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,180
Work is often the tool used to keep Malcolm and his family in their place.

489
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,060
The only reason Malcolm has to take this job is because Hal is the victim of a corporate

490
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,720
shake-up that he doesn't completely understand, and money is tied in the family.

491
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,260
Work is consistently shown as a means of being exploited by someone somewhere.

492
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,940
Way back in season one, in the episode, Malcolm Babysits, Malcolm gets his first ever taste

493
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,700
of employment working as a babysitter, only to find out that the generous couple had been

494
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,740
secretly recording him the whole time.

495
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,180
A few lines from Lois and Hal in this episode make the point especially clear.

496
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,900
I don't even know what they're going to pay me.

497
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
I'll tell you what they're going to pay you.

498
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,060
They're going to pay you what all jobs pay.

499
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,700
Less than your worth, and just enough to keep your crawling back for more.

500
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,100
So how's the job going?

501
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,020
They were jerks, so I quit.

502
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,380
Well, that's pretty much what work is.

503
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,020
Welcome to the club.

504
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,180
And in season two, we see what Hal's life would have been like outside of work, where

505
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,820
he dedicates his time to creating a painting.

506
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,700
Hal goes on a rollercoaster becoming a more effective parent, to becoming an obsessive

507
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,980
painter, to finally creating something truly beautiful.

508
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,460
I did it.

509
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,860
I really did it.

510
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,860
What's that sound?

511
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,780
I don't know.

512
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
It sounds like...

513
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
Look out!

514
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Paint the lairs!

515
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
Help!

516
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:30,140
The family could never have anything good, and the world seems to constantly be working

517
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
against it.

518
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,820
Why do we root for these losers?

519
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,860
Because they never give up?

520
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,140
Is that what life is?

521
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,220
Getting knocked down over and over again?

522
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,540
Always getting up?

523
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
Until you die?

524
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,660
That piece of art that immediately self-destructs is a good metaphor from that case.

525
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,740
The only options Hal has now is to pick up the brush again, or forget it and go back

526
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,860
to work.

527
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,300
And who can't relate to putting your dreams on hold because you have to go up there and

528
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
make a living?

529
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,420
It makes Hal want to stand up and do something about it.

530
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,980
Although I really only mentioned this episode because it included one other moment I've

531
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
had to highlight.

532
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,980
I've had this cute lab partner in science for eight weeks now.

533
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,920
Her name is Cheryl.

534
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,540
I finally left Cheryl no on her desk asking her out.

535
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:14,380
And when she read it, she turned to me and said, do you know who Reese is?

536
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,760
So then she goes, does anybody know who Reese is?

537
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,260
And everybody shrugged.

538
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,420
So then I said, probably some nobody.

539
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,140
And you know what?

540
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
I was right.

541
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,740
Okay, now that I've brought the mood down, let's talk about Reese.

542
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,460
Although often presented as a dumb force of destruction, he's probably the most tragic

543
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,100
character in the principal cast.

544
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,940
Then I worked on my triceps.

545
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,340
I want to break up.

546
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Oh.

547
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Yeah.

548
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
Yeah.

549
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
That's okay.

550
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Yeah, it's fine.

551
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
No.

552
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:17,020
I was just kidding anyway about, yeah, no biggie.

553
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,780
Look, Reese, it's not you.

554
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
It's me.

555
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,500
I just think I can do better.

556
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,940
Reese is a very tough character to like.

557
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,520
He's a bully and completely heartless at times, but he's also capable of showing

558
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,700
some genuine concern for others, at least when it comes to his family.

559
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,260
I'll say grace.

560
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,780
Thank you Lord for giving me the talent to express my love for my family and the only

561
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,060
way I know how.

562
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Amen.

563
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,420
In Reese's apartment, we see a great example of what's really holding him back.

564
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,220
He's just not that bright.

565
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,860
You've been using credit cards?

566
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
How much have you spent?

567
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,180
10, 11 grand, but I'm still way under the $20,000 limit.

568
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,420
How can you spend that much in 10 days?

569
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,780
Well, you know, I got that new convection oven, and that made the refrigerator look

570
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
kind of shabby.

571
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,100
Plus, I had to buy new clothes every time mine got dirty, and that giant gong in the

572
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,100
bathroom?

573
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,660
I mean, how do you guys do it?

574
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,620
And this is his whole character in a nutshell.

575
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,380
He's not that smart, and not being that smart makes an already tough world that much tougher.

576
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,260
His options are limited, and he's left to lash out violently.

577
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,540
That may be why this season ends with a two-parter titled, Reese Joins the Army, and Reese becomes

578
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,140
the ideal soldier.

579
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,300
But eventually, Reese has to turn on his brain and use his misbehaving to win the war game.

580
00:42:49,260 --> 00:43:15,300
It's frightening to think that what makes Reese a good soldier is that he can go from

581
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,900
unthinking robot to malevolent troublemaker.

582
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,140
Both are apparently crucial modes for a soldier, at least according to the show, and this

583
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,900
season ends with Reese headed into active duty in Afghanistan.

584
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,780
As a character, Reese seems to have the dimmest future ahead of him.

585
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,180
His good qualities can only manifest in environments that he spent years carving out a space in,

586
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,420
and the US military is less patient with him than Lois, ready to ship him off to Afghanistan

587
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,100
rather than send him to his room.

588
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:55,900
Season 6 resolves the Reese plotline with Lois traveling to somewhere in non-specific

589
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,420
South Asia to bring him home.

590
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,060
With the US government failing him, Reese's only salvation is, once again, his family.

591
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,540
The old theme of family holding together in the face of an indifferent society returns,

592
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,500
albeit in a very extreme and strange way that's less compelling than it was the first

593
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
time around.

594
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,820
The commentary on the military could have just as easily been applied to Francis'

595
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,620
time in the military academy.

596
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,500
One major change was the larger role in the series for Dewey.

597
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,980
In season 5, Dewey don't mix up at his school, Dewey is placed in the special ed class and

598
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,340
we're introduced to a supporting cast of kids called Buseys, taking their name from

599
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,780
actor Gary Busey, known for his eccentric behavior.

600
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,060
This gives us a glimpse into the lives of the kids in the special education class.

601
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,740
While a premise like this could have taken a very bad turn, the show instead reveals

602
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,380
how placing these children in classes that have given up on them only makes things worse,

603
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,780
and the differences displayed between the special needs and gifted classes are so stark

604
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,300
that I can't help but read a very real commentary on social class differences here.

605
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,180
All it takes is doing poorly on some tests, and then your change in class means you'll

606
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,220
be perpetually falling behind your peers, forced to watch them excel in ways you'll

607
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,540
never have a chance to.

608
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,260
Much like Reese's military adventure mirrored Francis's, a change in class for Dewey and

609
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,780
a metaphor for a change in social class mirrors Malcolm's, although there's a less promising

610
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,160
future in Dewey's new class.

611
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,240
Season 6 takes the special ed class premise and continues to build on it, with the Busey

612
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,280
kids appearing in several episodes.

613
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,540
Each of them revolve around the basic idea that they need Dewey to take care of them,

614
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,920
whether it's an episode where they all run away to live in a tree, or an episode where

615
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,300
Dewey arranges for them to be in an opera based on his family's internal strife.

616
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,860
Although generally a decent depiction of kids with special needs, taking some time

617
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,180
to portray them as having personalities and not just a walking collection of symptoms,

618
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,140
their dependency on Dewey borders on depressing at times.

619
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,340
In the episode, Buseys take a hostage, Dewey has neglected his friends, and without his

620
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:07,700
guidance they lash out at their teacher.

621
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,740
This episode goes a long way in explaining how these kids, left behind by the system,

622
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,700
desperately cling to the one person who offers them the chance to have fuller lives, and

623
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,140
the fact that this person is also a kid puts a huge strain on him, and he neglects them.

624
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,100
It's ridiculous to imagine that a classroom full of kids should be cared for by another

625
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
kid.

626
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,020
This is a portrait of how society has failed the children who need them the most, and even

627
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:37,060
worse, lets them be exploited.

628
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,460
The episode's framing sadly obscures this point, as demonstrated by Francis' talk

629
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:56,540
with Dewey, where he's told he shouldn't shirk his responsibilities.

630
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,540
The idea that this should be on Dewey is completely backwards.

631
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,020
The kids in the class need help, and even if Dewey can somehow get them through the

632
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,740
year, is his life now just taking care of them?

633
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,460
And what about kids in other grades?

634
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,100
They would have to hope to get lucky enough to have a compassionate caretaker.

635
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,700
Dewey is forced to sacrifice his own happiness for others, and the show's framing of this

636
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,740
is admirable, while positive on its face, is more accurately read as a complete failure

637
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,860
of the system.

638
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,700
One person cannot fix a system on their own, though when one person makes a stand it can

639
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,260
sometimes inspire a greater call to action.

640
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,540
In the episode Billboard, the boys vandalize a giant billboard, and when caught they try

641
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:58,940
to play it off as activism.

642
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:17,300
As the episode progresses, Reese has a realization about women.

643
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,860
The idea of using activism to escape blame is interesting, and it fits in with the cynicism

644
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,860
of the show.

645
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,380
All the power of activism affecting change, even on the people exploiting it, demonstrates

646
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,380
its power.

647
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,820
We are who we pretend to be, after all, and maybe even performative activism is better

648
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,340
than doing nothing at all.

649
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,220
In the episode Tiki Lounge, this same idea is taken a step further when Malcolm is forced

650
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,800
into joining his school's booster club, a blisteringly positive group of teens always

651
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,900
looking to hold special events to raise money for charity.

652
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,500
Malcolm assumes they're just a bunch of phonies looking for an excuse to throw a party, and

653
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,860
their unrelenting positivity is a cover for their insincerity, while running the auction

654
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,580
he tries to expose their hypocrisy.

655
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:03,220
First set him up, our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put up for auction a photograph

656
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:12,380
of herself from 8th grade, with her original nose.

657
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:34,220
I appreciate that the booster club really was passionate about the causes they claim

658
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,980
to care about, even though they're not very good at raising money.

659
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,140
It's a very kind critique of the champagne liberal stereotype.

660
00:49:41,140 --> 00:50:05,520
Her hearts may be in the right place, but their methods are less than ideal.

661
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,340
A lot of the praise for a show like Malcolm in the Middle I see from people further on

662
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,220
the left often touts its realism, and that realism, especially in earlier seasons, is

663
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,060
often buoyed by a deep cynicism about the world.

664
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,020
Unlike previous episodes, though, this episode was surprisingly positive in its outlook and

665
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,820
conclusion, offering the important lesson that setting aside pride can help different

666
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,260
groups of people achieve great things.

667
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,660
Thinking of the modern day and the temptation of people further left to mock liberals for

668
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,140
their hypocrisy makes this episode seem like a stark contrast to that tendency, as it offers

669
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,460
a counterpoint that good things are possible when working on goals together with people

670
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,900
who may be misguided in their methods, but are ultimately interested in helping other

671
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
people.

672
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,860
And it's better to set pride aside to achieve positive change rather than sneer at people

673
00:50:50,860 --> 00:51:01,020
who could be allies.

674
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,580
The season 7 premiere, Burning Man, took the family on the road to experience the desert

675
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,580
festival.

676
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,860
It's weirdly fitting and strangely out of place at the same time, a familiar feeling

677
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,020
in the later seasons.

678
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,340
There's one interesting part where Hal's suburban father routine is considered an art

679
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:31,580
piece.

680
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,980
Is this show art?

681
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,260
What even is art?

682
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,780
Is it the depiction of the real?

683
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,780
The unreal?

684
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,740
Is it an emotional experience or an intellectual encounter?

685
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,780
Hal's subplot seems to be asking these questions about the show, with a crowd viewing him

686
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,260
as a stand-in for suburbia, offering them a window into this forbidden space.

687
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,300
Is that, then, how we, the audience of the show, also experience it?

688
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,900
Or do we feel kinship with Hal's perspective, seeing these eccentrics as the outsiders?

689
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,940
We're watching them, watching him, but also, watching him, watch them.

690
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,980
What is the act of watching someone in a space we can never enter, as our stand-in

691
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,700
is entering it for us?

692
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,900
We will never go to Burning Man, or rather, we will never go to the idea we have of Burning

693
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,300
Man that this show is representing.

694
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Or maybe more accurately, the show is mocking the kind of overwrought artistic interpretation

695
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,980
like the one I just gave.

696
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,740
Malcolm in the Middle is a show that, when it works, feels very real.

697
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,100
It's conveying the idea of the family struggling to survive in a world that sees them as commodities

698
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,340
to be exploited.

699
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,780
When they go on adventures like this one, it starts to feel less real.

700
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,180
It's more like a hallucination out in the desert.

701
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,300
The season 7 premiere scored a 3.5 in the ratings, which is a very far cry from its

702
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,800
earlier seasons.

703
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,020
On average, it was getting less than 4 million viewers per episode.

704
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,100
In January of 2006, Fox announced that Malcolm in the Middle would be ending this season.

705
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,220
Francis had largely exited the show by this point, only appearing in a handful of episodes,

706
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,720
but Christopher Masterson was still a part of the series, directing an episode this season

707
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,820
titled Hal Greaves.

708
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,980
Masterson wasn't the only cast member to direct an episode in the series, though.

709
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,660
Bryan Cranston directed several episodes in the series, including Malcolm Defends Reese,

710
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,260
which also aired this season.

711
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,820
The final season still managed to effectively hit some familiar notes, such as in Lois Strikes

712
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,060
Back, where Lois decides to get even with some mean girls who played a cruel prank on

713
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Reese.

714
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:47,060
Lois uses some brutal techniques.

715
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,060
The idea that certain people are less deserving of justice because their troublemakers might

716
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,340
have landed clear had Reese been less of a jerk in earlier episodes.

717
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,660
It also doesn't help that the show kinda had the same premise for an episode a few

718
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,660
seasons back, in which a teacher flunks Reese because he thinks he's a punk.

719
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,460
The episode ends with Lois and Reese finally having something to bond over, the use of

720
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,260
cruelty to satisfy their need for justice.

721
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,000
Although Reese is probably just in it for their cruelty.

722
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,180
As the series wound down, it brought into focus Malcolm and Reese's final year of high

723
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,180
school, Reese having deliberately failed a grade so he could spend another year there.

724
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,420
Well established as a social outcast, Malcolm works with some of the other school misfits

725
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,860
to hold a morp, that's prom spelled backwards.

726
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:32,180
A counterparty for the prom happening in the gym, the morp is in the basement.

727
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,220
Malcolm's insecurity gets the better of him, and he has to confront the other kids

728
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,860
to let them know he and his outsider friends are having a good time.

729
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:10,420
And no one cares.

730
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,020
But eventually the two parties come together, bridges are mended, and the kids decide to

731
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:34,100
leave high school behind, which isn't enough for Malcolm.

732
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:38,260
Things like this that seem to contrast the Malcolm we knew just a season ago, ready to

733
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,980
join up with the boosters when he realizes their genuine desire to do good.

734
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,900
But that's not the Malcolm we have anymore.

735
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,540
And this represents the Malcolm we see more frequently in these later seasons where he's

736
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,100
not quite the charming eccentric he was originally written as.

737
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:59,500
And that brings us to the final episode of the series, Graduation, airing May 14th, 2006.

738
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,060
The premise for this episode is that Malcolm's family is struggling to find a way to afford

739
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:10,260
sending him to college.

740
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,660
Linwood Boomer, the creator of the series, makes a fun cameo in this episode, playing

741
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:21,460
on a loan shark Hal tries to get money from.

742
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,300
A friend of Abe, Stevie's father, shows up to offer Malcolm a shortcut, letting him skip

743
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,740
college and go straight into the workforce with a hefty six-figure salary.

744
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:54,420
A

745
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,500
garbage bomb set up by Reese goes off early in the car, and we get an exchange that sums

746
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:08,140
up the series.

747
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:17,700
I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path.

748
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,180
You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.

749
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
That's Dewey.

750
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,180
Really?

751
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,620
This is unbelievable.

752
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,380
You actually expect me to be president.

753
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,740
No, no, I'm sorry.

754
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,840
You expect me to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.

755
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,740
You look me in the eye, and you tell me you can't do it.

756
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,720
The show wraps up with a few interesting visuals, such as this callback to the first episode.

757
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,240
Another callback to the first episode is once again revealing the family's last name through

758
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,320
Francis' name tag at his new office job, only now the last name we see is no last name.

759
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,960
That name is also clearly mouthed by the speaker during graduation when Malcolm is introduced

760
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,440
as valedictorian.

761
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,900
And the scene closes with Malcolm delivering a nice speech about family.

762
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,440
And the series comes to an end with an epilogue, giving us a sense of where all these characters

763
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,440
are heading.

764
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,040
The final line of the series is,

765
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,000
Listen, I'm gonna get to my cab pass.

766
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'll talk to you later.

767
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,600
A huge part of what made the series work so well was the obvious chemistry between the

768
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,840
actors on screen.

769
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,000
It felt like a real family, and in some ways it was.

770
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,760
Frankie Muniz spoke to that in a recent interview.

771
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,280
It really did feel like a family, especially with us kids.

772
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,160
We spent more time together than we did with our real families.

773
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,240
We'd be outside playing kickball in sports, and we'd be arguing, fighting, bickering,

774
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,640
and playing pranks on each other just like brothers would.

775
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,280
So in that sense, you really do become like a family.

776
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,160
While the family and Malcolm in the middle was consistently at each other's throats,

777
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,760
they also demonstrated the love they had for one another and how protective they were against

778
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
the outside world.

779
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:57,800
That struck a chord for any family that knew how to band together when it counted.

780
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,520
During the end of the series, Frankie Muniz took a handful of rules over the years, but

781
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,920
largely stepped away from the world of acting.

782
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,400
Sadly Muniz has had continuing difficulties with his health, including two transient ischmetic

783
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,040
attacks, also known as mini-strokes, and nine concussions.

784
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,000
Muniz believes this is the reason his memory has been severely compromised, to the point

785
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,640
where he struggles to remember his time when Malcolm in the middle.

786
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,240
That said, he has reported memories returning to him and generally seems happy in his life.

787
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,320
He and his wife are expecting their first child in early 2021.

788
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,320
Although he was nominated for three Emmys for Malcolm in the Middle, Bryan Cranston's

789
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,560
career really took off in 2008 when he was cast as Walter White on Breaking Bad, a role

790
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:41,040
completely unlike Hal, and one which earned him four Emmys, enormous ratings, and glowing

791
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,980
praise as one of the most iconic roles on television.

792
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,600
So he became a pretty big deal.

793
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,680
Cranston has been working on high-profile projects ever since, though he clearly has

794
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,840
some affinity for his time on Malcolm in the Middle, going so far as to film a bonus alternate

795
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,400
ending to Breaking Bad, which features him waking up as Hal, realizing the Walter White

796
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,800
character was just a dream.

797
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,720
The same scene included Jane Kaczmarek, who, post-Malcolm in the Middle, found her career

798
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,000
completely changed, although she hasn't been cast in a role quite as prominent as Lois

799
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
since her time on the show.

800
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,720
In an interview, she spoke about struggling to get auditions and never being considered

801
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,240
for comedy roles at all prior to her time on Malcolm in the Middle.

802
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,000
Since the show ended, she's had a steady stream of roles on dozens of projects.

803
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Christopher Masterson acted in a handful of projects after Malcolm in the Middle ended,

804
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,080
though he seems to have transitioned out of acting entirely in 2014 and now works as a

805
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,080
DJ.

806
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,480
One fun fact I found about the role of Francis is that Bryan Cranston's Breaking Bad co-star

807
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,520
Aaron Paul had auditioned for the role, though the part eventually went to Masterson.

808
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,640
Justin Burfield moved away from acting almost immediately after Malcolm in the Middle ended

809
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,640
and went into working as a producer, working on several projects before eventually becoming

810
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,080
the Chief Creative Officer at Version Produced.

811
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,560
Eric Purr Sullivan also stepped out of the acting world, having only appeared in four

812
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,800
projects after Malcolm in the Middle, the last one released in 2010.

813
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,120
Sullivan has largely left the public eye, though a handful of photos and appearances

814
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,760
have emerged in recent years.

815
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,080
Since the show's end, there has been some discussion on bringing Malcolm in the Middle

816
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,520
back in some capacity, some of the cast members shared their thoughts on a revival.

817
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,600
We've talked about how fun it'd be to do a reunion show, season, or a movie, and

818
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,480
I don't think anything excites me more.

819
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,560
I'd love it because I had such a great time doing the show and the whole cast was amazing.

820
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,360
I feel like we have more story to tell, especially 20 years later.

821
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,280
There were so many possibilities about what the family could be up to.

822
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,040
As a fan of the show, I want to know what happened.

823
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,720
I remember one of the final things in that final episode in 2006.

824
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,240
Hal and I are rejoicing that we've got two kids out of the house and I come home with

825
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,600
a pregnancy stick and you hear us both screaming because I'm pregnant again.

826
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,400
If that was true, we'd have a 14 year old.

827
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,040
We'd have another Malcolm at home because when the show started, Malcolm was 14.

828
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,200
I told Linwin this thing still resonates.

829
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,420
I want him to pull him out of retirement and have him write a reunion movie.

830
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,360
If we were to produce a Malcolm in the Middle 20 years later show, we'd absolutely contact

831
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,200
every single crew member to come back because that's the family.

832
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,760
I'm going to keep working on him.

833
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,500
I think I can convince him.

834
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Like a good wine.

835
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,500
It endures.

836
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,600
It passes the test of time.

837
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,320
It's a classic story and series and I couldn't be prouder.

838
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,920
It remains to be seen if anything concrete will materialize, particularly with Linwood

839
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,620
Boomer seemingly content with the show not coming back.

840
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,920
But in August of 2020, there was a small reunion for many of the cast members on the show.

841
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,160
They performed a reading of the first episode of the series over Zoom.

842
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,780
Tickets sold to the viewing raised funds for Healing California, a charitable organization

843
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,280
that provides free dental, medical and vision care.

844
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,960
A handful of photos have emerged from the event and a number of guest stars who appeared

845
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,700
in the series throughout the years can be spotted making cameos.

846
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,920
Watching the series was a strange experience.

847
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,840
At the time of its airing, I was at that young age where I could relate to the younger characters,

848
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,480
but now I'm not quite old enough to relate to the adults with children.

849
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,480
Late in the series, there's a scene where Hal and a random kid are dancing on an arcade

850
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,900
machine that is legally distinct from a dance dance revolution machine.

851
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,960
In this footage, I can see my past and my future.

852
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,040
And while I could probably smoke both of these scrubs at DVR, I think the power of the series

853
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:18,280
is in moments like this, seemingly absurd but utterly relatable, speaking across generations.

854
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,080
Malcolm in the Middle was a major force in popularizing the single-camera style sitcom

855
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,440
on network television.

856
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,800
It helped end the age of laugh tracks, introduced more sophisticated uses of music, and let

857
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,980
characters travel to a number of exciting and not-so-exciting locations.

858
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,760
But through these stylistic accomplishments, at its core was the story of a family struggling

859
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,280
with one another and uniting together to take on the world.

860
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,800
The idea of life being an endless struggle is at the center of what makes this show feel

861
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
real.

862
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,640
It's relatable to anyone who feels that they live in a world where you can feel lost

863
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,640
in a crowd vanishing into faceless anonymity, like a middle child constantly overlooked

864
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,880
by their family.

865
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,680
But even though Malcolm was the middle child, if you don't count Francis, until Jamie

866
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,480
is born, his family never treat him that way.

867
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,480
Hal and Lois love all their boys, hard as that may be sometimes, and in spite of the

868
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,520
rough edges of their dynamic, they're there for one another.

869
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,240
In a recent interview, Jane Kaczmarek summed this up.

870
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,400
People say they're such a dysfunctional family, and I would think, are you kidding

871
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
me?

872
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,000
They sit down for dinner together every night.

873
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,920
Those kids don't get away with anything.

874
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,600
This is a highly functioning family.

875
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,560
They're mean, loud, and aggressive, but they're highly functioning.

876
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,880
When Malcolm runs off to one day be president, he does so with the knowledge of what it means

877
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,880
to suffer.

878
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,640
Instead of falling into a cynicism and despair, show leaves us with some degree of hope that

879
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,820
things might change and get better.

880
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:38,740
But Malcolm's very existence has always been absurd.

881
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:43,500
A child genius who was born in just the right circumstances to change the world around him.

882
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,380
The solution to the struggle Malcolm's family faces is to get extremely lucky, and that's

883
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:52,020
the hope for people like them in their world, that someone like Malcolm might be born in

884
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,500
the right family to make things better.

885
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,980
And then what are the odds of that happening?

886
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,380
It's an indictment of the world they live in.

887
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,540
And for anyone who's struggled to get ahead in the world, sometimes it feels like the

888
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,940
only solution is to become extremely lucky.

889
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:10,460
Something that, for most people, only exists in the world of fantasy.

890
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,780
So that is Malcolm in the Middle in the books.

891
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,140
To be honest, I had actually stopped watching Malcolm in the Middle when it was first airing

892
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:21,580
around season four or five-ish, so seeing those later seasons was a first for me.

893
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:26,080
And for anyone curious, Malcolm in the Middle is easily the most abandoned series I've had

894
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,300
for one of these retrospectives, and I hope people enjoyed this.

895
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,680
