00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Have you ever found yourself watching a YouTube political commentary channel, heard them cite

00:06.080 --> 00:12.080
something and then checked the source yourself and found that it said something completely different?

00:12.080 --> 00:16.880
It happens all the time in the videos I respond to and I often wonder what goes through the mind

00:16.880 --> 00:21.280
of someone as they read this stuff. Do they have an agenda they're trying to push by distorting

00:21.280 --> 00:26.800
the truth or are they just not bright enough to understand what they're reading? And that brings

00:26.880 --> 00:32.320
us to Tim Poole. Poole styles himself a journalist and while I'm not terribly familiar with the

00:32.320 --> 00:39.040
thousands of videos he's released, I'm going to violate his recommendation and focus on one video

00:39.040 --> 00:44.880
where he gives us a lovely example of how to read an article and twist it into a narrative.

00:46.640 --> 00:54.320
The title to his video, Vox Thinks Men Don't Deserve Civil Rights, reminds me of an old adage

00:54.320 --> 01:00.080
when it comes to journalism. If a headline ends with a question mark, the answer is usually no.

01:00.080 --> 01:05.920
Poole is responding to an article from Vox titled, A Men's Rights Activist Sued a Women's Beer Event,

01:05.920 --> 01:13.520
written by Rebecca James. Now let's see why this video got 122,000 views at the time of me writing

01:13.520 --> 01:18.800
this. I don't even know how to describe this, okay? This has got to be the most ignorant piece

01:18.800 --> 01:24.560
of writing I have ever seen. It's actually rather terrifying and bigoted. So we're off to a great

01:24.560 --> 01:29.520
start. Poole is letting us know that this article in Vox is the most ignorant piece of writing he's

01:29.520 --> 01:35.520
ever seen. This is actually a good opener, not because it's true of course, but because it's

01:35.520 --> 01:40.800
still specific to the article itself and doesn't pretend that this article is some kind of rosetta

01:40.800 --> 01:47.040
stone for the left. At least it doesn't do that yet. The first couple of minutes is just Poole

01:47.040 --> 01:51.440
blandly reading the article, which hardly matters because it's the commentary where

01:51.440 --> 01:56.160
the distortion happens. Let's look at how he interprets one slightly ambiguous line.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.600
Men's rights activists believe that society is actually sexist against men. Full stop. Not

02:03.600 --> 02:11.440
necessarily. It's my understanding that, you know, by putting actually sexist against men,

02:11.440 --> 02:15.040
they're kind of implying that they don't believe it's sexist against women.

02:15.840 --> 02:22.480
Wait, how does he know that? This line, men's rights activists believe that society is actually

02:22.560 --> 02:29.760
sexist against men. Anything regarding women here is being completely inferred by Poole. His phrasing,

02:29.760 --> 02:34.480
they're kind of implying, gives him permission to launch into a rant about a straw man of his own

02:34.480 --> 02:40.080
making. Poole's perceived idea that Jennings, the author of the article, believes men's rights

02:40.080 --> 02:45.200
activists don't believe society is sexist towards women. Maybe she does think that, but there's

02:45.200 --> 02:50.800
nothing in the article so far to suggest that, except for Poole's bias. Society is actually

02:50.800 --> 02:57.920
only sexist against men. The word only doesn't appear there. This is a single line in an article,

02:57.920 --> 03:02.080
and some more context can help us shed some light on what the author is trying to say.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.520
Context like this. Fry has perfected the subculture's favorite way to target what they

03:07.520 --> 03:12.160
see as a society that's sexist against men, suing businesses and organizations that incentivize

03:12.160 --> 03:17.600
women to go there. Jennings is telling us that men's rights activists, Martin Fry specifically,

03:17.600 --> 03:25.200
see society as sexist against men. Once again, no mention of women. This is why reading an article

03:25.200 --> 03:30.560
line by line is often a recipe for disaster, taking time to understand context matters.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.120
But if you're trying to push a narrative, you might be more inclined to imagine what the author

03:35.120 --> 03:41.280
thinks, rather than engaging with what they're actually saying. If you are running a public

03:41.280 --> 03:47.120
business, and you are using public infrastructure, I am of the opinion you must serve members of the

03:47.120 --> 03:50.880
public within reason. There's nuance, right? There's certain grounds in which you can remove

03:50.880 --> 03:55.120
certain people. I don't think it's absolute, but for the most part, if someone wants to come to your

03:55.120 --> 04:00.080
event, you can't be like, no dudes allowed, because that would be a violation of civil rights law.

04:00.080 --> 04:05.280
I think so. Right. Okay, let's go back to the article and have Tim read it out for us.

04:06.240 --> 04:10.960
But in November 2017, as Sue tells Eater, a man emailed Eagle Rock's general information

04:10.960 --> 04:15.760
line asking for a spot at the ticketed forum. A staff member mistakenly told the man

04:15.840 --> 04:21.120
that the event was for women only. In fact, men have attended before. And even after he was offered

04:21.120 --> 04:25.440
access to a future women's beer event, the man ultimately filed a discrimination claim through

04:25.440 --> 04:29.520
the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the entity in charge of enforcing California civil

04:29.520 --> 04:36.800
rights laws. What did he say again? You can't be like, no dudes allowed. So someone on staff

04:36.800 --> 04:42.240
at this bar mistakenly tells someone that men aren't allowed when men have attended this event

04:42.240 --> 04:48.160
several times in the past. And the person was offered a spot in the future. This is grounds for

04:48.160 --> 04:55.600
a civil rights lawsuit. Really, this turns into a little rant. But I would be surprised if Vox

04:55.600 --> 05:00.560
isn't supporting the you know, the gay couple that wanted the wedding cake. Basically, the wedding

05:00.560 --> 05:05.040
cake story is a gay couple wanted a custom wedding cake. The proprietor said you can buy any one of

05:05.040 --> 05:09.120
these cakes, but I won't do a custom job for your wedding. So they sued. And the left is upset about

05:09.120 --> 05:13.920
it. And the right is defending the private business rights. Well, what about this? This is a

05:13.920 --> 05:19.920
mushy mouth gotcha game trying to catch Fox on some kind of hypocrisy charge. I could play the

05:19.920 --> 05:25.920
same game pool is playing. I could make a whole video asking why the right is so anxious to defend

05:25.920 --> 05:31.760
a cake shop refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple, but is silent on a bar supposedly refusing

05:31.760 --> 05:36.720
service to men at a special event for women. Although I'd still be a liar making that video

05:36.720 --> 05:42.160
because the women's night doesn't ban men from attending something Tim Poole never figures out

05:42.160 --> 05:47.280
because it's not actually about civil rights. It's not about principle. It's about just winning,

05:47.280 --> 05:53.040
right? So the left is on the side of certain groups. All they want is for them to win. They

05:53.040 --> 05:58.080
don't care about the principle. Holy shit. One article on box is suddenly standing in for

05:58.080 --> 06:04.640
the left. Does Jennings realize how important she is now? She is the voice of the left. But obviously

06:04.640 --> 06:10.560
Poole here is using his reading of this specific article for commentary about the left. This is his

06:10.560 --> 06:16.320
exemplar and this is the point we've safely left the realm of criticizing a specific article

06:16.320 --> 06:21.600
and we're now talking about a group of people. So a quick sketch of what we've seen so far.

06:21.600 --> 06:28.160
Poole is reading this article with a bit of creative license using it to inform a certain branch of

06:28.160 --> 06:34.080
commentary and now he's taking that commentary and placing it all on the shoulders of the left.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.840
I hope the game being played here is becoming more obvious. Here's some more bad reading.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.400
And as she told Eater, she wants to elicit some form of change at the legislative level

06:44.400 --> 06:50.560
to minimize the exploitation of the UNRWA Act, a California law against discrimination by sex,

06:50.560 --> 06:55.600
race, and other factors, by career plaintiffs so that small businesses and women's groups don't

06:55.600 --> 07:01.440
continually get targeted for these cases. Career plaintiffs. Man, I love the absolute bias here.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.080
Let's call the man an activist. They've called him a men's rights activist. Why call him a career

07:06.080 --> 07:11.680
plaintiff? He's clearly doing this to make a point and he's using the law as it is written.

07:11.680 --> 07:16.400
It is not an exploitation of the law to make sure businesses are upholding the law. That's your

07:16.400 --> 07:23.200
issue. So did anyone catch the mistake Poole made here? This video, I thought, was about the bias in

07:23.200 --> 07:29.120
Vox's article as it was written by Jennings with Vox and by extension Jennings being responsible

07:29.120 --> 07:35.280
for the extreme bias. But what he just read here isn't written by Jennings. It's a quote from

07:35.280 --> 07:40.480
Ting Tzu, the woman who ran the women's beer forum. Generally speaking, you shouldn't assume that

07:40.480 --> 07:46.480
someone reporting on a story agrees with everything or even most of what a subject is saying.

07:46.480 --> 07:51.200
Poole even acknowledges Fry is called an activist earlier in the article, which should have given

07:51.200 --> 07:56.960
him a hint as to what was going on here. A bigger hint than the fucking quotation marks.

07:57.600 --> 08:03.120
I want to take the bait for a moment. Where does Tzu get off calling Fry a career plaintiff?

08:03.120 --> 08:09.120
This article from KCAL Los Angeles from 2014 describes Fry in another lawsuit where he was

08:09.120 --> 08:16.000
doing some real activism suing Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen restaurant in Brea in July 2013 claiming

08:16.000 --> 08:20.800
he was denied the opportunity to order the same Ladies Night special discount items that were

08:20.800 --> 08:26.880
offered to female patrons during visits to the restaurant in January and May 2013. What a hero.

08:27.520 --> 08:33.600
He lost this suit but according to court records Fry has filed over 40 sex discrimination lawsuits

08:33.600 --> 08:38.160
and this was back in 2014 and we know that number has gone up by at least one

08:38.160 --> 08:43.680
as per the article we're talking about right now. This is the clear behavior of someone looking

08:43.680 --> 08:48.000
for these lawsuits using the law to pressure businesses to get rid of promotions that he

08:48.000 --> 08:53.680
considers violations of his rights and I stress that these are what he considers violations of

08:53.680 --> 08:59.360
his rights as he's lost a number of these lawsuits that have gone to trial. Though generally a lot of

08:59.360 --> 09:05.120
them settle outside of court because the businesses he targets can't afford to fight back. That's the

09:05.120 --> 09:10.720
grift the Jennings article is trying to describe. If this went to court the law could be tested and

09:10.720 --> 09:16.960
as we've seen in the past Fry has lost several of his claims. Why Tim Poole thinks he is a credible

09:16.960 --> 09:22.000
activist I'm not too sure. I guess he probably just hasn't read up on the subject outside of a

09:22.000 --> 09:27.680
Vox article he can yell at and paint as extreme leftist propaganda. It's easy to call something

09:27.680 --> 09:34.800
propaganda or extreme leftist bigative whatever when you don't read beyond that article or even

09:34.800 --> 09:41.600
read the article accurately. As a side note I'd like to mention that all these lawsuits filed by

09:41.600 --> 09:46.960
Fry really highlight the absurdity of the legal system where important questions of rights can

09:46.960 --> 09:52.800
only be settled by those who can afford lawyers. We're getting to some good stuff now. The

09:52.800 --> 09:59.440
weaponization of the law against the very philosophy that one claims to champion is a case study in

09:59.440 --> 10:06.000
irony. For MRAs it's able-bodied white cis heterosexual men using civil rights legislation

10:06.000 --> 10:10.960
which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights of able-bodied

10:10.960 --> 10:16.240
cis white heterosexual men as more important than others. No it's not! That's literally not

10:16.240 --> 10:21.760
why we have civil rights laws. Civil rights law isn't written to say white men have too much power.

10:21.760 --> 10:27.200
Civil rights law is written to say that any person is is deserving of rights.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.440
Ooh he gets so angry here. I like this little clip not because it's funny seeing him get angry

10:33.440 --> 10:39.200
but because it encapsulates an incredibly dopey reading of history and some painful pedantry.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.880
The why we have civil rights laws is what I want to focus on here. Civil rights laws were not

10:44.880 --> 10:50.800
written to be anti-white men obviously right but the context in which they were written was

10:50.800 --> 10:55.600
specifically designed to protect the rights of individuals who are not able-bodied white cis

10:55.600 --> 11:01.200
heterosexual men because those were the people who had the most rights in American society before

11:01.200 --> 11:07.040
they were written. As a point of comparison let's take a famous example the 19th amendment to the

11:07.040 --> 11:13.040
United States Constitution. It reads pretty simply as the rights of citizens of the United States

11:13.040 --> 11:19.360
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.

11:19.360 --> 11:24.320
That sounds like it was written to protect all sexes right? But why was it written in the first

11:24.320 --> 11:30.000
place? I would hope people would know that it was written because women were being denied the right

11:30.000 --> 11:36.640
to vote. To say that this amendment was written to protect men and women is true only in the most

11:36.640 --> 11:42.240
pedantic sense. The historical reality of that amendment is that it was written to protect the

11:42.240 --> 11:46.560
rights of women. Let's look at the quoted section again from the Jennings article.

11:47.120 --> 11:52.480
Civil rights legislation which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights

11:52.480 --> 11:59.120
of able-bodied white cis heterosexual men as more important than others. Maybe the is

11:59.680 --> 12:06.480
should have been a was here if we're going to be particular about grammar since enacted is the past

12:07.120 --> 12:13.520
but the walk back the country's history part is pretty explicit in that this sentence is about

12:13.520 --> 12:19.760
why these laws were created to correct the racist and sexist differences in American society present

12:19.760 --> 12:25.360
in its founding. If you don't believe the US was racist and sexist when it started then

12:27.280 --> 12:32.640
I don't know man women not being able to vote in slavery seem pretty sexist and racist to me.

12:32.640 --> 12:36.800
And the irony this paragraph by Jennings is pointing out is that Fry is using civil

12:36.800 --> 12:41.760
rights legislation to shut down a space where women have historically been underrepresented.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.960
To focus on a pedantic reading of the law is to completely miss the point of what Jennings is

12:46.960 --> 12:53.120
writing here. It says as much in the one paragraph that Poole didn't even touch in his reading.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.240
When the law is set up to protect all people regardless of their demographic,

12:58.240 --> 13:03.440
these kinds of bad faith actors are able to twist laws designed to help correct imbalances

13:03.440 --> 13:09.840
to try to undermine their existence. That is to say when people abuse the law in this way,

13:09.840 --> 13:15.600
bad faith actors like Martin Fry, it undermines the reason these laws were created in the first

13:15.600 --> 13:22.880
place. Someone like Fry isn't really striving for equality so much as he is trying to make sure that

13:22.880 --> 13:29.040
white men don't lose a single ounce of their privilege. And that includes apparently having

13:29.040 --> 13:34.800
access to discounts. Poole's reading here is divorced from history in that he sees these laws

13:34.800 --> 13:41.120
in a modern context as a neutral tool for anyone who meets their definition. While it's well and

13:41.120 --> 13:46.000
good to write laws like these neutrally, I suspect when civil rights laws were written to get people

13:46.000 --> 13:51.760
to take whites only signs down they weren't worried about a day when men would be denied a

13:51.760 --> 13:59.680
25% discount on a green fee. And yeah that's one of the fights Martin Fry fought for. He was very

13:59.680 --> 14:06.000
upset there was a 25% discount for women during Breast Cancer Awareness Month at a golf course.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.800
Like I said, the guy's a hero. And invert it. It would be perfect in the 1950s. Women are suing

14:12.800 --> 14:18.320
men under civil rights law. They're exploiting the law to gain access. That's literally not what

14:18.320 --> 14:23.920
civil rights are about. Another lovely take. Are men really as disadvantaged today as women were in

14:23.920 --> 14:31.120
the 1950s? Really? There's a level of nuance here he just isn't engaging with because it isn't really

14:31.120 --> 14:36.560
convenient to his narrative that he's pushing. Like take a philosophy course. Just read some

14:36.560 --> 14:43.120
philosophy and and some famous writers on liberty and freedom and what it really means because this

14:43.120 --> 14:50.160
is some of the most insane bigoted racist nonsense I've ever seen. Oh my god. Man this guy must not

14:50.160 --> 14:56.240
see much if this is the most bigoted stuff he's ever seen. Also how is this racist? Wasn't this

14:56.240 --> 15:03.920
about sexism? Does Tim Poole think this video is about race just because she's Asian? Obviously I'm

15:03.920 --> 15:09.040
just being silly here. He clearly misspoke. I fully recognize that it's a dick move to ignore

15:09.040 --> 15:13.440
the context of a person's words to create a straw man to further a political narrative.

15:14.240 --> 15:19.840
If only we were both playing by those rules. Before leaving the video entirely, here are the

15:19.840 --> 15:24.640
most telling clips. And again that's about all I really know because I don't follow this a whole

15:24.640 --> 15:31.200
lot but I will say when I'm look I don't follow Vox uh I read Vox pretty often but I don't know

15:31.200 --> 15:36.080
their exact opinion on the on the wedding cake thing. Personally I don't know the full details

15:36.160 --> 15:40.960
of Jordan Peterson's uh suits. In each of those clips Tim Poole is admitting he doesn't know

15:40.960 --> 15:47.920
many details of what he's commenting on and then proceeds to comment on it. Funnily enough he knows

15:47.920 --> 15:53.600
less than he realizes from why civil rights laws exist to the nature of the event this article is

15:53.600 --> 16:00.000
describing but he doesn't stop himself from commenting on any of it. And this is what annoys

16:00.880 --> 16:06.320
me. Unlike Poole I won't make any broader claims about my subject based on one video. I sampled a

16:06.320 --> 16:12.000
few more of his videos but not nearly enough to form an opinion on the guy because the few I

16:12.000 --> 16:17.520
actually sat down and watched made me stand up for my computer and and consider the terrible

16:17.520 --> 16:23.120
choices I've made. Tim Poole's video has an argument that Vox, a stand-in for the left,

16:23.120 --> 16:29.280
constantly pushes out sexist pieces on their website. Poole's strategy to prove this hypothesis

16:29.280 --> 16:34.960
is to focus on a single video contorting it to fit his premise and then providing it as evidence

16:34.960 --> 16:39.600
for his narrative. Maybe if I comb through his thousands of videos maybe I could find some

16:39.600 --> 16:44.640
actual evidence of this narrative existing and his point could have some merit. But even if he does

16:44.640 --> 16:51.600
have videos where he provides evidence that Vox is some kind of horribly sexist outlet this isn't

16:51.600 --> 16:56.720
one of them. This is just Tim Poole beating his audience a narrative.
