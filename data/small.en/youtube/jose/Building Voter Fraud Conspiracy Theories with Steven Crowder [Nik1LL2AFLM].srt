00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Viewer discretion is advised. The following video includes clips of Steven Crowder, and I've done my best to screen out as many of his bad jokes as I could.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
In the lead up to the

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,080
2020 American election, rumors swirl about the security of the vote and the potential for fraud.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,960
Most of these rumors came out of the mouth of President Trump and were rapidly parroted by right-wing press and general bootlickers in the alternative media.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,280
The only way we're gonna lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. It's the only way we're gonna lose this election.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:47,520
On election night, people were primed to find all sorts of irregularities in the voting process, and by God, some voices in the online space were gonna find evidence even if they had to make it up themselves.

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:56,800
One tactic, employed quite heavily, was a favorite of conspiracy theorists called just asking questions, or jacking off if you want to say it in a sex way.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,120
It shouldn't be confused with asking questions in general, which is completely valid and something I wholeheartedly support.

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:14,400
The just asking questions technique uses the practice of asking leading questions to shift the burden of proof away from the question asker to make their evidence-free claims appear more convincing.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,200
One prominent example of this is the exhausting five-hour stream on the Steven Crowder YouTube channel titled,

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Live updates. Democrats try to steal election? Good morning, hashtag mug club, airing on November 4th, the day after the election.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,800
Before you ask, yes, I watched all five hours. I know I don't want to talk about how often I felt myself slip into the abyss of madness.

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Head for the gudgeon of madness.

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
The stream bounds back and forth between different questions it has about the election.

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,720
These questions, instead of being properly investigated, are used to fuel the conspiracy theory that victory in the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:04,560
One aspect of the just asking questions strategy is to ask questions in a number of ways, ignoring any answers you might get unless it's the answer an asker is actually after.

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,360
In this stream, that technique is best represented by the questions raised around ballots filled out with sharpies.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:21,040
In Arizona, the use of Sharpie pins was causing some ballots to be invalidated, and it could be pretty big numbers, mostly for Trump supporters.

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,120
So the people that were in front of me, there were two people in front of me that used the Sharpie that was given to them by the poll workers.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,920
It did not read their ballot, and they flooded in there twice. I used the pen, took their Sharpie and threw it away, and it read your ballot.

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,960
So what they're doing is they're telling people to use the Sharpies that way those votes aren't counted.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
That's exactly what's happening.

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,240
Truly shocking stuff. You would think these criminal masterminds wouldn't feed these votes into the counting machines in front of the voters, letting them see them fail.

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,320
But apparently, that's what happened, according to this random video taken from the internet.

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,320
And I'm not sure how they figured out who is or isn't a Trump voter before they actually vote.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,960
Still, the question is raised, and that's the most important part, getting us to question whether or not votes written with Sharpies are being counted.

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,640
And as the stream rolled along, that question changed along with it.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,960
We supposedly have even more evidence here from Maricopa County saying Sharpies are okay, but also not okay on their official voting ballot.

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,400
And then if you look at the actual election ballot, it's a little dark, but it says do not use a Sharpie type pen as it will bleed through.

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
Pretty damning, huh? And wow, these guys just hate it when people don't take their claim seriously.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,320
People that get really upset and say, oh, this is unconfirmed or this is a conspiracy theory. It's like, okay, well, let's let's look into it.

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Excellent point, Reg. And in the time it took you to go on that little rant, I decided to look up the phone number printed on that voting ballot and found out it is in fact from Arizona, but not Maricopa County.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:55,120
It's for the Elections Committee in Pima County. And had any attempts been made to reach Pima County election officials, they might have found this tweet speaking on the issue.

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,720
Arizona ballot tabulating machines can read ballots marked with a felt tip pen. Felt pens are discouraged because the ink can bleed through.

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,160
If it does bleed through, the ballot will most likely get sent for duplication so it can be read by the scanner.

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,880
All ballots in which voter intent can be discerned will be counted. That's also in the manual.

37
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,360
No ballots will be discarded because of the method used to color in the ovals.

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:26,720
Assuming Maricopa County's process is similar to Pima County, these tweets would also explain why the girl in the Twitter video saw the ballots of people who aren't her not go through the machine.

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,400
It's not that their votes weren't counted at all. It's that they had to be duplicated by hand and scan through the machine again.

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
But just to be safe, we should still ask, can people use Sharpies in Maricopa County?

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,680
If you take a few seconds to go to their election department website, you'll find this helpful little video.

42
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,920
Did you know you can use a black or blue pen or Sharpie to fill out your ballot in Maricopa County?

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:57,040
At the vote center, you may notice fine tip Sharpies are used. That's because it's the fastest drying ink and works best on the tabulation equipment.

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,920
If Crowder and his buddies had taken time to look into this adequately, they could have put this question to bed.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,520
Instead, questions about Sharpies persist throughout the stream.

46
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,560
A good two hours after first bringing up Sharpies, they finally find some random people on Twitter countering their claim.

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,720
You know, some Twitter users were saying that they filled it out with Sharpie and called them, the Arizona voting station, and said, hey, did you count my ballot or not?

48
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,480
And they said, yes, those do get counted, but not till later. So, you know, who knows?

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,360
But this answer to their question is ignored an hour later.

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,040
I got two different text messages from people on the ground, one in Michigan in Livonia, which I think is...

51
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
I know Livonia very well.

52
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay, another in Macomb County, also in Michigan, two different people have said they personally voted they were given Sharpies and told to vote in those jurisdictions.

53
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,480
Whether or not those votes were counted is beside the point. They just want to confirm that Sharpie use is widespread so they can modify their questions about Sharpies,

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,600
broadening the idea that this is a serious problem that needs to be investigated, even though they're not really providing any more evidence.

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,440
And yes, I absolutely mean they're trying to birth the conspiracy theory here, best exemplified by this clip.

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
And if we can find even a handful of places that we're using Sharpies, that is systemic.

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,960
They know better than to give you Sharpies. They know that you should not be voting with Sharpies and that makes it easy to manipulate votes.

58
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,800
And at the very least, any ballots that have Sharpies should be discounted and there should be a recount with those.

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Systemic use of Sharpies. All ballots using Sharpies should be discounted and trigger a recount.

60
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
That's an amazing jump based on a single video on Twitter.

61
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,280
Eventually, they find a day-old tweet from Maricopa County, which I remind you is where the original Twitter video was filmed.

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:47,280
There's a Maricopa County elections tweet from 23 hours ago saying that they can use Sharpies because they have new offset columns on the ballots, which will prevent bleed through.

63
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,880
OK, so we want to be accurate, but that kind of contradicts what the video from the two voters in Arizona were saying, right?

64
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
It was not going through for them.

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Well, they were saying that in Arizona, but now we're talking about Missouri and we're talking about other places.

66
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,760
Any answers that were acknowledged were only used to change the question because Crowder wants a specific answer and he'll keep changing the question until he gets it.

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,120
May not be a huge deal, but when you combine all of this together, Sharpie, Sharpie, Sharpie, Sharpie.

68
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Steven Crowder took a single video from Twitter, one that, at best, claims voting machines can't read ballots marked with Sharpies and turns it into a countrywide conspiracy about election workers handing out Sharpies to spoil ballots.

69
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,920
It's not happening. And if it was, he wouldn't need to ask questions.

70
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,800
He'd just show us the evidence and that would be the end of it.

71
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,760
News flash. We have another case of potential voter fraud hot off the press.

72
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,280
They were transporting votes by coolers in Michigan late at night.

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,000
I am concerned, panicked and shaken to my very bones.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
All right. I'm coming in because I just wanted to check and make sure this is verified.

75
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, thank goodness. Before making themselves look like idiots,

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
Steven Crowder is on the scene, making sure all of this is on the up and up.

77
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, you just you wouldn't be able to trust that just because some ballots could fly off the back.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,600
That's a guy in a WrestleMania t-shirt with a KB toys wagon.

79
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,760
And another exclusive for Steven Crowder.

80
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,560
He interviews the woman who captured this video of a guy wheeling this mysterious red wagon into a vote counting center.

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
And the concern was just the security concern.

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,280
We don't really know what was going on with or what items they were bringing in or who was going in or any of those things.

83
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,960
The video didn't show us any ballots and the person recording it says they don't know what was in those containers.

84
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,360
Yet they still feel comfortable saying that these were, in fact, ballots.

85
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
Right now, what we're seeing is people bringing in by themselves with no security,

86
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,240
red wagons and Coleman coolers, bringing them behind the glass area where no one has access.

87
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
He seems to be fishing for a very specific allegation.

88
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
What, I guess, is your concern.

89
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,080
They could be walking in with what? With fake ballots?

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,400
They could just I mean, absolutely.

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
Oh, and there he gets it.

92
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,000
He had to hold her hand very tightly, but he got her to say what he needed her to say.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,160
That fake ballots are being surreptitiously brought into the voting centers for liability reasons.

94
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
He's not the one making the claim.

95
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,000
The person he's interviewing is.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
It's a fun little microcosm of what he does with his viewers.

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,280
He leads them down a conspiracy theory garden path, points them towards a conclusion,

98
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
and lets them make the jump for themselves.

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
He never made the accusation.

100
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,120
He was just asking questions so we can't hold him responsible for getting this completely wrong.

101
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,840
But you know what?

102
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,520
I am going to hold him completely responsible because it was his shoddy investigation that

103
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:44,320
required this lovely response from local news station WXYZ, or I guess for Americans WXYZ.

104
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know, one of those.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
And as a seven action news representative,

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,040
I would have gladly told her that it was a box full of batteries.

107
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
Who would have guessed that someone for the group Lawyers for Trump

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
might have some kind of political agenda?

109
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
Of course, this news story came out after the stream,

110
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
so Crowder couldn't have known his ridiculous questions

111
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,640
had such an easy answer.

112
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
But that didn't stop him from broadcasting

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,640
speculation that these were ballots to advance the election theft conspiracy theory.

114
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,000
If we look at that video, we can't tell what's in that wagon, and neither can Crowder.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
There's no reason to believe these are ballots,

116
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,520
but that ambiguity was enough cover to let him ask the question.

117
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,280
What reason does Crowder have to think these are ballots and not, say,

118
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,600
a late night snack for the vote counters?

119
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Or maybe office supplies to help them manage all that paperwork?

120
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
And in reality, they were something else entirely.

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,440
They were batteries.

122
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
None of these possibilities are even raised.

123
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,520
The only questions Crowder was interested in asking

124
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,080
were leading questions to continue raising doubts on the results of the election.

125
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,760
Okay, so that's two duds.

126
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
But what other very serious questions does Crowder have about this election?

127
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
What? Is that commonplace?

128
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Can someone let me know?

129
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,200
That's a video from the inside of the guy, yeah.

130
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Oh yes, this was a very concerning question.

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
How can you have transparency when windows outside are being covered up?

132
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
Maybe if there was some kind of presence of the media there,

133
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
or monitors from the Biden and Trump campaigns?

134
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
Oh, what's that?

135
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
There's evidence that those people were there?

136
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
Oh, and if we look at the footage from the video that was shown to us,

137
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
we can see them right there.

138
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,960
Oh, that was easy.

139
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,000
Also, the video is like, where did they think that was coming from?

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Obviously, there are people inside recording things

141
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,920
if the recording people put up giant pieces of Bristol board.

142
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
Yeah, this one didn't really work out.

143
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,120
Let's see what the official reason from the city is for the covering of windows.

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,520
This comes from Lawrence Garcia, an attorney for the city of Detroit.

145
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,240
Some, but not all, windows were covered.

146
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Because poll workers seated just inside those windows expressed concerns

147
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
about people outside the center photographing and filming them and their work.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Only the media is allowed to take pictures inside the counting place,

149
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
and people outside the center were not listening to requests

150
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
to stop filming poll workers and their paperwork.

151
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
This concern over windows being covered up

152
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
happened in the midst of the discussion about the nefarious red wagon.

153
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,080
One of the methods that keeps conspiracy theories alive

154
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,960
is this tendency to constantly generate new questions

155
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,600
to create the impression that evidence is mounting.

156
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
Throughout the stream, Crowder frequently brings up the mysterious case

157
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,440
of over 100,000 votes suddenly being added to the Biden tally in Michigan.

158
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
This update of Biden getting 100% of new votes, 128,000 or more,

159
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
just in one chunk with zero for Trump.

160
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,560
Which they mentioned was reported as an error and eventually corrected.

161
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
And here's another sudden vote change they thought in Michigan.

162
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
In the reviewing the numbers and said their discrepancies,

163
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,960
it seems like the numbers were transposed that they got Trump's numbers in Biden switched.

164
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Right, and so he said they'll be corrected soon.

165
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,400
Pretty damn suspicious if you ignore that these errors were corrected during the election,

166
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,040
of course.

167
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,000
I think it's fair to assume that during an election involving millions of people voting

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
with thousands of voting centers across 50 different states,

169
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
a few errors might happen.

170
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,200
But Crowder has noticed a sinister pattern.

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
And all of this tomfoolery happened after 4 a.m.

172
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
and every single one of these major errors in these swing states

173
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
happened to favor Biden.

174
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,360
This is actually a decent point, but it also raises a contradictory question.

175
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
Are there any examples of suspicious circumstances

176
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
that worked against the Biden campaign?

177
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,200
Perhaps we listen to this clip for a few more seconds.

178
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,440
It broke a long time ago.

179
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
Of mail-in ballots were not delivered.

180
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
So, for example, in Philadelphia, 33.7 percent.

181
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,160
Oh, ballots aren't being delivered in Philadelphia.

182
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,960
Sounds like another one of those suspicious errors.

183
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,680
It could be another attempt to sabotage the Trump campaign.

184
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
Why would you say that, Steven?

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Oh, all the votes in Philadelphia were going for Biden.

186
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
Okay, so that's one error against the Biden campaign.

187
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Oh, and here's another error.

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,640
The Arizona had reportedly counted 95 percent of its vote.

189
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,480
And then New York Times noted that, oh, due to an error,

190
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,960
the actual number is only 86 percent.

191
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
This morning, the Trump campaign said, you know,

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,160
we think when all the votes are counted, we're going to pull ahead in Arizona.

193
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
I could easily frame these as mysterious votes

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,840
that come out of nowhere to support one candidate over another.

195
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,280
In truth, they were just mail-in votes that hadn't been counted yet.

196
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,040
Strange that Crowder forgot about this example from his own stream,

197
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,640
especially since this one was talked about 40 minutes before he even said,

198
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,040
Every single one of these major errors in these swing states happen to favor Biden.

199
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
The fact is, errors affected both candidates,

200
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
but Crowder is only paying attention to one side that's affected by them,

201
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,200
raising questions that portray the Trump campaign as victims of election theft.

202
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
There were some other irregularities pointed out on this stream,

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,280
such as votes mysteriously appearing in Kenosha.

204
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,920
We had 60 percent for Donald Trump to 38 percent for Biden.

205
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,440
And then all of a sudden it shrunk to 50, 47.

206
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
Again, the same county, the same county.

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
How does that happen?

208
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,440
This was because of mail-in ballots heavily favoring Biden,

209
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,160
thanks to Trump constantly encouraging his supporters to vote person rather than by mail.

210
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,840
And over 50 percent of voters in Kenosha ended up voting by mail.

211
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,680
After counting those votes, they decided to add them to the total all at once.

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,440
23,000 votes in Philadelphia, all for Biden.

213
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,280
That doesn't happen.

214
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,560
23,277, all.

215
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
Can you maybe take this one, Reg?

216
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, unless there's some strange way that they're just

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
reporting for one candidate at a time, that doesn't make any sense.

218
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

219
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,560
No need to wonder about it.

220
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,880
This is easily verifiable since a number of votes were reported all at once for Trump

221
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,200
a short time after the Biden numbers came in.

222
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Not as many, of course, because he didn't get as many votes as Biden.

223
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Because he lost.

224
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
I'm starting to run out of energy trying to answer all these questions

225
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
because the sheer volume of them is so high in this stream

226
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,520
and they do such a poor job of trying to honestly answer them.

227
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,920
Even when they stumble onto an answer during the stream,

228
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,680
they're quickly discarded so Crowder can hit home the point that matters the most.

229
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,160
That if all these questions are raised, something fishy must be going on.

230
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,960
Blitzing someone with so many questions that they might not notice

231
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,840
there's no actual evidence to support the idea that

232
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,760
this election is illegitimate or was stolen by the Democrats.

233
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,720
And I have one more sweet morsel of a question for everyone.

234
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,440
A piece of evidence so bad that even Steven Crowder can't stand by it.

235
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,400
This is something that is being sent to us right now on Twitter as a video.

236
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,480
I have no idea if it's true or not, but several people are circulating this.

237
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Do we have the clip? Let's roll it.

238
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,620
You know.

239
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,060
Oh Trump, you got to do what you got to do.

240
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,060
Crimes.

241
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,260
I've got around 80.

242
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,420
I don't know if this is real.

243
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,020
Yeah, I don't know.

244
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,100
We didn't necessarily to run that because we have something more authentic,

245
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,660
but we have something that's actually authentic afterwards.

246
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,420
But that wouldn't surprise me that that's been going on.

247
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Crowder isn't convinced it's real.

248
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,340
It isn't, by the way, all those papers being burned are sample ballots, not real ones.

249
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,180
But Crowder saying that it wouldn't surprise him if this sort of thing was happening

250
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,860
is just shocking.

251
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,460
Unlike other questions, which rest on ambiguous claims or videos,

252
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Crowder raises the question without even pretending that this video is anything other than bogus.

253
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,580
He uses it to present a general suspicion that

254
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,980
someone out there might be doing this based on a feeling he might be right.

255
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,340
This does not feel like a legitimate, it really doesn't feel like a legitimate

256
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,980
when there are too many things that just aren't adding up.

257
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,940
Are you convinced yet?

258
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,500
By the end of the stream, Crowder invites Congressman Dan Crenshaw on to voice some concerns.

259
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,460
Yeah, I mean, we just, we just have to know, right?

260
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,700
We see these anecdotes of potentially, you know, wrongful behavior.

261
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
We just have to know.

262
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,740
They just want to know.

263
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,460
And wanting to know is just a fancy way of saying,

264
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,900
they're just asking questions about the security of the election.

265
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,620
The reason they can only ask questions is because they have absolutely no evidence.

266
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,260
What few video clips and statements that have been shown

267
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,540
don't come anywhere near close to living up to the stream's title of Democrats stealing the

268
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,740
election, but all these questions are designed so it doesn't feel right to the audience.

269
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,100
Getting them to assume, on the basis of nothing, that this election isn't legitimate.

270
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Pepper, throughout the stream, are a series of rants against the mainstream media,

271
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,260
parading them for not doing their job and not investigating these bogus claims.

272
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,780
Should you ask a question?

273
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah, should you ask any question?

274
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,820
Funnily enough, most of the ridiculous conspiracy theories presented in this stream were debunked

275
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,020
by said mainstream media, making it a lot easier for me to produce this video.

276
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,020
But my favorite bit in one of Crowder's rants is right here.

277
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,180
We always have to be so right because there's so much accountability because everyone is gunning

278
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,740
for, again, in the big powerful corporations for people who have opinions like ours.

279
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,460
They're just aching for a reason for us to be wrong.

280
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,180
This is such a delicious irony.

281
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,580
Steven Crowder was wrong about every single one of these suspicious incidents,

282
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,660
and the title of this stream is a lie about the Democrats trying to steal the election

283
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,020
and how he's complaining about mainstream media getting it wrong.

284
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,420
All his questions are terrible, and no one on mainstream media should be asking them

285
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,020
because there is no real evidence to support anything they're alleging.

286
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,620
And yet they're still the ones fact-checking Scarbage because people like him are spreading it out there.

287
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,420
But Jose, you may be saying, these are questions from over a week ago.

288
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,380
What about all these other new questions Crowder is asking?

289
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,940
If you're genuinely wondering that right now, you've missed the entire point of this video.

290
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,340
An infinite number of questions can be generated about any controversy.

291
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,340
You just find video or statements that could be considered ambiguous

292
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,420
and frame it as if it were part of some kind of grand conspiracy.

293
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,140
If you truly have evidence of voter fraud, you wouldn't need to ask questions.

294
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,540
You would just present the evidence.

295
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,380
The consequences for him being so wrong and spreading misinformation,

296
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,780
something he does on a regular basis,

297
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,900
he has a YouTube channel of 5 million subscribers and works with Glenn Beck's Blaze Media.

298
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,180
But he wants you to think he's the one being persecuted,

299
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,500
all while advancing Republican talking points and furthering the political agenda of the right.

300
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,380
It's a nice grift if you can get it.

301
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,620
And also sleep at night knowing that this is how you make a living.

302
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,340
If you take a quick look at my sources below, you'll notice that they come from a wide range

303
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,260
of outlets, big international ones and others are small local ones.

304
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,660
If you still think Crowder's claims have some validity, ask yourself this question.

305
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,180
What's more likely?

306
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,460
That dozens of different media outlets from across the United States, and in some cases

307
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,260
other parts of the world, are working in tandem to hide all evidence of this election being

308
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,460
tampered with via sharpies and mysterious red wagons?

309
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,740
Or is Steven Crowder full of crap and trying to cast out on an election with no real evidence?

310
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,500
And because I'm not a coward and actually brought real evidence,

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,380
I'll tell you the answer.

312
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,740
Steven Crowder is full of crap.

313
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,620
Originally, this video was about right-wing media more broadly,

314
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,540
and I had examples from Dave Rubin, Tim Pool pushing conspiracy theories.

315
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:31,140
But this Steven Crowder stream just encapsulated so much madness that I had to dive right into it.

316
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,660
If you're interested in seeing more right-wing conspiracy theory nonsense debunked,

317
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,300
I highly recommend some of the articles linked below.

318
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,780
But if you like my work, which is making these YouTube videos,

319
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,020
you can join my Patreon by following the link below in the description box,

320
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:54,100
or you can get a membership for my YouTube channel by clicking the join button just below this video.

321
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,940
It'll give you early access to videos, a download link to my theme song,

322
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,820
and best of all, your name in the credits like these very lovely people.

323
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,180
If you're not in a position to do anything financially or you just don't want to spend

324
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,380
anything, you can still like this video, leave a comment, subscribe if you haven't already,

325
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,500
and hit the bell if you want to be notified of all my comings and goings on my YouTube channel.

326
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,300
You can also follow me on Twitter, that's a thing.

327
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,220
Thank you so much for watching.
