00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
In March of 2018, the Roseanne TV series was revived for a tenth season,

00:05.040 --> 00:10.080
picking up the exploits of the Connor family 20 years after the series' original finale.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.840
We all know what happened a few months later. Roseanne made a racist tweet,

00:13.840 --> 00:18.480
the show was immediately cancelled, and we were dragged into a hail of anger and fury.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.960
What was lost in the noise, though, was the show itself, and for all the outreach over Roseanne

00:22.960 --> 00:27.600
being fired, there wasn't much discussion about the tenth season of her show and what it was all

00:27.600 --> 00:32.560
about, or what the preceding nine seasons were about for that matter. Roseanne was a free speech

00:32.560 --> 00:37.280
martyr for the right, despite starring in a show that had much to say from the left.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.880
I think it's important to acknowledge that a TV show is a collaborative effort,

00:40.880 --> 00:44.640
comprising the work of hundreds of people. While you can't discount the person who

00:44.640 --> 00:49.360
is divorced behind it, you also can't treat the two as synonymous. That said,

00:49.360 --> 00:53.120
I can't completely discount the words and actions of Roseanne Barr,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.920
specifically when it comes to how she put her show together.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.080
So if you enjoy watching someone wrestle with whether or not art can be untangled from the

01:00.080 --> 01:02.240
artist, you're going to have some fun in this video.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.080
This story starts back in the late 1980s. The Roseanne show started as the vague idea of a

01:14.080 --> 01:19.440
series starring a working-class woman from producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Wartner. The

01:19.440 --> 01:23.360
pair had recently helped create the Cosby Show for NBC. They planned on creating this

01:23.360 --> 01:28.320
working-class series with a writer from the Cosby Show, Matt Williams, this time for rival network

01:28.320 --> 01:34.000
ABC. At the same time, one of the hottest rising stars in the stand-up comedy world was a woman

01:34.000 --> 01:39.600
named Roseanne Barr. Originally from Salt Lake City, she began a career performing stand-up across

01:39.600 --> 01:44.800
Colorado, drawing from her life as a wife and mother of three children. Often referring to

01:44.800 --> 01:50.800
herself as a domestic goddess, Barr's work was charged with a fighting attitude that immediately

01:50.800 --> 01:55.920
made her a star. A tape of her stand-up found its way into the hands of Mitzi Shore, owner of the

01:55.920 --> 02:01.520
fabled Los Angeles Comedy Club, the Comedy Store. Roseanne Barr's appearance at the Comedy Store

02:01.520 --> 02:07.120
led to an appearance on The Tonight Show, a national tour, and an HBO special. Barr was the

02:07.120 --> 02:12.880
perfect fit for the new Carsey Wartner sitcom. This all happened in the space of about five years.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.800
And so the Roseanne show was born. Almost.

02:20.800 --> 02:28.320
One of the inescapable facts about talking about the Roseanne show is that you cannot escape

02:28.320 --> 02:34.240
talking about the backstage drama, and it began even before the first episode aired. The first

02:34.240 --> 02:40.240
major conflict was between Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams. Originally, the first draft

02:40.240 --> 02:46.320
for the pilot episode was for a show titled Life and Stuff, which focused on the stories of three

02:46.320 --> 02:52.160
women. A married woman with kids, a divorced woman with a kid, and a childless single woman,

02:52.160 --> 02:57.920
all working at a factory in Indiana, something taken from Williams's personal background.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.560
When Barr entered the project, she reshaped the series entirely, including changing the name of

03:02.560 --> 03:08.000
the series to Roseanne, and having her character, the married woman with children, be the focal

03:08.000 --> 03:13.200
point for the series. According to Barr, the reason Williams hadn't made her the star of the series was

03:13.200 --> 03:18.160
because Williams had told her, I just don't think people would like you as the main character.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.760
Speaking to the LA Times in 1989, Williams gave full credit to Roseanne Barr for the character

03:23.760 --> 03:28.160
Roseanne Connor, who she played on the show. He also credits her with bringing a feminist

03:28.160 --> 03:32.960
perspective to the series, but the official credit for creating the show, as decided by

03:32.960 --> 03:39.280
the Screenwriters Guild, would still go to Williams. This infuriated Barr. The pilot was

03:39.280 --> 03:44.240
rewritten with the series now named Roseanne, and Life and Stuff was dropped to the episode

03:44.240 --> 03:48.640
title, and Roseanne Connor would be the focus of the show now, with the other two women being

03:48.640 --> 03:54.480
devoted to the supporting cast as her sister Jackie and friend Crystal. An unproven actress,

03:54.480 --> 03:59.760
the producers chose to surround Roseanne Barr with experienced actors. Although Barr had originally

03:59.760 --> 04:04.560
wanted her comedian friend Tom Arnold to play her husband on the show, the role was instead given

04:04.560 --> 04:09.680
to John Goodman. The chemistry between Goodman and Barr was instantaneous, and he was chosen

04:09.680 --> 04:15.840
to be Dan Connor within moments of his audition beginning. I pump those brakes to make sure they

04:15.840 --> 04:22.720
grab. If they don't grab, I ruin the guy in front of me. I get a ticket. Our insurance premiums go

04:22.720 --> 04:28.480
up. We go broke trying to pay them. Our children end up in a poor house. We starve. That's why I

04:28.480 --> 04:34.000
pump the brakes. Okay, well, just tell me one thing. What? Why do you pump the brakes?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.120
You know, Rosie.

04:45.600 --> 04:51.600
The pair had instant chemistry, and the character of Dan Connor was born. Another major addition

04:51.600 --> 04:57.120
to the cast was Laurie Metcalf, chosen for the role of Jackie Harris, Roseanne Connor's sister.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.520
In a cast of talented actors, Metcalf was the only one to win multiple Emmys,

05:01.520 --> 05:07.920
with three wins for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series from 1992 to 1994.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.200
The Connor family was completed with Alicia Lacey Gorenson as eldest daughter Becky,

05:13.200 --> 05:17.920
Sarah Gilbert as middle child Darlene, and Michael Fishman as the youngest Connor kid,

05:17.920 --> 05:23.840
David Jacob, or DJ. A few regulars would join the cast, such as Roseanne's friend Crystal,

05:23.840 --> 05:29.600
played by Natalie West, and Roseanne's sometimes boss and Jackie's sometimes romantic interest,

05:29.600 --> 05:35.600
Booker Brooks, played by George Clooney. Yes, that George Clooney. At the center of this cast

05:35.600 --> 05:40.480
was Roseanne Barr, playing Roseanne Connor, an abrasive working-class woman who held her family

05:40.480 --> 05:47.680
together with love, humor, and grit. I'll do everything else like I always do. I'll have to

05:47.680 --> 05:51.600
get off work an hour early, lose an hour's pay, totally rearrange my whole schedule,

05:54.080 --> 06:00.480
but I don't mind. Unlike sitcoms of an earlier era, this wasn't a household run by a father who

06:00.480 --> 06:05.040
knew best, but a mother who knew better, and the first episode set the stage for a series that

06:05.040 --> 06:09.920
would bring an American audience new perspectives on the working class, feminism, and what it meant

06:10.000 --> 06:17.840
to fight for everything you've got. A guy is a lump like this donut. Okay, so first you gotta

06:17.840 --> 06:26.320
get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap

06:26.320 --> 06:33.440
that they pick up from the beer commercial. And then there's my personal favorite, the male ego.

06:33.440 --> 06:42.960
The first episode establishes our working-class family, and from the very beginning you can tell

06:42.960 --> 06:49.040
this won't be like other shows. Roseanne isn't this sweet, put-together mother of other sitcoms.

06:49.040 --> 06:55.440
She's loud, has a sharp tongue, and is rather heavy set. In other words, she's the exact sort

06:55.440 --> 07:00.880
of person you wouldn't expect to see as the star of a primetime sitcom. Roseanne Connor works full

07:00.880 --> 07:05.200
time in a plastics factory, but her second shift starts when she gets home, holding together her

07:05.200 --> 07:10.480
household as a working mother. Her husband, Dan, doesn't do much to help out around the house when

07:10.480 --> 07:15.600
he's off work from his struggling drywalling business. The kids are loud, bratty, and talk

07:15.600 --> 07:22.480
back to their parents. In 2018, this isn't particularly groundbreaking stuff, but in 1988

07:22.480 --> 07:28.000
this was far less common. Families were happy little units on TV, like you might see on shows

07:28.000 --> 07:33.600
such as Full House or Growing Pains. On those shows, the teasing was gentler, and parents didn't

07:33.600 --> 07:38.640
treat their kids like annoying brats. Perhaps most importantly, we were being invited to laugh

07:38.640 --> 07:44.240
alongside the Conners, rather than at them, as an audience might do instead to other shows depicting

07:44.240 --> 07:48.960
the working class, such as Married with Children. And look at the aesthetics of this show. The

07:48.960 --> 07:53.840
Conners dress poorly, their food is shitty, and their furniture doesn't match. These aren't the

07:53.840 --> 07:58.320
proper homes you might see on other shows depicting a happy middle class. These are firmly

07:58.320 --> 08:03.200
working class people. In the first episode we get a sense of what money means to the Connor clan

08:03.200 --> 08:10.400
when Darlene gets in trouble for barking in class. Your daughter barks. Our whole family barks!

08:11.920 --> 08:17.040
Roseanne has to plead with Booker for some time off, and when she does loses part of her paycheck.

08:17.040 --> 08:22.480
To the Conners, money is always a major concern. Not for luxuries or greed, but to pay for the

08:22.560 --> 08:27.200
basics of what they need to survive. The struggle of holding the family together has real consequences

08:27.200 --> 08:31.840
too, as Roseanne and Dan constantly argue from gentle teasing to full-on fights.

08:31.840 --> 08:52.960
But the episode closes with Darlene getting hurt, and both parents springing to action to help her.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.280
This encapsulates so much of what the show is about, a working class family being stretched

08:57.280 --> 09:01.360
thin by economic demands, only held together by the love they have for one another.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.760
The Conners have to hold on to each other to survive in a society where working class people,

09:05.760 --> 09:11.840
and women in particular, are being worked to the bone. It's a damning critique of 1980s America,

09:11.840 --> 09:18.080
and in 2018 it still holds some resonance. By the end of its first season, it would be the second

09:18.080 --> 09:23.440
highest rated show on television, right behind the Cosby Show. The feminism of the first season is

09:23.440 --> 09:28.400
also in sharp display, particularly the episode Nightmare on Oak Street, which featured what has

09:28.400 --> 09:34.160
now become a sitcom cliché, Darlene getting her first period. An especially interesting choice,

09:34.160 --> 09:39.040
considering Darlene was very much the tomboy of the family, and this step into womanhood created

09:39.040 --> 09:43.920
a struggle with how she saw herself and how the world expected her to behave as a woman.

09:58.400 --> 10:10.400
We even get some pushback against toxic masculinity in the episode

10:10.400 --> 10:16.000
Dan's Birthday Bash, where Roseanne demands Dan not get into a fight with some asshole at a bar

10:16.000 --> 10:37.760
on his birthday. Roseanne and Dan end up having a frank conversation about getting older

10:37.760 --> 10:40.640
and a vision of manhood that doesn't involve fighting people.

10:46.000 --> 11:06.320
I really liked how in this episode, Roseanne's birthday gift to Dan is an anchor. The symbolism

11:06.320 --> 11:10.880
would be damning if it weren't for the fact that the anchor is for Dan's pet project, building a

11:10.880 --> 11:16.560
boat in their garage. A superficial reading here has the anchor tying Dan down and limiting his

11:16.560 --> 11:21.760
freedom, but a deeper understanding shows you that this anchor is in some ways what Dan has always

11:21.760 --> 11:27.280
wanted. A disappointing twist to this episode, and one of the first real signs that this show

11:27.280 --> 11:32.640
is of its time, is that Dan ends up going back to the bar towards the end of the episode and

11:32.640 --> 11:38.480
beating up the asshole anyway. His violence is a product of its time, and an example of how,

11:38.480 --> 11:43.760
as progressive as Roseanne was, it's still a show from 30 years ago, and there are certain

11:43.760 --> 11:49.440
artifacts that don't age well. Here's another example. In the episode Lovers Lane, Booker and

11:49.440 --> 11:57.200
Jackie have a friendly bet. If I win, then you have to spend the night in my place. What if you win?

11:58.320 --> 12:04.080
Then you spend the night in my place. Sounds good. Scrubbing my bathroom.

12:04.080 --> 12:12.160
Alright, whatever gets you in the mood. Is that a bet? Yeah. Yeah.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.800
I assume Booker means he wants to have sex with Jackie and not stay up reading the Bible together.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.560
The episode makes it clear that they're both attracted to each other, but we still

12:20.560 --> 12:26.800
get these vaguely, to be honest, rapey vibes. Would you really want me there against my will?

12:26.800 --> 12:35.360
Absolutely. Booker does redeem himself. Not on a bet. Not tonight, and not on a bet.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.400
But it's still not the sort of thing I'd imagine many guys saying while flirting with someone.

12:46.400 --> 12:52.720
Not a guy who isn't a complete scumbag. As we'll see even more pointedly as we go through the

12:52.720 --> 12:57.200
series, Roseanne is a show that does a lot of good things, but never completely escapes the

12:57.200 --> 13:02.720
context of its time. And for a modern audience to appreciate it, or get anything out of it,

13:02.720 --> 13:07.440
it's important to keep that in mind. While halfway through the first season,

13:07.440 --> 13:12.240
the show seemed to be sailing along smoothly, behind the scenes things were starting to reach

13:12.240 --> 13:16.480
a breaking point. While filming the fourth episode, Roseanne Barr was outraged that her

13:16.480 --> 13:21.360
wardrobe requests were the only ones being ignored. According to Barr herself, she took a

13:21.360 --> 13:26.000
pair of scissors, went to one of the producers responsible, and threatened her saying,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.920
Bitch, do you want me to cut you? Barr also kept a prominently displayed list in her office that

13:31.920 --> 13:37.120
had a title reading, These are the people who are going to be fired if they're not nice to me.

13:37.120 --> 13:44.160
People who I am the boss of. Everybody. All producers, all writers, all subject to change.

13:44.960 --> 13:50.480
She updated the list regularly. Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams continued to feud behind the

13:50.480 --> 13:56.000
scenes, with Barr often refusing to read lines. Barr gave the executive producers an ultimatum.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.640
It was her or Williams. One of them had to go. An agreement was reached with Williams,

14:02.640 --> 14:09.600
and by episode 13, he left the show forever. One of the ideas credited to Williams was the setting

14:09.600 --> 14:14.880
of a plastics factory, where Roseanne, Jackie, and Crystal worked. This artifact of his tenure

14:14.880 --> 14:20.160
would only last until the end of the first season, but not before providing a great season finale.

14:20.640 --> 14:27.120
In Let's Call It Quits, tensions at the workplace boil over when Booker is replaced by Keith Faber,

14:27.120 --> 14:32.800
a hard-ass boss played by former diehard villain and Republican presidential nominee hopeful,

14:32.800 --> 14:37.760
Fred Thompson. He not only applies harsh work quotas, he also picks on his employees.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.680
Will you hold this for a minute? Honey, I'm not here to hold.

14:42.720 --> 14:49.040
I'm here to supervise. And in particular, he wants to break Roseanne Connor.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.200
Now, my brother has this dairy farm. You know, some of those cows take the

14:55.760 --> 14:57.760
milk and ride off. Some of them take a little longer.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.080
Every once in a while, you run across a real stubborn. But you know what?

15:05.360 --> 15:08.880
Sooner or later, they all give milk.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.680
Eventually, Faber breaks Roseanne, getting her to agree to show him some respect

15:15.680 --> 15:17.600
in exchange for lower work quotas.

15:45.680 --> 15:58.000
Yes. Yes, what?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.080
Yes, we have a deal.

16:00.080 --> 16:06.400
Sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.240
But quotas still go back up.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.920
So what are you raising our quotas to?

16:21.920 --> 16:26.000
Nothing you girls can't handle. We're going to try 8,000 again.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.320
And I have every confidence that you girls can cut the mustard.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.920
And if you can't, then nice working with you.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.240
In the final scene of the season, not counting a post-credits scene, Roseanne leads a walkout.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.320
You okay, sis?

16:42.320 --> 16:47.840
No, I'm not okay. I mean, I tried to be okay, but he doesn't want me to be okay.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.200
He doesn't want any of us to be okay. You know why? Because he's not okay.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.480
Roseanne, I told you not to walk away from me.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.320
I'm walking away from you, Faber, and I'm walking away from the stick of the factory.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.160
I'm walking away from this lousy job.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.960
Well, that was a wonderful performance, Roseanne.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.760
But if any of you are considering joining her, may I point out there are two doors to this room,

17:10.480 --> 17:14.800
one that pays and one that doesn't.

17:24.480 --> 17:53.840
I guess we're not going to make our quota today.

17:53.840 --> 18:01.200
Honey Bunch.

18:02.240 --> 18:07.280
Roseanne quitting, on her own, would have meant little, but a massive movement of workers

18:07.280 --> 18:15.200
standing together in solidarity? That sounds like the beginning of a real political change.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.920
In season two, Tom Arnold joined the show as a writer.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.680
The controversial decision didn't sit well with the other writers,

18:25.680 --> 18:28.000
who were told to teach him how to write a sitcom.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.440
Safford Vila, a writer for the show at the time, says,

18:32.080 --> 18:35.680
We all thought he was 100% talent free.

18:36.960 --> 18:41.760
Arnold was Barr's man on the inside, as Barr didn't spend too much time in the writer's room,

18:41.760 --> 18:45.600
and she was worried the writers would push her show in a direction she didn't like.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.520
Barr would have a contentious relationship with her writing staff throughout the show's run.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.680
In Vila's mind, it was really just fighting for power in the voice of the show.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.400
This is also the season the show hit number one in the ratings.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.360
After Roseanne Connor left her job at the Plastics Factory,

19:01.360 --> 19:04.720
she took another selling magazine subscriptions over the phone.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.200
She also briefly worked in a salon.

19:07.200 --> 19:12.640
The salon job led Roseanne to confront her boss's boss from the first season, Mrs. Wellman,

19:12.640 --> 19:16.000
the owner of the Plastics Factory Roseanne once worked at.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.440
Mrs. Wellman can't even be bothered to remember Roseanne's name.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.480
The two really collide, if you'll excuse the pun,

19:22.480 --> 19:27.120
in an episode titled Fenderbender, where Mrs. Wellman hits Roseanne with her car.

19:46.000 --> 19:56.880
The Connor family is quick to review their legal options,

19:56.880 --> 20:02.240
but the only lawyer they can afford is apparently this hapless loser played by Stephen Root.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.480
In response to a legal threat, Mrs. Wellman tries to buy her way out.

20:16.800 --> 20:21.520
Mrs. Wellman effectively avoids any threat from the law because she can afford a better attorney.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.280
Once again, the working class are shown at a disadvantage in a system that supposedly

20:25.280 --> 20:29.360
protects them. The two-tiered justice system is a difficult concept to unpack,

20:29.360 --> 20:33.440
but in 20 minutes you can see this little TV episode explain it clearly.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
I also want to highlight this little line.

20:35.440 --> 20:40.880
Even though you no longer work for the company, we still think of you as part of the Wellman family.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.920
I don't suppose my health insurance is still good.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.200
Roseanne needs medical insurance.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.960
The fact that someone hitting you with a car leaves you with a bill is cruel.

20:52.960 --> 21:02.880
The symbolism of it being her former boss who treated her like garbage can't be understated.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.840
Producer for the show Tom Warner arranged to have Roseanne Barr sing the national anthem

21:11.840 --> 21:26.720
at a San Diego Padres game on July 25th, 1990. This is what it sounded like.

21:26.720 --> 21:44.560
People were unimpressed. There was enough backlash to get Barr to stop touring,

21:44.560 --> 21:50.480
and the president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, called it disgraceful. Although the

21:50.480 --> 21:54.960
national anthem disaster would have slowed down other shows, that wasn't the case for season 3.

21:54.960 --> 21:59.280
It premiered with strong ratings, continuing the trend of being viewed by over 20 million

21:59.280 --> 22:04.560
Americans every week, and like a virgin, the topic of sexuality and birth control comes up.

22:24.960 --> 22:34.320
It's a difficult subject to talk about, not just because it's centered on sex,

22:34.320 --> 22:37.360
but because it's specifically about female sexuality.

22:54.960 --> 23:17.360
Why do women feel the need to downplay their sexual history around men?

23:17.360 --> 23:22.560
The opposite is rarely true. It speaks to the old-fashioned attitudes of Roseanne and Dan's

23:22.560 --> 23:23.840
generation.

23:52.560 --> 24:15.440
This is a nice demonstration of how social change isn't something that happens overnight,

24:15.440 --> 24:21.520
but rather is a generational thing. On the theme of teenage sex, season 3 also sees the introduction

24:21.680 --> 24:28.960
of Mark, played by Glenn Quinn in Becky, Beds, and Boys. This episode also establishes Roseanne's

24:28.960 --> 24:34.640
new job, working as a waitress at a mall restaurant. Season 3 also introduced Leon,

24:34.640 --> 24:39.840
Roseanne's boss at the restaurant played by Martin Mall, and the episode Dances with Darlene,

24:39.840 --> 24:42.000
we find out something interesting about Leon.

24:51.520 --> 25:10.400
Although he's certainly not the first gay character to appear on a sitcom,

25:10.400 --> 25:15.520
Leon is one of the few who wasn't a cheap stereotype. Back in season 2, the episode

25:15.520 --> 25:20.960
Born to Be Wild introduced an old friend of Dan and Roseanne, Ziggy, played by J.O. Sanders.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.040
It was a good episode where Dan and Roseanne confront the rebellious past and see how they've

25:31.040 --> 25:36.160
been fit into their less-dramatic present. It ends with Ziggy helping Dan restore his old bike.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.280
Roseanne and Dan holding onto their past in some ways explains what informs this show,

25:41.280 --> 25:46.000
the rebellion of the 60s, and activism that, at the time of the show's airing,

25:46.000 --> 25:51.280
is already 20 years behind the times. This isn't to say something still can't be learned,

25:51.280 --> 25:56.880
but the romance of the past can create blind spots for the present. Ziggy embodies a romanticized

25:56.880 --> 26:01.520
version of their past. In season 3, Ziggy makes a return with an opportunity for the present.

26:11.280 --> 26:21.360
With some of Ziggy's backing and a second mortgage on the house,

26:21.360 --> 26:24.160
it looks like it's going to happen, but Ziggy gets cold feet.

26:41.280 --> 26:54.240
Ziggy, in this episode, is a counterpoint to what I said earlier about romanticizing the past.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.320
He's shown to be a coward. He lacks the maturity that can make a dream attainable,

26:58.320 --> 27:02.400
even if he does stumble into the means. The friendship ends poorly.

27:11.280 --> 27:24.880
And while Dan doesn't want to give up on his dream, even if he has to do it solo,

27:24.880 --> 27:30.240
the economic reality of his situation is that even risking everything isn't risking enough.

27:30.800 --> 27:35.040
This isn't the only time we've seen the Conners want to roll the dice for a better future,

27:35.040 --> 27:39.280
but a running theme of this series is that working class people can be screwed over by

27:39.280 --> 27:44.240
the many sad facts of their realities, many of them not of their own making. But maybe not this

27:44.240 --> 27:48.720
time. During the credits Darlene finds an envelope on the fridge, Ziggy's share of the investment

27:48.720 --> 27:54.400
money gifted to his former friend. It's a sweet gesture, and one that gives Dan the chance to

27:54.400 --> 27:59.840
chase his dream in the next season. How exactly do other working class people get an angel investor

27:59.840 --> 28:04.720
like this? Although that's kind of a useless question because this blessing will just give

28:04.720 --> 28:08.640
us further lessons on why it sucks to be working class in America.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.080
One of the major threads through season four is Darlene's battle with depression.

28:18.080 --> 28:24.000
In the season's fourth episode, Darlene fades to black, we're greeted with a despondent Darlene,

28:24.000 --> 28:30.160
shed of her tomboyish persona, and instead now a couch-dwelling misanthrope. What's telling about

28:30.160 --> 28:36.320
this is that there's no trauma, no sudden major life event, no crippling moment of realization.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.760
We just see Darlene, and she's depressed.

28:50.320 --> 28:54.240
Rosanne and Dan are at a loss on how to cope with her daughter's new depression.

29:00.160 --> 29:12.400
The episode ends without any touching family moment or chance for Darlene to recover.

29:12.400 --> 29:17.680
Depression isn't solved so easily. This is yet another way the Rosanne show departed from other

29:17.680 --> 29:23.120
sitcoms. Problems weren't solved at the end of every episode. Things didn't always magically

29:23.120 --> 29:29.200
get better with a heart-to-heart conversation with a loving parent. In this episode, mental

29:29.200 --> 29:34.800
illness and invisible invader shows up in their lives, and they're completely incapable of handling

29:34.800 --> 29:50.160
it. By the next episode, Darlene seems to be somewhat back to normal.

29:50.160 --> 29:57.440
But the black clothes she started wearing remain.

29:58.160 --> 30:02.720
Much like the way depression works in real life, there are good days and there are bad ones.

30:03.520 --> 30:09.600
A few episodes later, Thanksgiving 91, Darlene has a bad day. We get a few touching scenes that

30:09.600 --> 30:13.920
show how Darlene's parents are still reaching out to her. They won't give up on their daughter.

30:20.560 --> 30:49.360
Confronted with Darlene's pain, we see what any

30:49.360 --> 30:54.480
parents would do. They try to comfort her in any way they can, but perhaps more telling is how

30:54.480 --> 31:00.320
ill-equipped they are to do it. The word depression is rarely used in these episodes, as if the

31:00.320 --> 31:06.160
vocabulary of mental illness is out of their reach. In later episodes, this period in Darlene's life

31:06.160 --> 31:17.520
would be referred to as her mood. For a working class family like the Connors, they literally

31:17.520 --> 31:23.280
don't have the language to explain Darlene's problem. It may be generational, a class issue,

31:23.280 --> 31:28.400
or just an overall social ignorance about depression in 1991, but it's another sign

31:28.400 --> 31:32.160
of how the Connors are out of touch with what their kids need in a modern world.

31:32.720 --> 31:37.920
But it isn't for a lack of caring, but rather a painful reality of the limitations of what it

31:37.920 --> 31:42.800
means to be a parent and how being working class makes parenting that much harder. They can't

31:42.800 --> 31:48.320
afford to send Darlene to a therapist or fall back on some sort of post-secondary education

31:48.320 --> 31:53.200
to inform them of what's happening. They have to make do with what they've got, and what they've

31:53.200 --> 31:59.840
got, sadly, isn't quite enough. Although he was called Kevin in his first appearance, the episode

31:59.840 --> 32:05.520
The Bowling Show brought Johnny Galecki into the cast as Mark's younger brother, eventually named

32:05.520 --> 32:10.240
David. He would go on to be a major player, not just in Darlene's life as a love interest,

32:10.240 --> 32:15.440
but in the Connor household in general. Season four ends with the episode Aliens,

32:15.440 --> 32:20.880
which brings with it a reckoning on the challenges of being a working class parent in the early 90s.

32:20.880 --> 32:25.040
More so than the struggles with their daughters' sex lives and mental health, the Connors have

32:25.040 --> 32:29.760
always struggled with providing for their family. While the Connor kids can expect the basics of

32:29.760 --> 32:33.520
food, clothing, and shelter, what about the opportunity to have a better life than their

32:33.520 --> 32:39.280
parents? The two main threads of this episode are DJ competing in, and eventually winning,

32:39.280 --> 32:45.360
a spelling bee. And the other, more important one is Dan's bike shop, funded at the end of season

32:45.360 --> 32:51.280
three, is now shutting down. Dan just couldn't get it to work out, and Becky is learning the ugly

32:51.280 --> 32:59.200
truth. Please tell me there's a college fund. Well, there was, but... So even if I get into

32:59.200 --> 33:08.640
these schools, I can't afford to go? Becky, it has been a really bad year. I can't believe this.

33:08.640 --> 33:13.840
I mean, we may not have exactly been able to spoil her, but she still had it pretty good.

33:15.520 --> 33:21.600
As good as we wanted her to. The episode tries to wrap things up in a happy ending of sorts,

33:21.600 --> 33:27.120
but season five won't be leaving this thread alone. And perhaps the one true victory of this

33:27.120 --> 33:32.640
episode, the credits scene features the character Arnie being abducted by aliens, forever ensuring

33:32.640 --> 33:37.600
that Tom Arnold will not appear on the show. I've spared you clips of this guy as much as I could

33:37.600 --> 33:42.400
throughout this video, but this marks a good fucking riddance to the worst part of the Rose

33:42.400 --> 33:49.040
Dan show. The man was a comedy black hole, sucking in any and all humor that surrounded him into an

33:49.040 --> 33:59.520
endless, unfunny void of misery. Season five opens up with terms of estrangement, a two-parter that's

33:59.520 --> 34:04.880
one of my favorites. Dan is forced to close down his bike shop, proving that dream of pulling

34:04.880 --> 34:09.680
yourself up by your own bootstraps is an illusion. Your mother and I have decided to close the bike

34:09.680 --> 34:16.480
shop. We're going on a business sale and locking the doors on Friday. And I don't have a job,

34:16.480 --> 34:21.760
so that means no income. When Dan has to fire Becky's boyfriend, Mark, who had been helping

34:21.760 --> 34:26.800
at the shop, Mark quickly lands on his feet and is offered a new job. Only it's in another state,

34:26.800 --> 34:33.600
which means he would have to leave Becky. This leads to a scene where Becky tears Dan to fucking

34:33.600 --> 34:35.600
pieces.

35:03.600 --> 35:26.720
The episode ends with Becky and Mark running off to Minnesota to elope.

35:27.600 --> 35:32.080
The next episode picks up with Becky returning home to pick up her belongings. Since leaving

35:32.080 --> 35:34.720
home, Dan has been unable to speak to his daughter.

36:02.080 --> 36:25.840
But it isn't that Dan is mad at Becky so much as that he's upset with himself.

36:32.080 --> 37:01.680
The episode ends with Becky departing, but instead of that last minute tearful goodbye,

37:02.080 --> 37:07.840
Dan can't bear to face his daughter. Once again we don't get an easy resolution,

37:07.840 --> 37:12.160
and there is a heavy emphasis on parents failing their children. In this case,

37:12.160 --> 37:16.320
it's Dan being unable to provide for his daughter because he took a gamble and tried to start a

37:16.320 --> 37:22.240
business. While a crueler interpretation would say Dan is a bad businessman and deserves failure,

37:22.240 --> 37:27.280
the real question is, does Becky deserve to be punished because of that? Does a thoughtful,

37:27.280 --> 37:31.920
academically successful young woman not deserve the chance to better her life with a higher

37:31.920 --> 37:38.160
education because her father made a bad business decision? Rich people make bad business decisions

37:38.160 --> 37:43.680
every day, sometimes losing more money in a day than Dan Connor lost in the year he ran his bike

37:43.680 --> 37:49.520
shop. They can afford to screw up. Dan Connor can't. This illustrates the bind of the working

37:49.520 --> 37:53.840
class that even when you have the chance to make something of your life, if you make a mistake,

37:53.840 --> 37:57.520
you don't just let yourself down, you could potentially let your whole family down.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.000
Dan and Becky patching things up was inevitable. They had a good relationship,

38:02.000 --> 38:07.840
not so easily discarded over a failure. But will Becky's life ever recover? Will she be able to

38:07.840 --> 38:12.160
go back to school and make something of the future she dreamed of herself? We won't be finding out

38:12.160 --> 38:17.760
for a while because in season 5, Alicia Gorinson, the actress who played Becky, left the show.

38:17.760 --> 38:21.280
The reason for Gorinson's departure was not, as you might have guessed,

38:21.280 --> 38:26.000
fleeing in terror from Roseanne. She went to pursue an education at Vassar College,

38:26.000 --> 38:30.640
although the Becky Connor character wouldn't exactly leave the show with Gorinson's departure,

38:30.640 --> 38:35.920
but more on that in season 6. Season 5 brought with it one last major employment change for

38:35.920 --> 38:41.280
Roseanne Connor. In looking for loans in all the wrong places, Roseanne, Jackie, and their friend

38:41.280 --> 38:46.800
Nancy, played by Sandra Bernhardt, open a diner serving loose meat sandwiches. While that might

38:46.800 --> 38:51.680
seem outrageous, coming off the heels of Dan having to sell his bike shop, the money for starting

38:51.680 --> 38:56.880
the business mostly comes from Roseanne and Jackie's mother, Bev, played by Estelle Parsons.

38:56.880 --> 39:01.280
It's a small crime, I haven't mentioned her until now. She had been playing Beverly Harris

39:01.280 --> 39:05.680
in special guest spots since season 1. She never quite becomes a regular member of the cast,

39:05.680 --> 39:09.840
but she's a constant figure, appearing in several episodes throughout each season.

39:21.680 --> 39:36.480
Through a combination of a gift and a loan, Roseanne is able to start a business of her own.

39:36.480 --> 39:40.720
This is yet another chance afforded the Conners to make more of their situation. I don't want to

39:40.720 --> 39:45.040
dive too much into this episode, but it's telling that the opportunities the Conners get to reshape

39:45.040 --> 39:50.080
their lives often come from external help, almost as if the show is saying that the only way working

39:50.080 --> 39:55.120
class people can get out of their situation is with some help from the outside, rather than the

39:55.120 --> 40:01.120
whole fabled bootstrap method that has already been thoroughly undermined in earlier episodes.

40:01.120 --> 40:07.280
A major plotline in season 5 is the introduction of Fisher. The name even gives me chills now.

40:07.280 --> 40:11.360
Played by Matt Roth, the eventual real-life husband of Laurie Metcalf,

40:11.360 --> 40:16.160
Fisher was introduced as Jackie's love interest in the episode titled Mommy Nearest.

40:16.160 --> 40:24.640
All we really know about Fisher at first is that he's young.

40:24.640 --> 40:28.560
The truth about Fisher comes out halfway through the season in Crime and Punishment, and as a

40:28.560 --> 40:34.240
content warning, these next few scenes include some very wrenching depictions of an abuse victim,

40:34.240 --> 40:37.440
so fair warning that you might want to skip ahead to the time written below.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.920
One afternoon, when Jackie arrives at Roseanne's house to go out for dinner,

40:41.920 --> 40:46.640
after Roseanne urges Jackie to change her shirt, her bruises are discovered by Darlene.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.000
And the truth comes out.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.520
You don't understand.

41:41.920 --> 42:07.360
When Dan learns the truth, he takes action and faces the consequences.

42:12.880 --> 42:22.320
It's interesting to contrast the reactions of Dan and Roseanne.

42:22.880 --> 42:26.400
Roseanne's impulse is to care for her sister and get her to a hospital.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.320
Dan's impulse is to beat the shit out of Fisher.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.840
The following episode, War and Peace,

42:33.840 --> 42:37.680
sees Dan getting out of jail where he's confronted by a confused Jackie.

42:41.920 --> 43:01.760
This moment displays the struggle within Jackie, desperate for support, but not the kind Dan offers

43:01.760 --> 43:07.280
her. She feels shame, confusion, and sadness in a way that makes the situation so hard for her to

43:07.280 --> 43:10.640
process. She later considers going back to Fisher.

43:11.360 --> 43:38.480
Jackie and Fisher eventually meet,

43:39.360 --> 43:41.360
when another awful truth comes out.

43:41.360 --> 44:09.280
And in what is the most important part of the episode, Jackie is faced with a decision.

44:11.360 --> 44:29.200
These episodes speak so clearly on their own,

44:29.200 --> 44:33.040
but I want to highlight the difference between the various reactions to helping Jackie.

44:33.040 --> 44:38.560
Roseanne and Dan do what they can, as best they can in their own ways, but ultimately,

44:38.560 --> 44:43.360
it's a story about how Jackie finds the real power to solve her problems. It speaks to how often

44:43.360 --> 44:47.120
the best way to help someone out of an abusive relationship isn't to fight their battles for

44:47.120 --> 44:52.560
them, but to support and empower them so they can make the right choices. Done poorly, this episode

44:52.560 --> 44:57.120
could have just been Jackie having to pull herself up by her bootstraps and stand up to an abusive

44:57.120 --> 45:01.040
asshole, but instead we get a story of a victim who needs some port from those around her so she

45:01.040 --> 45:05.440
can make a positive change in her life. It's precisely why instead of blaming victims for

45:05.440 --> 45:10.640
getting into their situations or not being able to fix them, it's more productive to empower them

45:10.640 --> 45:15.840
so they can actually make a change in their life for the better. In the middle of season 5, feeding

45:15.840 --> 45:20.880
the monster, A Week in the Life of Roseanne aired on the BBC in the UK. It was a behind-the-scenes

45:20.880 --> 45:26.320
look at the production of The Roseanne Show. If we had any doubt on whether or not this is a

45:26.320 --> 45:28.720
left-wing show, here's a telling clip.

45:35.840 --> 45:42.080
Left also. That's true. That's very true. And there they were left out. Yeah, left and left out.

45:42.080 --> 45:47.920
All unemployed guys. We also get a sense of what Roseanne thinks of her own show. And it's not

45:47.920 --> 45:53.840
only anti-television, it's totally anti-media and then they don't get that neither because that's

45:53.840 --> 45:58.960
who they are until finally I'm talking about television itself which I did last in last week's

45:58.960 --> 46:03.360
episode that aired, which I thought was great. I was actually talking about the horrible things

46:03.360 --> 46:08.880
television has taught my generation and I'm doing it on television. I just think that's great.

46:09.520 --> 46:13.680
And perhaps more importantly, there's this revealing clip with one of the show's writers.

46:26.320 --> 46:30.560
And whenever I think of what Roseanne might think of this video I'm making right now,

46:30.560 --> 46:51.520
I think of this moment. As season five closes, there is another exit on the show

46:51.520 --> 46:56.480
in Daughters and Other Strangers. In contrast to Becky settling down with a new husband

46:56.480 --> 47:00.080
and giving up on her dreams of college, Darlene is going to Chicago to attempt

47:00.080 --> 47:03.520
to make something more of her life, something Roseanne can't refuse her.

47:26.480 --> 47:37.120
This is the infamous season where writers had to start wearing shirts with numbers printed on them.

47:37.120 --> 47:42.240
Instead of referring to them by their name, Roseanne Barr would call out their numbers instead.

47:42.240 --> 47:46.720
None of the writers who worked on the show spoke fondly of this new management strategy.

47:47.360 --> 47:53.040
This season also saw Sarah Gilbert going to Yale. Although unlike Gorinson, she remained a part of

47:53.040 --> 47:57.520
the show. Apparently Barr thought she was so essential that a special set was made near Yale

47:57.520 --> 48:02.080
so Gilbert could film her scenes speaking to various characters over the phone. She would

48:02.080 --> 48:06.960
appear with the rest of the cast in a handful of episodes and as a result never officially

48:06.960 --> 48:12.960
left the cast. This season brought with it two very controversial episodes with scenes that were

48:12.960 --> 48:17.440
at the time completely shocking. There's no need for a content warning though,

48:17.440 --> 48:22.160
unless your mind is easily blown by how conservative television was in the 1990s.

48:22.880 --> 48:29.040
The first, a stash from the past, is about, as you might have guessed, marijuana. Roseanne finds

48:29.040 --> 48:35.200
what she thinks is David's stash, only to later be reminded by Dan that it's actually hers.

48:41.680 --> 48:45.120
Roseanne, Dan and Jackie then proceed to smoke up.

48:52.160 --> 48:59.840
The most wonderful, beautiful, sexy, you know, thing.

49:01.440 --> 49:09.840
Somehow, this ranked as number 21 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of Television in 1997.

49:09.840 --> 49:15.280
It's a great example of time capsule activism where a truly groundbreaking act is rather

49:15.280 --> 49:20.880
mundane by today's standards. But really, I only bring up this episode in the context of the next

49:20.880 --> 49:25.200
one, which had a controversial moment that was a lot more than some middle-aged people getting

49:25.200 --> 49:30.640
high. In Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Roseanne is directly confronted on her supposedly pro-gay

49:30.640 --> 49:35.520
stance when it gets right up in her face. Literally, when a friend of Nancy's kisses her...

49:42.240 --> 49:46.000
Although the kiss grabbed all the headlines, this episode was about more than that.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.400
Roseanne has to confront the anxiety she now has when being gay is something she has to wonder

49:50.400 --> 49:54.000
about herself. It leads to an important realization at the end.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
And you're afraid that just one little tiny percent of you might have been turned on by a woman.

50:01.040 --> 50:06.960
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I am not afraid of any small percentage of

50:06.960 --> 50:14.640
my gay-ness inside, you know what I mean? I am totally okay about whether I'm like

50:14.640 --> 50:22.480
three percent or four percent or lower. While an unexpected kiss can be considered sexual assault,

50:22.480 --> 50:27.120
this episode sidesteps the issue by making it non-threatening and uses it as a metaphor,

50:27.680 --> 50:31.360
forcing Roseanne to really test how accepting she is of being gay.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.720
I am not gay!

50:32.720 --> 50:44.560
I didn't mean for that to sound like it was bad or anything, you know, because if I was gay,

50:44.560 --> 50:49.440
that'd be just fine, but I'm not gay. So I just don't like people calling me things that I'm not,

50:49.440 --> 50:52.800
like a hypocrite. I'm not gonna admit I was wrong or anything,

50:52.800 --> 50:56.880
but I just don't want to fight with you anymore, so I was wrong. Thank you.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.720
She realizes she's still uncomfortable with it deep down somewhere,

51:00.720 --> 51:04.960
revealing a degree of homophobia she has towards the idea of being gay herself.

51:05.600 --> 51:10.560
This is an especially powerful episode because it takes a woman who is the hero of the show and a

51:10.560 --> 51:15.200
champion for the downtrodden and revealing that she too has some bigotry in her. Though those

51:15.200 --> 51:20.480
feelings of awkwardness may not be out of hatred or malice, the phobia is very real. It's the fear

51:20.480 --> 51:25.680
of being ostracized by the community and how much easier it is to be an ally than someone with skin

51:25.680 --> 51:30.160
in the game. Because of the lesbian kiss, ABC fought to keep the show from airing.

51:30.160 --> 51:34.000
Arnold and Barr threatened to take the whole series to another network if they didn't air

51:34.000 --> 51:39.360
the episode, and ABC eventually caved, although the episode still ran with a parental warning.

51:39.360 --> 51:44.480
Later on, ABC would say that of the 100 calls they got, 75 were positive.

51:45.040 --> 51:51.200
Another major event of this season is the return of Becky, not Alicia Gorenson. Sarah Chalk,

51:51.200 --> 51:57.040
maybe best known for her work on Scrubs, was cast as The New Becky. Although Gorenson would return

51:57.040 --> 52:01.440
to the role in the later season, the two would still swap depending on how the role could be

52:01.440 --> 52:06.000
scheduled. Another note about season 6, it was during the airing of this season that Roseanne

52:06.000 --> 52:10.560
Barr and Tom Arnold divorced. Their volatile relationship wasn't a secret in the press,

52:10.560 --> 52:20.960
and it was turned into a TV movie by NBC. According to a writer for the series at the time,

52:20.960 --> 52:27.200
Amy Sherman Paladino, this is when things start getting erratic. Season 7 is also the one where

52:27.200 --> 52:31.280
the show finally dropped out of the top 10 most viewed shows in the United States.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.000
It's here where the show drifts heavily into the interpersonal drama. Although it's not as if the

52:42.000 --> 52:46.800
show hasn't always had that be a part of it, but the working class struggles of the Connor family

52:46.800 --> 52:52.000
are starting to feel more distant here. Dan has a steady job with the city, and Roseanne is the part

52:52.000 --> 52:58.160
owner of a restaurant. They aren't on the edge they had walked on before. Part of the show's premise

52:58.160 --> 53:04.080
receded, and it had to rely on the strength of its cast of characters, which can still lead to

53:04.080 --> 53:12.240
fantastic television. In White Men Can't Kiss, we get what might very well be my favorite episode

53:12.240 --> 53:17.680
of the series. The main plotline of the episode kicks off when we find out DJ refuses to take part

53:17.680 --> 53:23.840
in a play where he would have to kiss a girl. Roseanne, sticking up for her son, confronts his

53:23.840 --> 53:27.440
teacher, and then learns that there's more to this story than a bashful boy.

53:42.480 --> 53:46.160
I'm not going to change the entire play because of certain people's values.

53:47.280 --> 53:54.480
Wow, um, I guess if he's forced to kiss somebody, then I don't want him to be in the stupid play.

53:54.480 --> 53:58.160
Where should I put my costume as a sin? Why don't you just put it on the table, Gina?

54:01.600 --> 54:07.440
Uh, that wouldn't be the Gina, would it? Well, you can't tell them apart.

54:07.760 --> 54:13.120
Oh, you thought that that's why DJ didn't want it, and then you thought I knew and that I supported

54:13.120 --> 54:17.600
that. I see a lot of this around here. It always starts with the parents.

54:20.240 --> 54:25.440
This leads to a confrontation at home where Roseanne insists DJ do the play.

54:26.400 --> 54:30.720
What seems to be the truth about the origins of DJ's racism come out.

54:30.720 --> 54:35.920
I think you're being a little too hard on the kid. He grew up in Lanford, it's only 5% black,

54:36.880 --> 54:42.000
and kissing's a new thing for DJ. It's only natural he's not as comfortable kissing a black girl as

54:42.000 --> 54:51.040
one of his own. I did not say that. This leads to an emergency game of poker where Dan invites his

54:51.040 --> 54:59.120
one black friend, Chuck, played by James Pickens Jr., for some guidance. It doesn't go the way you

54:59.120 --> 55:04.400
might expect. I mean, you know, we don't know, he's prejudiced. I mean, the kid is young,

55:04.480 --> 55:08.960
he hasn't had much exposure to other cultures. Other cultures?

55:11.200 --> 55:13.760
Why? Is a black girl from China?

55:16.080 --> 55:21.440
You're saying that it's okay that DJ doesn't want to kiss this girl because she's black? No,

55:21.440 --> 55:28.000
I'm not saying that, but that's what you want me to say. No! Unless you really feel it.

55:29.680 --> 55:33.680
Man, why do you care how I feel so much more than everyone else?

55:34.400 --> 55:35.200
Because I'm black?

55:38.320 --> 55:45.440
Well, yeah. So if I feel okay, all black people feel okay, because we all the same.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.960
I would never say that.

55:46.960 --> 55:50.880
Of course not. Some of your best friends are black.

55:50.880 --> 55:53.600
Yes, you're one of my best friends. That's why you're here.

55:53.600 --> 55:57.760
Okay, then why is Bob here? DJ's got to kiss a dumb girl too? No offense, Bob.

55:58.160 --> 56:05.120
This scene reveals some important information. Most strikingly, that Chuck has been living a

56:05.120 --> 56:11.040
life that the others had no clue about, and Dan's sudden interest in the black experience as a way

56:11.040 --> 56:16.960
of assaging his own anxiety come off as insulting. What makes this such a great scene is Chuck's

56:16.960 --> 56:22.880
refusal to be Dan's guiding star on this. Being his black friend doesn't, and shouldn't, mean

56:22.880 --> 56:28.160
that he has to give Dan permission to be a bigot, or be his guiding light on all things race.

56:28.800 --> 56:34.960
The shame Chuck, as a character, doesn't get more screen time. I am very curious to hear

56:34.960 --> 56:40.000
more of his experiences and what it's like to be one of the only black people in Lanford.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.520
This scene is followed by Dan admitting to his faults and telling DJ he'll have to kiss that girl.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.840
I can't let you get out of this, because that would be wrong.

56:49.840 --> 56:53.840
But I'm afraid of what the other kids will say.

56:53.840 --> 56:59.760
Oh, the other kids? Well, they're going to be extremely jealous, because you're Connor.

57:01.760 --> 57:04.800
And Connor men are known as some of the world's best kissers.

57:09.680 --> 57:10.800
You're okay, I'll do it.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.320
You know, DJ, you're going to kiss a lot of girls in your life, and they're all going to be different.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.520
Well, do you think I should even kiss Lila Matthews?

57:20.640 --> 57:23.600
What's different about her? Well, Ralph says she uses her tongue.

57:28.480 --> 57:29.280
I'd go for it.

57:30.800 --> 57:36.080
And lest you think the show is over, we get another fantastic scene that builds on the idea

57:36.080 --> 57:41.120
that it isn't just Dan's latent racism that's the problem. It's a longer scene,

57:41.120 --> 57:43.840
but it's important to see a large portion of it.

57:43.840 --> 57:48.480
Hello. Hi.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.280
Hi, would you let me in, please?

57:54.320 --> 57:56.320
Uh, uh, we're closed.

57:57.520 --> 57:59.520
Yeah, well, it says here you're open till 10.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.360
Yeah, but see, we had a really busy day and we ran out of food.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.800
You're scary.

58:10.880 --> 58:11.680
Sounded like it.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.920
I did the right thing, didn't I?

58:13.920 --> 58:14.960
You said it was scary.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.000
Yeah.

58:19.440 --> 58:24.320
Hey, I think I should tell you something. I'm Mr. Williams, Gina's father.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.400
Oh, well, come on in.

58:29.760 --> 58:33.680
Roseanne Connor, why didn't you just say that you were Gina's father?

58:35.280 --> 58:38.640
You need to know all your customers' names before they come into your restaurant?

58:39.120 --> 58:44.240
Hey, Mr. Williams, uh, you think that you know what happened, but that wasn't what happened.

58:44.240 --> 58:49.760
No, she didn't do that because you are African American. She did that because you're a man.

58:49.760 --> 58:52.400
Yeah, and I'm prejudiced against all men equally.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.080
That's real funny.

58:56.800 --> 59:02.400
Hey, we're women, you know, and it's night. This is like a matter of safety.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.600
And in situations like that, I just got to go with my gut instinct.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.080
Well, I guess your kid inherited your instincts.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.480
What? There's no way that that is anything like this.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.440
Fine.

59:14.080 --> 59:17.280
Mr. Williams, come on. I'm sure you didn't come here to fight.

59:17.280 --> 59:19.040
Well, just forget about it anyway.

59:19.040 --> 59:22.240
There's probably just no way you're ever going to see where I'm coming from.

59:22.880 --> 59:26.000
You know, that's funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.

59:31.440 --> 59:33.840
Well, I think you're right.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.440
Well, I think he blew that out of proportion.

59:41.040 --> 59:44.400
I mean, you invited him in. You tried to make it up to him.

59:47.280 --> 59:51.440
You know, if he was a white guy with the exact same build in those exact same clothes,

59:51.440 --> 59:52.800
you would have done the exact same thing.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.560
Yeah, well, I'm glad one of us is sure.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.320
Well, now don't beat yourself up over it, Roseanne.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.280
You know, anybody else would have done just what you did.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.320
Well, isn't that great?

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.520
The subtle things here are what capture my attention.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.560
The way Jackie hides the register or how Roseanne flips the sign when she sees Mr. Williams.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.880
Things you can imagine any scared person doing at night while closing their shop.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.600
But why were they afraid?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.760
The lines exchanged by Roseanne and Mr. Williams are the most telling.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.640
They can never understand each other's experiences.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.560
As the audience, we can understand Roseanne's experience.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.080
We've had six and a half seasons of that, but Mr. Williams?

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.720
He's a cipher we can never really break.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.200
Unless you're black, of course, then you probably get it pretty quickly.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.720
Mr. Williams is the black experience in America coming right up to the face of white America

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.400
and saying that they don't see the racism he experiences.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.320
And the realization of Roseanne at the end is that he may be right.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.640
And that Roseanne, with those reflexive assumptions, is part of the problem.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.360
This episode perfectly encapsulates what Roseanne is missing as a series when it comes to portraying

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.720
the working class.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.400
Of course, it doesn't just miss race.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.080
There are a lot of other factors as well.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.800
But considering when this series was made, it's hard to really excuse not having it.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.680
And it certainly points to more we could learn about in the future.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.240
If Roseanne is to be some sort of guiding light on understanding the working class,

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.800
we have to understand areas that fall into the shadows.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.200
To me, this is the last truly great episode of Roseanne.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.400
It's something that could air today and still carry the same weight.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.480
I know I basically spoiled the whole thing, but I highly recommend seeking it out and

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.000
watching it in its entirety.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.800
And as a slight spoiler for season 10, Gina, that little girl DJ doesn't want to kiss,

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.600
they end up getting married and having a cute daughter named Mary.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.880
One of the signs of the show starting to drift off the rails is how aware it becomes about its

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.000
success and eventual place in TV history.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.120
The show toyed with fanciful episodes on rare occasions such as the Dream episode from season

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.400
2, but it's here where things start to kick it up a few years.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.280
In All About Rosie, we get one of those old sitcom staples, the clip show.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.040
These have thankfully died away, but in the past they were used to squeeze out an extra

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.200
episode of a show while keeping the budget down by having the characters sit around and

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.240
share memories.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:32.320
What makes this one hour, yes, one hour, special different is the second half features Roseanne

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.760
Connor meeting famed TV moms Barbara Billingsley, June Lockhart, Isabel Sanford, Allie Mills,

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.360
and Patricia Crowley.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.280
Whereas these mothers are initially judgmental of her brash persona,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.200
she slowly convinces them that she's part of a new way mothers can be viewed on TV.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:03:06.400
Season 7's finale, Sherwood Schwartz, a loving tribute, continues with the retro TV

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.840
love as the topic of Dan's boat comes up, which leads to a lengthy Gilligan's Island parody where

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.560
the actors from Roseanne take up the roles of various castaways from the classic sitcom.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.680
You can see a similar episode in the next season.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:34.480
These episodes are… not great.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.360
There's a subtext here that underscores the larger point of revering the past.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.440
When these shows are parodied, it's taking time to discuss the inherent silliness and

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440
negative stereotypes they hold.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.040
They're being deconstructed in a way to show you the limits of TV sitcoms,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.960
and that while they may be entertaining and even have something to say,

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.640
they are also products of their time, and it's only natural the same thing what happens to the

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.600
Roseanne show.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.240
Except Roseanne was already a show that was changing the way sitcoms could be viewed,

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.960
and it was doing it in a way that was much more interesting and clever than simply parodying

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.400
older sitcoms.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.640
Instead of being subtextual, these parodies make the commentary overt.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.760
Instead of trying to say something new, the show is instead saying the same thing as it always had

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.960
just a bit louder.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.080
And things are going to get louder still.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.840
This season marks the return of Lacey Goren's into the role of Becky.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.240
She would swap paces with Sarah Chalk throughout the season, and then Chalk would once again take

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.080
over the role completely in season 9.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.960
Yeah, it gets confusing.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.160
Another sign of the declining quality of the show is when we get the episode where the Connors are

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.840
totally woke.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.800
In The Last Thursday in November, DJ School Play gets some negative reviews when it dares

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.960
to mention that the Pilgrims and Native Americans weren't the best of buddies.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.320
God, Roseanne, could you believe how horrible that play was?

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.640
Well, I'm just sorry I let my son be in it.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.640
It was nothing but violent propaganda.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.000
And this debate drifts into another cheesy production where the cast pretends to be Pilgrims.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.840
So what's wrong with this episode?

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.160
In the context of the series, where we had earlier episodes such as White Men Can't Kiss

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.480
and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, where the Connors learn about their own faults and blind spots,

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.680
they're just kind of woke for this episode.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.760
The heat comes from the nameless parents at the school play who are passing morons and

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.280
capable of speaking in anything other than shitty right-wing talking points.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.320
There's no real nuance or discussion.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.480
This episode more than most others embodies all the things that are wrong with the Roseanne

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.600
show in later seasons.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.040
Even though its message is ultimately a good one,

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.640
of respecting the people's displaced and massacred by colonialism,

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.640
but Season 8 had some bright spots that I would be remiss to point out.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.960
The white sheep of the family includes a much-needed return of working-class dynamics when

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.720
it's revealed that Darlene has offered a relatively high-paying copywriting job

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.240
that she turned down so she could finish school and find something better.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.720
The job was not for $200, okay?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.400
It was as an advertising copywriter and it started at $500 a week.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.080
The Conners are suddenly confronted with someone not being in the same working-class boots

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.520
and it creates tension at home.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:49.840
The pain and pride of seeing Darlene succeed becomes clear.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.800
This episode introduces something new.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.680
The idea of one of the Conners making it.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.720
The thing the Conners have supposedly been working so hard for.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.680
The success of their children is finally happening.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.280
This might be one of the last episodes of the series to deal with being working-class

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.840
and in a way that doesn't sugarcoat the Conners as unflinchingly supportive.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.080
It portrays the fear of losing a child to a world that they could never be a part of,

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.960
knowing that it's in Darlene's best interests,

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.280
but with the fear that she may become one of the people they've always resented.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.560
This all unravels in later episodes and we learn Darlene is pregnant in another mouth to shut up

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.320
and she and David get engaged.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:18.480
The season putters along with Darlene getting married and Dan having a heart attack.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.440
While these are major moments for the Conners,

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.080
I'm going to skip right ahead to the final episode of the season.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.080
Fights and stuff.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.840
When Dan won't stick to a diet regime that will help him with his heart condition,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.320
he and Roseanne end up having a huge fight.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.640
It starts with a cute callback to the first season.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.360
I'll fix dinner.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.200
I'm fixing dinner.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.120
Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner 11 years ago.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.600
You want me to fix dinner?

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.280
I'll fix dinner.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.320
I'm fixing dinner.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.800
Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.040
Then it gets nasty.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.680
There are failures, Roseanne, and the only reason you won't admit it

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.920
is because you'll have to admit you failed as a mother.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.040
The only way I failed as a mother is to let Becky and Darlene get married

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.880
so young that they threw their whole life away on a man, just like I did.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.360
All the insecurities of being a parent boil over as the things that kept the family together,

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.400
the children, may not be enough when their goal of giving them a better life seems out of reach.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.120
The real pain and discord here isn't from Roseanne and Dan not being able to get along,

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.080
but the fear of not being able to give their kids a better life,

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.400
the fear of remaining working class.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.280
It's an anxiety that many can relate to and one that contradicts the myth of the American dream,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.880
that anyone can be successful as long as they're willing to work hard enough.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.640
Conners are hardworking.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.040
The system just wasn't built for them.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.920
The explosive finale of the last season may have just been an excuse to let John Goodman

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.680
spend some time away from the show.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.480
Frustrations backstage and a burgeoning movie career are all cited as reasons for his departure,

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.280
though he would still show up for several episodes this season.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.920
With Dan Connor gone though, and many of the cast regulars appearing only sporadically,

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.680
season 9 focused on Roseanne in some bizarre situations.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.560
Janet Leahy, a writer for the series, credits Roseanne's executive control for some of the

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.880
more ludicrous stories that appear this season.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.920
She says,

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.640
It is one thing to have editorial power and another to have creative power.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.800
And I think that crossed over in the end, and that was part of the problem.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.280
Season 9 is best known as the season where the Conners win the lottery.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.040
After Dan and Roseanne are hastily brought back together through a series of cheesy TV parodies,

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.360
the Conners win the jackpot of $108 million dollars.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.360
Adjusted for inflation, that works out to a shit ton of money in 2018.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.040
In Millions from Heaven, we get this moment that somehow always makes me laugh.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.720
I help pick the numbers.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.520
I don't know why, but it always works.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.840
The lottery win leads Roseanne on a number of strange adventures that my notes have marked

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.800
descriptively as weird shit.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.720
This is also where John Goodman is noticeably absent for several episodes,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.160
explained as him going to California to care for his ill mother.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.680
In his place, we get some truly weird shit, including parodies of Rosemary's Baby,

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.920
Roseanne Connor literally fighting a train filled with terrorists,

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.120
and an appearance by a fake Hillary Clinton and a real Steven Seagal.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.280
By the way, Roseambo, yeah it was called that, is widely thought of as the worst episode of the

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.800
series and is certainly the lowest rated one, at least from the original 9 season run.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.280
As the series winds down, a pregnant darling goes into premature labor in

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.960
The Miracle, an episode with a story credited to Roseanne Barr.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.320
The baby, Harris Connor Healy, is close to death,

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.200
and the Connor family money isn't able to solve their problem.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.040
It's not a question of money, Mrs. Connor. Unfortunately, we cannot

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.800
duplicate the conditions in the womb.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.960
But this is crazy. I mean, there's got to be something that you can do.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.960
Well, I wish there was, Mrs. Connor. I'm so sorry.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.800
What's perhaps most notable about this episode is the sudden turn towards the spiritual.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.040
You're making it up. That doesn't work.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.800
Oh yes, it does, Jackie. And you know why? Because they believe it's gonna work.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.800
I read that in all those books that Nancy gave me. And you know what?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.560
They all say the very same thing. You know what they say?

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.200
That the spiritual is the cause for the physical.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.480
This is a strange episode for me to watch. As someone with no faith or belief in the supernatural,

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.520
Roseanne Connor is coming from a fundamentally different place.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.760
The struggle to balance the question in her mind eventually leads her to a conclusion that's the

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.480
exact opposite of mine. This is one of those episodes where I feel very keenly that I'm

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.360
looking at someone completely different from me. Although season 9 had a lot of low points,

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.680
I don't think I would call this one of them. The struggle between faith and science show how,

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.840
even with material things, people still turn to the spiritual in the face of

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.880
unsolvable tragedy. Although I don't like the idea of divine intervention being the solution,

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.960
it does speak to the powerlessness people feel that lead them to believe it.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.600
As you might have suspected from the title of the episode, The Baby Pulls Through.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.240
And that brings us to the finale, a two-parter titled, Into That Good Night,

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.960
with another story credit to Roseanne Parr. The story of the last episode largely centers

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.560
around where the family is heading and the happy futures they all have together.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.200
Darlene and David with their new daughter, Becky and Mark expecting a child of their own,

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.800
and DJ finding a calling as a filmmaker. We even get an almost woke moment about gender identity.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:50.400
As the episode comes to a close, and it seems like we're getting a nice

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.560
bow to put on The Adventures of the Connor Clan, a recreation of the show's opening

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.920
credit sequence changes everything. A lengthy voiceover from Roseanne gives us the true story

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.160
of all the characters in the series, how Becky and David were the ones who got together,

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.920
and Darlene married Mark, how Jackie was actually a lesbian, and perhaps most shocking.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:33.360
The last season, and much of the series,

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.520
are revealed to have been Roseanne working in the writing room her family had gotten her

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.800
at the end of season two.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:32.400
The show ends with a quote from T.E. Lawrence, taken from the introduction to his signature

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.000
work, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:14.960
In 2011, the two-part finale was ranked number nine on the TV Guide Network special,

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:21.120
TV's Most Unforgettable Finale. Here are some comments from Barr herself, as well as Sarah

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:21.600
Gilbert.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.200
That's how it ends. It doesn't end with a happy reunion on ABC every Christmas.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.760
You know, it's not gonna go like that.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:46.160
We probably should have been done at season eight. The lottery and stuff? It got so surreal and

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:52.320
started to follow Roseanne's real path. It wasn't what it started as. For me, I like the struggle of

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.600
the family a little more. The financial struggle. The show ended on a somber note, but lived on in

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.960
syndication. Reruns still air to this day on some channels. The struggle of a working-class

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.040
family could have been consigned to the history books, and this video need not even exist,

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.800
but the TV cards weren't done with the Roseanne show just yet.
