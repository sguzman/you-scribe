1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Where do people get their ideas?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,920
In the case of this video, I took my general distaste for the work of noted conspiracy

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,840
theorist and soy hater Paul Joseph Watson, and decided to follow his work for a week

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,800
and tabulate the many omissions, poor framings, and outright lies that shape his work.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,280
But something weird happened along the way.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,760
I had decided upon the week of January 14th, 2019 as my starting point.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,280
With the very first article, my whole idea fell apart, and I fell into a weird rabbit

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
hole.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,800
The article in question is titled, Leftist French Website Calls for Heterosexuality

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,160
to be Banned, published on January 14th on Infowars, the home of conspiracy theories

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,880
and pending litigation for slander.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Watson's article is a less than favorable framing of a piece by Mérôme Jardin, titled,

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,760
Interdire le Artreu Sexuality, for the French outlet media part.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
And I apologize for that terrible French pronunciation there.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,480
Watson's article describes the content of the Jardin piece, and includes some generally

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,200
negative remarks, but doesn't go into it too deeply.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The first question I had was, does Paul Joseph Watson speak French?

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,440
He has a lot of translated sections of the original French article, but he doesn't really

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,280
attribute it to anyone.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,560
So where did these translations come from?

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,680
Did he just come up with them on his own?

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,880
So I decided to look this up.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
It led me to, as far as I can tell, one of the few English language articles about the

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,320
Jardin piece that wasn't just a reposting of the Watson article from Infowars.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,840
It was posted on a blog called, Diversity Machte Frei, which Google Translate tells

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,160
me is German for diversity power free.

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,880
But more about the blog in a bit.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,040
The article, Call for Heterosexuality to be Banned in France, was published on January

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,120
12th, 2019, two days before the Watson article.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,920
I know you're all probably thinking, ooh, a plagiarism case.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Sort of.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,000
There's actually something much more interesting going on here, so just hang in there for a

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
moment.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
The first thing I noticed about the blog post is that it's strikingly similar to the Watson

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,800
article, so much so that every quoted section from the Watson article is an exact match

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
for the blog article.

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,320
Translation is not an exact science.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,360
Translations may contain subtle differences, depending on the translator.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,120
Take, for example, these translations of the first paragraph of the French article.

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,240
I sourced both of these individually, and even when you take into consideration that

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,880
words such as sexism and biphobia are typically only translated in one way, you can still

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,120
see the subtle differences in the translation that show different people worked on them.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,880
The first paragraph is included in both the Watson and the Diversity Machte Frei blog

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,080
article, and they are identical.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,760
There is no difference between them whatsoever, aside from a few opening words that the Watson

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
quote cut off.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,320
In fact, every quoted section is identical aside from the word femicide, which was spelled

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,160
incorrectly as feminicides in the Diversity blog.

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I suppose it was nice of Watson to correct the spelling there.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,640
But going further than the quotations, take a look at all these additional claims in the

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,860
Watson article that aren't just quotes from the original Jardine article.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,280
Every single one of them can be found in the translated sections originally posted in the

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Diversity blog.

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,600
That may not sound like a big deal, since they're talking about the same French article,

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,080
why wouldn't they make the same claims?

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,920
Except the translation on the Diversity blog only includes four paragraphs from the original

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,760
French article 17, not counting the concluding sentence.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,580
Now what are the odds that the Watson article, supposedly based on having read the original

59
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,080
French article in its entirety, would have happened to hit the exact same points as this

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,360
blog post that translated less than a quarter of the article's content?

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,660
But we're not done yet.

62
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,800
The final few paragraphs of the Diversity blog read,

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,440
The bio of the author, Mérôme Jardine, says he was a member of ACTA Paris, 1998-2013,

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,700
a gay campaigning group, and is a member of CCIF, Collective Against Islamophobia.

65
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,620
Which is hilarious, since I don't think this guy will last long after the Muslim takeover

66
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,320
of France.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
Watson's article ends,

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,900
The irony behind the piece is that Jardine is also a member of the CCIF, Collective Against

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,880
Islamophobia.

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
One wonders how his opinion will be received amongst France's Muslim population, which

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,760
currently stands at almost 9%.

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Kind of strange how they ended on the exact same point, isn't it?

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,500
Although Watson, I suppose, gets some tiny bit of credit for adding the factoid about

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,220
the Muslim population of France, in an article that has nothing to do with Islam.

75
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,820
Funny how that worked out.

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,100
Countless writers have taken the work of others, synthesized or built upon it in some way.

77
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,420
Typically though, they add more than just a random stat at the end.

78
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,260
And even more typically, they actually credit their source.

79
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,900
At the very least, Watson should credit the Diversity blog for the translation.

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,560
Although that might expose how little work he did for this article.

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
And it might expose something else as well.

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,880
Diversity Macht Preu, you can get a sense of what this blog is about by checking out

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
some of their articles.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,900
There are a few overlaps with Watson's InfoWars work.

85
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,660
We have these two articles about a woman in Germany being pulled over for wearing braids.

86
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,640
The Diversity blog's article was dated January 8th, the Watson article January 9th.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,520
There's an article here about the French Green Party founder saying Europeans should

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,160
have less children to make room for migrants.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Diversity blog's article is dated January 4th, Watson's is dated January 11th.

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,840
And an article about Germany issuing a manual to schools warning about signs of, according

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,080
to Watson's article, right-wing parents.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,840
And according to Diversity blog's article, Nazi parents.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,640
The Diversity blog's article is dated December 4th, the Watson article December 5th.

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,680
In many of these cases, Watson, to his credit, does more to build on the story than the Diversity

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
blog does, enough to make it seem as if he got these stories from somewhere else.

96
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
And heck, maybe he did.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,160
It's entirely possible that the Diversity blog and Watson just run in the same circles

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
and cover a lot of the same stories using similar themes such as the left trying to

99
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
destroy Europe via immigration.

100
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,800
Although when it comes to that first article, responding to the Jardin piece, I can't assume

101
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,440
that's just a coincidence.

102
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,640
The articles are way too similar.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,480
One is clearly lifted from the other.

104
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,160
But this isn't just a case of plagiarism.

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,680
There's a bit more to that Diversity blog than I've told you so far.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,160
And it's pretty ugly.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,280
While Watson is happy to cover the same stories as the blog when it applies to conservatives

108
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,900
supposedly being under attack in Europe, he doesn't really touch the other stories the

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,800
blog pushes out on a regular basis.

110
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,520
Titles with titles such as A Very Jewish Coup, the Plot to Stop Brexit, Rich Muslim

111
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,240
States are hiring Jews to sell Islam to Christians via interfaith institutes.

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,080
As Christians celebrate Christmas with their families, Jews fantasize about their saviour

113
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
crawling through excrement.

114
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,680
So yeah, this blog is probably run by a Nazi.

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,020
And if you need a little more evidence than that, one of the few places that loves to

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,960
repost this blog's content happens to be the home for neo-Nazi scum on the internet,

117
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,040
the Daily Stormer.

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,400
This is definitely a Nazi's blog.

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
And the Daily Stormer has had an interesting relationship with Paul Joseph Watson over

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
the years.

121
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,640
In short, they don't like him.

122
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
At all.

123
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,780
Not because they disagree with the vast majority of his talking points, though.

124
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,260
As one 2015 article describes it, Watson is known for ripping off the Daily Stormer

125
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,940
and other pro-white sites and removing Jews from the discussion.

126
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,900
Now if the Daily Stormer said the sky was blue, I'd look out the window to check,

127
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,940
but there's clearly a kinship between Watson and his site.

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,320
Watson portrays the Daily Stormer as being hostile towards him.

129
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,940
But this doesn't result from some kind of profound ideological divide.

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,980
He says in this tweet they attack him, and that's true.

131
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,540
But only insofar that Watson doesn't quite go far enough to call out their imaginary

132
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,500
menace that's supposedly the source of all the evils in the world.

133
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,020
In this case, it would be the Jewish people.

134
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,660
Which they're obviously wrong about.

135
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,060
Do I have to say that?

136
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Do I have to say they're wrong?

137
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,420
I'm gonna say it anyway.

138
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,220
They're totally wrong about the Jews being fined everything.

139
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,740
That's a hideous conspiracy theory.

140
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,500
Watson's career has largely been spent working for Alex Jones and Infowars.

141
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,740
Infowars' single biggest work is a 2005 book titled Order Out of Chaos, a diatribe

142
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,620
about how the US government was responsible for 9-11.

143
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,940
One telling line within describes briefly how Watson believes the world works, particularly

144
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,900
in how it relates to the Jewish people.

145
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,020
Many people identify Zionism and the expansion of Israel as the head of the New World Order

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,060
Hydra.

147
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,740
In reality, Israel is just another tentacle of the beast.

148
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,820
The globalists do not owe allegiance to any particular country.

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,380
They will use any nation or movement as muscle to rhyme through their agenda.

150
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,340
So the point of contention between the likes of Watson and Stormfront is simple.

151
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,220
They both believe in the same theory of a group of global elites controlling the world.

152
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,260
Only Watson will claim that the group is exclusively Jewish.

153
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,980
Instead, he sees it as some sort of sinister left-wing cabal that is using identity politics

154
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,260
to, I don't know, make everyone gay, I guess.

155
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,820
What's so frustrating about these commentaries is that they're not completely wrong about

156
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,900
the world being organized in a way that favors a ruling class over all others, but instead

157
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,020
of trying to create a broad international coalition of the people against those who

158
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,100
would oppress them, they either scapegoat a religious minority or pretend that fascism

159
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,660
is going to save us.

160
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,340
These obviously aren't real solutions.

161
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,220
In an article by Nico Hines of The Daily Beast, we got a deep look into Watson's history,

162
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,420
particularly how he got his story ideas in the past.

163
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,200
He's a talented guy in that way, able to spit out these fake news stories very quickly.

164
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,060
This comment comes from Kelly Jones, Alex Jones's ex-wife who previously had a fairly

165
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,380
heavy hand in running the operations of InfoWars.

166
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,920
According to Kelly Jones, much of Watson's prolific career writing for InfoWars would

167
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
involve Jones reciting ideas to Watson over the phone, who would then turn them into articles.

168
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,160
If anything, this demonstrates Watson has a history of repackaging the ideas of, well,

169
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,040
unbalanced individuals.

170
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
If we want to know what motivates Watson, Kelly Jones can actually offer us a possible

171
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,160
explanation describing her time managing the prison planet, eventually InfoWars, payroll.

172
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Early early on, Paul Watson was making monthly what people make in a year.

173
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,000
We're talking about the kind of money that would drop jaws.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,920
Before I go further, I should mention Watson called this article a hit piece.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,780
Although throughout the article they cite government records and interviews with many

176
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,080
of his former friends and colleagues, that seems quite credible.

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,400
Watson's only critique after the article came out was the tweet below.

178
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,840
None of the information Kelly Jones provides has anything to do with knowing Watson personally

179
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,960
and is used to provide context of his working relationship with her husband.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,200
The Daily Beast article suggests, quite strongly, that Watson's intense suspicion about the

181
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,080
government, as seen in his earlier writings, where he pivots to conspiracy theories in

182
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,520
the face of any and all public tragedies, has slowly moved towards a more xenophobic variation.

183
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,200
We can see a great example of Watson's race to a conspiracy theory answer in one of his

184
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,640
early 2015 videos, where he actually came out against Donald Trump.

185
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,480
Donald Trump is a stooge for Hillary Clinton.

186
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
He's a plan.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,800
He's a ringer to sink the chances of Republican candidates who actually have a chance of

188
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,360
defeating Hillary.

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,720
Watson claimed to have evolved on this issue.

190
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Just how he evolved I think can be more easily summed up in these three tweets.

191
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,800
In the context of Donald Trump threatening military action in Syria off the heels of

192
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,920
a chemical weapon attack, Watson posted these three tweets within a 14 hour period.

193
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,940
I guess Trump wasn't Putin's puppet after all.

194
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,020
He was just another deep state neocon puppet.

195
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,060
I'm officially off the Trump train.

196
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,900
First time I've ever lost Twitter followers.

197
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,780
Interesting.

198
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,700
I am off the Trump train in terms of Syria, which I will criticize.

199
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,180
But I have not turned on Trump, as the media claims.

200
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,380
Fake news.

201
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,340
I suspect the truth of Watson's motivations lie in the second tweet in that little three

202
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,100
act Twitter play.

203
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Watson has an audience, an audience that makes him a lot of money.

204
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,980
He'll say what he needs to, to keep getting paid.

205
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,860
It's difficult to say whether or not Watson is entirely disingenuous, though.

206
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,740
Maybe he flirts with more extreme viewpoints for the financial benefits, but he's certainly

207
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,860
built a career being a conspiracy theorist who doggedly challenges the government, often

208
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,620
with dreadful completely wrongheaded conclusions.

209
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,420
Although Watson may make himself presentable and make a concentrated effort to appear reasonable,

210
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,580
he's still repackaging crackpot commentary as his own.

211
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,900
Whether it's in service to genuinely agreeing with it or to make a quick buck, it doesn't

212
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
really matter.

213
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,980
He's trying to stealthily insert neo-Nazi commentary into the public discourse, and

214
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,700
that's bad enough.

215
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,060
I want to give a shout out to my Twitter followers who helped me out with the translations for

216
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,900
the first paragraph of the Jardine article.

217
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,300
One asked to remain anonymous, but the other one is Timba on Toast, whose YouTube channel

218
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
you should totally check out.

219
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,980
He has a fantastic video on Dave Rubin, and I know a thing or two about Dave Rubin videos.

220
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,460
If you enjoy this video, I highly recommend you like it.

221

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,660
