00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
We've all made mistakes in our lives, done things we look back on with regret,

00:05.040 --> 00:08.000
maybe wishing there was some kind of way of making it right.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
My Name is Earl takes an average scumbag and gives him a mission to do just that,

00:12.000 --> 00:15.840
and in turn gives us a blueprint on how to make amends for wrongdoing

00:15.840 --> 00:17.920
and making the world a better place in the process.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.960
Running for a mere four seasons, My Name is Earl was a smash hit when it debuted,

00:22.960 --> 00:26.240
only to be unceremoniously cancelled after its fourth season.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.840
In that short time, it won several awards and grew a small cult following.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.080
Earl Hickey and his journey of redemption through the cartoonish role of Camden County

00:34.080 --> 00:38.240
gave audiences a crash course in karma, revealing the simplicity of doing good.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.360
And it gave us one of the greatest mustaches in TV history.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.400
The story of My Name is Earl begins with Greg Garcia.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.200
Before creating the series, Garcia had written for shows such as Family Matters and On Our Own.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.400
He then went on to co-create the sitcom Yes, Dear for CBS.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.080
Garcia came up with an idea for a show starring a less than savory character

00:56.080 --> 00:58.480
trying to make up for all the wrong he had done in his life,

00:58.480 --> 01:01.520
partially inspired by parts of Garcia's own personal history.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.680
My father, or stepfather, is named Earl.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.760
He wasn't the best guy in the world.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.440
He was somewhat of a crook.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.400
I don't think he was as bad as some of the things Earl has done,

01:14.400 --> 01:18.480
but he kind of saw the light and started to change his ways

01:18.480 --> 01:20.800
and didn't officially make a list.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.040
But he went around and kind of made up for some of the things he's done

01:25.040 --> 01:26.720
and he's continuing to do that.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.160
So he really inspired me.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.760
Garcia pitched the show to Fox, thinking it would be a good fit for the network,

01:31.760 --> 01:34.320
but they ultimately passed on the pilot's script.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.160
That script found its way to NBC,

01:36.160 --> 01:39.680
and while they initially wanted Garcia to create a whole new series for them,

01:39.680 --> 01:43.680
he suggested that instead they take the existing script and turn it into a series.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.600
And so My Name is Earl was born.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.480
Early on, director Mark Buckland was attached to the project

01:48.480 --> 01:50.880
and became a big part of the look of the series.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.880
He and Garcia were on the same page about wanting My Name is Earl to look cinematic.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.080
We just said, you know, this thing really should look like a movie every week.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.640
For the show to move forward, it had to assemble the right cast

02:00.640 --> 02:04.000
and the crucial first step was finding the right person to play Earl.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.960
Partially because NBC really wanted him on their network,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.440
Jason Lee was an early favorite to play Earl.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.120
Lee had mostly worked in movies at this point and back in 2005,

02:13.120 --> 02:17.040
it was a lot less common to see actors moving from the big screen to the small one.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.000
The strength of the pilot's script convinced Lee to take the part.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.920
This is something that I would see in a film if done right.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.200
And if done right, it would be up my alley,

02:27.200 --> 02:29.920
the kind of movie I would want to be and I would want to watch.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.320
Earl was a former dirtbag turned good guy and Lee brought an easy charm to the character

02:34.320 --> 02:36.560
that made the audience root for him on his journey.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.400
Lee also had the brilliant idea of giving Earl his signature mustache.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.160
And he said, you know what, he goes, I look really funny with a mustache.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.760
He goes, trust me, a mustache would be hilarious.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.760
And he was right.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.880
The iconic look was originally something they had to fight the network on,

02:52.880 --> 02:57.920
but for all our sake, sanity eventually prevailed and Earl Hickey was born.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.520
You got great boobs, Peggy.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.240
Her name was not Peggy.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.480
Ethan Suppley was in early consideration for the role of Randy Hickey, Earl's brother.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.640
Although Lee and Suppley had been friends for a while,

03:08.640 --> 03:10.880
having worked on a number of projects over the years,

03:10.880 --> 03:13.840
that wasn't how Suppley ended up in consideration for the role.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.480
And the story and the characters were hysterical.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.280
My wife is a manager and she said, what the hell are you reading?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.360
And I said, I'm reading My Name is Earl.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.440
And she said, that's Jason Shell.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.480
And I was like, what?

03:24.480 --> 03:27.600
It was a complete surprise to Suppley when he found out that he was in the running for

03:27.600 --> 03:32.160
a series starring his longtime friend and their onscreen chemistry made for an easy fit.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.240
Randy is a man of many strange talents and a unique perspective.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.960
Although not the most intellectually gifted of people,

03:38.960 --> 03:42.400
he does have a good heart and remains Earl's most loyal friend.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.280
Randy, those are poison.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.280
How poison?

03:49.920 --> 03:54.080
The role of Joy, Earl's ex-wife, very quickly went to Jamie Pressley.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.280
According to Pressley, it was basically given to her at the audition.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.480
I went in there like, so when do we start shooting?

04:01.360 --> 04:07.360
It's hard to imagine anyone else as the hard as nails, yet somehow charming trailer park terror.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.440
Although Joy and Earl didn't have the best marriage,

04:09.440 --> 04:12.000
they did manage to become friends after it ended.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.840
At least, they did eventually.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.400
You are not the one standing with the freshly broken bottle now, are you?

04:19.280 --> 04:22.960
Well, this will still hurt if I hit you with it.

04:22.960 --> 04:27.440
Eddie Steeples caught the eye of Greg Garcia after his appearance in a number of commercials,

04:27.440 --> 04:32.480
specifically his role as the rubber band man in a series of Office Max ad spots.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.720
Steeples played Darnell Turner, also known as Harry Monroe, more on that later,

04:36.720 --> 04:39.040
and affectionately nicknamed Crabman.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.160
Darnell is Joy's love interest and eventual new husband.

04:42.160 --> 04:47.120
The perpetual face of chill, Darnell is the yin to her yang, though his calm demeanor

04:47.120 --> 04:48.800
hides a mysterious past.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.520
Hi, Earl.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.480
Hey, Crabman.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.200
Joy wanted me to bring you these poison cookies.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.240
Huh?

04:54.240 --> 04:57.280
I wasn't gonna get involved, but now she got me delivering poison.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.640
Just don't sing right.

04:58.640 --> 05:04.160
The last person to join the principal cast was Nadine Velasquez, playing Catalina Arruca,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.800
the maid in the motel Earl and Randy live in.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.840
Velasquez actually gave up being part of the series Prison Break,

05:09.840 --> 05:13.040
where she would have played the character Maricruz Delgado,

05:13.040 --> 05:15.680
so she could instead be a part of My Name is Earl.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.680
Catalina brings a bit of flavor to the cast, offering a friend to support Earl and Randy,

05:19.680 --> 05:21.600
while also being a foil to Joy.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.160
There you go.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.960
Now, if you do it to the other hand, I want to take you to my church

05:24.960 --> 05:26.480
so I can watch all the old ladies cry.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.000
When the show came together, it tested surprisingly well with audiences,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.520
in spite of the fact that its single-camera style was a relatively new thing

05:33.520 --> 05:34.960
for networks that come at the time.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.920
Those early positive signs even led NBC to give out advanced previews of the pilot

05:39.920 --> 05:43.440
to people via a CD-ROM that was inserted into magazines,

05:43.440 --> 05:47.680
something that is absolutely a relic of the era this show came from.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.400
My Name is Earl premiered on a Tuesday night and brought with it

05:50.400 --> 05:53.920
some high hopes that it would be a hit, and it was an instant success.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.080
Straight from Carson Daly's lips to my morphine-laced ear.

05:58.080 --> 06:03.280
Debuting on Tuesday, September 20th, 2005, with an episode titled

06:03.280 --> 06:06.320
Pilot, My Name is Earl waved hello to the world.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.600
The opening minutes of the show establish the premise in short order.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
Earl is not a good guy.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.320
Sort of shifty-looking fella who buys a pack of smokes,

06:14.320 --> 06:17.280
a couple lotto scratchers, and a tall boy at 10 in the morning.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.080
He's married to a woman who got him drunk enough to marry her,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.200
even though she was six months pregnant with another man's child.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.080
Joy didn't remember much about the boy's real father,

06:26.080 --> 06:27.440
except that he drove a Ford.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.760
So we named him Dodge.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.920
A year later, she gave birth to another son,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.720
though Earl suspects this one wasn't his either.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.440
There he was.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.000
Earl Jr.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.160
Earl's life changes forever, though, when he wins $100,000 in the lotto,

06:42.160 --> 06:44.880
and he's then hit by a car and loses the scratcher.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.680
Joy soon leaves Earl for Darnell, the real father of her second son,

06:55.680 --> 06:59.840
and while Earl is stuck in a hospital bed wondering why his life is so miserable,

06:59.840 --> 07:02.720
Earl learns about a little thing called karma.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.880
You do good things, and good things happen to you.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.960
You do bad things, and they'll come back to haunt you.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.480
Karma.

07:08.480 --> 07:08.960
Karma.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.720
There it was.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.800
Having been tricked out of the trailer by Joy, Earl and Randy are living at a motel.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.400
They make a new friend in Catalina, and Earl announces his new plan in life,

07:18.400 --> 07:22.560
to make a list of every person he's wronged and then try to somehow make it up to them.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.440
I almost died because something good happened to me that I didn't deserve.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.760
That karma stuff is gonna kill me unless I make up for everything on that list.

07:29.760 --> 07:34.000
As if karma is smiling down on him, the lottery scratcher returns,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.520
and Earl has $100,000 he can use to fund his new quest to make all his wrongs right.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.320
The rest of the episode has Earl going on his first task,

07:42.320 --> 07:46.880
making amends with one of his former bullying victims, Kenny, played by Greg Binkley.

07:46.880 --> 07:51.360
He decides for this one he needs to get Kenny laid, only Kenny has a secret.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.800
I live in a small town, and I've never been face to face with a gay before.

07:54.800 --> 08:03.040
This is where the show starts to get more interesting.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.640
If all Earl was doing in this series was traveling around doing good deeds,

08:06.640 --> 08:08.240
it wouldn't be much of a show.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.640
From the pilot, we're getting a few key elements about what makes this series so special.

08:12.640 --> 08:17.760
Earl isn't just here to help Kenny, he has to help himself by getting past his own homophobia.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.680
To help get Kenny out of the closet, Earl takes him to a gay bar,

08:27.680 --> 08:32.960
and the experience is so transformative for Kenny that he lets Earl know he can cross him off his list.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.840
The one man I was the most scared of in my whole life has accepted me as I am.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.000
You took away my confidence, but today you gave it back.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.680
This episode offered a very lovely portrait of how to make amends to a person.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.480
It begins with Earl realizing he's done something wrong.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.240
He then goes to make amends.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.320
He learns about who his victim is as a person,

08:52.320 --> 08:55.520
and what unique way he can offer some form of restitution.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.080
And then his victim tells Earl when he's done enough.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.080
It's a form of justice that focuses on restitution towards the wrong party

09:02.080 --> 09:03.920
rather than punishing the aggressor.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.880
And there were so many other important facts established in the pilot.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.560
Earl finding the lottery ticket he lost, and still sticking with his list,

09:10.560 --> 09:13.920
establishes that this mission is something Earl is going to be on for a while.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.600
He's not just doing it for the sake of getting that one lottery ticket back.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.280
And by helping someone else, Earl also helps make himself a better person,

09:21.280 --> 09:23.600
overcoming the homophobia of his past self.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.360
Something we'll see in later episodes is Kenny coming to Earl's help when he needs it in the

09:27.360 --> 09:31.440
future as the series reveals over time, while Earl views it as a personal mission,

09:31.440 --> 09:34.560
this journey has consequences for all of Camden.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.840
Earl is a flawed guide, but he's made lovable by wanting to do better.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.440
He's also limited in that he's not suddenly a master of ethical living.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.480
But this doesn't somehow stop him from being a decent person.

09:44.480 --> 09:48.000
Karma is a simple, but very effective way of living a better life.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.400
Something anyone can take on, even Earl.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.240
The pilot was a huge hit, being watched by nearly 15 million people.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.840
A fun fact about this episode is that it also includes an appearance by the series creator,

09:57.840 --> 09:58.800
Greg Garcia.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.200
He's the guy Randy dances with at the gay bar.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.880
Over the years, there would be a number of cameos like this from Garcia and other members

10:04.880 --> 10:06.240
of the staff on the show.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.240
But this one was particularly fun.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.160
In the DVD set for the first season, there was also an alternate version of the pilot,

10:12.160 --> 10:13.840
Bad Karma, that was included.

10:13.840 --> 10:18.640
Instead of Carson Daly, Earl listens to Stewie Griffin from Family Guy go on a short rant,

10:18.640 --> 10:20.080
and takes this to heart instead.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.560
So instead of making a list of people he's wronged, Earl makes a list of vengeance and

10:24.560 --> 10:45.600
decides to be even worse than he had been before.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.200
Much of the pilot's events are inverted, like Earl attacking Joy and Darnell instead

10:50.200 --> 10:53.160
of Joy attacking him when she finds out he won the lottery.

10:53.160 --> 10:57.160
And Earl tries to manipulate Kenny, thinking that he's straight, into having sex with

10:57.160 --> 10:59.320
a prostitute who has a penis.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.800
The episode ends with Earl being hit by a car, and this time, a very upset Joy and Darnell,

11:03.800 --> 11:08.140
left bald by Earl's attack, decide to finish him off for good, leaving Randy to become

11:08.140 --> 11:12.280
the star of the series.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.320
This episode is a cute little extra, and it's also notable for being the one time we see

11:16.320 --> 11:19.760
Jason Lee playing Earl with a fake mustache and sideburns.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.840
Absolutely criminal.

11:24.840 --> 11:29.280
Earl's growth can be summarized very easily as a simple man making himself and his community

11:29.280 --> 11:31.000
better through good deeds.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.320
In the second episode, quit smoking.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.240
Earl tries to make up for getting his friend Donnie arrested.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.040
Only Donnie found religion in jail, and he forgives Earl.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.880
But Donnie wasn't the only victim, and Earl finds that he needs to make up for the two

11:42.880 --> 11:45.440
years Donnie's mother lost with her son.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.960
So to make things square, he helps Donnie's mother quit smoking so she'll have some

11:48.960 --> 11:58.720
extra time with him.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.360
While smoking is likely not as easy to quit as the montage makes it to be, or at least

12:03.360 --> 12:08.080
give quitting a fighting chance like the montage suggests, this little story reflects how Earl

12:08.080 --> 12:11.480
realizes his actions have hurt people outside of his list.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.520
The bad Earl did often spilled out and had a greater impact than he thought, but the

12:15.520 --> 12:17.160
same is true of the good.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.800
This list item helped Earl get healthier and Donnie and his mother have more time to

12:20.800 --> 12:21.920
spend together.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.880
Three people helped with one good deed.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.880
The important lesson, and one we see throughout the series, is that everyone and everything

12:27.880 --> 12:32.360
is connected to something else, and one good deed or one bad deed could ripple out to affect

12:32.360 --> 12:33.840
an entire community.

12:33.840 --> 12:38.320
By choosing to do good instead of bad, this is how Earl is making his community a better

12:38.320 --> 12:39.320
place.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.760
There's also a wonderful feedback loop that shows us that, by doing good and becoming

12:42.760 --> 12:47.480
a better person, Earl is able to take on more challenging tasks and having an increased

12:47.480 --> 12:49.400
impact in his community.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.480
Earl is effectively becoming a greater force for change as the series progresses, and Earl's

12:53.480 --> 12:56.940
commitment to karma is tested through an increasingly heavy load.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.940
This is how Earl makes himself better.

12:58.940 --> 13:03.080
In the season one finale, number one, Earl attempts to cross off the first thing on his

13:03.080 --> 13:04.080
list.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.080
It was the last bad thing he ever did before getting hit by a car, still ten dollars from

13:08.080 --> 13:11.920
a guy at a convenience store, only he finds out that that guy was going to use ten dollars

13:11.920 --> 13:15.680
to buy the winning lottery ticket that Earl bought instead, so Earl has to give the guy

13:15.680 --> 13:17.320
his lottery money.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.720
Having lost his lottery winnings, Earl puts his faith in karma to care for him and Randy,

13:21.720 --> 13:32.680
and that often takes the shape of his friends helping him out.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.080
Even with his money gone, Earl keeps working on the list.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.680
Then he loses his car, and he keeps working on the list, and it even looks like he might

13:40.680 --> 13:45.040
be losing Randy, and he still keeps on working on the list.

13:45.040 --> 13:49.400
He learns that the man Earl originally stole that ten dollars from was ruined by the lottery

13:49.400 --> 13:56.240
winnings.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.440
There's an almost mystical quality to the experience, as if this money can only be used

14:01.440 --> 14:03.040
to do good for others.

14:03.040 --> 14:07.520
This episode also raised the important point of how sometimes doing good can feel like

14:07.520 --> 14:12.400
you're going backwards, but if you stay on track, things will work out, and friends

14:12.400 --> 14:14.000
can help you along the way.

14:14.000 --> 14:27.600
The audio commentary reflected this very important part of the series.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.880
Earl at the beginning of the season likely would have bailed the moment his money vanished

14:30.880 --> 14:35.560
and gone back to his thieving ways, but doing good deeds for a year has changed him.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.120
It's not just about the reward, but also the experience.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.760
He still believes karma will make his life better, but not in the way he might have at

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
the beginning.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.800
Earl's capacity to do good and the power of good deeds are a major force driving him

14:47.800 --> 14:49.560
forward throughout the seasons.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.320
What Earl can do for others expands as more people do good alongside him.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.440
Earl's approach to doing good deeds is never very complicated.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.360
He's aware that he's a work in progress and that by doing good, he's working on

15:00.360 --> 15:05.080
making himself better, as perhaps best summed up at the end of the season one episode titled

15:05.080 --> 15:16.640
The Professor.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.480
How can you not root for this guy?

15:18.480 --> 15:21.920
These little moments are never very complicated and that's part of Earl's charm.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.680
He's a simple guy and doing good doesn't have to be a complicated thing.

15:25.680 --> 15:30.600
In the season two episode, Rob to Stoner Blind, Earl is faced with a deep dilemma when Woody,

15:30.600 --> 15:44.960
played by Christian Slater, teaches him about climate change.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.800
As Earl realizes this is going to require him to do a lot more than change his personal

15:48.800 --> 16:01.480
habits, he starts to feel overwhelmed by the problem.

16:01.480 --> 16:07.080
Climate change is beyond the power of a former thief on a mission to underdo his wrongdoings.

16:07.080 --> 16:11.000
The episode saying Earl just needs to repay the earth in a small way is a decent enough

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
message.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.960
But what rings particularly true here is that, for Earl, thinking on some kind of grand scale

16:16.960 --> 16:20.480
to fix the planet is not something he needs to do.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.320
What we're learning here is that, instead of being bogged down in grand ethical debates

16:24.320 --> 16:29.160
on how we live our lives and how it impacts every other organism on the planet, Earl can

16:29.160 --> 16:34.360
do good just by following his list and by doing that, it reveals how doing good is really

16:34.360 --> 16:35.760
a simple thing.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.140
That's another theme that runs through the series.

16:38.140 --> 16:43.040
It's not that worrying about big problems is a bad thing, it's that doing good doesn't

16:43.040 --> 16:46.280
require exclusively fixating on those heavier burdens.

16:46.280 --> 16:50.800
As long as someone is still making some kind of small step to help with those bigger problems

16:50.800 --> 16:54.560
and spending the rest of their time doing good in other, more immediate ways.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.320
The series isn't about wrestling with massive ethical conundrums.

16:59.320 --> 17:03.880
For instance, is it more moral to adopt a stray cat or donate your time to help a soup

17:03.880 --> 17:04.880
kitchen?

17:04.880 --> 17:08.820
The answer in this series is that it's not an either or question.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.160
You do the one that makes the most sense to you.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.000
It's the doing that matters the most.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.880
In the season 4 episode Sweet Johnny, we see a great example of that when Earl tries

17:17.880 --> 17:22.880
to make amends with a local stuntman named Sweet Johnny, played by David Arquette, only

17:22.880 --> 17:27.460
to learn that Sweet Johnny has a brain injury that prevents him from forming new memories.

17:27.460 --> 17:31.540
So Earl could never really make up for the fact that he slept with Sweet Johnny's girlfriend.

17:31.540 --> 17:35.800
Though he keeps trying, eventually Earl realizes why he's trying so hard.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.600
I was really only trying to make me feel better by crossing Johnny off the list.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.380
For the first time since I started doing my list, I wasn't going to be able to cross

17:43.380 --> 17:44.380
somebody off.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.260
I was going to have to just let it nag at me.

17:47.260 --> 17:51.340
But since Johnny was never going to remember, it felt right that someone will never forget.

17:51.340 --> 17:56.020
A guilty conscience is not something that is always a thing you can get rid of, but

17:56.020 --> 17:58.700
good deeds are always something a person can do.

17:58.700 --> 18:02.820
It may not make things right, but it can serve as a permanent reminder to be a better person.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.540
It's a very deep lesson for such a simple guy, and it's how the whole process of doing

18:06.540 --> 18:08.820
good shows the evolution of Earl.

18:08.820 --> 18:12.740
He becomes a better person and learns about the limitations of those good works, and even

18:12.740 --> 18:17.420
though he can't make everything right, that's no excuse not to do the good he can.

18:17.420 --> 18:21.220
And importantly, with Earl learning these lessons, it reveals that anyone can learn

18:21.220 --> 18:22.540
them alongside him.

18:22.540 --> 18:27.380
Although Earl is trying to be a better person, what's inescapable is that he isn't quite

18:27.380 --> 18:31.140
there yet, and that often gets revealed in some less than enlightened moments throughout

18:31.140 --> 18:32.180
the series.

18:32.180 --> 18:36.020
The aforementioned homophobia from the pilot is a great example because it not only highlights

18:36.020 --> 18:39.060
a problem of Earl's, but also how he corrects it.

18:39.060 --> 18:43.620
It was put succinctly by Jamie Pressley in the audio commentary for the season one episode,

18:43.620 --> 18:44.620
White Lie Christmas.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.500
That's what I love about our show though, is that it's politically incorrect and then

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
it corrects itself.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.060
In a really twisted way.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.860
In a really twisted way.

18:52.860 --> 18:56.540
Even though the show's humor bordered on the offensive at times, it didn't get a lot

18:56.540 --> 18:58.580
of pushback from the audience.

18:58.580 --> 19:02.180
In another audio commentary, this time in the season one episode, Oh Karma Where Art

19:02.180 --> 19:05.980
Thou, we hear how that that's why the show didn't get as much anger directed towards

19:05.980 --> 19:08.500
it for its more offensive moments.

19:08.500 --> 19:28.340
The show on occasion also has its cake and eats it too by having Earl do all sorts of

19:28.340 --> 19:33.460
horrible things in extended flashback sequences, sometimes nearly lasting the whole episode,

19:33.460 --> 19:35.980
to then see him making up for it in the present.

19:35.980 --> 19:38.620
This makes the whole journey feel more real.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.540
Rather than everything take place within the narrow timeframe of a few days, like on most

19:42.540 --> 19:47.620
other sitcoms, going back several years with numerous flashbacks creates a more realistic

19:47.620 --> 19:52.340
length of time for Earl to grow and the audience has been seeing that the whole time, since

19:52.340 --> 19:56.820
that's the premise of the series, so they can be a bit more forgiving of Earl in the

19:56.820 --> 19:57.820
past.

19:57.820 --> 20:01.660
Or even people in the present who have yet to have undergone Earl's positive influence

20:01.660 --> 20:03.260
or gone on his journey.

20:03.260 --> 20:07.020
The passage of time needed to improve as a person feels particularly real when it comes

20:07.020 --> 20:12.140
to how Earl begins to mend his relationship with his father, Carl, played by Bo Bridges.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.940
When we first see them together, shortly after Earl has started his list in the episode,

20:15.940 --> 20:21.820
Cost Dad the Election, we can see what a lifetime of Earl's bad behavior has done to the relationship.

20:21.820 --> 20:31.780
Earl is trying to convince his dad to run for mayor after Earl ruined his last campaign.

20:31.780 --> 20:35.960
Earl drags Carl back into another mayoral election, and while it looks like Carl might

20:35.960 --> 20:40.040
win this one, Earl accidentally screws it up again when he gets arrested for falling

20:40.040 --> 20:41.040
on a cop.

20:41.040 --> 20:52.220
But the real tragedy is that, Carl just can't believe Earl is trying to do better.

20:52.220 --> 21:10.160
But that's not the whole story.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.840
A few episodes later, in Dad's Car, we see Earl's efforts start to pay off when his

21:14.840 --> 21:20.220
attempt to return Carl's lost Mustang reveals that the car was meant for Earl, which has

21:20.220 --> 21:22.640
Earl putting himself on his own list.

21:22.640 --> 21:40.240
Earl doesn't just get the car, but the project of he and his dad putting it back together.

21:40.240 --> 21:44.280
Perhaps the sweetest part of the relationship is in the season 4 episode, Monkeys Take a

21:44.280 --> 21:50.160
Bath, where Carl finds out that his wife, Kay, played by Nancy Lenahan, cheated on him.

21:50.160 --> 21:54.680
After learning that payback isn't going to take the pain away, Carl and Earl bond

21:54.680 --> 22:16.800
over having been married to women who were unfaithful.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.820
Admittedly, this is pretty funny, it's also really beautiful.

22:20.820 --> 22:24.920
What Earl and Carl give each other in this exchange is freedom from the chains of a masculine

22:24.920 --> 22:29.220
repression of emotions, and they both learn the power of forgiveness.

22:29.220 --> 22:33.660
If this series is about Earl seeking forgiveness from others, this episode, and this final

22:33.660 --> 22:37.340
part of his journey with his father, reveal that he also needed to find a way to forgive

22:37.340 --> 22:41.500
others himself, because sometimes, even Earl is the victim.

22:41.500 --> 22:46.280
In this case, the victim of a society that told him he wasn't allowed to cry.

22:46.280 --> 22:56.640
And anyone raised as a boy can certainly relate to that.

22:56.640 --> 23:06.040
Kay Hickey describes her sons like this.

23:06.040 --> 23:10.080
I would rather say that Randy is… not complex.

23:10.080 --> 23:14.640
But that doesn't make him any less worthy of the respect and admiration one has for

23:14.640 --> 23:15.640
Earl.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.240
One of the first things we learn about Randy is how much he cares about his brother.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.680
And it's not so much that he needs Earl to babysit him all the time, but that Randy

23:22.680 --> 23:24.400
chooses to be with his brother.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.440
This makes Randy the perfect karma partner for Earl.

23:27.440 --> 23:44.640
Earl sums it up well in the season 1 episode, Monkeys in Space, when he says…

23:44.640 --> 23:48.680
Earl's appreciation of Randy, not just as a helper, but as a brother, is evident

23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
throughout the series.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.680
You get a real sense that they were always close, but if anything, working on the list

23:53.680 --> 23:57.920
has brought them even closer together, particularly when Randy goes the extra mile to help Earl

23:57.920 --> 24:01.560
with his list, even if it means putting his own wants on hold.

24:01.560 --> 24:16.160
This is from the season 1 episode, Still Beer from a Golfer.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.960
Earl and Randy have a very sweet relationship.

24:17.960 --> 24:22.120
They're perhaps not typical brothers in that they sleep in the same bed and spend

24:22.120 --> 24:25.640
every day together, but they support each other in everything they do.

24:25.640 --> 24:30.120
Randy's ability to do good reinforces the point made about doing good being a relatively

24:30.120 --> 24:31.760
simple proposition.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.840
If Earl can do it, why not Randy?

24:33.840 --> 24:38.100
His whole character serves as an extreme example of one of the points I mentioned about Earl,

24:38.100 --> 24:42.040
that doing good does not require some sophisticated set of ethics.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.320
In season 4's Got the Babysitter Pregnant, we get a sense of how far Randy has come when

24:46.320 --> 25:03.040
he fends for himself while helping someone on Earl's list.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.680
With Randy having someone to look up to him the way he looked up to Earl, Randy starts

25:06.680 --> 25:10.780
living by Earl's positive example, taking care of the guy and trying to get his life

25:10.780 --> 25:11.780
in order.

25:11.780 --> 25:15.400
And Randy reveals just how much his adventures with Earl have changed him for the better.

25:15.400 --> 25:30.280
Although Earl does take care of Randy to a degree, it's important that this is a

25:30.280 --> 25:40.240
voluntary relationship and Randy does his job as well, taking care of Earl.

25:40.240 --> 25:45.240
Going back to the label of slow, we do need to address how Randy is often depicted on

25:45.240 --> 25:48.700
the show as being less bright than most of the people around him.

25:48.700 --> 25:53.260
In the season 2 episode, Harassed a Reporter, we see how some people view Randy when a news

25:53.260 --> 25:57.860
story covering Earl's list tries to tug on the heartstrings of the audience by putting

25:57.860 --> 26:10.220
Randy in a certain light.

26:10.220 --> 26:14.300
When Randy confronts the reporter about how she deceptively edited the footage, she says

26:14.300 --> 26:20.080
it was revenge for all the times he ruined her live broadcasts in the past.

26:20.080 --> 26:33.480
Randy, who had been feeling overlooked compared to his do-gooder brother, takes the reporter's

26:33.480 --> 26:47.460
words rather well.

26:47.460 --> 26:51.060
Randy may not be a genius, but his ability to look on the bright side here reveals a

26:51.060 --> 26:55.100
good heart and a mindset that doesn't let him get too trapped in self-pity.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.340
But more important is that his fear of being labeled special reveals how labels like that

26:59.340 --> 27:00.600
trap people.

27:00.600 --> 27:04.820
It would turn Randy into an object of pity and mockery, and he's so much more than

27:04.820 --> 27:07.000
what his grades and score are like.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.980
In other shows, characters like Randy don't get nearly as much screen time unless they're

27:10.980 --> 27:13.480
there to be mocked with brief one-liners.

27:13.480 --> 27:17.480
And more than being a big part of the show, Randy has a really fulfilling life.

27:17.480 --> 27:22.520
He falls in love multiple times, he goes on adventures, and when Earl is incapacitated,

27:22.520 --> 27:26.000
he steps up for his brother and takes the list on himself.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.040
Randy gets to be a part of the show just the way everyone else is, and more so than just

27:30.040 --> 27:33.080
about every other character aside from Earl.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.520
Randy is definitely not common, but we don't need to label him with a condition in need

27:37.520 --> 27:38.720
of treatment.

27:38.720 --> 27:43.920
Being different is not always a medical condition, and Randy is still a valuable and important

27:43.920 --> 27:46.480
part of Camden County.

27:46.480 --> 27:50.920
Another big part of Randy's story, at least in the first two seasons, is his crush on

27:50.920 --> 27:51.920
Catalina.

27:51.920 --> 27:57.380
Randy's fixation here is a bit creepy at times, and a bit strange considering we see

27:57.380 --> 28:01.340
him date another woman within the time period he has a crush on Catalina.

28:01.340 --> 28:05.780
Even after Randy marries Catalina to deal with her citizenship issues, he still can't

28:05.780 --> 28:11.500
bring himself to be honest with her, and when he does, she only pretends to return his feelings.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.820
Catalina then takes Joy's advice to make herself as gross as possible so they can ask

28:14.820 --> 28:17.340
Saks and she can turn Randy off forever.

28:17.340 --> 28:21.860
And it works, Randy is grossed out, but Catalina suddenly regrets it because Randy is apparently

28:21.860 --> 28:26.940
great at Saks and their roles are reversed, with Catalina longing for Randy and him being

28:26.940 --> 28:29.120
oblivious and uninterested.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.700
And then the show just kinda drops that whole story and never really brings it up again.

28:32.700 --> 28:36.600
The whole misadventure would feel strange not to mention, but perhaps it serves as an example

28:36.600 --> 28:40.580
of why certain plotlines are introduced and then dropped in the series.

28:40.580 --> 28:44.580
Personally, I suspect Randy's strength as a character is part of the reason this plotline

28:44.580 --> 28:45.580
got scrapped.

28:45.580 --> 28:49.580
He was so versatile and capable of so much that he didn't need a running premise to

28:49.580 --> 28:54.260
fuel story ideas, he got to generate them all on his own by being himself.

28:54.260 --> 28:59.300
He never really needed the crush on Catalina to make him interesting, he was always interesting.

28:59.300 --> 29:08.220
Ethan Subley touched on this briefly in a panel discussion.

29:08.220 --> 29:12.740
Randy is always the same because the best parts of him don't really need to change.

29:12.740 --> 29:17.140
Sure he grows and changes because of Earl's positive influence, but deep down he was always

29:17.140 --> 29:21.540
a sweet guy with a good heart and his unique perspective of the world let him see things

29:21.540 --> 29:26.100
that other people didn't, and sometimes that's all you need to tell good stories.

29:26.100 --> 29:30.780
As one example of a fun Randy-centered story, in season 4's We've Got Spirit, we find

29:30.780 --> 29:39.440
out that Randy has always dreamed of being a cheerleader.

29:39.440 --> 29:43.260
We see Randy take the lead, inspiring the other cheerleaders at the camp, and when it's

29:43.260 --> 29:47.140
finally time to perform, he goes out there and shows everyone what he's got, even if

29:47.140 --> 29:55.940
everyone in Camden only showed up to have a laugh.

29:55.940 --> 30:02.460
And this time, it's Earl who steps up to support Randy.

30:02.460 --> 30:04.860
The Camden Squad wins everyone over.

30:04.860 --> 30:09.380
A nice touch in this episode is that, even though Randy is doing his own thing, it doesn't

30:09.380 --> 30:11.740
mean he doesn't need Earl to support him.

30:11.740 --> 30:15.380
If Randy is always backing up Earl, Earl can also do the same for Randy.

30:15.380 --> 30:19.580
I personally don't have a brother, but I know if I did, I'd want a relationship

30:19.580 --> 30:29.700
to be like Randy's and Earl's.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.860
Joy Turner is not an easy woman to love.

30:32.860 --> 30:36.300
She's rude, mean, and self-absorbed.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.340
In the early episodes of the series, it's almost as though she's being set up to be

30:39.340 --> 30:43.940
the villain, trying to kill Earl so she can get his lottery winnings, but the series quickly

30:43.940 --> 30:48.820
readjusted and took some time to portray Joy in a more sympathetic light, at least

30:48.820 --> 30:49.820
a little bit.

30:49.820 --> 30:53.940
Jamie Pressley's portrayal of Joy was a major standout early in the show's run.

30:53.940 --> 30:57.740
Pressley was the only member of the principal cast nominated for an Emmy for her performance

30:57.740 --> 31:08.940
on the series, and she won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2007.

31:08.940 --> 31:12.740
It was well-earned, and you can see Joy's role in the series expanding as they realized

31:12.740 --> 31:14.740
how good Pressley was playing her.

31:42.740 --> 31:50.340
In an interview, Pressley described the appeal of Joy as being an inner voice women wished

31:50.340 --> 31:51.340
they could channel.

31:51.340 --> 31:56.340
Believe it or not, I have women come up to me all the time saying, repeating all the

31:56.340 --> 32:03.340
one-liners that Joy has, because there's a little bit of Joy in every woman that wants

32:03.340 --> 32:04.820
to come out sometimes.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.740
But what made the character work, and seems so particularly convincing, was her gradually

32:09.740 --> 32:11.820
revealed range as a character.

32:11.820 --> 32:16.220
When Joy and Darnell get married in Season 1's Joy's Wedding, it becomes a list item

32:16.220 --> 32:24.180
for Earl when he drunkenly ruins it.

32:24.180 --> 32:28.300
Things don't get too much better when, while planning Joy's dream wedding, Earl sleeps

32:28.300 --> 32:29.300
with Joy.

32:29.300 --> 32:33.020
Darnell is crushed when he finds out, and the wedding only goes forward when he realizes

32:33.020 --> 32:49.500
the full depth of Joy's feelings.

32:49.500 --> 32:54.140
Earl is very much an early work in progress, particularly in these early episodes, and

32:54.140 --> 32:57.660
Joy represents something similar throughout the run of the series.

32:57.660 --> 33:02.980
Although Earl is an imperfect convert to Karma, Joy is less impressed with the idea of Karma.

33:03.340 --> 33:08.500
But as the series progresses, we, very slowly, see Joy begin to change.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.380
It starts with her and Earl developing a real friendship.

33:11.380 --> 33:15.620
In Season 1's The Bounty Hunter, we see Joy realizing just how far Earl is willing

33:15.620 --> 33:19.760
to go to help her, keeping Joy safe from a bounty hunter, and the two put their marriage

33:19.760 --> 33:28.840
in perspective.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.960
In Season 2's Blow, Joy, finding out she has a half-sister, Liberty Washington, played

33:33.960 --> 33:48.720
by Tamala Jones, ends up with Joy becoming a surrogate for her.

33:48.720 --> 33:53.260
And by Season 4, Joy begins to check her own harsh behavior when she sees how it impacts

33:53.260 --> 33:55.780
her kids in the episode, Joy and a Bubble.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.840
What makes for a compelling character is someone who changes throughout the story, whether

34:27.840 --> 34:32.680
they reveal parts of themselves not immediately evident, such as Joy's less abrasive side

34:32.680 --> 34:37.200
coming out, or if a character grows, such as Joy becoming more empathetic to the people

34:37.200 --> 34:38.280
around her.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.440
In the context of My Name is Earl, it speaks to the transformative power of doing good

34:42.440 --> 34:47.140
deeds that both of these things become more apparent as Joy is impacted by the good works

34:47.140 --> 34:49.400
of Earl, and even does a couple herself.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.120
Joy's life goes through some turbulent changes throughout the series.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.560
She nearly goes to prison in one season and ends up in the Witness Protection Program

34:56.560 --> 35:01.460
in another, but the real changes we care about are the ones inside her, the slow glacial

35:01.460 --> 35:06.860
changes that reveal that even this incredibly unlikable woman has the capacity to be better.

35:06.860 --> 35:12.020
Late in Season 4, Earl works to get Joy a spot on the TV game show Estrada or Nada,

35:12.020 --> 35:14.460
in the two-parter Darnell outed.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.980
Throughout the episode, we learn about how Joy dreams of being a celebrity, and she thinks

35:17.980 --> 35:21.220
appearing on this game show is her last chance at that dream.

35:21.220 --> 35:34.600
Her talents, though, are limited.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.840
When appearing on TV leads Darnell's assumed identity to be compromised, more on that later,

35:39.840 --> 35:41.560
they have to go into hiding.

35:41.560 --> 35:52.580
But Crabman risks it all to let Joy live her dream.

35:52.580 --> 35:58.460
And we see Joy show up that smug Eric Estrada.

35:58.460 --> 36:06.920
Of course, none of that would have been possible without a few key assists from Earl, and we

36:06.920 --> 36:23.160
get an idea of how far the relationship has come.

36:23.160 --> 36:26.680
Joy and Darnell go into hiding for a few episodes, but when Joy is living the rich lifestyle

36:26.680 --> 36:31.480
she thought she wanted, it reinforces that she was already happy with what she had.

36:31.480 --> 36:35.680
They do return to their status quo of living in the trailer park in Camden, but even before

36:35.680 --> 36:39.960
all that silliness, we see in this two-parter just how much Joy has in her life.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.920
She has a husband who loves her, two kids who depend on her, and great friends like

36:43.920 --> 36:48.580
Randy and Earl, and her harsh exterior is made less bitter with that knowledge.

36:48.580 --> 36:52.040
And while she's still hard as nails, she can find the space to be happy and appreciate

36:52.040 --> 36:53.240
the life she has.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.680
Life doesn't need to dramatically change for her.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.680
All she needs is a willingness to see what she already has around her.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.360
That's part of the lesson Joy learns, and it's made possible because the people around

37:02.360 --> 37:05.920
her stopped doing bad things and started doing good things.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.440
Good works don't need to give someone a mansion, it just needs to give them a new

37:09.440 --> 37:16.880
way of looking at their life.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.400
My Name is Earl had a number of really strange episodes.

37:20.400 --> 37:24.520
There are brief scenes with live-action puppets of the cast, there are multiple episodes where

37:24.520 --> 37:28.440
the people of Camden are in an episode of Cops, and there's one fun episode where

37:28.440 --> 37:32.600
the opening credits get recut to feature different characters, but these are relatively

37:32.600 --> 37:34.400
short and self-contained.

37:34.400 --> 37:39.880
The most ambitious project of the show is undoubtedly its entire third season.

37:39.880 --> 37:44.240
Set up in the Season 2 finale, The Trial, we see Joy, who had spent much of Season 2 worried

37:44.240 --> 37:47.960
about going to prison after stealing a truck, finally go to trial.

37:47.960 --> 37:52.040
The evidence is tipping against Joy, namely recordings of a terrified Earl calling the

37:52.040 --> 37:57.280
cops on her from the time they were married, so Earl feeling responsible does something

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
drastic.

37:58.280 --> 38:15.280
Earl sees this as a form of karma, a punishment for all the crimes he's committed, and he

38:15.280 --> 38:17.600
sentenced to two years in prison.

38:17.600 --> 38:23.880
He even asked to give up his list.

38:23.880 --> 38:28.160
On most other shows, this finale is a corner the show would have to write itself out of

38:28.160 --> 38:32.360
in the Season 3 premiere, and we would see Earl leave prison at the end of the episode

38:32.360 --> 38:34.800
to get back to the usual status quo.

38:34.800 --> 38:40.000
Instead, My Name is Earl leaned into this idea of Earl in prison and reinvented itself

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
for its entire third season.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.060
The third season can effectively be split into three acts.

38:45.060 --> 38:49.640
The first has Earl in prison, the second has Earl in a coma, and the last has Earl as a

38:49.640 --> 38:50.640
married man.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.240
That's obviously a lot to happen, so let's go through this season in more detail.

38:55.240 --> 38:59.720
Earl's life has been improving by working on his list, and as he's done good things,

38:59.720 --> 39:01.240
good things have come to him.

39:01.240 --> 39:05.400
There were always exceptions when times would get tough, and his faith in karma and the

39:05.400 --> 39:10.600
list was tested, but by the end of each episode, he was more or less through the worst of it.

39:10.600 --> 39:14.320
It wasn't until the beginning of Season 3 that we see Earl face his most challenging

39:14.320 --> 39:16.440
test, going to prison.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.960
One of his first real challenges is finding a gang for protection.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.440
I'm just saying, I don't see why I have to shave my head.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.440
It hates in your heart, not in your hair.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.200
Forget it, I'm out.

39:31.200 --> 39:36.000
Earl finds a better way of surviving in prison by deciding to stay himself and keep doing

39:36.000 --> 39:37.400
good things for others.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.880
I realize that no matter how scared I get, I'm going to survive in prison and I have

39:41.880 --> 39:43.880
to do it as myself.

39:43.880 --> 39:49.800
Because my name isn't inmate number 28301-016, my name is Earl.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.480
And while it makes his life in prison better, Earl is still left with the difficult question

39:53.480 --> 39:57.520
of how, even though he's doing good things, he's still trapped in prison.

39:57.520 --> 40:02.440
At first, it seems as though karma will reward him as his good deeds start leading him toward

40:02.440 --> 40:07.200
an early release, with the warden, played by Craig T. Nelson, shaving time off Earl's

40:07.200 --> 40:10.560
sentence for each time he assists the warden in some kind of project.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.840
Earl, you've got six months and ten days left in here.

40:13.840 --> 40:18.720
Now you make this program work and I will give you a certificate for six months off

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
your sentence.

40:19.720 --> 40:24.360
But when Earl is getting close to his release, the warden screws him over.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.480
I don't know what I would do here without you to cover my ass.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.960
Well, I guess you're going to find out tomorrow.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.560
Thanks again, sir.

40:32.560 --> 40:42.320
A frustrated Earl resorts to making a prison escape.

40:42.320 --> 40:46.480
Unfortunately, the escape attempt is foiled, but when Earl finds out the warden formerly

40:46.480 --> 41:01.760
had a career in porn, in the episode titled, Early Release.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.760
The resolution here doesn't quite work in Earl's mind.

41:04.760 --> 41:09.640
He responded to being screwed over by doing something bad using blackmail and now he was

41:09.640 --> 41:18.120
being rewarded for it.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.640
First Earl is punished for doing something good and then rewarded for doing something

41:21.640 --> 41:22.640
bad.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.400
So what does that say about karma?

41:24.400 --> 41:29.200
In the next episode, Bad Earl, we see Earl revert to his bad ways and he turns his back

41:29.200 --> 41:30.320
on the list.

41:30.320 --> 41:48.680
In this clip, Earl was filling in for a stripper, hence, the outfit.

41:48.680 --> 41:52.560
The episode raises an interesting question of how doing good things can have a selfish

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
motive.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.760
Earl wants a reward for his good deeds.

41:55.760 --> 41:59.900
As Earl behaves badly, he drifts further from his loved ones and Randy tries to convince

41:59.900 --> 42:15.660
him to change back to good Earl with an earnest speech.

42:15.660 --> 42:25.260
But it doesn't work.

42:25.260 --> 42:29.380
Good things are happening for other people, but for Earl, that isn't enough anymore and

42:29.380 --> 42:55.340
he ends up right where he started in the first episode.

42:55.340 --> 42:59.180
When Earl finds out the person who hit him is Billy, played by Alyssa Milano, he finally

42:59.180 --> 43:01.300
believes he's found his reward.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.980
As a quick rewind, Billy is the ex-girlfriend of Frank, a buddy of Earl's who is locked

43:04.980 --> 43:05.980
up with him.

43:05.980 --> 43:09.900
Part of Earl helping Frank in prison was convincing him to let Billy find a better life without

43:09.900 --> 43:14.800
Frank's bad influence and Earl developed a small crush on Billy only to now be reunited

43:14.800 --> 43:16.300
when her car hits him.

43:16.300 --> 43:21.260
And then karma comes for Billy too.

43:21.260 --> 43:24.580
While in a coma, Earl enters a sitcom fantasy land.

43:24.580 --> 43:29.140
While trapped there, Randy figures that working on list items will save Earl and so Randy

43:29.140 --> 43:30.780
does them in Earl's place.

43:30.780 --> 43:45.220
And eventually, Earl is rescued from his coma in the episode, Killer Ball.

43:45.220 --> 43:49.020
Earl finds Billy and the two get married and even though Earl used the last of his lottery

43:49.020 --> 43:53.980
winnings putting on a prison prom, Billy has come into some insurance money of her own.

43:53.980 --> 43:58.500
So the moral of the story, at least at this point, seems to be that if you persevere with

43:58.500 --> 44:03.700
karma eventually, through the people you helped, you will receive the reward of being married

44:03.700 --> 44:05.700
to Alyssa Milano.

44:05.700 --> 44:08.120
Except the season isn't over yet.

44:08.120 --> 44:12.540
Over the next few episodes, we find out that marrying a woman because she was your coma

44:12.540 --> 44:18.200
fantasy doesn't quite work and Earl realizes that he and Billy are a bad fit.

44:18.200 --> 44:32.680
She suggests the worst in the episode, Girl Earl.

44:32.680 --> 44:37.360
In the episode, Camdenites, while struggling with Billy, Earl works on his list crossing

44:37.360 --> 44:39.840
off Dee Dee, played by Tracy Ashton.

44:39.840 --> 44:43.880
The one-legged woman he ran out on was something of a running joke throughout the series so

44:43.880 --> 44:47.220
seemed like a big deal for him to finally be tackling this list item.

44:47.220 --> 44:51.080
He thought by helping her it would improve his relationship with Billy since this was

44:51.080 --> 44:55.340
a woman he'd rung and maybe that's the reason he was having bad luck with women in general.

44:55.340 --> 45:08.100
All Dee Dee wants is for Earl to understand her by walking a mile in her shoe.

45:08.100 --> 45:12.300
Although Earl thought he would be helping his relationship with Billy by crossing Dee Dee

45:12.300 --> 45:15.020
off his list, it doesn't really help.

45:15.380 --> 45:20.300
In fact, the only thing that really helps here is that Billy and Earl eventually separate,

45:20.300 --> 45:24.860
with Billy adopting a more rustic lifestyle leaving her insurance money with Earl.

45:24.860 --> 45:29.500
So at the end of all this hardship, the only thing even resembling a reward for Earl is

45:29.500 --> 45:32.940
that he's giving the remnants of Billy's insurance money.

45:45.100 --> 45:49.580
And Earl is going to do what he was doing with his lottery winnings and that's help other people.

46:08.780 --> 46:13.980
In addition to the fact that Billy being a reward is pretty creepy, as a person shouldn't

46:13.980 --> 46:15.740
be a prize to be won.

46:15.740 --> 46:19.900
The overarching message of this season is that Earl should not be doing good for any

46:19.900 --> 46:22.060
sort of external reward.

46:22.060 --> 46:25.940
He should be doing it because he's internally motivated to do good for others.

46:25.940 --> 46:29.420
In the first two seasons, you might argue that Earl still imagined he'd get some magical

46:29.420 --> 46:34.200
reward at the end of his list, but the third season establishes that this journey may not

46:34.200 --> 46:36.580
end with some sort of grand reward.

46:36.580 --> 46:41.580
Rather, the reason to do this is not some fabulous cash prize like an even bigger lottery

46:41.580 --> 46:46.460
winnings, but instead feel that personal satisfaction with his life, the joy that comes

46:46.460 --> 46:47.860
from helping others.

46:47.860 --> 46:52.420
At the end of season 3, Earl's life appears the same on the outside, but on the inside

46:52.420 --> 46:54.380
he's grown into a better version of himself.

46:54.380 --> 46:57.220
He's now doing good deeds for a better reason.

46:57.220 --> 47:00.500
You might say that's still kind of selfish because he's getting a good feeling from

47:00.500 --> 47:04.580
helping others, but going from an external reward to an internal one, skipping the need

47:04.580 --> 47:08.600
for material comforts to get that good feeling, has shown Earl a simpler and more effective

47:08.600 --> 47:13.320
way of enjoying his life, and had the series run longer, maybe his drive to do good things

47:13.320 --> 47:15.760
could have been explored on an even deeper level.

47:15.760 --> 47:20.920
But sadly, this giant step in season 3 is the only one we get in the series.

47:20.920 --> 47:26.280
Structurally, the third season was also very different when compared to how other sitcoms

47:26.280 --> 47:28.680
tend to tell long-form stories.

47:28.680 --> 47:32.760
In most of the shows that have done similar things with season-long arcs, they're not

47:32.760 --> 47:35.320
quite as comprehensive as My Name is Earl's.

47:35.320 --> 47:39.120
Some examples would include the second season of Cheers, where we saw Sam and Diane trying

47:39.120 --> 47:43.680
to be a couple, the fourth season of Parks and Rec with Leslie Knope running for office,

47:43.680 --> 47:47.780
and the fifth season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air with Will and Lisa falling in love.

47:47.780 --> 47:52.160
But the difference between My Name is Earl's season-long arc and these other shows is that,

47:52.160 --> 47:56.500
while most other arcs featured change to a show's premise to create different dynamics

47:56.500 --> 48:01.520
in each episode, telling standalone episodes that simply reflect that new premise, My Name

48:01.520 --> 48:06.560
is Earl used a season-long arc to tell a much bigger, more complicated story.

48:06.560 --> 48:10.760
It tested Earl's commitment to karma and examined what really motivated him.

48:10.760 --> 48:15.680
It helped him realize the difference between a desire to do good and a desire for a reward.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.080
And Earl's understanding of that dynamic changes throughout the season as we see him

48:19.080 --> 48:21.680
in many different circumstances.

48:21.680 --> 48:26.320
And at the end of it all, he grows and evolves as a character in a way that you don't typically

48:26.320 --> 48:28.360
see in other shows.

48:28.360 --> 48:32.440
Season 3 did draw some criticisms from the audience though, particularly the part where

48:32.440 --> 48:34.400
Earl was trapped in a coma.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.720
While referencing classic sitcoms within new ones is a cute idea, later on the show seemed

48:38.720 --> 48:43.780
to acknowledge that certain members of the audience weren't too keen on this meta-joke.

48:43.780 --> 48:56.680
This is a clip referencing that in the fourth season episode, Inside Probe Part 1.

48:56.680 --> 49:00.140
And one interesting artifact of this season is that, when the show had a lengthy break

49:00.140 --> 49:04.960
because of the writers' strike from 2007 to 2008, it came back with a recap ahead of

49:04.960 --> 49:15.760
its return episode delivered by NBC Universal CEO and President Jeff Zucker.

49:15.760 --> 49:20.520
This weird intro was not well-received and even led to a short article on Deadline, an

49:20.520 --> 49:24.760
entertainment industry outlet, asking if Zucker had lost his mind.

49:24.760 --> 49:29.040
It was actually Greg Garcia's idea to have Zucker do this intro, but even so, the intro

49:29.040 --> 49:31.120
would be scrubbed from the DVD release.

49:31.120 --> 49:35.400
And before leaving Season 3 entirely, I do want to highlight a surprisingly good trans

49:35.400 --> 49:49.520
joke.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.600
I think it's important to highlight that joke because, while there are other jokes

49:52.600 --> 49:57.360
in the series that are less kind, including the use of a transphobic slur, this good joke

49:57.360 --> 50:01.400
reveals the capacity to learn and improve from that previous bad behavior, just like

50:01.400 --> 50:02.400
Earl.

50:02.400 --> 50:06.400
Although it should be mentioned that a cis man in a dress is not good casting for a trans

50:06.400 --> 50:10.160
woman, so it's still very much a work in progress.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
Just like Earl.

50:11.160 --> 50:17.920
And I have to acknowledge another moment in Season 3 where Randy is encouraging some anti-jose

50:17.920 --> 50:31.040
violence.

50:31.040 --> 50:35.720
As a Jose, this anti-jose nonsense is deeply disappointing and I hope the show will do

50:35.720 --> 50:36.720
better.

50:36.720 --> 50:41.920
Just do better.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.960
There are a lot of flashbacks in the series.

50:44.960 --> 50:47.600
Some of them go on for nearly a whole episode.

50:47.600 --> 50:53.320
An early example being Season 1's Y2K episode where we see how Earl, Joy, Randy, Darnell,

50:53.320 --> 50:57.760
and Donny, played by Silas Weir Mitchell, handle the impending technological apocalypse

50:57.760 --> 51:06.280
that never was.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.680
My Name is Earl is a show defined by the past of its characters.

51:09.680 --> 51:13.240
Earl's past of wrongdoings is an obvious one, but in the case of other members of the

51:13.240 --> 51:16.720
cast, their pasts are also a big part of their characters.

51:16.720 --> 51:20.960
Catalina is a character whose past gradually gets revealed in the first half of this series.

51:20.960 --> 51:25.120
Not just that she entered the US illegally, but also that, before she became a hotel maid,

51:25.120 --> 51:29.760
she worked as a stripper at Club Chubby, a job she goes back to in the Season 2 episode

51:29.760 --> 51:30.760
Jump for Joy.

51:30.760 --> 51:35.520
And in Season 2's mailbox, we get a slow burn reveal where we find out Catalina has

51:35.520 --> 51:42.220
killed someone.

51:42.220 --> 51:52.700
This is followed up in Season 3's The Frank Factor.

51:52.700 --> 51:55.160
This is a nice example of continuity on the show.

51:55.160 --> 51:59.340
If Earl's story is about him realizing the impact of his past on his present, the same

51:59.340 --> 52:01.380
is true for other characters too.

52:01.380 --> 52:05.540
We learn more about Catalina's past when she is deported, and Earl and Randy have to

52:05.540 --> 52:09.100
rescue her in the Season 2 two-parter south of the border.

52:09.100 --> 52:13.860
Although she's sent to what we're told is her hometown in Mexico, later on in the

52:13.860 --> 52:18.780
series it's revealed that Catalina is from La Paz, which is the capital of Bolivia.

52:18.780 --> 52:22.540
This is an example of the show playing fast and loose with its continuity.

52:22.540 --> 52:27.160
It's pretty common for sitcoms to place comedy over continuity, but it's a bit more noticeable

52:27.160 --> 52:31.500
in My Name is Earl, where a character's history is the basis of so much of what they

52:31.500 --> 52:36.860
do in the series, and the show certainly doesn't help itself with the many flashbacks it includes.

52:36.860 --> 52:40.740
That all said, there are enough consistent facts to make sense of these characters'

52:40.740 --> 52:41.740
history.

52:41.740 --> 52:47.180
Regardless of whether it's her home country or not, Mexico is where Catalina is deported

52:47.180 --> 52:48.180
to.

52:48.180 --> 52:51.660
And Randy marries Catalina so she can come back to America.

52:51.660 --> 52:54.980
Of course, as we already talked about, it doesn't work out for them.

52:54.980 --> 52:58.700
And it's around here that Catalina's character seems to drift around a bit, as if there was

52:58.700 --> 53:00.740
no definite plans for her.

53:00.740 --> 53:04.460
While she's a fun addition to the cast and an interesting character, the key to making

53:04.460 --> 53:07.180
her interesting is often done by explaining her history.

53:07.180 --> 53:11.200
We see this whole truth for Darnell as well, a character who is very mysterious in the

53:11.200 --> 53:15.180
early seasons, as the only clue we get to his history is that he's in the witness

53:15.180 --> 53:19.020
relocation program and his name used to be Harry Monroe.

53:19.020 --> 53:22.760
It isn't until the show's fourth season we finally get some answers as to who Harry

53:22.760 --> 53:26.100
Monroe is in the two-parter Darnell outed.

53:26.100 --> 53:30.780
While, as mentioned earlier, a lot of this two-parter is dedicated to Joy trying to show

53:30.780 --> 53:35.620
up Erika Strada and prove she can be a celebrity, what complicates the plan is Darnell appearing

53:35.620 --> 53:53.540
on national television and having his cover identity blown.

53:53.540 --> 53:58.420
In My Name is Alias, a few episodes later, we get a more complete answer as to who Darnell

53:58.420 --> 54:15.500
is when his secret agent father, played by Danny Glover, comes to make amends with him.

54:15.500 --> 54:19.500
Darnell left his life as a government assassin when he was asked to kill a child.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.780
When he testified against the agency in front of a subcommittee, the agency wanted revenge

54:23.780 --> 54:26.740
and Darnell had to go into witness protection.

54:26.740 --> 54:30.340
While this history for Darnell wasn't planned from the beginning, the show's creators

54:30.340 --> 54:44.540
always knew he'd have a wild backstory.

54:44.540 --> 54:47.900
These revelations do contradict the fact that we saw Darnell's family in the season one

54:47.900 --> 54:51.900
episode Joy's Wedding, though that's explained away as them being other people in the witness

54:51.900 --> 54:53.300
protection program.

54:53.300 --> 54:56.620
Both Darnell and Catalina are their most interesting when their pasts confront them

54:56.620 --> 55:00.220
in the present, along with the show's many flashbacks and Earl's quests.

55:00.220 --> 55:04.180
This is how change over time is represented in the series, and it gives the impression

55:04.180 --> 55:08.580
that these characters are more rich and detailed than what little we may see them do within

55:08.580 --> 55:10.580
the context of an episode.

55:10.580 --> 55:13.420
There's always the subtle suggestion that there's more to these characters than meets

55:13.420 --> 55:17.620
the eye, and some part of their past is just waiting to leap out from the shadows.

55:17.620 --> 55:21.660
Catalina and Darnell are both similar to Earl in that they're happier in the present because

55:21.660 --> 55:24.140
of the choices they've made to live happier lives.

55:24.140 --> 55:27.900
They certainly aren't perfect, but the worst conditions of their past are a reminder of

55:27.900 --> 55:32.460
why they chose to leave their old lives in Bolivia and as a secret agent, respectively.

55:32.460 --> 55:34.640
They were miserable in both places.

55:34.640 --> 55:38.300
Much like Earl making a list of wrongdoings and making up for them, the changes Catalina

55:38.300 --> 55:39.980
and Darnell make were a challenge.

55:39.980 --> 55:44.420
Leaving a life behind, no matter how you do it, is always difficult, but part of the show's

55:44.420 --> 55:48.660
optimism comes from that willingness to make a try against difficult odds, and the courage

55:48.660 --> 55:58.540
it takes to remake your own life.

55:58.540 --> 56:03.020
Camden County is one of those fictional places in a TV show that never gets a precise location

56:03.020 --> 56:04.420
in the real world.

56:04.420 --> 56:08.620
The closest we get to any confirmation is that it definitely is not the same Camden

56:08.620 --> 56:10.220
County in New Jersey.

56:10.220 --> 56:14.220
Its local accent and complete lack of snow at Christmas time suggest it's somewhere

56:14.220 --> 56:17.460
in the southern US, but it's hard to be more precise than that.

56:17.460 --> 56:22.580
We can contrast this to the vaguely named Big City in the season 1 episode, Stole P's

56:22.580 --> 56:27.140
HD Cart, where we see Earl struggle to get any justice from a big corporation trying

56:27.140 --> 56:41.980
to muscle a local hot dog cart out of Camden.

56:41.980 --> 56:57.020
That Earl learns an important truth.

56:57.020 --> 57:01.660
This episode has a fun message about how corporations exploit labor and that real restorative justice

57:01.660 --> 57:06.180
involves going Robin Hood on a big corporation, but there's another larger message here

57:06.180 --> 57:10.720
about how the people of Camden, especially Earl and his friends, exist outside the world

57:10.720 --> 57:12.680
of white shirts and ties.

57:12.680 --> 57:17.000
This needs to be understood as not a complete rejection of living in a society, as we see

57:17.000 --> 57:21.160
Earl learn the value of having a functioning government in the season 1 episode didn't

57:21.160 --> 57:22.160
pay taxes.

57:22.160 --> 57:32.880
Earl's vision of a more just world is one where people help other people, and the world

57:32.880 --> 57:37.120
of big business, represented by the big city, is a rejection of that ethos.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.320
It embraces selfishness and the exploitation of others.

57:40.320 --> 57:43.920
Camden doesn't feel like a real place because it operates on such a heightened sense

57:43.920 --> 57:48.120
of reality, which is probably why it doesn't feel unrealistic for Earl's change of heart

57:48.120 --> 57:50.000
to have such a wide ripple effect.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.520
But it cuts in other ways too, such as in the season 2 episode, Van Hickey, where Earl's

57:54.520 --> 58:14.320
longtime friend, Ralph, played by Giovanni Rubisi, threatens to kill him.

58:14.320 --> 58:18.600
The impact of this dynamic is explained well in the DVD audio commentary for that episode.

58:18.600 --> 58:28.960
Camden is a place where some scary stuff goes down, and you can believe characters

58:28.960 --> 58:30.880
when they say they're going to try to kill someone.

58:30.880 --> 58:34.920
But in that heightened sense of reality, there's also the possibility to do some good.

58:34.920 --> 58:39.440
As we go through the series, Earl's good deeds create new friends wherever he goes,

58:39.440 --> 58:43.200
helping shape the community into one where everybody helps each other rather than compete

58:43.200 --> 58:44.520
against each other.

58:44.520 --> 58:47.920
But this isn't just a rejection of the capitalist mindset.

58:47.920 --> 58:52.340
It goes a step further by presenting Camden, and Earl's social circle, as a meeting place

58:52.340 --> 59:03.920
for all types of people.

59:03.920 --> 59:08.360
In season 2, with the episode Sticks and Stones, we get a great example when Earl tries to

59:08.360 --> 59:12.280
make up for teasing a girl who had facial hair in school and then finds himself in a

59:12.280 --> 59:33.880
small community of circus performers.

59:33.880 --> 59:38.080
As Earl learns more about the performers as people, he also learns to identify with them

59:38.080 --> 59:41.920
when he's reminded he was teased for having Harry Nipples as a kid.

59:41.920 --> 59:45.400
The episode ends with Earl facing his fear and going off the high dive with his shirt

59:45.400 --> 59:49.560
off, and he's joined by the performers who refuse to hide away in their private community.

59:49.560 --> 59:53.520
It's about learning to have some pride, even if you're a little different, and that

59:53.520 --> 59:55.680
we're all a little different in our own ways.

59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.320
It's a pretty basic message, but the series is more than just bringing in people for an

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.280
episode to say, hey, they're decent people too.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.280
A lot of these characters appear again throughout the series, much in the way Kenny became a

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.480
series regular after the premiere.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.120
These characters don't just show up to teach Earl a lesson, they become active members

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.360
of his community.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:19.000
We see another example in season 1's Teacher Earl, where Earl teaches English as a second

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:37.840
language to make up for all the times he's made fun of people with accents.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.600
Actually something ironic here about the actor who plays Neskabar a lob-lop, Abdul-e-Ngom,

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.400
he actually speaks at least five languages, or six depending on who you believe in the

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.760
DVD commentaries, or maybe seven if you believe everything you read on the internet.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.520
Although the depiction has some of these people borders on the offensive, the series seems

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.520
to develop in its depictions of these characters the same way Earl learns to be more sensitive

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.040
to people who are different.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.840
Much like the circus performers, Neskabar becomes a regular in the series in a lot of

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:24.880
fun and creative ways.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.880
When the series begins, Earl's concept of us is just him and Randy, but as it progresses,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.960
that us grows to include so many more people, not just the obvious editions of Joy, Darnell,

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.920
and Catalina, but also the people he would place in the very undesirable bucket of them.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.960
And importantly, not just to Earl, a lot of these people who become part of the us label

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.760
are often marginalized by society with little access to power, keeping them perpetually

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.440
trapped under the label of them.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.000
Immigrants and people born a little different have every right to be a part of our communities.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.560
Any us worth making is one that includes these people too.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.260
In the season two episode, our cops is on, we get a sense of how big the us is getting

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.160
with numerous cameos from the people of Camden.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.000
A nice bit of subtext in this episode is that even though their lives and relationships

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.360
weren't being improved by Earl in his list since the episode predates it, it does show

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.440
us that they were all in community with one another already.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.000
They were just either strangers or hostile to one another.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.960
The fact that they're all sitting here laughing, drinking, and watching this episode together

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.160
reinforces the transformative nature of doing good deeds and the impact it has on the community.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.840
In the season three episode, Camdenites, when Earl has to untip Joy's trailer, which he

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.880
drugingly tipped over a few episodes earlier, he's assisted by all the people of Camden

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.680
he's helped out over the years.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.080
When I was doing bad things, no one would help me with anything, but now that I was

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.640
doing good things, I had lots of friends willing to pitch in.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.680
And they prove that by working together, they can make their whole community a better place.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.000
And that doing good is infectious.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.560
Now, everybody just calm down.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.220
On May 14th, 2009, the final episode of My Name Is Earl aired, although it wasn't meant

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.720
to be the finale.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.040
Titled Dodge's Dad, the episode centers around Joy finding out that Dodge, her eldest

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.400
son, isn't actually the son of Little Chubby, played by Norm Macdonald.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.840
It turns out that Earl, who raised Dodge thinking he was another man's son, is actually Dodge's

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
biological father.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.840
No.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840
Yep.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840
No.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.400
If anything, you did me, I was drunk.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.020
This is one of the dangers of hooking up at a costume party.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:38.800
But even more shocking than the Dodge revelation is that Earl Jr. isn't actually Darnell's

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800
son.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.000
These three DNAs match, that means it's you and the boys, which makes this one mine

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.040
and it doesn't match any of those.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040
What does that mean?

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.240
It means I'm not Earl Jr.'s father.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.680
And the last line we ever hear from the series is Joy saying,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.240
Now, everybody just calm down.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.360
And we got a giant message saying, to be continued.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.000
Only it wasn't.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.720
Although My Name is Earl premiered to very strong ratings, it gradually slipped as the

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.160
seasons rolled on.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.400
For its fourth season, it had fallen to 60 second place in the ratings, Far Cry from

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.160
its debut at 22nd.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.040
But it is strange that it was cancelled while other NBC shows such as Chuck and Parks and

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.880
Recreation, both with lower ratings, were both renewed.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.960
Whatever the reason, going into that episode, creator Greg Garcia was under the impression

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.440
that this would not be the final season.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.400
Codd completely flat-footed, the only sign that this might be the final episode is the

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.760
production company tag at the end where we see a partially shaved Jason Lee.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.280
Even that suggests that maybe they're not entirely done yet.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.220
After being cancelled by NBC, there were talks with several networks to pick up the series,

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.400
with TBS being a strong contender.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.340
But ultimately, the cost of the series to fulfill its creative vision was just too much

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.460
for any other network to sign on.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.740
And so Earl's ending would remain, at least for now, untold.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:03.740
In a 2013 Reddit Ask Me Anything, Greg Garcia was asked how the series was meant to end.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:08.400
This answer remains our best look at what the future held for Earl Hickey.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.940
We never really got the chance to fully figure it out, but the talk in the writers room was

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:17.540
that Earl Jr's dad was going to be someone famous, like Dave Chappelle or Lil Jon, someone

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.760
that came to town on tour and Joy slept with.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.160
But when we got cancelled, we never got the chance to figure it out.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.960
I was worried about doing a cliffhanger, but I asked NBC if it was safe to do one at the

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.160
end of the season and they told me it was.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.460
I guess it wasn't.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.320
I had always had an ending to Earl, and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to see it happen.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.400
You've got a show about a guy with a list, so not seeing him finish it is a bummer, but

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.380
the truth is he wasn't ever going to finish the list.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.720
The basic idea of the ending was that, while he was stuck on a really hard list item, he

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.200
was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.320
Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.080
They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.900
He asks them where they got the idea for making a list and they tell him that someone came

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.200
to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.080
Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with lists and

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.200
that he's finally put more good into the world than bad.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.400
So at that point, he was going to tear up his list and go live his life.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.640
Talk into the sunset of Freeman with good karma.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.220
There are some interesting post scripts to My Name is Earl's cancellation, such as

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.000
the show not being the only thing that was cancelled.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.400
Anyone who purchased the first DVD set of the series would have seen this fancy little

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.040
flyer advertising a My Name is Earl comic coming from Oni Press.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.520
When asked about this, Greg Garcia explained that this project was abandoned because he

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.600
would have lacked the creative control over it he would have liked.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.400
One project that followed My Name is Earl that did come to fruition was Garcia's next

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.360
series, Raising Hope.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.480
Garcia described the inspiration for the series saying,

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.440
The main inspiration for Raising Hope was the anger over the fact that they cancelled

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.440
My Name is Earl.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:58.300
I wanted to do another single camera comedy so I could quickly hire the same crew that

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.600
I had loved working with for four years.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.880
I was interested in doing a domestic comedy so I thought of the most twisted way I could

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.280
of putting a baby in a house full of people that had no idea what to do with it.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.720
In addition to bringing back his crew, a number of cast members from My Name is Earl

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.080
made cameos throughout the series' run.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.800
There were also some cute nods to the abrupt cancellation of My Name is Earl, such as one

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:36.000
of the characters on Raising Hope revealing that they were a fan.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.940
It would take a whole video to list every reference to My Name is Earl on Raising Hope,

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:45.360
but I did at least want to mention the season 3 episode making the band which almost felt

01:07:45.360 --> 01:08:00.880
like an alternate reality episode of My Name is Earl.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.720
And that's more or less that we got from the residents of Camden County following the

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.240
show's cancellation.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.640
Jason Lee did say in a 2020 interview that he was interested in giving the show a proper

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.740
wrap-up though so far no concrete plans have emerged.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.000
While working on My Name is Earl, Jason Lee also starred in the first Alvin and the Chipmunks

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.160
live-action movie as Dave Seville, a role he'd reprise in its various squeak-walls.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.280
He also appeared on The Memphis Beat and Up All Night.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.120
He's largely stepped away from acting in recent years though he's expressed interest

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.440
in reviving older projects he's worked on such as mall rats and of course My Name

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440
is Earl.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.680
Ethan Suppley has appeared in a number of roles on TV and film after the end of the

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.440
series including roles in The Wolf of Wall Street, Dog, and The Ranch.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.280
In 2014, he reunited with former My Name is Earl co-star Jamie Pressley in the series

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.720
Jennifer Falls.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.960
Jamie Pressley has worked on a number of projects following the cancellation of My Name is Earl.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.160
In addition to the short-lived Jennifer Falls with Ethan Suppley, Pressley also appeared

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.880
on Welcome to Flash, I Hate My Teenage Daughter, and she appeared on seven seasons of the series

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.300
Mom.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.960
After My Name is Earl, Eddie Steeples appeared in the TV series The Guest Book and the movies

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.780
Hot Seat and Jujitsu, currently scheduled to appear in the upcoming movie Fallen Cards.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:21.380
Since My Name is Earl, Nadine Velasquez appeared on the series The League and the movies Snitch

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.600
and Flight.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.160
Most recently she appeared as a part of the principal cast in the ABC series Queens.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.200
My Name is Earl is an unfinished story of redemption and in a way, that story could

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.640
never be finished.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.480
Throughout the series we see Earl make right the wrong deeds of the past, but we also see

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.440
him make mistakes along the way, having to add new items to his list.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.780
It's likely that the work on the list will never be completed and the desire to be an

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.120
ideal person is not going to be completed by Earl himself but will have to be a quest

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.080
picked up by the people around him.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.680
As you can tell from that imaginative finale from Greg Garcia, that was the whole point

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.720
of the series, that doing good doesn't end with some ultimate reward waiting for

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.280
you but rather doing good makes the world a better place and that doing good inspires

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.920
others to do the same, with your reward being able to be part of that better world you all

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920
share together.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.440
It expands the idea of doing good from a solitary exercise to something more communal.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.640
We aren't waiting for an Earl to come save us because we can all start on our own lists

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.840
right now and we can all make the world better together.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.400
The cancellation of My Name is Earl will probably always sting because there's so much more

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.880
growth we could have seen in the series and ending with a cliffhanger is usually not

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.840
a good way to leave off characters.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.180
Even if Earl was never going to finish that list, we could have at least seen his new

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:37.560
struggles with fatherhood or Darnell's changing relationship with the boy he thought was his

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.440
biological son or even just Joy tracking down Earl Jr's real father.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.760
These are the lingering questions that could use a few more episodes or a movie to wrap

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760
up.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.000
But Four Seasons is a lot more than most other shows get and in that four there's still

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.080
a lot of good stuff to be found about the value of trying to be a better person.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.280
And it's the trying that's the key.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.760
No one will ever be perfect and Earl certainly never is.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.280
But his example shows us that anyone, even a dirtbag with no education and a lengthy

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.040
rap sheet, can try to make the world a better place.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:14.800
All it takes is believing in karma and starting with a list.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.940
This will probably come as a surprise to anyone who's watched these retrospectives but I

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.060
usually don't have to go out of my way to find a series.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.140
Most shows that are classics are found streaming pretty much anywhere and special features

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:31.640
and documentaries and whatnot take a bit of digging but can be found with some effort.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.140
My Name is Earl was the first time I actually had to track down physical media in the form

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:42.100
of old DVDs basically doing a lot more work just so I would have as much information as

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.580
possible to put together this video.

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.940
With that in mind I would like to extend an extra special thanks to my Patrons because

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.500
of their support I was able to do this without any serious financial burden and you can see

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.700
their lovely names going up the screen now if you would like to join them and have early

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:02.300
access to videos like this and also finance some tougher ones that take a bit more effort

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.220
to put together you can join my Patreon.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.980
In addition to getting your name in the credits you'll get early access to videos plus lots

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.440
of other fun bonuses and extras as they come.
