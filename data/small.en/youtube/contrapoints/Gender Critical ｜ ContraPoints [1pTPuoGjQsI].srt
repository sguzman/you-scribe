1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,080
rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
Thank you.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,280
It breathed hoarsely.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,800
I smirked and nodded and stood backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous knuckly,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,160
hairy, brilliant paw that clutched it.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,720
The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,960
stubble was already burning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,880
pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,640
scarf dressed from a polished steel women's liberation emblem.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,560
I should have said, you're a man.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,160
The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Piss off.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Let's go, adult human females.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,400
First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
here today, get out.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,640
I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,280
which case like, comment, subscribe.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
radical feminists.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,480
You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,400
are lost lesbian sisters.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,760
You guys do know about trans men, right?

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,520
Male to female is not the only type of transgender person.

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,120
It's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned, people who were always,

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,520
people who identify.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
TERFs don't like being called TERFs.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,640
They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,080
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,960
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,200
construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,600
In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,040
bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,840
And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
want to be balanced.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,400
used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,460
And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,960
with men and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,160
men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,720
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,160
first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,840
It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,480
And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
would feel that way.

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,240
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,460
And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,820
gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,700
conversation debate idea, marketplace expression discourse.

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,680
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,060
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of germane greer.

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,580
And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling extra-biological.

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,140
And when the full moon shines, she speaks.

55
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,700
Ugh, this is agony.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Can you imagine?

58
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,940
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure

59
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,700
she doesn't hate trans people.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
She just has a few concerns.

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,740
You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore or you're accused

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,740
of transphobia.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,540
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we the public never got

64
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,980
a chance to debate.

65
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,140
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are allowing biological males to run rampant

66
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,580
in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous

67
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,580
dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

68
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,740
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,300
She goes on like that for hours.

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,660
It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

71
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,660
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

72
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,940
Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,420
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

74
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,940
Scholars remain divided.

75
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,980
It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.

76
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,500
You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,060
It's PC Ron Amock.

79
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,380
It's a Hana catastrophe.

80
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,220
Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
untreated sewage.

82
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,740
We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure.

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,380
We have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates

84
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,180
of family rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,540
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,

86
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,140
unambiguous slogans.

87
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,660
Trans women are women!

88
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Which is true.

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
We are women.

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,420
But, ooh, that was a sinister but.

91
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Watch out for that.

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,820
What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most

93
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,460
people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,900
And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not trans feminism,

95
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,380
might wonder things like, how can you be a woman without the oppression experiences

96
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
of girlhood?

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,860
Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

98
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,460
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

99
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,580
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time, they're

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,420
just brandished as weapons against us.

101
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,540
You know, it's like when a man asks, if society is so sexist against women, then why is it

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,540
that men are 97% of combat fatalities, feminazis?

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,020
Like you could sit there for 3 hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal, but wouldn't

104
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,700
you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,860
Because 9 times out of 10, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's

106
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,620
just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.

107
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,420
And the same goes for people telling me,

108
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,740
You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a

109
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
woman?

110
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,220
Could you define womanhood for me?

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,660
Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

112
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,780
But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,

113
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,180
and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.

114
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,060
Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.

115
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,420
In this video, I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with

116
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,900
gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers

117
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,660
rather than dogmatic ones.

118
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,180
Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,

119
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,100
and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly.

120
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,100
So if I do fuck something up, well, just read me the filth on Twitter like you always do,

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
you little shits.

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Love you!

123
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,940
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

124
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,940
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

125
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,300
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today, only the catch is that some of them are actually

126
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
men.

127
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Oops, wrong channel.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,220
Concern 1.

129
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,580
Gender Metaphysics.

130
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,900
There's no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

131
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,140
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

132
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,820
Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.

133
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,220
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,700
Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to

135
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,780
put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.

136
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,380
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?

137
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,620
I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.

138
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,780
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine

139
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
habit.

140
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,460
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between binary transgender identity

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,540
and cross-sex brain anatomy, but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female

142
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,060
brains and male bodies or anything like that.

143
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,900
Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like grey and

144
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,660
white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies, distinct anatomical structures

145
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,420
like penises and vaginas.

146
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,540
So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.

147
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the

148
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,580
trans cult, in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man rather than as

149
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,940
always having been a woman.

150
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,500
But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile, I am not

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
real and not valid.

152
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,140
But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening whether

153
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,300
you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

154
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,780
My view is well expressed by Catherine McKinnon.

155
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,020
I always thought, I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man, doesn't matter

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,340
to me.

157
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,140
Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,

158
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,900
as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

159
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Concern 2.

160
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,340
Gender stereotypes.

161
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,100
What do you mean you live as a woman?

162
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,460
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly

163
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
voice?

164
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,060
Listen, sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.

165
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,780
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.

166
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,140
No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same, rather, we're using

167
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,660
a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.

168
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,220
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand why I'm

169
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,260
presenting in such a meticulously feminine way, like they think I'm wearing ombre lips

170
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,940
at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game, which I am, but also, if one person

171
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,140
calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day, so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti

172
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,700
at the wall in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

173
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,580
I think butcher gender nonconforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyperfeminine trans women

174
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,620
because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,860
since childhood against a society that's told them they have to be feminine.

176
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,740
And I completely sympathize with that.

177
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,660
I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.

178
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,060
But also, I've had to fight against the same society that told me I should really, really,

179
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,660
really not be this.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,540
So I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.

181
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,420
Concern three, abolish gender.

182
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,540
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,

183
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,900
not conforming to them.

184
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,060
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

185
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Abolish gender?

186
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,780
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give

187
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
it a try.

188
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Solanus, be praised.

189
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
No nails, no makeup.

190
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,540
I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

191
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,740
I did it, everyone.

192
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,260
I abolished gender.

193
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier, so I should probably get rid of that.

194
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,260
How is she, though?

195
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
She's feeling a little genderless.

196
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,500
I guess the way I positioned my body is still gendered, and there's a gendered cadence to

197
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
my voice.

198
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,260
So what I'm going to do is just hold my hands up genderlessly and speak in a genderless

199
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
robot voice.

200
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,500
My name is 54-664-17.

201
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,700
I have no gender.

202
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Patriarchy is over.

203
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
I guess English is still patriarchal language, right?

204
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,820
So I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.

205
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,060
Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.

206
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I can't stand this.

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
Fuck this.

208
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,180
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.

209
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,140
Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth didn't determine what kind of life

210
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
you could live?

211
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,420
And that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change, kind of like Abolish Borders.

212
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,100
Your utopian pipe dream is valid, and denying trans people their gender identity because

213
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,580
abolished gender is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because Abolish Borders.

214
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,460
Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable under the present system

215
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,260
and then leveraging that system against them under the pretense of abolishing it.

216
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,180
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,

217
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,820
Why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

218
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,180
You should be abolishing gender, not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

219
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,140
No, they don't attack the gender expression of people with power and influence.

220
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,580
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor, newly out trans woman with 200 followers and

221
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,980
calling her a creepy man and mocking her for being feminine and ineptly or being too feminine

222
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,940
or not being feminine enough.

223
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,900
It's almost like when they say abolish gender, what they really mean is abolish trans people.

224
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
It's almost like this is a hate movement hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
platitudes.

226
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,340
But surely, I must be missing something.

227
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,500
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement that you think you can just

228
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,700
claim womanhood for yourself without living any of the struggle that entails.

229
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,260
So look, I'm a successful white, middle-class trans woman.

230
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,420
In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.

231
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,100
I may not be the one percent, but I am the tranny one percent.

232
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,860
So I don't like to complain about every little microaggression I experience because under

233
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,220
the circumstances, it just seems a little gauche.

234
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,780
And I don't like things that are gauche.

235
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,980
But I've had cis feminists of my race and class tell me that I have no idea what it's

236
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,140
like to be talked over and interrupted by men or to experience street harassment or

237
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,580
to have to treat every first date like a potentially life-threatening situation and it's just bizarre

238
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,820
to me that they think that.

239
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,380
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

240
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,340
You think men treat me as their equal?

241
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,820
You think street harassers are going to treat me with dignity and respect because I have

242
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
a Y chromosome?

243
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,460
Hey beautiful, where you going baby?

244
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Where you going?

245
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Oh it's tranny.

246
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,580
Excuse me sir, my mistake, please proceed freely to your destination.

247
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,540
Come on people, use your heads.

248
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,820
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it, what do you think the guy in the

249
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,740
steps of the liquor store is going to say?

250
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,900
When a trans woman doesn't pass, it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

251
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,180
No, you get treated as monster gender, pronouns it and spit, and male privilege is not a good

252
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,380
description of that experience at all.

253
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,020
Once you start passing as a woman, it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,

254
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,340
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

255
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,540
Now gender-critical feminists are really skeptical of the whole notion of passing, they think

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,940
they can always clock a tran, and they assume everyone else can too.

257
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,620
But that's just not reality, I mean I'm only a year and a half into my transition,

258
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,740
and at this point I've had zero surgeries, and it's been like six months since I was

259
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,260
last misgendered offline.

260
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,180
I mean a person with a good eye for it will probably clock me, and maybe a lot of people

261
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,380
have just been indoctrinated into politically correct gender ideology, but like, you really

262
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,420
think the gas station attendant and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

263
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,700
are all calling me Miss and Ma'am because of post-modernism?

264
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,180
I know some of you are gonna sneak off to your shitty little rad femme forums and obsess

265
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,860
over how manly and cloggable I am, but like, at the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?

266
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,780
The deranged hateposting of 25 frothing anons, or every social interaction I've had for months?

267
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,260
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

268
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm Ahi Tuna, and you're a mackerel, sweaty.

269
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Take a fuckin' sip, babes.

270
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,700
I love that.

271
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
Concern 5.

272
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Male Socialization.

273
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,540
So you had a male upbringing, you never experienced the traumas of girlhood, you benefited from

274
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,620
male privilege for decades, and now you think none of that matters?

275
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,420
You are who you are because of how you were socialized, not because of how you dress.

276
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,060
Alright, it's time to crack open the nuance.

277
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,020
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

278
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,620
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled as a nine year old girl, or what that does

279
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,620
to a child's psyche.

280
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,860
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me till I was an adult, when I knew what

281
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,180
I was getting into and was ready for it, that's very different from what cis women

282
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
go through.

283
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,340
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common with a typical man than a typical woman, and

284
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,380
many of my experiences from those days I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

285
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,900
I absolutely benefited from male privilege, and it did influence who I was, and who I

286
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,300
was in my late teens and early twenties was an anti-feminist shithead who had no idea

287
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
what women go through.

288
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,220
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that, because in trans discourse it's just

289
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,540
accepted it's obvious that trans men know what it's like to be raised as women, and

290
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,380
to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

291
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,740
But when it comes to the early life experiences of trans women, we're supposed to say,

292
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,540
when I was five years old I loved wearing my mom's high heels, or else say nothing

293
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
at all.

294
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,880
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath, where she describes the way living

295
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,620
as a woman stifles an adventurous spirit, and her longing for a male experience.

296
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,300
Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom

297
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,260
regulars, to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.

298
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,980
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl, a female, always supposedly in danger

299
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,060
of assault and battery.

300
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,220
My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce

301
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,100
them, or as an invitation to intimacy.

302
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

303
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,300
I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.

304
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,000
So I got to do all that in my early twenties, and what I discovered is, I hate sleeping

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,660
in open fields, I despise the west, and I'd really rather stay inside collecting ceramics

306
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
and sucking dick.

307
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,940
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman, and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is

308
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,400
a man because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews for reasons that are inconceivable

309
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
to me.

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,060
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties, I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,

311
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:43,020
body and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me, and I tried every possible alternative

312
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,340
to transitioning before realizing that I had an irrepressible need to become a woman.

313
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,300
So I changed, and when I changed, society's treatment of me changed.

314
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,380
Socialization doesn't end with childhood, it's a lifelong process.

315
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,340
For example, when I transitioned, my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers, and radical

316
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,060
feminist haters started commenting on my physical appearance about twenty to thirty times more

317
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,860
often, and I had to get used to that being something that matters a lot more.

318
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,060
That said, resocialization takes time, and sometimes trans people who are early in transition

319
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,820
have most of that process ahead of them.

320
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,780
I also think we have to take into account the age at which a person transitions.

321
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,380
Kim Petras, who must we stan,

322
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
Oh we stan!

323
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
We stan!

324
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
I stan!

325
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
We stan!

326
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,020
She transitioned as a child, and I imagine was socialized more or less the same as a

327
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
cis woman.

328
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,780
Whereas Caitlyn Jenner humps, well, just humps.

329
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,100
She made millions of dollars in men's sports, she had six children by three wives, she transitioned

330
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,660
in retirement at age 65, and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman is

331
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,620
figuring out what to wear.

332
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,220
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of, it makes me want to cry.

333
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,700
Like I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman, but I am saying that anyone who wants

334
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,580
to argue that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective doesn't have a leg to stand

335
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
on.

336
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,420
But also, trans women often don't experience male socialization the way cis men do.

337
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,340
Many trans women are feminine and queer before they transition, and have always experienced

338
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,020
a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.

339
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,140
Some trans women also identified as women years before transitioning, and internalized

340
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,060
society's messaging about women more than society's messaging about men.

341
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Now that's still not the same as living in society as a girl from birth, but it's also

342
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,980
pretty different from the socialization of most cis men.

343
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,980
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue that trans women never experience

344
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,780
male privilege is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege as a proxy for calling us men.

345
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,180
Pull up your zipper, your male privilege is hanging out.

346
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,620
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point for many gender-critical feminists

347
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,060
is that there's an element here of stolen valor, this sense of injustice that people

348
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,260
are claiming their identity without experiencing their oppression.

349
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,420
It reminds me of what in the trans community are called trans medicalists.

350
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,580
People who insist the only real trans people are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

351
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,220
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing that confirms your identity is pain.

352
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,620
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

353
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,260
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

354
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

355
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,820
You don't know what it's like.

356
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,140
You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying that you don't know what it's like

357
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,180
to occupy an identity so stigmatized that most of the people who are attracted to you

358
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,100
in private are too ashamed to admit it in public.

359
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,140
You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative that you're shut out

360
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,660
of whole areas of society.

361
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,260
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest does nothing but to provoke

362
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,940
infighting between trans women and cis women at a time when we should be marching side-by-side

363
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,380
to destroy video games forever, hashtag Yes All Gamers.

364
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,540
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

365
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,860
You don't know what it's like to grow up being shamed for your periods, to fear

366
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,340
unwanted pregnancy, to have to fight for your right to abortion, to bear the pain of childbirth.

367
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,580
Well, yeah, that's true.

368
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,900
My inner rad femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

369
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,020
I do think it's important for trans women to stand in solidarity with cis women on issues

370
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,940
like period equity and abortion rights, and to learn about the experiences of cis women

371
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,580
to form a more complete understanding of the female condition.

372
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,740
But of course, no individual woman experiences all the things women experience, and individual

373
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,220
women understand the meaning of womanhood in drastically different ways.

374
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,860
For some women, having babies is the most essentially womanly experience.

375
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,100
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

376
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,980
I mean, not actually, but you know, TERFs pretended it is to own the trannies.

377
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,740
For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails in my business inbox from married men struggling

378
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,980
through the existential crisis of some kind of she-male-themed sexual awakening.

379
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,500
Also, do you want to be a guest on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?

380
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,380
But also, not all women experience their womanhood as essentially oppressive, or centered around

381
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,100
the pain of reproductive capacity.

382
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,580
When Shania Twain sang, Man, I Feel Like a Woman, she wasn't talking about having a

383
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,300
coat hanger abortion in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

384
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,060
Man, I feel like shit.

385
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,460
Concern 7 Erasing Female Vocabulary

386
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,940
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss women's bodies and women's

387
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
oppression.

388
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,100
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people and menstruators just to appease the

389
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
gender ideologues.

390
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,580
Well, I for one am not a menstruator.

391
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,860
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.

392
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,900
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people and are thinking, what

393
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,780
the fuck kind of Orwellian noose-beak gender cuckoldry is that?

394
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
Take a deep breath.

395
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Clear your mind.

396
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Here's the tea.

397
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,700
Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term pregnant people instead of

398
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
pregnant women.

399
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,980
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators in a tweet about the repeal

400
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
of a tampon talks.

401
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,580
This has prompted some conservative, turf, and Christian publications to post panicked

402
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,100
commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

403
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,140
But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman erases

404
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,700
trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.

405
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,540
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them, whereas saying pregnant people includes

406
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,620
them answers women and doesn't erase anyone, except for Cincinnatians, because we all know

407
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
they're not people.

408
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,220
Take your shitty chili elsewhere.

409
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.

410
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,300
What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

411
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,100
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing, and the trans

412
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,180
men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.

413
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,660
Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable, and my

414
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,020
prediction is that menstruators is not going to work out.

415
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,260
Maybe people who menstruate?

416
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,100
But why can't I just say woman?

417
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,300
That's what I am.

418
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,100
You can't just say woman.

419
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,580
That is what you are.

420
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,500
No one is asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.

421
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,380
Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

422
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,340
No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expected mothers.

423
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,180
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

424
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,060
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

425
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,780
I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.

426
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,460
Oh, I am definitely suggesting that.

427
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,500
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss

428
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,620
our own bodies.

429
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,860
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods, or wearing pussy hats

430
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,420
at political marches, or free bleeding all over the national mall.

431
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,140
I mean someone has to, the national mall is not going to bleed on itself.

432
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,380
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy and

433
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,460
defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

434
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,620
The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender

435
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,900
trans men or exclude wombs whom stuff not bleed.

436
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,580
I mean trans women do bleed, but only when we cut ourselves.

437
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,620
No one knows what it's like to be a satrian.

438
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,580
Concern 8.

439
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,500
Turf is a slur.

440
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,060
Turf is a slur designed to silence women.

441
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,900
Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.

442
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,820
The word turf is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,

443
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,140
but it's not a slur.

444
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,860
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.

445
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,380
The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations, and is often used

446
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,580
as an insult, but it's not a slur.

447
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,060
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.

448
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,620
The same is true of the word turf, it's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors

449
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
that deserve to be derogated.

450
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,940
The term gender critical is really a euphemism, recently created to replace turf with a phrase

451
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,380
that doesn't have such negative connotations.

452
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,020
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist, which was invented by racists wanting

453
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,060
a more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.

454
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,500
I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence sitters, but

455
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,220
I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms, and I generally

456
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,780
do the same with turfs.

457
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,020
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person, I usually like to call people by whatever

458
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,380
they want to be called, but when it comes to race realist or gender critical, every

459
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,540
time I use these phrases I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to

460
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,940
legitimize bigotry.

461
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,060
But I have especially little patience for turf requests for linguistic decorum, since

462
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:25,100
most of the language used by turfs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful, harmful,

463
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,780
and insulting to trans people.

464
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,060
For instance, turfs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.

465
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,380
They call trans women tims, an acronym for trans-identified males, and trans men tiffs,

466
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,100
trans-identified females, obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

467
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,380
To give you a sample of typical turf prose, here are a couple comments from literally

468
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,700
the first thread I saw on the gender critical subreddit while I was working on this video.

469
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,540
And I have to admit to considering more contempt for the likes of s***, since he makes a point

470
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,420
of taking selfies with ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

471
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,460
I also get a good love at tims putting their hands up to their shins, they're trying

472
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,620
to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple, but it only draws more attention to

473
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,020
their enormous man hands.

474
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,420
I saw an AGP photoshoot with his knee under fall and his fifties was closing with one

475
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,180
leg up like a flamingo, his hands dainty at his ear.

476
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:34,300
In every photo, even group ones at events, now I was just grossed out.

477
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,780
So there it is, that's what this is really about.

478
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,500
In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns and I've provided

479
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,140
responses I hope the average person will find fair, but I would be lying to you by omission

480
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,300
if I were to end this video without being real with you about what the core of the gender

481
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,260
critical movement is actually about.

482
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,060
See what turfs do in public is advance what, on the surface, are a series of feminist critiques

483
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,140
of trans people.

484
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,540
For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes

485
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,900
designed to oppress women.

486
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,100
At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present

487
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
themselves.

488
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,220
But in the next breath, these same turfs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine

489
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,780
perverts who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.

490
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,380
So if trans women being feminine is bad, and trans women being masculine is bad, then there

491
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,540
really is no way that trans women could behave that turfs would accept.

492
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,020
So in fact, what turfs really oppose is not trans women being feminine or trans women

493
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,580
being masculine, but trans women being trans women.

494
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,820
In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia, simple

495
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,180
animosity towards trans people's very existence.

496
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,220
And it's pretty easy to recognize that just from the tone they use when they talk about

497
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
us.

498
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,820
When you read through the gender critical subreddit or turf twitter, what you see is

499
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,780
just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes draped over a jagged thorn-tangle of visceral

500
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
disgust and targeted hate.

501
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,620
The pure exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Jermaine Greer quote

502
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,620
from the opening of this video or in the average gender critical forum post.

503
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,500
The enormous, snuckly, hairy, be-ringed paw, the pancake makeup through which the stubble

504
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,200
was already burgeoning, this Neanderthal in his fifties, ridiculous, insulting-to-women

505
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
facial expressions.

506
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,060
Now I was just grossed out.

507
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,740
What gender critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations

508
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,260
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

509
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,820
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

510
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,540
You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate, and

511
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,300
the arguments people made that marriage was under attack, that the children would be traumatized,

512
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,820
that bestiality would be next, that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions

513
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,540
with their outrageous demands, it was all just nonsense.

514
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,260
If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do, Sylvia I wish I could give

515
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,420
you what I had, he would just blurt out the truth, which was that the sight of two grown

516
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,100
men locking lips made him want to vomit.

517
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,220
Comophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.

518
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,180
They come from the lizard brain disgust response.

519
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:17,300
We evolved to deal with blood, infection, vomit, feces, flies, the hairy paw, the stubble

520
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,060
burgeoning through the pancake makeup, bleh.

521
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,900
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance, because it's the same disgust I felt toward

522
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,980
myself for years.

523
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,500
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five

524
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,260
years ago and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.

525
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,620
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

526
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,820
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia, because transphobia is always

527
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
the same.

528
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,860
It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of

529
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,860
ways.

530
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,220
I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops, where a police

531
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,380
officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

532
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,260
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her, deadnames her, mocks her

533
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,580
clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.

534
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,900
It's also repetitive and familiar, it's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in

535
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,580
the right-wing press on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all

536
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
the same.

537
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,820
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair is her unbreakable wit and confidence in

538
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,660
the face of transphobic abuse.

539
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,980
The single most iconic moment is when, after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid

540
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,340
a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering, she glances back at the cop and says,

541
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Excuse my beauty.

542
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Excuse your beauty.

543
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Okay.

544
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,180
That right there is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture, the resilience of

545
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,580
trans women, the assumption of a regal posture, and even the most abject conditions.

546
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,380
And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out

547
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,380
of bigotry.

548
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,420
So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this, what else can I say except,

549
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,420
on behalf of all trans women, excuse my beauty, TERF.

550
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Thank you very much.

551
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Thank you.

552
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Thank you.

553
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Thank you.

554
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
Thank you.

555
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Thank you.

556
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Thank you.

557
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Thank you.

558
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
Thank you.

559
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Thank you.

560
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Thank you.

561
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Thank you.

562
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Thank you.

563
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Thank you.

564
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Thank you.

565
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
Thank you.

566
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
Thank you.

567
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
Thank you.

568
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
Thank you.

569
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Thank you.

570
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Thank you.

571
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Thank you.

572
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Thank you.

573
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Thank you.

574
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
Thank you.

575
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Thank you.

576
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Thank you.

577
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Thank you.

578
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Thank you.

579
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Thank you.

580
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Thank you.

581
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Thank you.

582
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Thank you.

583
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
Thank you.

584
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
Thank you.

585
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
I really appreciate it.

586
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
It's been a long time.

587
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
A long time.

588
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
We'll see you later.

589
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Don't laugh.

590
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Please do it.

591
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Thank you.

592
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Thank you.

593
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Bye.

594
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Bye.

595
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Bye.

596
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Bye.

597
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Bye.

598
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Bye.

599
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Bye.

600
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Bye.

601
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
Bye.

602
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Bye.

603
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Bye.

604
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay, that's so stupid.

605
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
That's so stupid.

606
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,540
Run it, hey Mark.

607
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,380
Corona Premiere.

608
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,220
Well done.

609
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,860
Turf beer of choice.

610
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,460
My chromosomes need to unwind

611
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,880
after a hard day of heating trans people.

612
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,820
It is absol-

613
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,300
These titties, I just saw them and I just lost it.

614
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,020
I just, it's just, what?

615
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,540
I am a W-M-B-Y-N.

616
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,340
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

617
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,180
B-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

618
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,020
No one knows what it's like

619
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,700
to be a side tran,

620
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,140
to be a trash can,

621
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,380
for trap chasers jizz.

622
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,580
Perfect.
