0	11440	My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front
11440	17400	My shop is the fixer front I'm real when I shop my face
30000	39640	Hey guys it's Natalie welcome back to my channel
39640	45760	Today I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial as always but first story time, story time, story time
45760	50000	I just wanna be upfront with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery
50000	54000	I'm always gonna be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much
54000	57880	to me like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story
57880	61600	my whole entire journey this journey I've been on as a transgender woman you've been
61600	65360	with me on this whole journey this is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey
65360	68640	this is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just so special because you've
68640	71760	been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey the whole message of my journey as
71760	76080	a vulnerable moment it's just been so impactful on my life and the truth of my journey it's
76080	80000	just so meaningful that you guys have been here for so much to me that you guys are supporting
80000	84280	the truth of the life experience of my transgender journey as a transgendered journey it's been
84280	88200	so painful and it's been a really vulnerable time for me and I'm just so grateful to you guys
88200	90120	because you guys are so meaningful and you've been here for so much
90120	93640	I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun
93640	98680	but it's inner beauty that really counts anyway let's talk about plastic surgery I had facial
98680	103800	feminization surgery on April 2nd so about a month and a half ago what we call facial feminization
103800	109000	surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to
109000	114840	have to look more feminine so what I had done is forehead contouring a brow lift rhinoplasty
114840	119960	mandible contouring a trachea shave you know what let's just have the skull lady talk you through it
119960	127720	a coronal incision was made across the cranial vault whence the skin of the forehead was stripped
127720	136040	away from the bone a fragment of the super orbital ridge was then chiseled away removed reshaped and
136120	143480	re-affixed thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that oft times
143480	150200	distinguishes the skull of the chard a second incision was made athwart the columnella of the
150200	158200	nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction of the anterior cartilage and bone further incisions
158200	165000	were made betwixt the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped and shaved
165000	172520	down to a gracile curvature of jaw and pointed chin thereby delineating a facial silhouette
172520	178040	exhibiting that aspect which medical men call canti it all sounds pretty gruesome when you
178040	182840	describe it like that but there's actually a very fine level of technique and aesthetics involved
182840	187480	my plastic surgeon is an artist the results are natural I don't look like I've had a bunch of
187480	191640	work done which is good you know you at least want to leave people wondering maybe she's born with
191640	196120	it maybe a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull here's a before and after picture
196120	200280	where you can clearly see the difference to use the exact medical terminology my brows on fleek
200280	205080	my nose is no longer busted the house my jaw snatched and my Adam's apple is canceled wasn't
205080	209880	it always really Eve's apple maybe Satan's apple I think I still look like myself it's not a new
209880	215560	face we're talking about millimeters of bone here but to have all that done was well it cost a lot
215560	222200	of money the anticipation was oh terror like I've never known the pain was memorable and the
222200	226920	recovery took more than a month in fact I still have some swelling in my jowls jowls there's a
226920	231320	nice feminine sounding word love that the standard youtube t girl thing to do of course would have
231320	236520	been to vlog the whole journey story time my facial surgery experience my FFS journey and
236520	241240	post constant social media updates about it and I am grateful to the trans women who have done that
241240	245720	because it was really helpful to me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what
245720	250360	I was getting myself into but I decided not to post about the surgery because I wanted privacy
250360	254840	for the recovery and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before
254840	259000	subjecting myself to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids you know I think I've
259000	263720	been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people say about my appearance
263720	268440	online I'm not even talking about the haters like at this point I can mostly brush them off
268440	272520	but for instance about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit and some trans
272520	276840	woman was agonizing about her appearance and someone offered the encouragement you know you
276840	283640	can still look hot even if you don't pass just look at contour points oh like a dagger to the
283640	290280	heart the unintentional shade of it all so the past six weeks have been at times difficult and
290280	295720	lonely but I did manage to keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm
295720	301480	ever gonna be for the commentary of the internet so bring it on you jackals you vultures you
301480	306680	goblin swine while I was lying around bandaged and bored I did have a lot of time to think and what
306680	311720	I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now which is why
311720	317480	would someone do what I just did why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much
317480	323560	anxiety and pain just to change a few millimeters of bone isn't this all just extravagant vanity
323560	327880	some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much well I feel like there's a lot of pressure
327880	332360	on me to say that in fact this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all usually trans people say that
332360	337560	surgeries like facial feminization top surgery general reassignment and so on serve the sole
337560	342680	purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria this discomfort we feel with the mismatch between
342680	347160	our bodies and our gender identity so what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically
347160	352760	necessary reconstructive procedure needed to make my testosterone weathered facial bones
352760	357880	match the five foot two happy baby bouncy bio girl I truly am inside thereby alleviating my
357880	363240	dysphoria helping me safely blend into society and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown
363240	367080	and there is definitely truth to that it's certainly the argument I intend to make when I
367080	372120	write this off as a medical expense on my taxes if you're an IRS auditor please stop this video
372120	377560	now and insert the next floppy disk into your CD drive but hypothetically speaking I think the
377560	382840	reality might not be quite so simple how sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the
382840	387560	other kinds of body image dysphoria that drives cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the
387560	392200	time last year when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance I tweeted that I wanted to
392200	397800	get FFS and some trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia
397800	402680	and self-loathing they compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery or so-called
402760	407960	ethnic rhinoplasty which they say are motivated by internalized racism and western beauty standards
407960	412520	I think that's a pretty weak analogy and telling a trans person to just learn to accept the way they
412520	417640	look can actually be kind of transphobic because a big part of what it even means to be trans
417640	423160	at least for me is the desire to look more female but I also think trans people often talk like
423160	428920	gender dysphoria is this intrinsic personal experience that's always 100% valid and never
428920	433880	has anything at all to do with the external pressure of beauty standards but in fact gender
433880	438840	dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of societal ideals and norms
438840	444040	early in my transition some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair so I had full body laser hair
444040	448680	removal and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg but where does the idea that women
448680	453560	don't have body hair come from isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom a lot of the cis women
453560	458680	I know don't so much as shave their legs so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman
458680	465400	maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a knuckly hairy
466520	472760	manish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my core is this gender dysphoria
472760	478840	or is it internalized transphobia or is it simply a cosmetic preference when I try to psychoanalyze
478840	484600	myself I find that my desires to look female to look feminine and to look beautiful are not
484600	490120	exactly the same but they're woven together so tightly that it's kind of difficult to untangle
490120	496120	them and the opposite is also true that for me feeling manish or dysphoric usually goes along
496120	501240	with feeling ugly I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking well I'm giving fem
501240	505480	queen realness but apart from that I look like absolute shit of course there are qualities that
505480	510760	make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive like cellulite or flabby arms which
510760	515720	are super fish but aren't deemed beautiful by society the truth is I don't just want to look
515720	523320	female I want to be beautiful desperately god I'll do anything anything in this video I want to
523320	528120	explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful and why it seems like a lot of people who live in
528120	534360	a society are so obsessed is it phones it's probably phones I know you're supposed to pretend that you
534360	538360	don't care about being beautiful or that you're not trying but guys it's the only thing I care
538360	542200	about and I've never tried so hard in anything of course I do feel guilty about being so obsessed
542200	547240	with it because there's this idea that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain you know
547240	552280	smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty and I've always been categorized as a smart person
552280	556760	by people around me some of that is when you're raised like I was as a middle class white boy with
556760	562760	no athletic talent parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius like Einstein nutted a load
562760	568200	in Mozart's bussy and Mozart shot you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from Vincent van Gogh
568200	573160	it inspired his famous painting starfish night but even among women caring about beauty is often
573160	578440	frowned upon I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia and I know a few
578440	583160	because I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a uh what do you call someone who makes
583160	588440	videos a cam girl most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup to them the
588440	593560	idea of earnestly putting on press on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable like maybe on
593560	598200	Halloween now part of that is that women in male dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to
598200	603320	present more masculine to be taken seriously because of this prejudice that beautified femininity
603320	609240	equals frivolous but another part is clearly some kind of not like other girls weird flex which okay
609240	613800	fine whatever I'm not going to judge another woman for the way she copes with a society that
613800	618680	pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it I guess my way
618680	624120	of coping is this tacky heteronormative and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind of
624120	629800	post-ironic feminine beauty why am I like this well part of it is vindictive transsexualism pure
629800	634680	and simple to all the people who've ever called me a man I want to say fuck you by looking like the
634680	641000	undeniable visual archetype of a woman which is a beautiful feminine woman who's wearing
641640	644840	600 000 sequins they're biological sequence
648120	651320	oh that is some asmr right right there isn't that
662520	668040	another factor is this shitty website I'm a professional youtube influencer forgive me
668040	673720	father and I'm on camera all the time I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month
673720	678280	staring at my own face on a screen now you try doing that and see what kind of fucked up complex
678280	683320	you develop plus I compare myself to other women who make videos a lot of the trans women on
683320	688360	youtube are so young and so beautiful it makes me want to throw up and in comparison for a long
688360	695320	time I've felt like this this shabby aging transvestite just this feral cat wandering the
695320	700520	aisles of the liquor store so I'm insecure I'm compensating for that whole mess but I honestly
700520	705560	don't resent the beautiful people I really just stand the hell out of them I follow this woman on
705560	711160	youtube but I want to be just like her mom her name is Dame Jefferson Star her name is Lady Jane
711160	717640	McLean Señora Nicole Beatrice tutorials Tatiana Petrovna West Prokova and of course my queen and
717640	721640	perfect goddess whomst I stand in whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times so there's maybe
721640	725880	some extra intensity for me but I think it's actually pretty normal to want to be beautiful
725880	729720	I think even grad students want to be beautiful they just want to do it in that Becky kind of
729720	734120	way where you scoff at anything glam or artificial and it's not just women who care about beauty
734120	738200	either I mean gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery but now even the
738200	742520	straights are doing it in cells are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal
742520	746680	appearance and the ones who aren't completely black pilled are obsessed with plastic surgery
746680	751240	the incel newspeak word for beauty is looks maxing because of course they have to go about
751240	755720	this in the most heterosexual possible way it is imperative to implement a skin max regimen in
755720	760760	order to maximize looks money status and secure access to females oh my god comte own not every
760760	764840	sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner yes they
764840	770280	actually call skincare skin maxing James Charles I know you're having a hard month but I've got a
770280	774440	business idea that's gonna turn this thing around for you here's the plan you're gonna create a new
774440	780440	line of skincare products called Chad glow bribed PewDiePie to send his fans to the promo video
780440	785320	hi sister cells and send me a check in the mail you're welcome if you read looks max forums
785320	790280	they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants chin implants mandible implants
790280	798200	it must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad exhibited a jawbone most robust
798200	803720	it's literally facial masculinization surgery so everyone's obsessed with the bones everyone's
803720	810040	obsessed with beauty whether man or woman cis or trans gay or gamer maybe lesbians are just
810040	815720	straight chillin well everyone else has completely lost their minds but why why do we care so much
815720	820680	well with incels by their own account the only reason they care is they think that looks maxing
820680	825480	will make femoids have sex with them and they think of that will make their lives feel meaningful
825480	831800	which um it will not so incels are canceled now what about women what's our deal what's our
831800	836680	sitch what's our vibe what's our vish well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels
836680	841880	that we care about beauty and wear makeup fake up because we're trying to attract men my daddy
841880	846200	don won on vice news last year and said that women wear makeup because they're trying to stimulate
846200	851800	male sexual arousal and because evolution now with the risk of being bratty i gotta say this is maybe
851800	857800	10 true and 90 false for one thing straight men don't like makeup at least they don't think they
857800	862280	do here's a chart i made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about makeup
862280	867160	yes i asked all of them if you wear no makeup they think you look diseased and i actually do
867160	870920	look diseased when i don't wear makeup so fair enough if you wear natural makeup you know a
870920	875880	little concealer mascara maybe a nude lip they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like
875880	880760	it if you wear campy makeup colorful eyeshadow heavy contouring overdrawn lips they think it's
880760	886120	dumb and they hate it of course i'm generalizing hashtag not all daddy doms but if women really
886120	890600	wore makeup to attract men then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it when there are no men
890600	895480	around but that doesn't happen about a month ago there was that video going around of a woman
895480	900440	showing how to make jailhouse makeup mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow using
900440	905400	kool-aid and vaseline to make lipstick there's not a lot of men in women's prisons but women are still
905400	910600	performing incredible feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup so maybe
910600	916520	women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity you know things that prison tries
916520	922200	to take away from you kind of makes sense there's a refinery 29 documentary about prison cosmetology
922200	926520	and also sexual exploitation yikes in which a former inmate describes how women would engage
926520	932280	in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup if a girl's performing sexual favors for
932280	938360	an officer he would bring her in colored pencils lip gloss things like that that's right women are
938360	943480	sucking dicks and they can put on makeup not the other way around honestly if all the men died
943480	948520	tomorrow af i'd definitely keep wearing makeup in fact i might wear more and i'm not just saying
948520	953160	that because i'm trying to win feminist points or anything like do i want to attract men yes of
953160	959880	course i do do i want to attract women i guess i don't really think about it isn't it safer to just
959880	965480	secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside whatever it's fine i want to attract
965480	970200	non-binary people too of course but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way of my crudely
970280	975800	stereotyping people based on gender so how dare you the point is when i think about my appearance
975800	980280	wanting to attract people to have sex with is not the main thing going through my head what is going
980280	990680	through my head i guess i just want to feel beautiful i want to see myself in the mirror
990680	995480	and think i look snatched is that a crime i don't feel pretty very often i'd say it happens about
995480	1001160	once a month when i'm having a good skin day i do my makeup just right i glisten with setting spray
1001720	1010600	and then it happens a tingle goes up my spine i am bodicelli i am van gogh i have created
1011480	1018040	beauty i'm a girl and then it's over that's it for a month usually when i look in the mirror i
1018040	1021880	can't actually tell whether i'm pretty or not like with other people i can just look at them and
1021880	1026760	instantly make a judgment about it but with myself i have to just guess it's the same as
1026760	1032760	being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass would you clock me i'd clock me
1033880	1039640	i'd fuck me too i don't give a shit get out of my room mom it doesn't work like that for me
1039640	1044040	i have to rely on other people's feedback of course the problem with other people's feedback
1044040	1051080	is that people are liars you look gray on especially when those people are your fans
1051080	1055560	put the house queen stuff in my throat mother i'll die for you oh my god or when they're your
1055560	1061480	haters you're disgusting a giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces i guess
1061480	1066520	i'll never know whether i'm pretty or not but i can't estimate like i have figured out that i'm
1066520	1071640	too pretty for twitter but i'm not sure yet if i'm pretty enough for instagram it's hard being
1072280	1076680	i have been dipping my toes in the instagram water before my surgery i got into a pretty good
1076680	1081880	rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup looks and what i find addictive about it is this constant
1081880	1087000	flow of positive comments from other people even though i know it's mostly flattery you invented
1087000	1091800	beauty perfect angel choke me mommy every time i get a comment like that i'm perfectly aware
1091800	1097240	that it's wild exaggeration fueled by parasocial delusions but i still get a hit of dopamine in my
1097240	1101960	biologically female brain and the intoxicating thing about instagram is that the embellishment
1101960	1107400	of the truth is a two-way street thanks to the miracle of facetune yes we finally get to talk
1107400	1112680	about the phones see it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul
1112680	1118520	get it should i explain it again phones live in a society facetune is an app that lets you fix all
1118520	1123960	the problems with your face so here's an unedited pre-ffs picture of me what i would do in facetune
1123960	1129000	is smooth out the complexion shrink the nose a little bring the jaw in and use the vibrance tool
1129000	1133480	to make the eyeshadow pop it's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo doctoring people
1133480	1138200	have been doing since the invention of photography what's changed is that now everyone is doing it
1138200	1143400	to their own photos every day and i've noticed that when i'm in the habit of editing my flaws
1143400	1148360	out of pictures when i look at an unedited picture of myself or when i look in the mirror
1148360	1155400	my eyes go straight to the flaws why aren't my pores so big why aren't medical scientists doing
1155400	1160920	something to stop this is this really a good use of my mental energy here comes that guilt again
1160920	1165800	instead of worrying about my pores shouldn't i be helping stop the impending climate catastrophe
1165800	1169720	that's going to destroy the planet if we don't change the economy in like 12 years
1169720	1173720	shit i guess it's 11 years now it's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much
1173800	1184520	else on my mind he's just so cute i guess i'd just rather think about the aesthetic than the
1184520	1190680	apocalypse and that's the darkness why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin
1191640	1196680	do i need botox yet should i get a facelift these are the questions that will no doubt define the
1196680	1201720	next couple decades of my life as if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence
1201720	1208200	on camera i also have to deal with aging and thus the ritual of skincare products here's my daytime
1208200	1213240	routine so first i'm gonna mix the dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just
1213240	1218440	massage my face none of this is sponsored by the way this is just me supporting corporations out
1218440	1224280	of the kindness of my heart now if i'm not running late for something i will do a face mask but
1225240	1228120	if i'm out of bed it's because i'm running late for something so
1229080	1235800	i've never done a face mask now i'm gonna use a toner which is very important now a lot of people
1235800	1245000	don't know what a toner does but um look it tones okay do you want your face to be untoned next i'm
1245000	1250440	going to spray expensive korean yeast directly into my eyes i use this because it's actually
1250440	1255000	a lot cheaper than the japanese yeast so you're really losing money if you don't buy it think of
1255000	1259800	the savings now i'm going to mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic
1259800	1265960	bulgarian rose water you can almost smell the bulgarian rose fields it's enchanting it's like
1265960	1270120	i'm there there's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather i use this moisturizer
1270120	1276520	because gg gorgeous told me to and i do everything gg says every fucking thing i know it seems like
1276520	1282120	a lot of products but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection the tendency is to push
1282120	1287160	it as far as you can i feel like i'm forgetting something of sunscreen i'm not really sure what
1287160	1292440	this does we can probably skip it and i'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive
1292440	1300440	mist yes god i love a good facial i'm so fucking wet right now so after all these products does
1300440	1308520	my skin look clearer younger more toned well it's hard to say for sure but it certainly is moist
1308520	1311880	this is the part where i usually just stare at my own face for 10 minutes
1311880	1316920	and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time
1325480	1330920	i'm fine it's it's fine this is fine it's fine
1330920	1360120	i'm not having fun right now why am i not having
1360120	1365400	fun i guess i just don't feel beautiful and i know a lot of people think i'm pretty and i know
1365400	1370200	a lot of other people have it worse than me and i know i should be grateful and i know i'm privileged
1370200	1374680	to be able to get plastic surgery and i know i shouldn't care so much about this in the first
1374680	1381240	place but the truth is that this just eats away at me and i'm losing a lot of time and life to
1381240	1386280	this pain i've been kind of depressed this past month and i think part of it is that on a
1386280	1391640	subconscious level i think i was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image
1391640	1398120	and make me like myself but it really hasn't i mean i'm happy with the results i'd do it all again
1398120	1404440	but i still feel the way i felt before you have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific
1404440	1409720	problems like the adam's apple problem or the way my forehead looks and profile problem but it's
1409720	1416200	really not a solution to deep psychological issues i still don't feel beautiful and i need
1416200	1421320	to face the fact that i'm never going to feel beautiful unless i change the way i think because
1421320	1426440	i'm trapped in a doom spiral over here and if i'm ever going to get out i think i need to start by
1426440	1431640	forgiving myself for wanting to be beautiful there's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful
1431640	1437960	besides being shallow and vain for one beauty is associated with youth it's a symbol of life of
1437960	1444920	defiance of death that's a profound thing to be concerned about see i'm not a bimbo i'm a poet
1444920	1450120	beauty is also associated with moral worth the beautiful princess versus the evil hag there's
1450120	1454520	studies showing that conventionally attractive people are more likely to be assumed to be happy
1454520	1459480	healthy and trustworthy they're more likely to be hired so it's not just about instagram likes this
1459480	1465880	is serious stuff and we the woke we are all aware of this we know that beauty is power that beauty
1465880	1470520	is political we know that beauty standards come from the people with privilege in an unequal
1470520	1476360	society we know it's unjust that being light-skinned cis able-bodied or thin is considered more
1476360	1481880	attractive than being dark-skinned trans disabled or fat we know that female beauty matters so much
1481880	1486840	because patriarchy we know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked by advertising the
1486840	1492280	cosmetic industry and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products we know we know we know
1492280	1496920	all this because we've all been sitting around critiquing it for decades because that's what
1496920	1504440	leftists do we critique things we are finely tuned detectors of racism sexism ableism fat phobia
1504440	1511000	transphobia and capitalism run amac we notice an injustice we problematize it we critique it and
1511000	1517240	then we cancel it but what's next when we're done critiquing things what are we supposed to do
1517320	1522200	because i'm aware that conventional beauty standards are a racist sexist ableist fat phobic
1522200	1526600	transphobic social construct designed to preserve power relations and sell products
1526600	1533320	but does that awareness mean i desire any less to be conventionally beautiful well no i want it
1533320	1538840	more than ever the problem is that the intellectual exercise of critiquing things doesn't usually
1538840	1545320	affect my desires very much so what am i supposed to do sit here in silent contemplation until my
1545320	1549160	desires finally align themselves with the interests of the international proletarian
1549160	1554600	revolution oh fuck the revolution i want to be a pretty rich girl i don't want to be contra points
1554600	1559880	anymore i want to be gg gorgeous fighting fascists on youtube was an idea i came up with when i was a
1559880	1565000	male alcoholic unfortunately america needs a contra points right now more than it needs a 30
1565000	1570920	year old gg gorgeous impersonator so i guess i'm stuck with it maybe it's for the best critiquing
1570920	1576200	society may not change our desires but it can motivate us to change society and changing
1576200	1583960	society can change our desires so how do we change society revolution well sure revolution
1583960	1589160	depending on what happens in 2020 i'll think of grabbing a brick myself but failing that i think
1589160	1594280	there are ways we can work to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards without the futility
1594280	1599480	of trying to stop caring how we look i do think representation matters and i think having visible
1599480	1605160	beauty icons who are dark-skinned or trans or gender non-conforming or disabled or fat or over
1605160	1611000	35 or influencers makes a big difference beauty standards are social constructs and social
1611000	1616840	constructs can change that's why it's so important to recognize that influencers are just as valid as
1616840	1621480	other celebrities but the problem with changing society is that it takes a long time and this
1621480	1627800	video is almost over where i can see an escape from my particular doom spiral is in style as
1627800	1633560	an alternative ideal to beauty you can be stylish at any age you can be stylish whether you pass or
1633560	1639080	not style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic that you have complete control over
1639080	1645480	it's like art and that originality is a virtue style is an individual aesthetic unlike the
1645480	1651160	collective aesthetic of beauty standards as the poet wordsworth said about artistic appreciation
1651160	1656840	every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating
1656840	1661800	the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so even if you don't conform to conventional beauty
1661800	1668040	standards through the power of original style you can create the taste by which your unique beauty
1668040	1673800	is to be appreciated society may frown upon us six-foot trannies but if i know i'm dressed well
1673800	1680920	or my makeup is snatched i can easily abide any comment any stare i can be misgendered a dairy
1680920	1686840	queen for all i care it does not matter i can strut with confidence because i am basking in
1686840	1694040	the regal knowledge of my own aesthetic superiority bow before me peasants i proclaim to the drive
1694040	1703400	through window for i am serving a lurk sir this is a dairy queen so i guess that's the solution
1703400	1708280	i can't believe i single-handedly ended capitalism now does that mean i'm not going to get a lot of
1708280	1713880	expensive plastic surgery fuck no what do you people think i am some kind of transgender mother
1713880	1720360	tereza god damn the audacity of you people the hubris look i need plastic surgery because i have
1720360	1725240	no style in fact after the month i've had you should be grateful i'm wearing clothes at all
1725240	1730360	so that's it for me i guess i have nothing but the decay of time and age to look forward to
1730920	1735480	i guess i'll just have to find my self-worth and cultivating kindness intelligence and inner beauty
1735480	1744680	ew gross
1765480	1772680	so
1795480	1825480	I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry
1825480	1851880	I'm drooling all over myself because my jaw is still numb from the surgery. Love that.
