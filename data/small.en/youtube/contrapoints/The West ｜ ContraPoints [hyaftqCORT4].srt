1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
9-1-1, what are you reporting?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,600
Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,600
I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six feet tall. Big man-ham.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man-ham?

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
Well, she's covered in butter-five, and she has giant wings.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm sorry, what?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Oh, and she talks like a fat ****.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Memph.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,600
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,400
Hail mortals, I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Western culture is being destroyed by cocks and by gender-bending intoxication and sodomy.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
You know, things that have never happened in Europe.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:32,200
There's a lot of people talking lately about the West and Western culture and Western civilization.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
But what do those words even mean?

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,800
I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Fuck that!

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
The people demand blood, and I'm thirsty for blood.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
And by blood, I mean dick.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
And by dick, I mean corndogs.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
And by corndogs, I mean sixteen of them over the course of an evening.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
And by evening, I mean morning.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,000
And by morning, I mean between eight o'clock and eight fifteen.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And by corndogs, I mean dick.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Who's up first?

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Well, Angry White Guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,800
and it's been a while since I've done a video response, so let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
McGonk is here, baby doll.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
What?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't want to die!

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,600
That is a mad.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,600
The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
Both of these clues have to do with coming out.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Wrong!

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Her magic power is the conflict of the plot.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,800
And her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,800
and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
She will destroy her enemies and raise their castles to the ground.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
The song Let It Go is basically, fuck this shit, I'm conquering everyone.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,800
So just to be clear, this is a grown man who has addressed himself

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,800
as far as a sorcerer to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
It almost feels like punching down at this point.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
At least the golden one was mask for mask.

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Who can I punch up at?

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I don't like talking about punching.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I would never punch a turf.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
My hands are too feminine.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
And my fingers are tired.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Someone massage them.

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Who can I claw up at?

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,800
The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
How about that?

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Dad, stop. Ugh, get out of my life.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,800
In my video about Jordan Peterson, I talked about how he posits a struggle

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
between the West and postmodern neo-Marxism.

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I argued that Pomo No Mo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
none of which are in any sense non-Western.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Unless, of course, you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,800
which, surely, no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
In this video, I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
and the people who claim to defend it.

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Wow, Daddy, nice sword.

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
God damn it, we're going to need to aim even higher.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
The President of the United States of America,

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
big dick, special big boy Donald Trump.

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Just as Poland could not be broken,

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I declare today for the world to hear that

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
the West will never, ever be broken.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
and our civilization will triumph.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:59,800
So we've got the most powerful fuckboy on the planet

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization,

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
so I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Which is too bad, because that's going to require a lot of thinking.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Someone massage it.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
And soon, mechanically,

84
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea

86
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate,

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
then a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800
something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,

93
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
this new sensation having had on me,

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,800
the effect which a love has of post-preambulatory banter.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Whether you're in Fashy YouTube or Pomo, Nomo, Akadomino,

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
clearly defined thing called Western Civilization

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
of enlightened philosopher kings.

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
On the track!

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
On the track!

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
On the track!

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
by modern people for particular purposes.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
It's like an origin myth.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
In an article titled,

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
There is No Such Thing as Western Civilization,

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
there was no such thing as the West.

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
The world was divided into three continents he called Europe,

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Asia, and Libya.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Herodotus had no notion that these three continents

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
corresponded to different types of people,

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia,

118
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
in which he traveled,

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
than with the faraway and foreign people of northern Europe.

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Really, there is no one idea of the West,

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
under the heading of the West.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Let's talk about them now!

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Concept 1.

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values

129
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
In the year 732,

130
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
at the Battle of Tor,

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain

133
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
into what is now France,

134
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
into Western Europe.

136
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
According to Apiah,

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
the first recorded use of the Latin term

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Europensis, or Europeans,

139
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tor,

140
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
distinguishing Christians from Muslims.

141
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
In the late Middle Ages,

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
the concept of Christendom appeared

143
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
and was used to distinguish the Christian world

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
from the Islamic world and from paganism.

145
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor

146
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
to the modern concept of the West.

147
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Notice that the term itself

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.

150
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
The Christian inheritance is still invoked today

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
by defenders of the West,

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
like Lil Benny and Professor Studied the Blade,

153
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
often under the heading of Judeo-Christian Values,

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
a term usually used to falsely imply

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
that contemporary moral norms

156
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
derive from such a generic parochial

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
as if the prohibition of graven images

160
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
has any contemporary influence whatsoever,

161
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws

162
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily triggered ego

163
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
and non-condemning slavery and rape.

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?

165
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Bible jokes.

166
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
The other main use of Judeo-Christian Values

167
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.

168
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Speaking of which,

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Two kids and a dog just like the Bible says?

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Well, no.

172
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament

173
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
and not forbidden in either testament.

174
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Even in the beginning,

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents

176
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
and who can blame her,

177
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.

178
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
But it's cool he was into that.

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
In the Middle Ages,

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
the Catholic Church gradually enforced

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
the one man and one woman view of marriage.

182
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Although in formerly pagan lands,

183
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
this idea was slow to take hold.

184
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Charles Martel's grandson, Charlemagne,

185
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines

186
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
because he was a proud son of the North,

187
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
100% Natty, and Alpha as fuck.

188
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm sorry, I just can't stop.

189
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
The Golden One, his soul and mind are intermingled.

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Probably because we both played

191
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
1200 hours of Age of Empires in 1999.

192
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
And then something went terribly wrong.

193
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Fuckin' 9-11.

194
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
It used to be such an innocent decision

195
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
to play as the Franks or the Saracens

196
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
that it became this huge civilizational struggle,

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
and that's why this guy is a fascist

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
and I grew up to be a woman.

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Thanks a lot, Osama.

200
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Being transgender is so weird.

201
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
You have these childhood memories

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
that are just totally discordant

203
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
with your adult gender identity.

204
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
How do you even deal with that?

205
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, here's how.

206
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
You bond with straight guys

207
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia

208
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
and then you fuck them.

209
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm not like other girls.

210
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,800
No.

211
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Concept 2, Enlightenment Values.

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior

213
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
named Martin Luther nails his list

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.

215
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
between Catholics and Protestants.

217
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
That eventually chills out,

218
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
but then the 18th century rolls around

219
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
and shit's just fuckin' crazy.

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
There are various fops and dandies and macaronis

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses

222
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
and babbling about enlightenment

223
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
like the beatnik trash they are.

224
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Then, 300 years later,

225
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
a bunch of drinks sought in fedora tippers

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire

227
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
before sinking into sweeping

228
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
sexual harassment allegations under the rug

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,800
about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.

231
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
That's not what they were discussing

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
at the Parisian Salon.

233
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
This is all very embarrassing,

234
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
but still, some of these Enlightenment values,

235
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
science, liberty, skepticism about dogma,

236
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
these are basically good ideas

237
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.

238
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
But it's important to keep in mind

239
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.

241
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
So the sum of what we now think of as the West

242
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
actually contains major contradictions

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
because the history of the West

244
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
is a history of change and revolution.

245
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
So when a new movement comes along,

246
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
like for instance a bunch of Buzzkill sad sacks pointing out

247
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
that actually our society is still pretty terrible

248
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,

249
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
it might not be the smartest thing

250
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
to just dismiss it as some kind of sinister

251
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
postmodern new Marxist cuckoldry.

252
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
It could be the next Reformation,

253
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
in a history marked by a series of reformations.

254
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
If there are any historians watching this,

255
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
please call it the SJW Reformation.

256
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Think about the Protestant Reformation.

257
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
At the time,

258
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
that probably seemed like a civilizational threat

259
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
to the Holy Roman Empire,

260
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
and it kind of was.

261
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
But in retrospect,

262
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
we see the Reformation as just as important a moment

263
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
in Western culture

264
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
as the medieval period that preceded it.

265
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
But today's Counter Reformation,

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
made up of people like Orangie Smalls

267
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
and Dr. Clean Your Room,

268
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
uh, insist on pretending the current Reformation

269
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
is some kind of alien threat.

270
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
And as for the Counter Counter Reformation,

271
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
well, that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.

272
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Concept three, Western culture.

273
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism

274
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
between the Western Roman Catholic Church

275
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
But in its contemporary sense,

277
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
the idea of Western culture didn't really exist

278
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

279
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spangler's

280
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
1918 book, The Decline of the West,

281
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
an important influence on Nazi ideology.

282
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
As long as people have been talking about Western culture,

283
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,

284
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
as I've discussed in several earlier videos,

285
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
which I encourage you not to watch.

286
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
But the idea of Western culture

287
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
was influential well beyond the Third Reich.

288
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
At the height of European imperialism,

289
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
the idea of a superior high culture of the West

290
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit

291
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
the mysterious Orient.

292
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist

293
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
rhetoric under the rug,

294
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept

295
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
in our schools and universities,

296
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
where you have to take courses like

297
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
but you didn't actually do any of the readings for

299
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
because you were too busy crouching in the bushes

300
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
outside the dean's office,

301
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.

302
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
The consequence of this Western culture education

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
is that we now all have this sense

304
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
that we belong to a continuous civilization

305
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
whose crowning achievements are the Ten Commandments,

306
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Jesus fucking Christ, Athenian pederasts,

307
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
cathedrals, Mozart, human rights,

308
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
science, and iPhones.

309
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
But the reality is,

310
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
this is an essentialist conglomeration

311
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
of a history that's much more non-linear

312
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
than we often think.

313
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
We in the West claim to be the inheritors

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,

315
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.

316
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
St. Thomas Aquinas,

317
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,

318
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
is largely responsible for introducing

319
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Aristotle to Christian universities,

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
but he never would have encountered Aristotle

321
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
in the first place had not ancient Greek philosophy

322
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
been translated and commentated

323
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.

324
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
So the origins of Western culture

325
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
aren't really unique to us at all,

326
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
and the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.

327
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
On the one hand, you have Judeo-Christian values,

328
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
and on the other hand, you have degenerates

329
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
like William Shakespeare,

330
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens

331
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
and make out with each other,

332
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
which, for the record, is disgusting,

333
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.

334
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Because if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times,

335
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
boys in drag played female parts.

336
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I wish I had female parts.

337
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Working on it.

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Concept four, The Free World.

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
From 1941 to 1945,

340
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,

341
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
an agricultural scientist from Iowa,

342
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
whom Democratic Party officials despised

343
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
for being what we'd now call a democratic socialist.

344
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Wallace later ran for president in 1948

345
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
as a third-party candidate on a platform

346
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
of universal health care, anti-segregation,

347
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
in opposition to the Cold War.

348
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked

349
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
in the press for his spiritualism,

350
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,

351
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
and what Time Magazine called his assault on the South,

352
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
that is, his, quote,

353
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
ostentatious ride through cities and towns

354
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
with his Negro secretary beside him,

355
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.

356
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
The poor, naive Wallace commented,

357
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
there is something so unlovely about hate

358
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
when you see it distorting the human face.

359
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
We'll get used to it, buddy.

360
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
This is America.

361
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Am I lecturing someone from 1948

362
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
about how bigoted this country is?

363
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
This is fine.

364
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote

365
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
in the 1948 election,

366
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech

367
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
titled, The Century of the Common Man,

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
in which he contrasted what he called

369
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
the slave world of fascists with the free world,

370
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
which he described as an incomplete

371
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
and ongoing international people's revolution.

372
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
No Nazi counter-revolution will stop him.

373
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
The common man will smoke the Hitler Stooges

374
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
out into the open in the United States,

375
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
in Latin America and in India.

376
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
He will destroy their influence.

377
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
No Laval's, no Mussolini's

378
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
will be tolerated in a free world.

379
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it,

380
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
but it was common during World War II

381
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
when the phrase the free world

382
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
first entered common parlance

383
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers,

384
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
including the Dirty Reds.

385
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
After the war, the phrase the free world

386
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
remained common in American politics,

387
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
but the meaning shifted.

388
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Instead of referring to the international alliance

389
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
against fascism, it referred to the capitalist west

390
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
as opposed to the communist east.

391
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
The idea of the free capitalist west

392
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
is still an important ingredient

393
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
in this jumbled concept we call western civilization.

394
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
So when lobster dad says there's a struggle

395
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
between Marxism and the west,

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
it seems at first like he's just stuck

397
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
in the 1980s or something.

398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?

399
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Dad, what year do you think it is?

400
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?

401
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
They're on your side now, remember?

402
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism

403
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
to invoke red scare sentiment

404
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
in opposition to the SJW Reformation.

405
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
But the point I'm trying to make

406
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
is that the west is a concept,

407
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
or rather several contradictory concepts,

408
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
that are always posited in particular

409
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
political circumstances

410
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
as one side of an us versus them opposition.

411
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Whether it's the Christian west versus the infidels,

412
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
the Enlightenment west versus Islam,

413
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
the cultured west versus the colonized savages,

414
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
the capitalist west versus the communist east,

415
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
or the white European west versus

416
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
the Jewish cultural Marxist plot

417
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
to cock the sons of the north

418
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens

419
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
and inundating their countries

420
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
with a barbarous board of third world migrants.

421
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I guess I have to say something about that.

422
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Concept five, blood and soil.

423
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer

424
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Richard Spencer what he thinks the west is,

425
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic,

426
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people

427
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
by their fair-skinned ancestors.

428
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent

429
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
could be part of the west is ridiculous

430
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,800
because for Spencer to be western is to be white.

431
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Now the thing about that is,

432
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
as an analysis of the common usage of the term the west,

433
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
it's not even wrong.

434
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Consider Latin America where the main language is spoken

435
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
are Spanish, Portuguese, and French

436
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
where the majority of religion is Roman Catholicism.

437
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the west?

438
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?

439
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.

440
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Or to be more accurate,

441
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
the flexible and historically variant concepts

442
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
of whiteness and the west have been constructed

443
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
so as to exclude them.

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
And I've already spent half my YouTube career

445
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
on delirious gay screeching about Nazis

446
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
so I don't want to do more of that now.

447
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
But suffice to say,

448
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
the association between whiteness and the west

449
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
is always lurking beneath the surface

450
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
and when whiteness rears its head proudly,

451
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.

452
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
As I'm making this video,

453
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes

454
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
is up and running yet again,

455
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe

456
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
and a racist demagogue in the United States.

457
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
And once more,

458
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
both continents are dotted with barbed wire,

459
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
refugee ghettos,

460
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
and internment camps full of children torn from parents.

461
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Concept six, the evil west.

462
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
The west, in many ways,

463
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
is an inherently supremacist concept.

464
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
It's thought to be more civilized,

465
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
more holy,

466
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
and more cultured than the non-west.

467
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
But there are some ridiculous college professors

468
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,800
who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.

469
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
According to them,

470
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
the west is not uniquely civilized

471
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
but uniquely uncivilized,

472
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
cruel,

473
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
imperialistic,

474
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
racist,

475
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
and genocidal.

476
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
This just perpetuates the same essentializing error.

477
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Europeans aren't inherently more evil

478
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
any more than they're inherently more civilized.

479
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa

480
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
400 years ago,

481
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
the result would have been just as brutal.

482
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
So instead of vilifying the west,

483
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,

484
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,

485
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
and acknowledge that the world is too complicated

486
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
to reduce to simple us and them binaries.

487
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle

488
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
in classical music and the Cheesecake Factory.

489
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
We can still keep all that shit

490
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
while eliminating the propaganda

491
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
and injustice that surrounds it.

492
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Coda.

493
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.

494
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
What if traps are gang?

495
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
What if no one can ever love you?

496
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
What if happiness is impossible?

497
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
What if everyone who compliments me is lying

498
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
so they can laugh at me later

499
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
when I delusionally feel good about themselves?

500
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
What if when you die you stay conscious

501
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and then you just are...

502
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
What if I'm standing in an awkward way

503
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
and it looks weird?

504
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
What if Blanchard is right?

505
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
What are these horrible goddamn noises

506
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
coming out of my mouth?

507
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain

508
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
and music is really great for that.

509
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I've always liked classical music.

510
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
When I listened to Mozart or Mendelssohn

511
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
or even an amateur like Satie,

512
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.

513
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
And I don't care what civilization the composer came from

514
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.

515
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
And I don't want to know because I need this.

516
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I need this feeling that makes me just want to

517
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
take a big...

518
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
...

519
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
...

520
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
...

521
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
...

522
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
...

523
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
...

524
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
...

525
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
...

526
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
...

527
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
...

528
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
...

529
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
...

530
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
...

531
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
...

532
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
...

533
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
...

534
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
...

535
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
...

536
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
...

537
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
...

538
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
...

539
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
...
