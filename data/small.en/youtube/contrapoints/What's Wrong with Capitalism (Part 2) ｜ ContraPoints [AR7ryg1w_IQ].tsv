0	29000	I like stuff, I like this, and I like this, and I like this, and I like stuff, and I want
29000	30000	more stuff.
30000	35320	My child, hearkened to my voice, it is I, Socrates.
35320	38160	Oh no, what do you want?
38160	41240	I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.
41240	45040	Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.
45040	49560	My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.
49560	53640	Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness, the rational
53640	56280	contemplation of truth and justice?
56600	60720	Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.
60720	63400	I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.
63400	67480	Ah, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.
67480	71960	Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself, perfectly
71960	76080	exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.
76080	80360	Okay, thank you for your feedback, we'll take that into consideration.
80360	81920	Ugh, Greeks.
81920	87920	Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.
87920	91400	But happiness, what does that word even mean?
91400	95680	I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things, and these are questions really better left
95680	99440	to the philosophers, which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this
99440	100440	video.
100440	104200	Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist
104200	109880	philosophy ever produced, a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the concept of
109880	111400	the fetishism of the commodity.
111400	116360	I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed video about three men who
116360	120880	are younger than me who travel the world and try different foods that cost different amounts
120880	124880	of money, and then say whether it was worth it.
124880	129080	In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants at three drastically
129080	133240	different price points to find out which one is the most worth it.
133240	139800	For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold, and a $1
139800	146800	ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold, and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel
146800	148080	that's made of gold.
148080	149080	It is a lot of gold.
149080	150760	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
150760	151760	A ganjipreneur!
151760	156720	Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.
156720	161760	But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.
161760	163800	We like to take it all in.
163800	164800	Ahh!
164800	168540	The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven.
168540	173780	These are not mere content creators, mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad
173780	174780	revenue.
174780	177900	They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even.
177900	182500	And what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly, far surpasses the combined
182500	189820	insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Sartre Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukacs, Zarathustra,
189820	192260	and even our dear breadmom, Kropotkin.
192260	196840	I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many, many times, but I always
196840	201880	come away dissatisfied and I find myself returning, yet again, to the unparalleled
201880	204520	masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.
204520	209240	See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.
209240	210840	Is it worth it?
210840	212040	We may never know.
212040	217200	Take for instance the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.
217200	218640	Which is the better deal?
218640	222560	I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?
222560	227560	Well, according to Karl Marx, the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.
227560	232160	On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some
232160	233160	human need.
233160	238000	And on the other hand, there is the exchange value, the quantity determining the ratio
238000	243200	by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity, deriving from objectified
243200	246360	labor over time and expressed in terms of price.
246360	248480	But let's not oversimplify things.
248480	254440	Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand
254440	260640	the use value, exchange value dichotomy not as a mere hierarchical binary, but as a sort
260640	267640	of delusian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections as the
267640	269160	truffles on the pizza itself.
269160	271000	Am I making myself clear?
271000	272000	I'm not.
272000	275920	It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon and not actually
275920	277720	helping me think through this any better.
277720	282920	So let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.
282920	283920	Fuck this.
283920	295400	I like stuff, and I like shiny things.
295400	299800	Now that's something everyone can understand, so let's take that as the first axiom of
299800	302560	the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.
302560	307680	So given that I like stuff and I like shiny things, let's return to the question.
307680	310320	Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?
310320	317640	Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that, but the pizza itself seems
317640	318640	kinda gross.
318640	323800	It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras, stilton cheese, black truffles, gold
323800	325680	flakes, and caviar.
325680	329160	These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.
329160	332480	The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.
332480	336640	It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment, but Andrew and Steven
336640	341440	sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop and they try to pretend that
341440	345560	the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.
345560	348960	I'm honestly speechless.
348960	349960	I feel weird.
349960	350960	Is it the gold?
350960	351960	I just ate $250.
351960	355200	I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.
355200	359600	And that's what $1,250 looks like.
359600	365080	There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza isn't
365080	369120	worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.
369120	373960	It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money on some gilded
373960	377880	piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.
377880	379720	Is there a name for that feeling?
379720	383240	Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.
383240	388840	In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia, a bad pizza covered in gold would just be
388840	390800	a bad pizza covered in gold.
390800	395360	You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza, but you probably wouldn't
395360	398120	be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.
398120	403240	To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it, you have to understand it in
403240	405080	the context of capitalism.
405080	410560	The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza, and if you live in America
410560	414880	you have an instinctive sense for what that means, because you know all the other things
414880	416920	you could buy with $2,000.
416920	422280	For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.
422280	426200	And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening worrying
426200	428720	about how they're going to afford golden nails.
428720	435040	And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem not just aesthetically disappointing,
435040	437280	but almost obscene, or even immoral.
437280	441920	But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.
441920	444440	So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go,
444440	448360	Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you?
448360	452760	Because the problem isn't that Andrew Adam and Steven are bad people for buying inexpensive
452760	455160	flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.
455160	460120	The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable these repulsive
460120	462560	juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.
462560	466440	That's why I don't really agree with the philosophy of Peter Singer, who has this
466440	471320	idea that many of the world's problems could be solved if privileged American college students
471320	475560	would just become hedge fund managers and donate most of their income to buying mosquito
475560	476560	nets in the Congo.
476560	480440	I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations, but it's not going to
480440	485040	change the fact that the global economy is structured around cheap, exploited labor at
485040	488280	the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.
488280	493160	Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?
493160	494960	Well they're certainly not the Jews.
494960	500640	I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.
500800	503680	Except, you know, cucking the white race.
503680	505880	But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.
505880	508080	The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.
508080	512240	So the lizards are not the Jews, they're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis, they're
512240	517000	not Freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda, but the key insight is that they're not
517000	519160	even really the capitalists.
519160	522440	The lizards are capital itself.
522440	523440	And what does that mean?
523440	527520	Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?
527560	530800	What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product
530800	534240	of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.
534240	538920	Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.
538920	543120	And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.
543120	547360	So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme
547360	551840	economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.
551840	555440	If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go
555440	557280	something like this.
557280	561560	Humanism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating
561560	566160	large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where
566160	571280	efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity
571280	573200	to maximize human happiness.
573200	575360	Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.
575360	576360	Here's a question.
576360	579960	Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?
579960	584560	It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity, so what I look for in a good
584560	588920	economic system is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of
588920	589920	it.
589920	593160	So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is does having
593160	595240	more wealth make people happier?
595240	599440	And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system,
599440	604520	and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point, but
604520	609080	the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus is somewhere between $65,000 and
609080	610920	$95,000 a year.
610960	615600	One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower
615600	621060	income levels, more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical
621060	622760	bills or college tuition.
622760	627440	But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing
627440	628760	golden pizzas.
628760	634200	If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,
634200	636520	at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.
636520	641000	The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that
641000	646760	the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national
646760	651320	median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.
651320	658160	Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the
658160	660000	peak happiness threshold.
660000	665040	So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country
665040	670160	don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and health care,
670160	675680	while a few million others are like constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.
675680	679640	But I'm guessing it's even worse than that, because it's not just that some people don't
679640	684280	have enough money to meet all of their needs, it's that they have to be poor while other
684280	685920	people are rich.
685920	690600	And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties
690600	692520	and resentments and social tensions.
692840	696720	There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows that if you reward one monkey for a
696720	701680	task with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,
701680	704080	the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.
704080	707920	And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.
707920	710080	But that's just how it looks to me.
710080	711080	I could be wrong.
711080	715960	I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how
715960	717160	the economy works.
717160	720000	I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.
720000	722840	I make the videos, I swipe the card.
722840	727680	So look, if I'm wrong, and capitalism is good actually, just leave a comment and I'll
727680	729320	be happy to be proven wrong.
729320	733680	But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.
733680	737520	Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.
737520	741520	Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.
741520	745960	Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.
745960	749960	And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain
749960	751240	themselves and their families.
751240	755200	It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.
755200	757800	But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.
757800	761840	Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher if they could make a good living
761840	762840	as a janitor?
762840	766800	Well, janitorial work is pretty important actually.
766800	770760	Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve
770760	771760	a decent living.
771760	775600	But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the
775600	780200	kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by
780200	781480	profit anyway.
781480	785480	Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine even though he could have made millions of
785480	790440	dollars from it because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose beyond
790440	791440	personal profit.
791440	796080	In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need
796080	800880	to work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.
800880	802400	So let me get this straight.
802400	807520	You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.
807520	808520	Hypocrite much?
808520	813160	A few years ago I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticized capitalism
813160	814720	then, people used to say,
814720	818200	Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?
818200	822720	You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.
822720	827120	So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,
827120	831960	and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,
831960	837040	then according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?
837040	841080	Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.
841080	844360	You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?
844360	846360	Well, no, I wouldn't.
846360	851560	Hello, I'm Tatiana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.
851560	852560	Fuck off!
852560	856240	Dozvidanya fascist.
856240	860600	So granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty, but that doesn't mean that
860600	863560	the current system is the best and final system for all time.
863560	868280	My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,
868280	873680	but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.
873680	876760	Okay, but I like stuff.
876760	878280	I like stuff too.
878280	883680	I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.
883680	889360	I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,
889360	894440	undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,
894440	897960	just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.
897960	901000	And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,
901000	904560	since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.
904560	908720	But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,
908720	912640	these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.
912640	915920	And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,
915920	917040	straight guys will be like,
917040	920080	will there be video games after capitalism? Oh, god!
920080	921440	And yeah, there will be.
921440	924800	Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.
924800	934200	Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.
934200	938080	I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.
938080	942840	The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing, by John Berger,
942840	946560	I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.
946560	949720	Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.
949720	952880	Happiness as judged from the outside by others.
952880	956280	The happiness of being envied is glamour.
956280	960200	And I felt kind of attacked because glamour is very important to us.
960200	961960	And by us, I mean the gays.
961960	967560	The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy cues.
967560	970520	But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,
970560	975400	the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder
975400	977000	in the service of selling you shit.
977000	982040	But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour, not something essential to it.
982040	986800	And maybe glamour would actually be liberated if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.
986800	991640	So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that, actually, stuff is good.
991640	993840	Glamour is good. Video games are good.
993840	995880	Luxury is good. Baths are good.
995880	999680	I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.
999680	1005800	You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza is ultimately that the $2 pizza is actually better.
1005800	1010320	The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,
1010320	1013120	but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.
1013120	1017960	So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.
1017960	1020880	But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.
1020880	1023880	I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.
1023880	1028400	Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way, I'm finally ready to get started.
1028400	1030960	Part one, which you've all been waiting for.
1030960	1033440	How to end capitalism once and for all.
1033440	1036480	Well, I don't know. Who do you people think I am?
1036480	1040600	I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.
1040600	1044440	I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.
1044440	1048960	Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.
1048960	1052560	So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.
1054400	1056400	Sure, it's bound to happen any day now.
1058400	1064160	You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.
1064160	1067440	Uh, so, I don't know. I guess vote labor.
1067440	1071440	Tweet radically. Try to eat more vegetables.
1071440	1077040	Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.
1077040	1083280	And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?
1083280	1088000	No. No voting. Smashing.
1088080	1093600	Well, you know what? Since she's the one with the plan, apparently, I guess, just do whatever she says.
1098160	1100160	Tabi, why don't you go take a bath?
1104080	1106480	Good kitty. Don't close the door.
1106480	1110800	Dear comrades, the central catgirl committee has determined that ContraPoints is,
1110800	1114400	and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.
1114400	1117920	The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video
1117920	1120320	with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabi.
1144400	1146400	This video is made possible by the U.S. Department of Information, the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information.
1174400	1176400	Thank you for watching.
