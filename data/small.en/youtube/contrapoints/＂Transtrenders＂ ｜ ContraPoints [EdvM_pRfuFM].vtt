00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital

00:12.720 --> 00:19.920
messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there

00:19.920 --> 00:25.840
are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and alone

00:25.840 --> 00:31.680
I came upon them, and the glory of my posts taught about me, and I delivered unto them

00:31.680 --> 00:33.680
a vision.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.280
Freedom, freedom, fuck in freedom, which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life

00:49.280 --> 00:54.480
or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jack-boo. As a centrist, I am

00:54.480 --> 01:00.560
undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it. Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host

01:00.560 --> 01:05.760
of The Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.

01:05.760 --> 01:12.000
How dangerous are they? Muslims, can we stop them? Tonight we return once again to the dangerous

01:12.000 --> 01:17.920
transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half and halfs and in-betweens.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.080
I mean look at this, they're transing 13 year olds now, what's next? Babies with breast implants?

01:24.080 --> 01:30.800
It makes me want to throw up. I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.320
Cut the music. Tonight my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and

01:36.320 --> 01:42.640
conservative opinion haver, and my second guest, well what the hell are you? You're transgender,

01:42.640 --> 01:48.960
you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal? Well Jackie Jackson,

01:48.960 --> 01:57.040
my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society forcing me into tiny little boxes. Okay, but are

01:57.040 --> 02:03.520
you a man or a woman? Just tell me. Well why does it matter? Why do you have to know? Maybe you

02:03.520 --> 02:09.520
should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories.

02:09.520 --> 02:17.120
Jackie Jackson. Well can I at least ask your name or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

02:17.120 --> 02:25.120
My name is Baltimore. Baltimore what? Baltimore Maryland. I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore

02:25.120 --> 02:32.640
Maryland? It is among my names. Tiffany, what do you make of this? Look Jackie, I'm gonna be

02:32.640 --> 02:38.480
completely real with you. I am a transsexual, that means I have a very specific mental disorder

02:38.480 --> 02:43.360
called gender dysphoria. I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance

02:43.360 --> 02:48.800
in the womb. This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones

02:48.800 --> 02:53.840
and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function. It is not a fashion statement,

02:53.840 --> 02:59.040
it is not a trend, it is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed. It is a very difficult

02:59.040 --> 03:08.880
condition to live with. I'm dying inside. Okay, so you're both transsexuals then. Now I am a

03:08.880 --> 03:15.760
transsexual. That is not a transsexual. That is a trans-trender. Trans-trender? Well what is that?

03:15.760 --> 03:21.200
Is that a gender? No, it's not a gender. A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here

03:21.200 --> 03:26.640
who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender

03:26.640 --> 03:32.960
and complaining about misgendering for oppression points. Actually, it's they. What? I use they

03:32.960 --> 03:39.120
them pronouns. They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see. Why do you say that,

03:39.120 --> 03:46.880
Tiffany Tumbles? Have I complained about oppression so far? It seems to me that it is you who has been

03:46.880 --> 03:55.040
complaining about your dysphoria. Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

03:55.040 --> 04:00.880
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed. I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

04:00.880 --> 04:09.840
It's in my brain. I was diagnosed. It's a fact. It's real. My pain is real. And my pain isn't real?

04:10.720 --> 04:16.240
It's interesting that you think that. Well, what pain are you talking about? People making fun of

04:16.240 --> 04:20.320
you because you dress like a circus act? Interesting that you mentioned the circus,

04:20.320 --> 04:27.360
Tiffany Tumbles. Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the

04:27.360 --> 04:33.920
circus? You're not confined anywhere. You choose to dress like that. And why do you choose to dress

04:33.920 --> 04:40.400
the way you dress? Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman. Hello. And I'm non-binary,

04:40.400 --> 04:48.720
so I dress non-conforming. Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

04:48.720 --> 04:53.760
Well, it's a free country. If you want to be a glitter of your gender fuck, then go ahead.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.480
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a

04:58.480 --> 05:05.200
bunch of trendy freaks. But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society? Do you think you can

05:05.200 --> 05:13.040
purchase acceptance through conformity? Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles. That is

05:13.040 --> 05:19.600
simply adding another cell to the prison. It's not about conforming. It's about me having an actual

05:19.600 --> 05:26.080
medical condition. You do not have a female brain. You have a fashion disaster. Oh, do they?

05:26.800 --> 05:32.320
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles. When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he

05:33.040 --> 05:40.560
take a look at your brain then? What? Of course not. But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

05:40.560 --> 05:47.520
Well, no. Where are you going with this? I mean, if you've never seen your brain and the doctor

05:47.600 --> 05:53.280
who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it, then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.360
how do you know that you have a female brain?

06:02.160 --> 06:07.760
Well, shit, that's a good point. No, it isn't. Look, there's scientific studies. Can you explain

06:07.760 --> 06:14.960
to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain? Are they different colors?

06:14.960 --> 06:19.200
I'm not an expert, but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

06:19.200 --> 06:27.360
I see, but your doctor never looked at your brain. So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

06:27.360 --> 06:33.280
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it. And you told him what exactly?

06:34.080 --> 06:39.680
That I experienced gender dysphoria. So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

06:39.680 --> 06:46.480
and therefore your identity, is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain, but

06:47.600 --> 06:48.400
because of your...

06:52.000 --> 06:57.120
feelings? Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter. You backed me into a corner.

06:57.120 --> 07:04.080
Sure. It's because of my feelings. My feelings of gender dysphoria. So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

07:04.800 --> 07:12.800
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid, but mine, according to you, are not?

07:14.240 --> 07:20.560
This burgeoning brick. You guys, let's think about this. If I have never seen my brain,

07:22.400 --> 07:27.920
how do I know I even have a brain? Well, you probably don't, girl. Look, Baltimore, I'm sure

07:27.920 --> 07:33.360
you have lots of feelings about your gender. And if you feel cloud gender, or demi nebula,

07:33.360 --> 07:40.400
or astroglide, or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind, then you do you, girl. Or not

07:40.400 --> 07:47.920
girl. Whatever the fuck you are. But I want to make one thing very clear. I am nothing like you,

07:47.920 --> 07:54.000
okay? My gender is not unicorns and glitter. My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis that

07:54.000 --> 08:01.040
I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. No, not even you. My? I'm really getting under your skin,

08:01.040 --> 08:07.280
aren't I? No. Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are. You're getting under my skin because it

08:07.280 --> 08:11.440
really rattles my dysphoria that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender

08:11.440 --> 08:18.800
community when in fact you're just making a mockery of my pain. Your pain? You're in a lot of pain,

08:18.800 --> 08:25.920
aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles? Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

08:25.920 --> 08:31.520
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles. I pity you because you don't think you're real

08:31.520 --> 08:38.720
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad. And I can't imagine what it must be like

08:38.720 --> 08:45.680
to have so little confidence in your own reality. Okay, well, don't patronize me. I'm just trying to

08:45.680 --> 08:52.160
understand, Tiffany Tumbles, why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating

08:52.160 --> 08:58.640
your body. Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory? Now, you don't have to hate yourself

08:58.640 --> 09:03.200
or hate your body, but you do have to have dysphoria. And if you tell people otherwise,

09:03.200 --> 09:09.360
you're just misleading them. I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles. Would

09:09.440 --> 09:15.680
you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness? Actually, I would strongly prefer if

09:15.680 --> 09:20.480
you would stay away from any of my rifts. Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect

09:20.480 --> 09:26.880
Tiffany against the ravages of inner strife and close her and your loving arms and cleanse her of

09:26.880 --> 09:33.680
all condemnation and internalized transphobia. I entreat you, oh great mother, bathe Tiffany in

09:33.680 --> 09:40.800
her peace, acceptance and self care and rid her of her toxic cisnormative truce gone ways. Amen.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.520
Are we done here? I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.

09:45.520 --> 09:50.640
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver on to you? Because I'm grossed out by

09:50.640 --> 09:57.280
you. That's why. Okay, then. Well, namaste, bitch. Look, why don't we all take a step back

09:57.280 --> 10:05.040
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform and let them know how much we appreciate

10:05.040 --> 10:10.960
their service. God, I love the troops. Thinking about the troops makes me wet. It makes me come.

10:11.680 --> 10:21.120
Semper Fi, boys. What? I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

10:21.120 --> 10:27.520
Tiffany, your transsexualism. I have to say I don't love it, but you do seem to at least be

10:27.520 --> 10:33.360
aware that you have some kind of mental disorder. So I'll give you that. Whereas Baltimore,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.760
you're what? Making some kind of statement? If my existence is a statement, I think that says more

10:39.760 --> 10:44.400
about society than it says about me. Jackie, what you have to understand is there have been

10:44.400 --> 10:50.240
transsexuals around for a long time. I have talked to 80 year old transsexuals and they agree with

10:50.320 --> 10:57.120
me that all this genderqueer bullshit, it's just a trend. It's a fact. But is it? For thousands of

10:57.120 --> 11:02.720
years, there have been third gender groups across human cultures. There's the Hijra of India,

11:02.720 --> 11:08.560
the two-spirit people among Native Americans. Whereas binary transsexualism is a medical

11:08.560 --> 11:15.040
construct of the 20th century. Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until

11:15.040 --> 11:24.240
2013, meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis. So perhaps it is

11:24.240 --> 11:35.600
you, Tiffany Tumbles, and not I who is following a trend. Wow, that just blew my mind. Well,

11:35.600 --> 11:41.440
tables are turned, bitch. Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a

11:41.440 --> 11:50.960
trans trender? He's not Native American, though. They. They. You know, it's kind of hard not to

11:50.960 --> 11:55.760
call you he when you have a fucking beard. If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,

11:55.760 --> 12:00.400
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that. Your honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.

12:00.400 --> 12:07.440
Okay. Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they, but what it isn't is two-spirit. Look,

12:07.520 --> 12:12.560
the SJWs don't even agree with this. They think it's racist. White people have two genders. Pick

12:12.560 --> 12:18.160
one and sit down, dude. Yeah, that's a good point. Two genders, two genders, attack helicopter.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.440
It's ma'am. Okay. Well, now you're just. Two genders, only two genders. My gender's Baltimore.

12:23.440 --> 12:29.360
I think there's 76 genders because I don't think it's for you. You're just saying that you're me

12:29.360 --> 12:35.200
and talking in a whiny voice. That is not an argument. The toxic truce gum bullies are gay

12:35.200 --> 12:40.320
eating my gender. I don't have to, you know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal

12:40.320 --> 12:47.520
with in life is assholes. It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it. Let's be ourselves.

12:47.520 --> 12:54.800
Let's totally be ourselves. All right. That's enough of this. You know, as a biological female,

12:54.800 --> 13:00.800
I honestly don't understand any of this. Okay. That was a hard T. Now does my husband sometimes wear

13:00.800 --> 13:06.160
panties around the house and ask me to call him mommy's little slut? Well, sure. But that is a

13:06.160 --> 13:12.720
matter between her and the Lord. It's best not to think about it too much. Anyway, uh, Tiffany,

13:12.720 --> 13:18.560
my brain has an easier time processing youth and whatever is going on over here. So congratulations.

13:18.560 --> 13:25.760
You're the winner. That was some excellent free speech. Okay. Great. So in conclusion,

13:25.840 --> 13:31.760
trans trenders are real and probably dangerous. Make sure to protect your children. As for how

13:31.760 --> 13:37.040
many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.

13:37.600 --> 13:42.000
All right. That's our show. This has been the freedom report where the debate never stops.

13:43.360 --> 13:49.120
Except when the show is over. The girl can't help it. She's a Libra.

13:49.120 --> 14:01.280
Behold the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected. They gave their cheek to them

14:01.280 --> 14:07.920
that mocked their beard and did not their face from shame. But lo, Tiffany, the person who tricks

14:07.920 --> 14:14.320
the trendier than thou is shady queen. Give next of all her friend Justine and sought her counsel

14:14.320 --> 14:37.760
thus. God, damn it, Justine. I just can't with these trenders anymore. I simply cannot. You

14:37.760 --> 14:43.760
know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door. Okay. Seems a little formal.

14:45.120 --> 14:52.160
Ugh. You look great, hun. Cute. Justine, you look like absolute shit. What happened? Did the cat

14:52.160 --> 14:57.520
girl finally beat you up? No, I just, look, I slept in my makeup. Okay. Leave me alone. I've

14:57.520 --> 15:03.600
been having a difficult time. Are we serving a little depression moment? Jesus. Well, don't leave

15:03.600 --> 15:08.960
me out. I saw you on the freedom report today. Okay, girl, can we talk about Ladybeard Baltimore,

15:08.960 --> 15:15.360
Maryland? Oh, add that one to the crazy hall of fame. Really? You're happy with the way that went?

15:15.360 --> 15:19.680
You feel good about that? You feel good about yourself right now? Well, why wouldn't I?

15:20.240 --> 15:28.080
Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world than a tran

15:28.080 --> 15:34.080
who thinks she's better than other trans. It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.600
You seem to think that you're queen of the world because you're hanging on to societal

15:37.600 --> 15:43.360
acceptance by two fingers instead of one. Well, you're not, bitch. You're just an insecure,

15:43.360 --> 15:48.400
frightened little queer who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread

15:48.400 --> 15:53.200
other people down. And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.520
Your eyelash is coming unglued.

16:00.720 --> 16:06.720
My life is coming unglued. Look, it's not like I'm coming out to trannies who just can't afford

16:06.720 --> 16:11.280
to transition. I don't have the social support. It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he

16:11.280 --> 16:17.840
can to pass and people just treat him like a freak for no reason. They. It's they. Are we really

16:17.840 --> 16:25.680
saying they now in private? Yes, we are. So get used to it. My name is Justine. I think

16:25.680 --> 16:31.680
misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings. I always forget that you're like

16:31.680 --> 16:36.480
actually an SGW. I always forget that you're actually an asshole. Why do I even hang out with

16:36.480 --> 16:41.040
you? Oh, because you hate yourself and you have to believe there's hope for me because if there's

16:41.040 --> 16:45.280
hope for me, there might be hope for you. Wow, you're developing self-consciousness. Where'd

16:45.280 --> 16:53.120
you learn that trick? Gigi, Tiffany. Have you ever been bullied? Oh, let's see. Let me think.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.800
Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day. But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the

16:58.800 --> 17:03.760
victim. No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully. I think you grew up getting bullied for

17:03.760 --> 17:09.600
being a sissy till you started passing as a woman. And then you got a little taste of normal. And now

17:09.600 --> 17:14.640
you want to be the one who bashes the queers. Bash them? If anything, I'm the one defending

17:14.640 --> 17:19.360
trans people from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders. You said on air

17:19.360 --> 17:25.120
that Baltimore grosses you out. Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here

17:25.120 --> 17:29.920
have nothing to do with your own self-loathing? How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is

17:29.920 --> 17:36.080
nothing like me? Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse. Oh, it's not bigotry. Look,

17:36.080 --> 17:41.920
I shouldn't have said grossed out. I'll give you that. But he does. They do make me uncomfortable.

17:41.920 --> 17:48.400
And why do you think that is? I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.720
Makes me want to down a bottle of hormones. Make sure I never look like that. Bitch,

17:52.720 --> 17:57.280
secondhand dysphoria. What is that? You know, when you look at a tranny and you just clock

17:57.280 --> 18:03.760
everything and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria? Yeah, I do know what you're talking

18:03.760 --> 18:07.760
about. And I'll tell you why it happens. When you're early in your transition and you're doing

18:07.760 --> 18:12.640
everything you can to pass, you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little

18:12.640 --> 18:19.040
thing that makes you clockable. Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people

18:19.040 --> 18:25.280
and you project your dysphoria onto them. I buy that. Yeah. Well, that is absolutely not a valid

18:25.280 --> 18:31.120
reason to please other trans people's presentation. Secondhand dysphoria is not valid. The fact that

18:31.120 --> 18:37.040
you project your dysphoria onto other people is your problem and your problem alone. And you need

18:37.040 --> 18:42.320
to deal with that issue in private, girl, not on a fucking talk show. Yeah, you're probably right

18:42.320 --> 18:49.280
about that, but it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid. Tiffany, let's be

18:49.280 --> 18:54.400
pragmatic about this. Suppose everything you're saying is true. Suppose the only real trans people

18:54.400 --> 18:58.800
are dysphoric, binary transgender people, transsexuals. Every time you say the word

18:58.800 --> 19:04.160
transsexual, I feel like it's 1978. Are you 80 years old? I guess you could say I'm not the

19:04.160 --> 19:09.760
trendiest person. Haha. Look, suppose you're right and everyone who doesn't meet your definition

19:09.760 --> 19:15.440
of a transsexual is some kind of confused trend follower. Even if that were true, and to be clear,

19:15.440 --> 19:20.480
it isn't, what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid because virtually

19:20.480 --> 19:24.720
every trans person goes through a period of being confused about their gender and of having

19:24.720 --> 19:29.920
nonconforming expression. And you're going around enforcing a stigma against that. Didn't you ever

19:29.920 --> 19:35.360
have doubts about your gender? Weren't you ever androgynous? Oh yeah, I mean, I was never a sad

19:35.360 --> 19:42.000
burgeoning, but I had my little cringe here being a non-binary SJW. Uh-huh. And one of the great

19:42.000 --> 19:47.200
things about non-binary identities is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist,

19:47.200 --> 19:51.680
even when neither gender really fits them, whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple

19:51.680 --> 19:56.560
months. Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated for being a trenderer during

19:56.560 --> 20:02.640
your exploration year might not have been the most helpful thing? Not really. I have dysphoria,

20:02.640 --> 20:07.520
so if anyone called me a trenderer, I'd eventually prove them wrong. That's all I'm saying. If you're

20:07.520 --> 20:13.120
not a trenderer, then transition. Prove me wrong. The stigma you perpetuate against gender confusion

20:13.120 --> 20:19.040
and experimentation keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition. It alienates baby

20:19.040 --> 20:24.720
trans from the community that should be welcoming them instead of publicly humiliating them. And when

20:24.720 --> 20:30.480
you appoint yourself the public decider of whomst is really trans, the torquemata of the trender

20:30.480 --> 20:36.000
inquisition, you're terrorizing a lot of people who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.880
Okay. But then how do we decide which t***ies are valid? We don't. This is where I'm losing you,

20:42.880 --> 20:48.400
because trendstrenders are absolutely a thing. Like, undeniably. I've talked to people who've

20:48.400 --> 20:53.920
literally told me they used to be trendstrenders. So, some people question their gender but end up

20:53.920 --> 20:58.480
deciding they're not really trans. There is nothing wrong with that. And those people still

20:58.480 --> 21:02.800
aren't being helped by public shaming. Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place if

21:02.800 --> 21:07.520
SJW's weren't going around telling people they don't need dysphoria to be trans. You know, it's

21:07.520 --> 21:12.000
one thing if teenage girls want to dye their hair pink and call themselves demi-boys for most of

21:12.000 --> 21:17.280
sophomore year. But some of these kids are actually going to medically transition. And soon, we're going

21:17.280 --> 21:21.760
to have an epidemic of detransitioners on our hands. And there's going to be TERFs publishing,

21:21.760 --> 21:27.280
I told you so, op-eds in every major newspaper. Now, maybe you think that's worth it just to make

21:27.280 --> 21:33.600
sure no one ever feels invalidated for any reason. But I think that's highly irresponsible. Look,

21:33.600 --> 21:38.000
if you're so worried about people feeling pressured to medically transition, then what you

21:38.000 --> 21:42.960
should be doing is working to make the trans community as inclusive and welcoming as possible

21:42.960 --> 21:47.920
to gender non-conforming people and non-binary people and people who are questioning and trans

21:47.920 --> 21:53.280
people who don't medically transition. But instead, you're doing the exact opposite. You're telling

21:53.280 --> 21:58.080
everyone that medical transition is the only way to be valid. And if anything is pressuring people

21:58.080 --> 22:05.120
to medically transition, it's that. Justine, I think you're a good person. Maybe too good. And

22:05.120 --> 22:09.760
that's why you're trying to have compassion for everyone. But at some point, you have to protect

22:09.760 --> 22:15.120
yourself. We live in a world of Jackie Jackson's who don't understand trans people and don't think

22:15.200 --> 22:20.560
we're real. So we need to have an explanation of what it is to be trans that's based on facts and

22:20.560 --> 22:26.160
not feelings. And the most factual explanation is transmedicalism, which is the idea that

22:26.160 --> 22:31.360
transsexualism is a diagnosable mental disorder called gender dysphoria. There's science to back

22:31.360 --> 22:36.960
this up. It's accepted by medical professionals, and it clearly explains why we are valid,

22:36.960 --> 22:42.480
unlike Rachel Dolezal and snowflake gender teenagers and people who identify as cats.

22:42.480 --> 22:48.240
Okay, I see the appeal, but I don't think transmedicalism is as validating as you think it is.

22:48.240 --> 22:53.600
Why not? I'll put it bluntly. Why does having gender dysphoria make you a woman? Because gender

22:53.600 --> 22:59.120
dysphoria means I have a female brain. No, it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you, but the science

22:59.120 --> 23:04.640
does not say what you think it says. There may be neurological causes of gender dysphoria. But at the

23:04.640 --> 23:10.480
end of the day, all dysphoria is is discomfort in a male body or a male social role or however you

23:10.480 --> 23:19.120
want to put it. And wanting to be a woman is not the same thing as being a woman, not by any means.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.800
Girl, where are you going with this? What is this? Are you becoming a turf? No, I just don't think

23:22.800 --> 23:28.160
your theory actually validates our womanhood. Well, if you're right, that's a real problem,

23:28.160 --> 23:33.280
because we need to have reason and science and logic and facts on our side so that we can

23:33.280 --> 23:40.720
explain to society that we are valid and that we are real. Otherwise, bad things. Well, maybe

23:40.720 --> 23:46.240
there's a better theory. Well, okay, Socrates, let's hear it then. The way I see it, gender is

23:46.240 --> 23:53.520
either psychological or biological or social. Now, my friend Tabby, the cat girl, she thinks it's all

23:53.520 --> 23:58.720
psychological, that it's just identity, that whatever you think about your own gender is true.

23:58.720 --> 24:03.680
And that makes me really uncomfortable because then what's the difference between identifying

24:03.680 --> 24:09.840
as a woman and identifying as a Norwegian forest cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself seems

24:09.840 --> 24:13.120
not to have much of a grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to tell you about

24:13.120 --> 24:17.760
transtrenders this entire time. Just let me finish. If gender is strictly biological,

24:17.760 --> 24:22.400
then that's game over for trans people unless you make some kind of wrong brain and the wrong body

24:22.400 --> 24:27.280
argument. But I told you I'm not buying that. So that leaves gender as a social construct.

24:27.280 --> 24:32.160
Are you gonna try to make me read Judith Butler again? I'll summarize it. Gender is a series of

24:32.160 --> 24:37.120
gestures. It's called performativity. It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak. It's the

24:37.120 --> 24:42.560
way you act. It's the way you relate to other people. Through transitioning, we habituate to

24:42.560 --> 24:48.480
the gestures of womanhood and socially that makes us women regardless of biology or psychology,

24:48.480 --> 24:56.160
checkmate transphobes. Okay, the problem with that is that it's both too exclusionary

24:56.160 --> 25:01.360
and too inclusive. It excludes a lot of trans people who can't transition for circumstantial

25:01.360 --> 25:07.440
reasons, but whose dysphoria is very real. And it includes every transtrender, drag queen,

25:07.440 --> 25:13.680
fetishist, and two-bit cross-dressing comedian in a dino wig. Uh, well, do you really believe

25:13.680 --> 25:20.960
that a man who plays a woman on stage becomes just as much of a woman as you and me? Yes? Bitch,

25:20.960 --> 25:27.040
no you don't. Yeah, you're right. I'm full of shit. I know you are because you're an SJW,

25:27.040 --> 25:31.280
and SJWs hate performativity theory almost as much as they hate me. Well, they only hate it

25:31.280 --> 25:35.760
because they don't understand it. They think it invalidates non-binary identities, but in fact,

25:35.760 --> 25:40.800
it's the most rational way to explain non-binary identities. How can you perform a non-binary

25:40.800 --> 25:46.480
identity? Simple. You learn the rules so you can break them. Wearing a beard and a dress communicates

25:46.480 --> 25:52.080
ambiguity. Even the gesture of declaring, I am neither a man or a woman, is a speech act that

25:52.080 --> 25:56.880
removes the speaker from the semantics of- Girl, shut up. This is too much philosophizing. I can't

25:56.880 --> 26:01.120
stand it anymore. Why don't you tell me what's really going on with you? Why do you look like

26:01.120 --> 26:05.200
you've been in a k-hole for a week? Why are you suddenly so obsessed with white knighting for

26:05.200 --> 26:12.000
non-binary people? Because I am non-binary. No, you're not. What are you talking about?

26:12.560 --> 26:19.120
I just feel like since I started transitioning, I've been trying so hard to fit in and to perform

26:19.120 --> 26:25.920
my gender and to pass and to just be normal. But I can't do it anymore. I just cannot make it work.

26:26.480 --> 26:31.600
I feel like an actor. I feel like a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions of this new gender

26:31.600 --> 26:36.880
role that's supposed to liberate me, but that's somehow just as empty as the old one. Because

26:36.880 --> 26:42.080
I'm just not normal Tiffany. I am a freak and I'm always going to be a freak. Justine,

26:42.080 --> 26:48.560
you're not non-binary. You're gay and everyone can see this except you. Oh, come on. I'm not,

26:49.680 --> 26:58.160
I'm not gay. Justine was extremely gay. Protests though the lady may, there simply is no stopping

26:58.160 --> 27:14.320
a gayness. I love girls. I hate girls. Okay. So I'm a little bit gay, right? And you don't know

27:14.320 --> 27:18.640
how to reconcile your attraction to women with your desire to reform your gender. That's why

27:18.640 --> 27:24.000
you feel this dissonance. Yeah. I guess that's basically it. Well, it really shouldn't be that

27:24.000 --> 27:30.880
hard girl. You already came out as a woman. Just blurt it out. Say hello world. My name is Justine

27:30.880 --> 27:38.720
and I fuck pussy. That's a very cis normative way to say it. Hello world. My name is Justine and

27:39.280 --> 27:45.680
I fuck pussy. Oh, I feel like a man when I say it. Yeah. Well, you should probably buy a pickup

27:45.680 --> 27:51.200
truck then get some of those mud flaps on the back with the little sexy ladies on them. And

27:51.200 --> 27:56.160
you may as well change your name back to Justin. Okay. Well, that's just uncalled for. Girl,

27:56.160 --> 28:01.280
I don't know what to say except I told you so. Sexuality is just like gender identity. It is

28:01.280 --> 28:06.320
not a performance. It's not a trend. It's not a choice. It's just part of who you are. And

28:06.320 --> 28:13.600
there's nothing you can do to change it. I guess you're right. I guess my theory sucks. It sucks

28:13.600 --> 28:18.800
so fucking hard. But the good news is you can unclench your asshole now and do whatever you

28:18.800 --> 28:23.600
want because you're still a woman, whether you're performing a stereotype or not. So run free,

28:23.600 --> 28:31.120
Justine. Go top a cis woman. Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized flannel. Do whatever you want.

28:31.120 --> 28:36.400
Wow. Yeah. I guess, I guess that is pretty liberating. Yeah. Thank God for transmedicalism,

28:36.400 --> 28:42.400
right? Oh, except not because you just destroyed transmedicalism with facts and logic. So we have

28:42.400 --> 28:47.520
no theory. We have no theory, Justine. What do we do now? How do we prove we're valid? Well,

28:47.520 --> 28:51.680
just do what every trans woman has done since the beginning of time. Go out and

28:51.680 --> 28:57.600
fuck the most brutally heterosexual man you can find and be validated and come. Oh, honey,

28:57.600 --> 29:02.480
I have and I will, but that's not going to convince anyone but me. It's not a proof.

29:02.480 --> 29:07.760
It's not a theory. Well, maybe we don't need a theory. Maybe we don't need to prove anything.

29:08.480 --> 29:13.840
Bad things, Justine. Bad things. Well, do we have a theory about why people are gay?

29:13.840 --> 29:18.960
No, they just are. The only reason we even feel like we need a theory about trans people

29:18.960 --> 29:24.480
is that society is so unaccepting of us that it's constantly demanding we justify our own reality.

29:24.480 --> 29:28.960
Okay. So what am I supposed to tell Jackie Jackson then? What am I supposed to tell the

29:28.960 --> 29:35.680
TERFs? That I'm a woman because reasons? No, not even because reasons. Just because you are.

29:35.680 --> 29:40.720
So it's what? A leap of faith? Oh, great. I'm sure that's going to convince all the rational

29:40.720 --> 29:47.760
skeptics. Justine, it makes us sound completely delusional. Well, Tiffany, delusion is what

29:47.760 --> 29:52.320
separates us from the animals. Who do you think built the pyramids and the cathedrals? Clearly

29:52.320 --> 29:56.320
not people with a perfectly rational worldview. But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one

29:56.320 --> 30:01.120
who thinks being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't describe it as the height of sanity,

30:01.120 --> 30:05.520
but I would prefer to think that my whole life and identity is based on something I can rationally

30:05.520 --> 30:11.120
explain. Well, what are we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the single most obnoxious thing about men that

30:11.120 --> 30:16.960
they think they have to wrap up the entire world in a little rational box? Maybe the most important

30:16.960 --> 30:22.720
things in life can't be logically proved. Can you logically prove that you love your own children?

30:22.720 --> 30:29.840
No. And the attempt to prove it is as degrading as it is futile. Maybe gender identity is one of

30:29.840 --> 30:36.560
those things. Okay. But then how do I prove I'm more valid than Baltimore, Maryland and the star

30:36.560 --> 30:42.160
genders and the cat people? Well, maybe we should stop getting so caught up in proving our validity

30:42.160 --> 30:47.360
to ourselves that we end up being horribly cruel to other people. What if we just accept all the

30:47.360 --> 30:52.560
freaks of the world? At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as important to have logical proofs

30:52.560 --> 30:56.160
as it is to be empathetic and open-minded and compassionate.

30:58.320 --> 31:13.040
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya.

31:13.040 --> 31:18.400
I have something to tell you. Here it comes. I love you.

31:18.400 --> 31:27.200
Okay. Well, I'm going to get going now. I have an important date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries

31:27.200 --> 31:34.320
and reading YouTube comments by myself. So I'd really better go do that. But good luck with

31:34.320 --> 31:45.760
your new life as a male lesbian who fucks cats. Are you upset? Just go. I'm sorry.

31:49.360 --> 31:54.640
Oh, I hate this bitch, but God, she's a yum yum.

32:00.400 --> 32:05.920
Harken children, in this vision, you have witnessed world fools on the screen.

32:05.920 --> 32:15.120
Fools who did all of themselves. But I, your goddess mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.

32:15.120 --> 32:24.400
For I am truth. I am light. I am in capitalism. And everything I tweet is woke. Most importantly,

32:24.400 --> 32:33.280
I love myself. I love myself so much. It makes me wet. It makes me cum. Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.840
Like, comment, and subscribe. Amen.
