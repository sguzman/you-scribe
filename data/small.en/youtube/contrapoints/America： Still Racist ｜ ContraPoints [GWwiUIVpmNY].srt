1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
do.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,480
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,240
toad venom, and you simply wait for the Wolverines to eat your legs.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,880
Trust me, you're better off that way.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,900
Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race, well, here's what you get.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,000
You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists tag team title match tonight

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,240
at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,880
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy nilly convicting innocent black

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
people of crimes they didn't commit.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,640
Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices for which they have

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,680
to deal with the consequences.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,940
Racism isn't an explanation for everything bad that happens to black people.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,800
If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,180
That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,760
to commit more crimes for no reason.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,600
I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music, or deadbeat dads with their sagging

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
pants.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I'd say that this is the most common right wing view of race in America.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,560
It's not outright fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,320
racial inequality is a product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
bad choices.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
Usually this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
inequality and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,680
Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,620
This is what I'm going to argue against in this video.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,920
We're going to take a break from talking about fascism.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,240
In the past, I've focused too much on the alt-right.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
I think we all have.

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,640
I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement, but it's just not

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,040
the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,360
In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America, which

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,320
is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,720
And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,440
of Pepe's and racist Odinists and neo-Nazi larpers.

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,720
All that stuff, it's very last season.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm kind of over it.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Oh, god damn it.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Hello Leiter.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Fritz, get the hell out of here.

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
No one cares about you anymore.

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
No one cares about you anymore.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
No.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't care.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I don't care.

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
You're still a Nazi.

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Get out.

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
But I'm trans.

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
How could I possibly be a Nazi?

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
That's a good question.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:21,720
It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Get out.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,040
She calls me a Nazi, and yet she is the one trying to silence my free speech, an excellent

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,960
example of how truly fascist the left has become.

55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,760
Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
the free marketplace of ideas?

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,280
Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
of my room.

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Mom, get out of my life.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish question?

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
No.

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It's just ideas.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
What are you afraid of?

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
here in ten seconds.

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Ten.

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Nine.

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Oh, baby.

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Come on.

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
I thought you liked to be.

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Six.

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
You used to whisper to me so sweetly.

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Well, not anymore.

74
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,840
Well, do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax?

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, Jesus.

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
I don't like doing this.

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
I prefer to have conversations about disagreements.

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,600
I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people.

79
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,440
They just give you no choice.

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Where were we?

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Right, so racial injustice.

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,440
When I talk to people about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists

83
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,920
react to them in two ways.

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,000
One, by saying you're racist.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,480
And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
a lot of people have.

88
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,760
And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this.

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
No offense.

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,040
And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are more

91
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,360
than happy to educate people in their own special way.

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
So as I see it, the left needs to step it up.

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,840
Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,200
explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole, and it's true, it's not their

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
job to explain it to you.

96
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,440
They have other shit to do with their lives.

97
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,520
But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520
lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes.

99
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,840
Because it kind of is my job, and I have all the time in the world.

100
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,880
It's a funny thing, time.

101
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,640
Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history?

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,920
Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a long time ago?

103
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,840
I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July.

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
This person?

105
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Who the fuck is that?

106
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
No, I don't have any white guilt.

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
That's not what this is about.

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,840
That's just more white narcissism is what that is.

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,680
So wipe away those white-ass tears.

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Here, I'll pick you out of cotton ball.

111
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,480
1.

112
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Freddie Gray

113
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,640
On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,920
a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted

115
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,320
knife that maybe was illegal.

116
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.

117
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,800
His leg broke and yachts, man, I didn't like that.

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,480
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,760
A week later, Gray died of his spinal injury, while the Baltimore police released contradictory

121
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,000
and inadequate information about his arrest.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,720
This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Baltimore riots.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,320
Now, you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism if black people don't

125
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,280
want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police?

126
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,880
Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent crimes

127
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,120
shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming to

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,760
me how quick you are to defend this.

129
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,760
And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine

130
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,040
the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and

131
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,880
are subject to more aggressive policing.

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,360
So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,720
Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators

134
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,480
brought this out as evidence that he was no angel.

135
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,360
The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, but he deserved

136
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
to die.

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place?

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition.

139
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
Did he just do it for no reason?

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
Well, let's see.

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,960
Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood, Sandtown Winchester.

142
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,760
You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated row house

143
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
with peeling lead paint.

144
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because

145
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,760
it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to deficits in attention and increased

146
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,040
aggression which may explain why children poisoned with lead are seven times more likely

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,680
and six times more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,880
But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with a congressional ban

149
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,440
on lead paint, and as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's

150
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,480
lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.

151
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,720
Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,640
brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids.

153
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Now you might be thinking, well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right?

154
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,080
Well, unfortunately, no.

155
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,960
What's happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,240
poisoning victims, some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their

157
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,220
structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total

158
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
worth of the settlement.

159
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,480
And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,920
In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for

161
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
$18,300.

162
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,400
They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray siblings

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,240
settlement for $54,000.

164
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,800
Now I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad, but to understand how it relates to structural

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation.

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,200
Or you know, we could just keep doing livestreams with Richard Spencer.

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,600
Interviews with Nazis, the new YouTube craze.

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
God damn it.

169
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I need to relax.

170
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I need music.

171
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm just a race down in every corner.

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Two.

173
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
Housing discrimination.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated

175
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,480
lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white.

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Lead.

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Race.

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Lead.

180
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Race.

181
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

182
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,560
Why in the 21st century is Baltimore still so segregated?

183
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,000
I thought racism was over.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Well, here's the thing about that.

185
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,360
When your country's history is 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't

186
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,320
just get to say, oops, sorry about that.

187
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
It's all cool now though, right?

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
No, it's not cool.

189
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,580
Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.

191
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,420
I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that 100 years ago, America may

192
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,100
have been somewhat racist.

193
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,460
In 1910, a Yale educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

194
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,960
white Baltimore neighborhood.

195
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,740
This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city passed an ordinance

196
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,940
mandating the segregation of every residential block.

197
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,740
Basically, the ordinance forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks

198
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,300
and vice versa until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

199
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,760
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?

200
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,980
Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

201
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,180
Well, no, that's actually not correct.

202
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,620
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote home ownership in

203
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,600
the midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.

204
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,020
One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,

205
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,020
which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.

206
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,020
FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating home ownership throughout the

207
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,860
middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden

208
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,300
age of the American Dream.

209
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,020
But many black Americans were excluded from home ownership and the benefits it conferred

210
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,060
to white families, particularly the family financial stability it enabled.

211
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,860
So how was this exclusion possible?

212
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle

213
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,380
methods to enforce residential segregation and deny home ownership to black Americans.

214
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,020
For instance, 1.

215
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
Restrictive Covenants

216
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,500
When the 1910 Ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

217
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,740
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods

218
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,660
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

219
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,420
These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued

220
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,420
against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

221
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,420
2.

222
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Red Signing

223
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,340
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to ensure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were

224
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,380
colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name redlining.

225
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,700
This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which, in

226
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,020
turn, left them vulnerable to three predatory lending.

227
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,260
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed

228
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,180
mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans with abusive

229
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,700
terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single

230
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
missed payment.

231
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,220
Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and

232
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,700
they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,

233
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,140
further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.

234
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
4.

235
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,140
Blockbusting

236
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,540
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting, where they'd

237
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,100
intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of a white

238
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
neighborhood.

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,140
They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners into selling

240
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,900
their houses at below-market prices so they could resell those same houses at extortionate

241
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,860
prices to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

242
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,620
The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped

243
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,780
in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,

244
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,820
and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

245
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,700
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains

246
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
unredressed.

247
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,780
No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of homeownership

248
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,100
during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated $500 million

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
in Chicago alone.

250
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,820
But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination

251
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,700
of the last century is still ongoing.

252
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,020
I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fuckin' neighborhood like one mile

253
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,820
away from where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different

254
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
country.

255
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,060
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.

256
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,580
I'll compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

257
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,340
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the

258
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,740
same pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects

259
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,860
of racism have not entirely been eradicated.

260
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,140
And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

261
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,740
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,

262
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,940
Cleveland, LA.

263
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,620
All of these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a separate but equal

264
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,940
situation either.

265
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,380
Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore to this map of Baltimore police

266
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,820
stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

267
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,020
recorded police stops of black pedestrians.

268
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,060
And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and

269
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
2013.

270
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,700
Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead

271
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,900
exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems

272
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,980
going on here that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their

273
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,300
belts and do less crimes.

274
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,060
But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either, because that only accounts

275
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,180
for a small fraction of what's going on here.

276
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,780
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation, the historical

277
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,100
exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing

278
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,700
insistence on treating a problem of injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality.

279
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,620
I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt.

280
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,620
And it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

281
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,940
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.

282
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,940
You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.

283
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,700
As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra.

284
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Black Lives Matter are the real racists.

285
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,780
3. Mass Incarceration

286
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,540
Since the 1970s, the United States incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where

287
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,100
nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.

288
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,660
We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's

289
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,500
prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.

290
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,420
More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black incarceration

291
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,620
rate is almost 6 times that of whites.

292
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,180
Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in

293
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
general.

294
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,020
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants

295
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,260
are pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of

296
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
incarceration.

297
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,180
But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

298
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,260
You know, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

299
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,340
If the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

300
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

301
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
You know what?

302
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,540
Why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?

303
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Every single YouTuber.

304
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,860
Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.

305
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,580
Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can

306
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,660
finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.

307
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
God damn it.

308
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Where's my toad venom?

309
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,180
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit

310
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
more crimes.

311
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,460
For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people are

312
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,020
nearly 4 times as likely to be arrested for it.

313
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,060
And we're talking about a drug that, at this point, white America has basically decided

314
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,580
shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

315
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,380
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.

316
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,020
And just look what white people are doing to weed.

317
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,740
Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a gondrepreneur.

318
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,300
It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.

319
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,340
It's a great bronco dilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

320
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,660
Yeah, so in fact, in the back of the limousines, only one of the only legal places you can

321
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,460
consume cannabis.

322
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,780
The whites are at it again.

323
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,380
They have gentrified the marijuana.

324
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,900
And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the same drug

325
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,820
that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

326
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
A gondrepreneur.

327
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,700
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

328
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,380
This is the most basic kind of unfairness, and if this doesn't make you angry, then

329
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,540
either you're really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.

330
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,500
I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation

331
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,780
about race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial

332
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,980
executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

333
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,460
and the vicious history of discrimination in its ongoing repercussions.

334
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,900
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person

335
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,820
who takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.

336
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,940
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter

337
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,420
is and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism and its unpatriotic and

338
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,540
postmodern and racist, and I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

339
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,140
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.

340
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,620
If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare, it's

341
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,140
locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

342
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,980
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk

343
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
about that.

344
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,500
They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.

345
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
How dare they?

346
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,380
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists

347
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,140
or stock, salad-eating, basic white girl caricatures.

348
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,540
I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think, where does this

349
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?

350
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,620
I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

351
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
And here's the thing about that.

352
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,780
You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility or taking control of your life

353
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,420
to the greatest extent possible is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

354
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,500
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,940
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

356
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,980
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.

357
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Please don't do that.

358
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,660
Go succeed as much as possible.

359
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,460
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

360
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,140
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances, but we also have

361
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,860
a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions that create those circumstances

362
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
in the first place.

363
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Wow.

364
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,820
I feel like I just gave a great speech.

365
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,500
Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime

366
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
this entire time?

367
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,660
Look, I even put a lime in it.

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,020
Bud Light Lime with Lime.

369
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,500
The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much about people

370
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,460
who complain too much about racism.

371
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,260
For the final...countdown.

372
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,700
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

373
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,300
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white

374
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
people.

375
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

376
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,580
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country and someone should make videos

377
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
about those too.

378
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,020
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

379
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,380
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the

380
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
topic.

381
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,620
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

382
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,860
Like, c'mon, that should just be common sense.

383
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,940
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down, smash that unsubscribe button,

384
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,180
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos, and

385
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,460
then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have

386
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
to say.

387
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,780
Um, so, I guess that's it.

388
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,140
I was just kidding about the forest.

389
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,020
I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

390
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,020
So, I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

391
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:07,020
But his truth is marching on.

392
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

393
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

394
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

395
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,020
His truth is marching on.

396
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:32,020
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea with the glory in his bosom

397
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,020
that transfigures you and me.

398
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:45,020
As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free while God is marching on.

399
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

400
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

401
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

402
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,020
His truth is marching on.

403
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy smash the binary hill, Satan.

404
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Ow!
