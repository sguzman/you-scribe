1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I like stuff, I like this, and I like this, and I like this, and I like stuff, and I want

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
more stuff.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,320
My child, hearkened to my voice, it is I, Socrates.

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,160
Oh no, what do you want?

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,240
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,040
Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,560
My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,640
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness, the rational

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,280
contemplation of truth and justice?

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,720
Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,480
Ah, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,960
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself, perfectly

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,080
exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,360
Okay, thank you for your feedback, we'll take that into consideration.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Ugh, Greeks.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,400
But happiness, what does that word even mean?

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things, and these are questions really better left

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,440
to the philosophers, which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
video.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,200
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,880
philosophy ever produced, a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the concept of

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,400
the fetishism of the commodity.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,360
I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed video about three men who

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,880
are younger than me who travel the world and try different foods that cost different amounts

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
of money, and then say whether it was worth it.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,080
In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants at three drastically

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,240
different price points to find out which one is the most worth it.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,800
For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold, and a $1

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,800
ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold, and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
that's made of gold.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
It is a lot of gold.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,760
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
A ganjipreneur!

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,760
But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,800
We like to take it all in.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Ahh!

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,540
The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,780
These are not mere content creators, mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
revenue.

43
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,900
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,500
And what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly, far surpasses the combined

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,820
insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Sartre Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukacs, Zarathustra,

46
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,260
and even our dear breadmom, Kropotkin.

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,840
I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many, many times, but I always

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,880
come away dissatisfied and I find myself returning, yet again, to the unparalleled

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,520
masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,240
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,840
Is it worth it?

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
We may never know.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,200
Take for instance the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
Which is the better deal?

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Well, according to Karl Marx, the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,160
On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
human need.

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,000
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value, the quantity determining the ratio

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity, deriving from objectified

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,360
labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,480
But let's not oversimplify things.

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,440
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,640
the use value, exchange value dichotomy not as a mere hierarchical binary, but as a sort

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,640
of delusian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections as the

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
truffles on the pizza itself.

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Am I making myself clear?

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,920
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon and not actually

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,720
helping me think through this any better.

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,920
So let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Fuck this.

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:55,400
I like stuff, and I like shiny things.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Now that's something everyone can understand, so let's take that as the first axiom of

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,560
the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
So given that I like stuff and I like shiny things, let's return to the question.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,320
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,640
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that, but the pizza itself seems

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
kinda gross.

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,800
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras, stilton cheese, black truffles, gold

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
flakes, and caviar.

82
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,160
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,480
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,640
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment, but Andrew and Steven

85
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,440
sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop and they try to pretend that

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,560
the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm honestly speechless.

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I feel weird.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Is it the gold?

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I just ate $250.

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,200
I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,600
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,080
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza isn't

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,120
worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

95
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,960
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money on some gilded

96
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,880
piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,720
Is there a name for that feeling?

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,240
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,840
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia, a bad pizza covered in gold would just be

100
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,800
a bad pizza covered in gold.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,360
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza, but you probably wouldn't

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,120
be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,240
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it, you have to understand it in

104
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
the context of capitalism.

105
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,560
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza, and if you live in America

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,880
you have an instinctive sense for what that means, because you know all the other things

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,920
you could buy with $2,000.

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,280
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,200
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening worrying

110
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,720
about how they're going to afford golden nails.

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,040
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem not just aesthetically disappointing,

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,280
but almost obscene, or even immoral.

113
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,920
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,440
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go,

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you?

116
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,760
Because the problem isn't that Andrew Adam and Steven are bad people for buying inexpensive

117
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

118
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,120
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable these repulsive

119
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,560
juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

120
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,440
That's why I don't really agree with the philosophy of Peter Singer, who has this

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,320
idea that many of the world's problems could be solved if privileged American college students

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,560
would just become hedge fund managers and donate most of their income to buying mosquito

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
nets in the Congo.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,440
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations, but it's not going to

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,040
change the fact that the global economy is structured around cheap, exploited labor at

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,280
the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,160
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?

128
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Well they're certainly not the Jews.

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,640
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,880
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

132
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,080
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,240
So the lizards are not the Jews, they're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis, they're

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,000
not Freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda, but the key insight is that they're not

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,160
even really the capitalists.

136
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,440
The lizards are capital itself.

137
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
And what does that mean?

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,800
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product

140
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

141
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,920
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.

142
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,120
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

143
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,840
economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

145
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,440
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go

146
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,280
something like this.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,560
Humanism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating

148
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,160
large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where

149
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,280
efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
to maximize human happiness.

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

152
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Here's a question.

153
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,960
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,560
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity, so what I look for in a good

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,920
economic system is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of

156
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
it.

157
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,160
So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is does having

158
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,240
more wealth make people happier?

159
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,440
And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system,

160
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,520
and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point, but

161
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,080
the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus is somewhere between $65,000 and

162
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,920
$95,000 a year.

163
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,600
One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,060
income levels, more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical

165
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,760
bills or college tuition.

166
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,440
But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing

167
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,760
golden pizzas.

168
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,200
If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,520
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

170
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,000
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,760
the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national

172
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,320
median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,160
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the

174
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
peak happiness threshold.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,040
So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

176
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,160
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and health care,

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,680
while a few million others are like constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

178
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,640
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that, because it's not just that some people don't

179
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,280
have enough money to meet all of their needs, it's that they have to be poor while other

180
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,920
people are rich.

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,600
And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties

182
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,520
and resentments and social tensions.

183
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,720
There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows that if you reward one monkey for a

184
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,680
task with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,

185
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,080
the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,920
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

187
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,080
But that's just how it looks to me.

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
I could be wrong.

189
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,960
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
the economy works.

191
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,840
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

193
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,680
So look, if I'm wrong, and capitalism is good actually, just leave a comment and I'll

194
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,320
be happy to be proven wrong.

195
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,680
But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,520
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

198
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,960
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

199
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,960
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain

200
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,240
themselves and their families.

201
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,200
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,800
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

203
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher if they could make a good living

204
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
as a janitor?

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,800
Well, janitorial work is pretty important actually.

206
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,760
Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve

207
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
a decent living.

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,600
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the

209
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,200
kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by

210
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,480
profit anyway.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine even though he could have made millions of

212
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,440
dollars from it because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose beyond

213
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
personal profit.

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,080
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need

215
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,880
to work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

216
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
So let me get this straight.

217
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,520
You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Hypocrite much?

219
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,160
A few years ago I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticized capitalism

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,720
then, people used to say,

221
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

222
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,720
You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

223
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,

224
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,960
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,040
then according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?

226
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,080
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

227
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,360
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

228
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, no, I wouldn't.

229
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,560
Hello, I'm Tatiana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.

230
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Fuck off!

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,240
Dozvidanya fascist.

232
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,600
So granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty, but that doesn't mean that

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,560
the current system is the best and final system for all time.

234
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,280
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

235
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,680
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

236
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,760
Okay, but I like stuff.

237
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
I like stuff too.

238
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,680
I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.

239
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,360
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,

240
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,440
undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

241
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,960
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

242
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,000
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,560
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

244
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,720
But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,

245
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,640
these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

246
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,920
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,

247
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
straight guys will be like,

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,080
will there be video games after capitalism? Oh, god!

249
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,440
And yeah, there will be.

250
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

251
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,080
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,840
The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing, by John Berger,

254
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,560
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

255
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,720
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

256
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,880
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

257
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,280
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

258
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,200
And I felt kind of attacked because glamour is very important to us.

259
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
And by us, I mean the gays.

260
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,560
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy cues.

261
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,

262
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,400
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder

263
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,000
in the service of selling you shit.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,040
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour, not something essential to it.

265
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,800
And maybe glamour would actually be liberated if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

266
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,640
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that, actually, stuff is good.

267
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,840
Glamour is good. Video games are good.

268
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,880
Luxury is good. Baths are good.

269
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,680
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.

270
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,800
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza is ultimately that the $2 pizza is actually better.

271
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,320
The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,

272
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,960
So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.

274
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,880
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

275
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

276
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,400
Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way, I'm finally ready to get started.

277
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Part one, which you've all been waiting for.

278
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,440
How to end capitalism once and for all.

279
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,480
Well, I don't know. Who do you people think I am?

280
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,600
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.

281
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,440
I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

282
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,560
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

284
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Sure, it's bound to happen any day now.

285
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,160
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

286
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,440
Uh, so, I don't know. I guess vote labor.

287
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Tweet radically. Try to eat more vegetables.

288
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.

289
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,280
And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

290
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
No. No voting. Smashing.

291
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,600
Well, you know what? Since she's the one with the plan, apparently, I guess, just do whatever she says.

292
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Tabi, why don't you go take a bath?

293
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Good kitty. Don't close the door.

294
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,800
Dear comrades, the central catgirl committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

295
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

296
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,920
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

297
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,320
with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabi.

298
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
This video is made possible by the U.S. Department of Information, the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information.

299
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Thank you for watching.
