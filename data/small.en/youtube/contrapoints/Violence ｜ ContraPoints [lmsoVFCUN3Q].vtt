00:00.000 --> 00:26.600
ðŸŽµ

00:26.600 --> 00:49.600
ðŸŽµ

00:49.600 --> 00:53.400
So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?

00:53.400 --> 00:57.400
Well, I don't know. What do I look like to you? Some kind of philosopher?

00:57.400 --> 00:58.600
ðŸŽµ

00:58.600 --> 01:02.120
So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,

01:02.120 --> 01:05.400
not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.680
However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,

01:10.680 --> 01:15.560
I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.800
well, violence is fun.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.440
ðŸŽµ

01:20.440 --> 01:23.800
And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.040
It's not fun when other people are violent to you.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.800
I mean, unless that's what you're into.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.720
That is what I'm into.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.240
Did I say you could speak?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.280
No, mistress.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.080
Then shut up.

01:47.800 --> 02:05.240
ðŸŽµ

02:05.240 --> 02:05.800
That's good.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.240
Chocolatey.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.680
Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,

02:10.680 --> 02:13.080
and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.720
Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.560
I mean, if you're gonna watch a non-violent movie, you may as well read a fucking book.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.320
What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to video the old

02:23.320 --> 02:27.240
ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,

02:27.240 --> 02:31.800
a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.320
What's creepy about Alex is that film encourages us to identify with him,

02:35.320 --> 02:36.840
and he kind of draws us in.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.520
I mean, he listens to Beethoven,

02:38.520 --> 02:43.480
and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.760
Also, he tries the line.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.120
Try to watch!

02:46.120 --> 02:46.600
Shh!

02:46.600 --> 02:51.400
So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people,

02:51.400 --> 02:54.520
and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,

02:54.520 --> 02:57.560
and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.600
It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.000
So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.160
How normal is it to enjoy violence?

03:07.160 --> 03:09.800
I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,

03:09.800 --> 03:13.160
but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances

03:13.240 --> 03:16.920
where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.

03:16.920 --> 03:21.640
And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience.

03:21.640 --> 03:26.680
And I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy watching a clock work orange.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.440
It's not that they don't enjoy violence.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.520
It's that in order for them to enjoy violence,

03:30.520 --> 03:33.320
they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,

03:33.320 --> 03:36.120
and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.200
I guess it's kind of like sex.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.400
I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.480
At least, not since I started taking this shit.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.480
I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.160
A little goddamn ambiance.

03:51.160 --> 03:56.680
And you could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.

03:56.680 --> 04:01.320
You can't properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging going on in the background.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.560
But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?

04:05.560 --> 04:08.760
What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?

04:08.760 --> 04:12.040
Well, think about the TV show Long Order SVU.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.760
Which has just as much sex and violence as a clockwork orange, but which is much more popular.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.280
SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process

04:20.280 --> 04:24.840
brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.360
You like that, don't you?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.880
I love it so much.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.240
You all do.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.160
I think a lot of the appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens

04:35.160 --> 04:38.360
a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes

04:38.360 --> 04:42.360
while promising the moral purification of justified police violence.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.760
Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance of the moral psyche.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.400
When we believe that violence is morally justified,

04:49.400 --> 04:53.080
when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room fucking deserved it,

04:53.080 --> 04:55.560
we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.360
Exactly.

04:56.360 --> 05:01.960
And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines

05:01.960 --> 05:06.440
you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George Kills the Rapist.

05:06.520 --> 05:10.360
For viewers with too many moral hang-ups to get off on totally senseless violence,

05:10.360 --> 05:14.680
a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required

05:14.680 --> 05:16.600
for gratifying bloody payoff.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.280
But I wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the good

05:20.280 --> 05:24.520
person's enjoyment of justified violence and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random

05:24.520 --> 05:26.360
violence as we might like to think.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.600
Yes, the good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence,

05:30.600 --> 05:35.800
but once you get past that, there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture and swinging,

05:35.880 --> 05:41.880
thrashing, stabbing, shooting, blasting, and burning, and aesthetics of violence and destruction.

05:42.440 --> 05:47.080
Now, I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.880
and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.960
I mean, unless I get real frustrated.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.160
Shut up.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.160
Please just shut up.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.600
Oh, it's nice.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.720
I can't get straight.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.040
You're so filthy.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.160
It's time to drink your milk.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.520
But you know, when I'm playing video games and there are no moral or practical consequences

06:24.520 --> 06:28.120
to any of my actions, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.

06:30.280 --> 06:34.760
I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.

06:34.760 --> 06:41.560
I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life, and that's fun, but life itself is terrible.

07:04.760 --> 07:10.120
To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.480
I'm actually fine.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.920
I have tons of friends.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.960
I'm fine.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.560
I'm reallyâ€”I'm fine.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.160
I'm happy, okay?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.320
Here's what I want to know.

07:19.320 --> 07:24.280
Unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the

07:24.280 --> 07:27.400
gameplay of most video games is based entirely around it?

07:27.400 --> 07:31.080
Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,

07:31.080 --> 07:34.520
and that it's a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.840
And yeah, it's true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted.

07:38.840 --> 07:44.120
But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique since I like violent media,

07:44.120 --> 07:47.880
and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.960
Although sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurry

07:51.960 --> 07:53.560
with what I usually like to think.

07:54.200 --> 08:01.400
Little baby, don't you cry, mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

08:03.320 --> 08:08.200
Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary The Act of Killing chronicles the contemporary lives

08:08.200 --> 08:14.040
of the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965 to 1966.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.520
One of the killers, Anwar Congo, explains on a local television program that his torture

08:18.520 --> 08:21.800
and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies.

08:23.560 --> 08:41.080
The documentary takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrator is set to work producing

08:41.080 --> 08:45.720
cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes, stylizing the events after Westerns,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.040
mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.920
It's a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.520
And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange withdrawn from British

08:54.520 --> 09:00.120
distribution in 1973 after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.920
Now I'm not saying that violent movies make people violent,

09:02.920 --> 09:07.240
and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.920
I mean, I watch violent movies all the time and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.

09:12.760 --> 09:17.000
So now Woke Contrapoints thinks child abuse is funny.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.400
I personally drowned several of my babies and it was very traumatic for me.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.560
Why did I become an SJW again?

09:23.560 --> 09:28.280
Hey, what I want to know is what's the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful

09:28.280 --> 09:30.040
and those who are sadistic killers?

09:30.040 --> 09:34.360
Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt?

09:47.000 --> 10:06.840
So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself with some kind of flimsy excuse,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.440
you can kill without remorse.

10:08.440 --> 10:12.360
And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing

10:12.360 --> 10:14.520
and you never have to face any consequences for it.

10:14.520 --> 10:19.400
What's interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical,

10:19.400 --> 10:23.240
whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.560
In other words, the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist,

10:27.560 --> 10:31.400
except that the former happens to have better reasons backing him up or lives in a better

10:31.400 --> 10:32.600
political situation.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.880
But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?

10:35.880 --> 10:40.760
I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies, but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?

10:40.760 --> 10:45.720
What would be helpful here is an example, some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,

10:45.720 --> 10:48.120
and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.

10:48.120 --> 11:02.120
Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior, and none of them would ever enjoy it.

11:02.120 --> 11:07.720
ContraPoints has completely lived out and can't stop wringing your hands over a poor little

11:07.720 --> 11:09.800
Nazi getting hit in the face.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.000
Alright, alright, let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Let's say it's morally required, even.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.160
Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?

11:19.160 --> 11:22.280
Suppose there's a Nazi turf and he's about to punch a baby,

11:22.280 --> 11:25.960
and punching the turf Nazi is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.

11:25.960 --> 11:29.160
Socrates, is it just to punch the baby puncher?

11:29.160 --> 11:33.000
ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community for this video's ongoing

11:33.000 --> 11:34.760
trivialization of infanticide.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.400
They'd also like you to know that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,

11:37.400 --> 11:39.640
and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.

11:39.640 --> 11:43.480
Why are we even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?

11:43.480 --> 11:47.960
I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example of actual far-left violence in America

11:47.960 --> 11:49.640
that anyone seems to be able to dig up.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.320
Not for long, bourgeois dogs!

11:53.320 --> 11:55.160
Cat girls of the world unite!

11:55.880 --> 12:00.040
Tabby, could you bring it down just 27 notches or so?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.120
Why don't you take a second to relax?

12:04.120 --> 12:05.960
Just chill out a little bit.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.720
Here, have some spiked milk.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.600
Ra-ra, Rasputin, lover of the Russian fleet.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.120
There was a cat that really was gone.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.680
That was having a very interesting effect on her.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.120
I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist punching discourse,

12:24.120 --> 12:27.240
whether it's Nazis or turfs or whatever, is twofold.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.920
First, there's the optics problem.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.400
We want to convince people that, for instance,

12:31.400 --> 12:34.520
trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.080
And I can't help but wonder, is the slogan,

12:37.080 --> 12:41.000
kill all turfs, really the most effective way to convey that message?

12:42.440 --> 12:46.760
And I realize the costume I'm wearing is not the best for making this point either.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.160
But, you know, I just didn't plan well.

12:49.960 --> 12:54.760
The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic and starts being fun,

12:54.760 --> 12:57.480
as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spencer punch.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.840
Because then it's not just that we're saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary to

13:00.840 --> 13:04.200
prevent worse crimes, it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
And any time real violence becomes fun, that's a little alarming,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.840
because even if your actions are genuinely justified,

13:10.840 --> 13:13.640
you don't want to get in the habit of enjoying real violence,

13:13.640 --> 13:18.440
because the violence will continue to be fun, whether or not your justifications are any good.

13:18.440 --> 13:22.600
Though I agree there's something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-Satism hangup.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.840
For most of history, it was just accepted that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.720
and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.

13:29.720 --> 13:34.120
As a boring French postmodernist called Michael Foucault pointed out,

13:34.120 --> 13:38.280
in the 18th and 19th centuries there was a so-called humanitarian revolution

13:38.280 --> 13:42.520
that was suddenly ashamed of overt Satism with respect to criminal justice and treatment of the

13:42.520 --> 13:46.840
mentally ill, replacing brutal executions with intricate techniques of discipline.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.960
And a boring French communist called Alain Badieux

13:51.160 --> 13:57.240
argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance is actually just fucking neoliberal

13:57.240 --> 14:02.360
bullshit that encourages first world people to stage third world humanitarian interventions

14:02.360 --> 14:06.680
that look a lot like invasions for some reason, as well as opposing genuine liberation movements

14:06.680 --> 14:10.760
on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology, the bourgeois liberals claim.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.920
So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence benefits the people in power,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.880
since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia,

14:17.880 --> 14:22.280
and sometimes to make political progress you have to tar and feather some folks and

14:22.280 --> 14:25.320
cut their heads off just a little bit or punch them in the fucking face.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.080
Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this are absolutely horrified right now,

14:29.160 --> 14:33.480
and they're thinking, what's to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and

14:33.480 --> 14:38.120
unjust as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists? To which I respond, well that's an

14:38.120 --> 14:43.000
easy one, it's because my side are the good people and your side are the bad people, I'm so sorry.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.480
Seriously though, that is a pretty good question. Why don't I change the subject to avoid how much

14:47.480 --> 14:52.920
of a problem it is for the argument I'm making? Isn't all politics kind of violent? What about

14:52.920 --> 14:58.200
capitalism? Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings, and it's the relations of

14:58.200 --> 15:02.680
power that maintain or disrupt that organization, so there's always violence or the threat of

15:02.680 --> 15:07.400
violence in there somewhere. In our own society, police will use violence against us if we disobey

15:07.400 --> 15:12.280
the law or are black, and even when white people do obey the law, there's always the implicit

15:12.280 --> 15:17.240
threat of police violence, including the potential arrest and incarceration of pretty much every

15:17.240 --> 15:23.400
citizen who doesn't have enough money to- Let's talk about Western values. According to the great

15:23.400 --> 15:29.080
tradition of European political thought, sovereign power is justified by the social contract. In other

15:29.080 --> 15:34.280
words, we all consent to be governed because it's in our own interest. Except it's really hypothetical

15:34.280 --> 15:40.840
consent more than anything, because no one actually asks you, and you can't say no. Wait a minute.

15:42.360 --> 15:47.400
I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society, it's pretty easy to see how fascism

15:47.400 --> 15:51.800
and revolutionary movements are inherently violent, and how those political situations

15:51.880 --> 15:56.440
generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish. What's harder to see is how the same

15:56.440 --> 16:01.320
tendency spills out at the seams of our own supposedly humane society. We think of the

16:01.320 --> 16:08.760
police as peacekeepers, not killers, yet it's not unheard of that- Oh. Oh no. Oh god.

16:10.040 --> 16:14.760
Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions,

16:14.760 --> 16:19.960
but when you put real human beings in combat situations, the nature of war has a way of just-

16:19.960 --> 16:28.600
Oh. Oh god. No. Fuck. We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,

16:28.600 --> 16:32.760
but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.160
There's also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving,

16:37.160 --> 16:41.880
or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory, or the low-key normalization

16:41.880 --> 16:46.200
of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries, none of which requires so much as

16:46.200 --> 16:50.760
a single cackling maniac. So in order to think about this intelligently, we need to weigh the

16:50.760 --> 16:55.320
risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem against the

16:55.320 --> 17:00.920
risk that our own complacency with the injustices of the status quo will make us quiet enablers of

17:00.920 --> 17:05.640
more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence. And I don't feel confident enough to say which

17:05.640 --> 17:10.200
one I think is the bigger risk, but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone who doesn't

17:10.200 --> 17:17.720
acknowledge the problems with both options. So, in conclusion, is violence good, or is it bad?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.320
I guess we'll never know.

17:32.200 --> 17:37.080
You know, with any true philosophical question, there always comes a point when you realize that

17:37.160 --> 17:41.160
all the rationalizations you tell yourself, or all the things you believe and do, just

17:41.800 --> 17:46.200
don't really make any sense. And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?

17:46.840 --> 17:54.280
Just do the fucking laundry. Drink some wine. I don't know, do whatever. Look, what do you want from me?
