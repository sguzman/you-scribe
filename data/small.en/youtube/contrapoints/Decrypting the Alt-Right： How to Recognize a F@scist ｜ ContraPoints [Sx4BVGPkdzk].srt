1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You will not replace us, you will not replace us, you will not replace us.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
More than soil, more than soil, more than soil.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do they have any semblance of guilt?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A local World War II veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He believes what happened.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
One, people of European heritage ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as the white race,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Two, Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and non-white immigration,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Three, the only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false,

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so what is it that's attracting people to fascism?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure that out.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who are you?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They could say, I'm a Roman.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a Saxon.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm a Dane.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Good news, boys.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate,

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and defend Voltaire, an adorable blonde children against black civil rights.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know, just like the Vikings did.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We're often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German, or any European nationality,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Democracy.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Freedom.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Tolerance.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Multiculturalism.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, life is basically sad.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And in capitalist society, that sadness is a sense of isolation,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990's collector's edition

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Beersdine's Until You Die.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
a homeland for your people,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and as far into the future.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling other human beings as property.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white ethnostate is just nonsense.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is in no way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become the same thing.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt propaganda.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In the wake of the disastrous Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month,

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
At least two of their major websites were shut down,

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Confederate monuments were removed all over the country,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
None of this means fascists will go away,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
it just means they'll have to be more subtle and indirect.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Shortly after the Charlottesville rally,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared on poll,

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of Japanese nymphettes.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away is really stupid.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the Overton window to the right,

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average white person.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And the way to do that is...

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This instantly makes the average person hate you.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental overt goals.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and prioritizes white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning against you.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Leftists will recognize dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So at first glance, this seems like a really silly juvenile post that references Dragon Ball Z.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to long-term goals

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
that I wish were more common on the left.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But of course the strategy described here isn't new.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in order to appeal to racists.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You start out in 1954 by saying, by 1968, you can't say that hurts you backfires.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you say stuff like force busing states rights and all that stuff.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these things that you're talking about a totally economic things.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to hear dog whistles.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism, and white supremacy.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
At least when talking to you, a non-fascist.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Fascists are more likely to gain traction and are hence more dangerous when they use subtler tactics.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use to code their ideas

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Strategy one, outright denial. Never reveal your power level.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking points,

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism should be worth absolutely nothing to you

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and shouldn't even enter into your consideration of whether they're a fascist.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Strategy two, euphemism.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Of course I'm not a fascist. I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve Western values.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations that develop around the names of their movements

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
whenever people figure out what they really are.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So they insist they are Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
they'll shift their terminology again and start telling you,

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
or whatever the next thing is. But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist,

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
they'll talk about preserving Western civilization or Western culture instead.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people,

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
they'll talk instead about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists,

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and leave it to the audience to catch the color-coding on their own.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Strategy three, pedantry.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's absurd to call me a Nazi. The German National Socialist Party has an existence since 1945.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and also to bond you down in a petty, terminological dispute.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led you to call them a Nazi in the first place.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think that whites are superior to other races.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I simply think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest IQs,

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
he's, if anything, an Asian supremacist.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
instead of talking about the fact that the main goal of the politics he supports

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is the political and social supremacy of white people over all other Americans and Europeans.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In other words, white supremacy.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Strategy four, secret symbols.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or like the swastika itself,

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with fascism

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or at least have some other meaning, such as the Athala rune or the Iron Cross.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod at each other,

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it doesn't matter what the symbols are.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In fact, it's important that the symbols constantly change so that normies don't catch on.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Maybe it'll be this.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or this.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to identify themselves.

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try to point those symbols out,

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the fascists can always say,

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is there anything they don't think is racist?

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The poor centrists.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They're so afraid that Antifa's gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
or because of the emoji they use.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political rallies,

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh God, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And the fascists whose free speech you defend so often are trying to drum up exactly the sentiments

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
that make the police dangerous to black people

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and that make it dangerous for queer people to be themselves in public.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So I hope that's something you think about.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
or that anyone who uses it is racist.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And in fact, it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink and nudge.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
sets the stage for, strategy five,

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
camaraderie of the accused.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The left accuses everyone of racism.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They think all white people are Nazis.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
especially online.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and some of them do throw the label at centrists or liberals.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
History shows that happens regardless.

187
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But it can accelerate the process,

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
lending some plausibility to the fear that moderate centrists have

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that anti-fascists will come after the next.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and use it to pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Strategy six, irony, jokes, satire, and memes.

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Of course I wasn't actually being racist.

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It was just an edgy meme.

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can anyone take a joke anymore

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
or will the anti-fascists violently attack you over humor now too?

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes

199
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and then when called out, you mock your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Before I realized I was transgender,

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I used to jump at any opportunity to cross-dress ironically.

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So when you see people joking about being Nazis,

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
they could just be joking,

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or they could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.

206
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that just happens to use a Nazi battle flag.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
who are unable or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists,

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Kekistan became the perfect pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians,

213
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
including the ones who led the rally

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
for an edgy shit-poster hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.

215
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Pfft. Those normie fools. It's just a joke.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Strategy 7. Shifting blame.

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations,

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
like Black Lives Matter or Antifa?

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is essentially just a two-quo-quay fallacy,

221
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
especially heinous because of the equivocation between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and between white nationalism and Black civil rights.

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against Black people

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Shortly after the Charlottesville incident,

226
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
our proto-fascist president called out Antifa in the alt-left,

227
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and establish the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Both sides rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists,

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and helps to shift the center of acceptable discourse in their direction.

233
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Strategy 8. Incrementalism.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here,

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but we do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation,

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
often aimed at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
as a defense of white people and white culture.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The fascist's long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate,

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
which at some point will require massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another,

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration,

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
something they'll try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
by emphasizing the danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric,

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
they can later turn that energy against the non-white people who are already here.

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Strategy 9. The Free Speech Defense.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You may not agree with what I say,

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble as anyone else.

252
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and intimidate,

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies or by pressuring platforms not to host fascists.

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value of free speech.

255
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced you are.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.

257
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They only value the race, the people, the nation.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Their long-term goal is a society where there is no room for anyone who isn't white,

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
or even anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms,

261
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but remember, you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.

262
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They do not care about diversity of opinions.

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and to garner sympathy from centrists.

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children who don't get sexual innuendo.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy to exploit.

270
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking points without intending to or realizing it.

271
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.

272
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate fascist memes,

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
then isn't just about everyone suspect.

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?

275
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, that's what they want you to think.

276
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-light

278
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
or if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Likewise, it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-light but not an outright fascist

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and a fascist who is concealing their power level.

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The other day, the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption,

283
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is the future ACLU members want.

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And for a second I was like, what the fuck?

285
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme.

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But of course it's unintentional, it's the ACLU.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Not make a quick statement.

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes, I have become crazy.

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is the psychological consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and communicating in code.

295
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And it's the intentional consequence of that.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist psychological arsenal.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?

298
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,

299
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you.

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And I admit that I am pretty frustrated with you right now, obviously.

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better at resisting fascism.

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning.

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So don't feel guilty for falling for them, just try to get better at resisting.

304
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.

305
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you care about even one person of color or queer person or immigrant,

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
stand up for that person by opposing the alright and its allies.

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Do not give them a platform. Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.

308
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech,

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
but they do not have a right to a megaphone and you should not be giving them one.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas,

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
everyone expressing their ideas peacefully.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous.

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Now if you're just an average person without a big platform,

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
then you actually can debate and you should be debating.

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Argue with your family. Argue with your coworkers.

318
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let them know that you don't agree. Make them listen to a different perspective.

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group,

321
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you have to get out now.

322
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not too late, society will forgive you.

323
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate,

324
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
an organization founded by a former neo-Nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And as for all you lefties, naz drovia.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Keep up the good fight, comrades.

327
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thanks for watching.

328
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thanks for watching.
