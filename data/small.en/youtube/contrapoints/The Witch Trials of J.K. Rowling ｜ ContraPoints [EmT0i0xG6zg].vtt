WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Saar, I'm gonna talk about Jorro once again.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.340
But first, story time.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.680
Chapter one, Anita.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.800
The most famous bigot in American LGBT history

00:15.800 --> 00:18.240
is a woman called Anita Bryant.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.140
This is her story.

00:22.060 --> 00:25.540
1977 was not a good time to be gay.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.920
Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.740
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights

00:33.740 --> 00:35.240
into national consciousness.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.080
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,

00:38.080 --> 00:41.320
and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association

00:41.320 --> 00:44.100
declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.940
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference

00:46.940 --> 00:50.380
and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.

00:50.380 --> 00:54.980
We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.960
Because that's the only way to get anything done

00:57.960 --> 01:00.440
in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.700
They give you no choice.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.780
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,

01:05.780 --> 01:08.680
known for such popular cities as Miami,

01:08.680 --> 01:10.640
approved a law that added the phrase

01:10.640 --> 01:13.060
affectionate or sexual preference

01:13.060 --> 01:15.020
to its non-discrimination ordinance,

01:15.020 --> 01:17.980
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination

01:17.980 --> 01:20.040
on the basis of sexual orientation.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.040
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

01:24.040 --> 01:26.960
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.220
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

01:30.220 --> 01:32.140
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman

01:32.140 --> 01:34.900
who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.680
and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.240
Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.040
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida

01:44.040 --> 01:45.200
any time of the day.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.740
Orange juice from Florida!

01:46.740 --> 01:48.920
It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

01:48.920 --> 01:52.320
Orange juice with natural vitamin C

01:52.320 --> 01:55.860
from the Florida Sunshine Tree.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.700
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

01:58.700 --> 02:02.060
A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

02:02.060 --> 02:05.620
Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.460
Cute.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.140
When Anita heard her pastor speak

02:08.140 --> 02:10.160
about this non-discrimination ordinance,

02:10.160 --> 02:13.700
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.620
How touching.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.020
According to the word of God,

02:16.020 --> 02:19.980
it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.060
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.480
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner,

02:26.120 --> 02:28.320
as a concerned mother of four children,

02:28.320 --> 02:31.400
I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.480
I have never condoned

02:32.480 --> 02:35.360
nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.440
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

02:38.440 --> 02:41.880
you will in fact be infringing upon my rights

02:41.880 --> 02:44.800
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

02:44.800 --> 02:46.800
to teach my children God's moral code

02:46.800 --> 02:48.680
as stated in the Holy Scriptures.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.960
Anita, kill your shitty child.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.440
When the amendment passed,

02:52.440 --> 02:54.840
Anita created a campaign for its repeal.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.760
The Save Our Children Coalition,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.800
which sponsored provocative TV ads

02:59.800 --> 03:02.040
implying that gay people are degenerates

03:02.040 --> 03:04.920
who ruin communities and seduce children.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.600
The campaign has been vicious.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.880
With television commercials,

03:07.880 --> 03:09.760
the Save Our Children group is appealing

03:09.760 --> 03:11.560
to parental anxieties,

03:11.560 --> 03:14.000
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality

03:14.000 --> 03:15.840
before impressionable children.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.240
The Orange Bowl parade,

03:17.240 --> 03:20.640
Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.940
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

03:23.940 --> 03:25.740
it's a parade of homosexuals,

03:25.740 --> 03:27.220
men hugging other men,

03:27.220 --> 03:28.700
cavorting with little boys.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.140
Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash

03:32.140 --> 03:34.220
to gay rights in the United States,

03:34.220 --> 03:37.140
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.740
On one side were the gay rights activists

03:39.740 --> 03:41.180
who argued that non-discrimination

03:41.180 --> 03:42.860
was a matter of human rights.

03:42.860 --> 03:45.540
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued

03:45.540 --> 03:47.140
that the non-discrimination ordinance

03:47.140 --> 03:50.700
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.060
We all believe in human rights,

03:52.060 --> 03:54.820
but we don't believe human rights

03:54.820 --> 03:56.500
that would corrupt our children

03:56.500 --> 03:59.620
or for individuals who have special privileges

03:59.620 --> 04:01.820
that would go against the constitutional rights

04:01.820 --> 04:03.100
of the normal America.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.260
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

04:05.260 --> 04:07.060
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.900
In other words, gay people already have equal rights

04:09.900 --> 04:12.100
just as long as they stay in the closet

04:12.100 --> 04:13.820
and don't do anything gay.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.940
That's very helpful.

04:15.940 --> 04:18.460
Thank you so much, Anita,

04:18.460 --> 04:21.940
for standing up for our right to be gay

04:22.700 --> 04:24.020
in secret.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.660
As long as they do their job

04:25.660 --> 04:27.100
and do not want to come out of the closet

04:27.100 --> 04:29.140
and force their homosexuality

04:29.140 --> 04:32.140
on being in the areas of business or in the schools,

04:32.140 --> 04:34.060
they can live their life.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.260
And we're not going out after their jobs

04:36.260 --> 04:39.020
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.580
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals

04:42.580 --> 04:46.420
to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.500
Just biologically that God made mothers

04:48.500 --> 04:49.700
so that we could reproduce.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.060
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

04:53.060 --> 04:56.700
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.220
It's the exact same argument that's being used today

04:59.220 --> 05:00.940
by right-wing politicians who claim

05:00.940 --> 05:03.020
that queer people are groomers.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.500
Stop confusing our babies

05:05.500 --> 05:09.100
with your groomer gender ideologue.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.580
This wicked book, me and Earl and the dying girl

05:12.580 --> 05:16.380
sexually indoctrinated with wicked vile books.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.940
And she believes in traditional marriage

05:17.940 --> 05:19.020
between a man and a woman.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.980
And in that book it talked about two moms.

05:20.980 --> 05:24.460
Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.780
People should definitely arm themselves.

05:25.780 --> 05:26.620
I agree with that.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.580
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.700
The Democrats are the party of teachers,

05:31.700 --> 05:33.140
elementary school teachers,

05:33.140 --> 05:37.220
trying to transition their elementary school-aged children

05:37.220 --> 05:39.260
and convince them they're a different gender.

05:39.260 --> 05:42.620
They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.740
They're recruiting.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.020
They don't know what furries are.

05:45.020 --> 05:48.940
It's where school children dress up as animals,

05:48.940 --> 05:52.500
cats or dogs during the school day.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.940
They meow and they bark.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.140
What a great country we live in.

05:56.140 --> 05:59.020
I love it so much.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.020
Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant

06:02.020 --> 06:03.260
and save our children.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.100
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice

06:06.100 --> 06:09.060
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

06:09.060 --> 06:12.180
and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail

06:12.180 --> 06:13.980
called an Anita Bryant.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.060
Let's make one now.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.140
Forgot my cocktail measure

06:17.140 --> 06:19.620
so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.420
There's the dash of apple juice.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.860
Give it a stir.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.420
Needs a garnish.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.260
Stunning.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.780
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,

06:30.780 --> 06:32.780
but if I was in the 70s,

06:32.780 --> 06:34.940
I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things

06:34.940 --> 06:36.620
out of pure spite.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.300
There's a story that Troy Perry,

06:38.300 --> 06:39.860
the founder of the gay-affirming

06:39.860 --> 06:41.820
metropolitan community church,

06:41.820 --> 06:43.860
was on a transcontinental flight.

06:43.860 --> 06:45.700
And when the attendant put a glass of orange juice

06:45.700 --> 06:46.940
on his tray, he said,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.300
take that away.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.740
I'm a homosexual.

06:49.740 --> 06:53.260
At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,

06:53.260 --> 06:55.860
anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently

06:55.860 --> 06:58.060
on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.300
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.820
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.660
True.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.500
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired

07:06.500 --> 07:08.380
more anti-gay legislation,

07:08.380 --> 07:11.460
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,

07:11.460 --> 07:13.600
both of which passed in the Florida Senate,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.640
as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,

07:16.640 --> 07:18.240
which would have forced public schools

07:18.240 --> 07:19.880
to fire gay teachers.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.000
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.940
She was an influential bigot,

07:23.940 --> 07:26.040
but she may also have helped to unify

07:26.040 --> 07:28.080
and galvanize gay activists

07:28.080 --> 07:30.200
by providing them with a common enemy.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.400
According to historian Lillian Faderman,

07:32.400 --> 07:34.880
Anita Bryant created fervent activists

07:34.880 --> 07:36.800
out of those who'd previously been content

07:36.800 --> 07:39.240
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.620
Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation

07:41.660 --> 07:44.820
that a mass movement can get along fine without a God,

07:44.820 --> 07:47.060
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.020
For gay people all over the country,

07:49.020 --> 07:51.500
Anita Bryant became that devil.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.700
I think that she is rallying the community together

07:54.700 --> 07:56.220
like I have never seen before.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.980
It's not like I could have done it on my own.

07:57.980 --> 08:00.660
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal

08:00.660 --> 08:02.940
to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,

08:02.940 --> 08:05.420
there is no question that in the long term,

08:05.420 --> 08:07.260
Anita Bryant was the loser.

08:07.260 --> 08:08.780
She took a lot of L's.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.620
Rip.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.820
That must be super hard for her.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.820
For the short remainder of her career,

08:12.820 --> 08:15.180
gay activists protested her events.

08:15.180 --> 08:16.900
They shut down the tour for her book

08:16.900 --> 08:20.020
about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

08:20.020 --> 08:22.320
and they succeeded in turning public opinion

08:22.320 --> 08:24.260
against Anita Bryant to the point

08:24.260 --> 08:26.420
that she became virtually unemployable

08:26.420 --> 08:27.980
in mainstream entertainment.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.420
And it helped that she came across

08:29.420 --> 08:31.220
as kind of a judgmental prude

08:31.220 --> 08:32.980
that even hip straight people

08:32.980 --> 08:35.140
didn't want to be associated with.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.780
Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant,

08:37.780 --> 08:40.580
former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,

08:41.220 --> 08:43.620
performed co-eaters in public yesterday,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.980
campaigned to promote heterosexuality.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.900
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.980
Like she famously told Playboy magazine.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.380
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

08:54.380 --> 08:55.980
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit

08:55.980 --> 08:57.220
of the tree of life.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.100
God referred to men as trees,

08:59.100 --> 09:01.680
and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,

09:01.680 --> 09:02.980
which is male sperm.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.260
Oh my God.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.720
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.460
This is how you lose the culture war.

09:08.820 --> 09:11.660
Let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.660
That's the energy we surround.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.240
And of course, there was the famous incident

09:18.240 --> 09:21.020
where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie

09:21.020 --> 09:23.380
in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.660
And went into a place called North Fork, Virginia,

09:25.660 --> 09:30.220
and we're met with protest and all kinds of problems.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.060
And every-

09:34.460 --> 09:35.780
Security agent, security agent.

09:35.780 --> 09:36.620
No, no, let him stay.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.220
No. Let him stay.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.100
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.100
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated

09:42.100 --> 09:44.820
the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,

09:44.820 --> 09:48.280
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

09:48.280 --> 09:52.660
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face

09:52.660 --> 09:56.220
when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

09:56.220 --> 09:59.540
announcing her marriage to a woman and publicly struggling

09:59.540 --> 10:02.580
with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.

10:02.580 --> 10:05.580
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks

10:05.580 --> 10:08.180
that an integral part of your identity

10:08.180 --> 10:11.540
is just an evil delusion.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.620
That it is, Sarah.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.420
That it is.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.260
So that's the story of Anita Bryant

10:17.260 --> 10:19.820
as students of LGBT history know it.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.260
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

10:22.260 --> 10:25.660
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

10:25.660 --> 10:29.700
The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.460
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.740
I played on both the houses.

10:33.740 --> 10:37.060
Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita

10:37.060 --> 10:39.100
as a bigot and a homophobe?

10:39.100 --> 10:42.380
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

10:42.380 --> 10:45.420
was the real victim?

10:47.780 --> 10:48.700
Oh, no.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.540
Oh, no.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.420
I can't do this anymore.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.260
I'm eating my pie.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.620
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.980
Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

10:59.980 --> 11:00.900
God help us all.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.180
The mainstream media would have us believe

11:04.180 --> 11:06.940
that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,

11:06.940 --> 11:09.060
some kind of hateful bigot.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.340
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic

11:11.340 --> 11:13.860
used to silence valid concerns?

11:13.860 --> 11:15.820
Mothers in this country are worried

11:15.820 --> 11:17.540
about their children going to school

11:17.540 --> 11:19.460
to be taught by perverts.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.380
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals

11:22.380 --> 11:24.580
weren't the real bigots?

11:24.580 --> 11:26.860
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

11:26.860 --> 11:29.300
was the first victim of cancel culture,

11:29.300 --> 11:32.980
of dare I say it, wokeism?

11:32.980 --> 11:35.140
Well, no, that's the dumbest thing

11:35.140 --> 11:36.700
I've ever heard in my entire life.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.340
But suppose that you're an idiot,

11:38.340 --> 11:39.820
and suppose that that's the narrative

11:39.820 --> 11:41.020
you wanted to promote.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.940
Well, what would be your argument?

11:42.940 --> 11:44.500
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head

11:44.500 --> 11:46.460
and forced me to make that argument,

11:46.460 --> 11:48.900
I'd probably say something like this.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.700
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.500
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty

11:54.500 --> 11:56.060
in rural Oklahoma.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.660
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

11:58.700 --> 12:00.620
the same year she made her singing debut

12:00.620 --> 12:02.380
at the Baptist Church.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.620
Parts of my childhood,

12:03.620 --> 12:05.700
I blocked out because it hurts too much.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.100
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,

12:08.100 --> 12:09.460
and my parents were remarried,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.380
and I was baptized and came to know Christ

12:11.380 --> 12:12.940
as my personal savior.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.100
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.620
It was real painful,

12:17.620 --> 12:19.460
and it just about killed my mother.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.500
She was a very submissive wife.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.260
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.540
She let my dad step all over her.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.900
Because of him, I think I went through life

12:28.900 --> 12:30.900
for a long time hating all men.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.340
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory

12:34.340 --> 12:36.700
as a feeling of intense ambition.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.220
A relentless drive to succeed

12:38.220 --> 12:39.940
at doing well the thing I loved.

12:39.940 --> 12:44.940
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

12:45.180 --> 12:49.580
It's truth is marching on.

12:49.580 --> 12:53.300
But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role

12:53.300 --> 12:55.660
as a traditional Christian woman.

12:55.660 --> 12:58.500
In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.140
Miami's top disc jockey,

13:00.140 --> 13:03.260
the only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.260
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.140
Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.220
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

13:14.220 --> 13:16.460
Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty

13:16.460 --> 13:19.220
nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.940
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

13:21.940 --> 13:25.100
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.020
But while submitting to her husband

13:27.020 --> 13:30.100
and raising four children, Anita was still able

13:30.100 --> 13:32.220
to build the career she'd always wanted.

13:32.220 --> 13:35.660
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,

13:35.660 --> 13:37.780
earning half a million dollars a year,

13:37.780 --> 13:39.100
enough to move her family

13:39.100 --> 13:42.900
into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.340
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.860
Did she really deserve to lose it all

13:48.860 --> 13:51.300
just because she took a stand

13:51.300 --> 13:53.140
for something she believed in?

13:53.140 --> 13:55.660
Anita Bryant's role as a leader in the campaign

13:55.660 --> 13:58.380
against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign

13:58.380 --> 13:59.500
to sell orange juice.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.140
Are you being black-bowled?

14:01.140 --> 14:03.660
Well, it looks that way.

14:03.660 --> 14:04.940
It's worse than that.

14:04.940 --> 14:08.020
We're being threatened, and there's all kinds of harassment,

14:08.020 --> 14:09.700
even with my job with Florida Citrus.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.260
I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother

14:13.260 --> 14:16.340
to defend her children and all children

14:16.340 --> 14:19.100
against their being recruited by homosexuals.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.740
Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.380
She'd been dropped as a spokesperson by the orange growers.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.780
She'd been dropped as a commentator

14:25.780 --> 14:27.460
on the Orange Bowl parade.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.460
She lost a television show contract.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.260
Her bookings dropped drastically.

14:31.260 --> 14:34.220
It destroys the dream that I had had since I was a child

14:34.220 --> 14:36.580
to entertain and present wholesome subjects

14:36.580 --> 14:38.460
to my fellow Americans

14:38.460 --> 14:42.220
because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.980
No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant

14:44.980 --> 14:47.260
for taking a public stand on something she believed in.

14:47.260 --> 14:51.580
I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house

14:51.580 --> 14:53.700
in a fetal position and wanting to die.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.660
Gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics

14:57.660 --> 15:00.740
to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.620
Stop Anita now!

15:02.620 --> 15:04.980
Stop Anita now!

15:04.980 --> 15:07.420
Homosexuals started fighting back.

15:07.420 --> 15:08.940
The gays formed new groups

15:08.940 --> 15:11.380
and picketed the performers' public appearances,

15:11.380 --> 15:13.060
forcing her to cancel a few.

15:13.060 --> 15:16.660
Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.580
They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.460
They blamed her for hate crimes.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.180
They burned her an effigy.

15:23.180 --> 15:25.700
They disrupted events she was involved in.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.340
They printed toilet paper with her face on it.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.220
Some sent Anita death threats.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.140
Or they mailed her rotting oranges,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.980
dead cockroaches, human excrement.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.580
See, this is how you canceled people before phones.

15:37.580 --> 15:38.940
Instead of shitposting,

15:38.940 --> 15:41.620
you would simply mail actual human shit

15:41.620 --> 15:43.420
through the United States Postal Service.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.980
Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.260
Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.580
How would you men feel if you opened a letter

15:51.580 --> 15:54.300
and there was a photo of your wife's head superimposed

15:54.300 --> 15:55.980
on some other female nude body

15:55.980 --> 15:59.460
in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?

15:59.460 --> 16:00.540
You can imagine quite a lot.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.060
I do think it would be fair to say

16:02.060 --> 16:05.660
that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.060
Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,

16:08.060 --> 16:11.860
particularly lesbian feminists, abhorred the sexist terms

16:11.860 --> 16:14.420
that were being used to characterize Anita Bryant.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.620
Bitch and whore, gay men called her.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.660
The harassment escalated to the point

16:18.660 --> 16:20.940
where Anita had to cancel her book tour

16:20.940 --> 16:24.700
due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.780
And of course, there was the pie.

16:28.460 --> 16:31.020
So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.

16:31.020 --> 16:31.860
It's kind of a deep cut.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.860
Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.980
Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,

16:36.980 --> 16:39.340
but what about Anita's right to free speech?

16:39.340 --> 16:41.700
I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.140
Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book,

16:45.140 --> 16:47.420
Free Speech for Me, but Not for Thee,

16:47.420 --> 16:49.860
that the orange shoes boycott reminded him

16:49.860 --> 16:52.860
of a little thing called McCarthyism.

16:52.860 --> 16:55.460
Have you ever considered that being pro-gay

16:55.460 --> 16:57.980
is quite similar to being anti-gay

16:57.980 --> 17:00.100
and that both are opinions?

17:00.100 --> 17:03.420
As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God

17:03.420 --> 17:06.980
were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.

17:06.980 --> 17:09.380
The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,

17:09.380 --> 17:11.420
religious and civic leaders in opposition

17:11.420 --> 17:13.980
to a well-organized, highly financed,

17:13.980 --> 17:17.180
and politically militant group of homosexual activists.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.020
We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,

17:21.020 --> 17:23.340
and deniers of basic human rights.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.460
And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned

17:26.460 --> 17:28.220
for our children and our community.

17:28.220 --> 17:30.980
So Anita's version of the story is that she

17:30.980 --> 17:34.500
and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers

17:34.500 --> 17:38.180
were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia

17:38.180 --> 17:40.780
of gay extremists, all because they had

17:41.060 --> 17:45.220
a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual

17:45.220 --> 17:46.860
cavorting with little boys.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.340
Cavorting with little boys.

17:48.340 --> 17:51.300
Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?

17:51.300 --> 17:53.140
Until the Dade County ordinance,

17:53.140 --> 17:55.100
Anita was a registered Democrat

17:55.100 --> 17:57.220
and considered herself a liberal.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.420
And she never said that she hated gay people

17:59.420 --> 18:00.860
or wanted them dead.

18:00.860 --> 18:04.780
In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.980
I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.

18:07.980 --> 18:10.140
I love them enough to tell them the truth

18:10.140 --> 18:12.700
because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals

18:12.700 --> 18:16.660
that if they're willing to turn from sin

18:16.660 --> 18:18.340
the same as any individual,

18:18.340 --> 18:20.740
that they can be ex-homosexuals,

18:20.740 --> 18:22.300
the same as there can be an ex-murder,

18:22.300 --> 18:23.860
an ex thief, or ex-anybody.

18:23.860 --> 18:28.300
She loves homosexuals because they can change,

18:28.300 --> 18:30.140
just like murderers.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.260
Would a bigot have said that?

18:33.260 --> 18:34.860
Just about McFucking had it.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.700
Anita was so kindhearted,

18:36.700 --> 18:40.220
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.020
I can relate to the homosexual

18:42.020 --> 18:44.900
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.900
I really felt the rejection of my father.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.220
And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone

18:49.220 --> 18:51.100
going into homosexuality.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.220
Look, I don't hate homosexuals.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.180
That's the truth.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.100
No matter what they think of my motives.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.620
I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.260
Wow, what an empath.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.140
You know, I actually think it's really noble

19:03.140 --> 19:06.340
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

19:06.340 --> 19:07.740
onto the marginalized group

19:07.740 --> 19:10.500
whose rights she's trying to take away.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.660
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,

19:13.660 --> 19:14.740
to many sides.

19:14.740 --> 19:16.900
We've considered all the evidence.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.140
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

19:20.140 --> 19:23.860
and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve

19:23.860 --> 19:25.300
that pie to the face?

19:25.300 --> 19:28.140
Well, yes, obviously.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.740
But the point I'm trying to make here

19:29.740 --> 19:32.620
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

19:32.620 --> 19:35.660
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,

19:35.660 --> 19:38.780
and to twist them into fucked up apologia

19:38.780 --> 19:40.940
for horrible, oppressive behavior.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.620
If you play this game long enough,

19:42.620 --> 19:44.380
you can essentially explain away

19:44.380 --> 19:46.380
the entire concept of bigotry

19:46.380 --> 19:49.740
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

19:49.740 --> 19:52.220
There's only tragically misunderstood people

19:52.220 --> 19:55.420
with difficult childhoods and valid concerns

19:55.420 --> 19:58.780
cruelly demonized by militant activists

19:58.780 --> 20:00.880
defaming and silencing them

20:00.880 --> 20:04.940
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

20:04.940 --> 20:09.940
Now, because you, viewers, are smart, media-literate people,

20:10.260 --> 20:13.380
you understand framing, so you already know

20:13.380 --> 20:16.900
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.420
In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling...

20:19.420 --> 20:24.220
Oh, J.K. Rowling is a popular author

20:24.220 --> 20:27.740
who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

20:27.740 --> 20:30.860
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers

20:30.860 --> 20:32.740
masturbating into stolen panties

20:32.740 --> 20:35.060
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.060
Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.220
Christ, what a nightmare.

20:40.060 --> 20:44.360
Chapter three, The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.600
All right, kids, it's trans in time.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.580
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast

20:50.580 --> 20:54.300
about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,

20:54.300 --> 20:57.420
an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.340
The notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,

21:00.340 --> 21:03.660
most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers

21:03.660 --> 21:06.940
with signs that say God hates f***s.

21:06.940 --> 21:09.900
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.780
J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church

21:12.780 --> 21:16.080
is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups

21:16.080 --> 21:17.000
in the world.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.980
In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.740
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.500
I went to a counter-protest in 2010.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.420
I remember how when I was in high school,

21:28.420 --> 21:31.260
the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing

21:31.260 --> 21:33.900
that conservatives and liberals could agree on

21:33.900 --> 21:37.260
because they hated the troops and the gays,

21:37.260 --> 21:40.580
essentially the two genders of 2006.

21:40.580 --> 21:41.420
But let's not pretend

21:41.420 --> 21:43.820
that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.740
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,

21:45.740 --> 21:49.060
she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies

21:49.060 --> 21:51.020
about how the gays are going to hell,

21:51.020 --> 21:54.380
which to this day, I am a big fan of.

21:54.380 --> 21:58.060
But what did you say you think I loved your praying?

21:58.060 --> 22:01.380
He hates all you do, cause you love fornicating.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.500
It's perfect.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.340
I love it.

22:05.340 --> 22:06.660
Play it at my funeral.

22:06.660 --> 22:10.820
Stop praying, stop praying, God will not hear you anymore.

22:10.820 --> 22:14.540
You've got the boys and the girls to be proud of.

22:14.540 --> 22:16.220
For, forever burned.

22:16.220 --> 22:17.940
Go to the spot and you just keep pushing on

22:17.940 --> 22:20.140
to the hell where you were forever burned.

22:20.140 --> 22:23.620
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012

22:23.620 --> 22:27.660
after a crisis of faith precipitated by a power struggle

22:27.660 --> 22:29.060
within the church.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.940
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,

22:31.940 --> 22:34.380
which is honestly a pretty interesting account

22:34.380 --> 22:37.140
of deconversion and the circumstances

22:37.140 --> 22:39.620
that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.020
Megan contacted me for her podcast

22:42.020 --> 22:44.580
because I had criticized to take a ruling

22:44.580 --> 22:46.580
in a video a couple of years ago.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.820
Now you might be wondering, why would I think

22:48.820 --> 22:51.940
that a person who's been carrying a God hates sign

22:51.940 --> 22:54.340
most of her life would be the correct person

22:54.340 --> 22:56.420
to lead an international conversation

22:56.420 --> 22:59.380
about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

22:59.380 --> 23:01.780
Because I'm an idiot, happy.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.460
Basically, I agreed to the podcast

23:04.460 --> 23:06.860
because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.980
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church

23:09.980 --> 23:13.260
wants to mediate a conversation between me

23:13.260 --> 23:15.300
and the author of Harry Potter.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.100
Would you say no to that?

23:17.100 --> 23:20.260
Maybe, if you're smart.

23:20.260 --> 23:22.820
Last month, the podcast was announced

23:22.820 --> 23:24.980
in an essay by Megan titled,

23:24.980 --> 23:27.540
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.220
Obviously, a tendentious framing that posits Jo-ro

23:31.220 --> 23:34.460
as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.

23:34.460 --> 23:37.380
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling

23:37.380 --> 23:40.940
complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

23:40.940 --> 23:43.620
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob

23:43.620 --> 23:46.260
holding a rotten hell rolling sign

23:46.260 --> 23:49.140
juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

23:49.140 --> 23:52.420
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.780
This did not bode well.

23:54.860 --> 23:57.460
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter

23:57.460 --> 24:00.300
because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy

24:00.300 --> 24:04.380
to some kind of unearned J.K. Rowling redemption tour.

24:04.380 --> 24:08.020
This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me,

24:08.020 --> 24:10.620
calling me a bigot against God.

24:10.620 --> 24:14.540
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.980
There's only one of him.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.260
And he could really use your help, Shirley.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.700
I said in these tweets that I felt used,

24:20.700 --> 24:22.980
which that is how I felt,

24:22.980 --> 24:26.500
but ultimately I need to take full responsibility

24:26.500 --> 24:28.020
for my involvement in this.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.660
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this

24:30.660 --> 24:32.620
is you honestly have no idea

24:32.620 --> 24:34.860
what the final product is gonna be like.

24:34.860 --> 24:38.780
So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.

24:38.780 --> 24:42.220
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

24:42.220 --> 24:44.500
There are red flags from the beginning

24:44.500 --> 24:47.140
and I ignored them because I was projecting

24:47.140 --> 24:49.500
my own hopes onto the situation.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.780
You know, it's a compelling story.

24:51.780 --> 24:55.620
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot

24:55.620 --> 24:59.220
could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.

24:59.220 --> 25:01.660
We all love a good redemption arc.

25:01.660 --> 25:05.620
And I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.620
That's something I've moved away from,

25:07.620 --> 25:08.940
but there's still part of me

25:08.940 --> 25:11.100
that wants to see the best in people

25:11.100 --> 25:13.820
and to believe that people can change

25:13.820 --> 25:17.980
if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.940
Maybe my wishful thinking was that

25:21.940 --> 25:24.700
because Megan left Westboro,

25:24.700 --> 25:27.100
that must mean that she must understand

25:27.100 --> 25:31.620
the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

25:31.620 --> 25:34.580
And despite no evidence for this,

25:34.580 --> 25:38.460
my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally

25:38.460 --> 25:42.300
and could be really effective at confronting Jo-Roe

25:42.300 --> 25:46.060
about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?

25:46.940 --> 25:47.860
Wrong.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.700
I'm Megan Phelps-Roper,

25:49.700 --> 25:53.020
and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.500
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling

25:59.500 --> 26:03.620
is more than seven hours of apologetics for J.K.R.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.860
The podcast presents Rowling as a complex,

26:06.860 --> 26:11.860
humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist backstory.

26:12.140 --> 26:14.060
Jo Rowling's rise to success

26:14.060 --> 26:16.460
is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.

26:16.460 --> 26:19.700
Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob

26:19.700 --> 26:21.580
of transgender activists.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.380
First no vote, first no vote!

26:24.380 --> 26:27.380
All because she, as a woman,

26:27.380 --> 26:32.380
had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

26:33.020 --> 26:37.620
I had been becoming increasingly concerned

26:37.620 --> 26:40.460
about the way in which women were being shut down.

26:40.460 --> 26:44.180
Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.

26:44.180 --> 26:46.980
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing

26:46.980 --> 26:51.980
of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists

26:52.660 --> 26:54.540
whom Rowling describes as

26:54.540 --> 26:58.460
a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

26:58.460 --> 27:02.220
For the first five hours of this podcast,

27:02.220 --> 27:06.420
Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob

27:06.420 --> 27:11.420
of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.140
You are murdering trans children!

27:15.140 --> 27:16.620
Let's get out by the time!

27:16.620 --> 27:19.940
A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

27:19.940 --> 27:22.100
And you did it at my birthday dinner!

27:22.100 --> 27:26.260
There's this one clip of some kind of Antifa super soldier's

27:26.260 --> 27:30.700
abrasive screaming that they play like once per episode.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.180
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

27:33.180 --> 27:35.020
You look like you got your teeth knocked out

27:35.020 --> 27:36.580
you fucking fascist!

27:36.580 --> 27:38.860
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares

27:38.860 --> 27:40.580
and you will die alone!

27:40.580 --> 27:44.340
And then it usually cuts to like somber monks

27:44.340 --> 27:47.260
chanting some kind of medieval lament.

27:47.260 --> 27:50.180
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

27:50.180 --> 27:55.180
Ooh, species.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.460
Just in case you didn't get from the title

27:58.460 --> 28:00.420
that this is a witch hunt.

28:00.420 --> 28:05.420
Ooh, species.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.180
Do you guys get it?

28:08.180 --> 28:09.420
Do you get it yet?

28:09.420 --> 28:12.540
You got your teeth knocked out you fucking fascist!

28:12.540 --> 28:14.300
Let's get out by the time!

28:14.300 --> 28:16.740
And then these mobs of irrational,

28:16.740 --> 28:19.740
misogynistic, trans rights fanatics

28:19.740 --> 28:23.420
are contrasted with this poignant story

28:23.420 --> 28:26.980
of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband

28:26.980 --> 28:30.740
to publish our generation's most beloved novels.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.580
I was still very committed to those parts

28:33.580 --> 28:35.820
that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

28:35.820 --> 28:38.340
because there was a truth to them

28:38.340 --> 28:39.820
and there was a power to them.

28:39.820 --> 28:43.300
The only voices of genuine trans descent

28:43.300 --> 28:46.500
appear in episode six out of seven,

28:46.500 --> 28:48.540
more than five hours in.

28:48.540 --> 28:50.220
And there's only two of us.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.660
One is me.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.500
Shame.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.740
And the other is a teenager named Noah

28:55.740 --> 28:59.020
who kind of just seems like he wants to be liked

28:59.020 --> 29:02.740
and understood and wishes that his favorite author

29:02.740 --> 29:06.700
would please stop saying bigoted things about him.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.100
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,

29:08.100 --> 29:10.140
or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,

29:10.140 --> 29:14.340
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.860
I can't even state how important it was to me.

29:16.860 --> 29:19.660
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography

29:19.660 --> 29:21.780
from my third grade classroom

29:21.780 --> 29:23.620
and I kept it for a long time

29:23.620 --> 29:24.780
because I just loved reading it

29:24.780 --> 29:26.260
because I just admired her so much.

29:26.260 --> 29:29.380
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.100
On my last day editing this video,

29:31.100 --> 29:32.660
I got in touch with Noah.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.980
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast

29:34.980 --> 29:37.900
he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.140
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue

29:40.140 --> 29:42.740
are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.220
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

29:45.220 --> 29:47.980
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

29:47.980 --> 29:50.340
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,

29:50.340 --> 29:52.340
wellbeing, and ability to survive.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.660
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling

29:54.660 --> 29:57.060
should come second to fighting for maintained access

29:57.060 --> 29:59.620
to healthcare, support, and general resources

29:59.620 --> 30:02.260
for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.180
I agree.

30:03.180 --> 30:05.180
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

30:05.180 --> 30:08.020
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

30:08.020 --> 30:11.340
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling

30:11.340 --> 30:13.020
is the victim of a witch hunt

30:13.020 --> 30:15.780
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.980
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:20.700 --> 30:23.260
I mean, turf is basically witch.

30:23.260 --> 30:26.260
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.460
Show me the actual words, Jack.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.260
Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt

30:31.260 --> 30:32.660
by trans people.

30:32.660 --> 30:36.020
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:36.020 --> 30:39.020
Yes, a podcast on which I never once say

30:39.020 --> 30:41.940
I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.780
What are you talking about?

30:42.780 --> 30:44.500
I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.580
Your license plate says scammin'.

30:46.580 --> 30:49.300
Uh, no.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.340
What do you mean, no?

30:51.180 --> 30:52.500
Yes.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.340
Joanne, show me where I ever said

30:55.340 --> 30:58.460
that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.780
Why would you even think that?

31:00.780 --> 31:03.220
You're crazy.

31:03.220 --> 31:06.900
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.980
For sale now at Wild Woman Workshop.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.940
And Meghan is not much better.

31:11.940 --> 31:14.620
Like, there's this whole section in episode two

31:14.620 --> 31:16.540
where Meghan interviews Christians

31:16.540 --> 31:19.540
who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,

31:19.540 --> 31:22.660
and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

31:22.660 --> 31:25.940
So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents

31:25.940 --> 31:28.260
were maybe part of a moral panic?

31:28.260 --> 31:29.220
Yeah, absolutely.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.100
It's a scary world out there.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.500
Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
trans protests against Joe Roe

31:35.500 --> 31:38.620
are equivalent to the Christian ones in the 90s,

31:38.620 --> 31:40.980
but she does heavily imply it.

31:40.980 --> 31:44.220
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,

31:44.220 --> 31:48.340
which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,

31:48.340 --> 31:52.300
to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,

31:52.300 --> 31:56.260
boycotted, and in some cases, burned.

31:56.260 --> 31:58.820
When confronted about the obvious implications

31:58.820 --> 32:00.740
of the podcast's title,

32:00.740 --> 32:03.540
Meghan said, the title is ambiguous.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.380
Toward the end of her conversations,

32:05.380 --> 32:07.940
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling

32:07.940 --> 32:09.140
about discernment,

32:09.140 --> 32:11.180
about how a person can ever know

32:11.180 --> 32:13.260
if they're standing up for what's right

32:13.260 --> 32:14.940
or joining a moral panic.

32:14.940 --> 32:18.700
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.920
Meghan, I was not surprised.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.820
I know I won't ever regret having stood up

32:23.820 --> 32:25.260
on this issue, ever.

32:25.260 --> 32:28.060
The podcast released new episodes weekly,

32:28.060 --> 32:29.940
and whenever Meghan was challenged

32:29.940 --> 32:32.180
about the blatant one-sidedness,

32:32.180 --> 32:34.660
Meghan would respond, oh, you just think that

32:34.660 --> 32:37.780
because you haven't listened to the whole podcast yet.

32:37.780 --> 32:40.220
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.100
Much more of other perspectives is coming.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.580
Make sure to tune in next week.

32:45.580 --> 32:49.180
More bombshell revelations to come.

32:49.180 --> 32:52.900
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,

32:52.900 --> 32:55.780
and I truly do not think that anyone

32:55.780 --> 32:58.600
with basic media comprehension skills

32:58.600 --> 33:00.380
could come away from this thinking

33:00.380 --> 33:03.140
that the main intent was anything other

33:03.140 --> 33:06.500
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr

33:06.500 --> 33:11.500
of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.

33:13.180 --> 33:15.920
This is the obvious implication of the podcast

33:15.920 --> 33:18.720
from the first words to the very last.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.420
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.340
The final episode concludes with this.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.540
There are more important things in this world

33:27.540 --> 33:30.260
than being popular, and that doesn't mean

33:30.260 --> 33:32.180
it's more important to me to be right.

33:33.100 --> 33:36.020
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.460
Why would you end on that note?

33:38.460 --> 33:42.140
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

33:42.140 --> 33:45.180
if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe

33:45.180 --> 33:47.740
that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

33:47.740 --> 33:50.060
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.100
Like, there really is no other reasonable way

33:52.100 --> 33:56.100
to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.700
If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim

33:59.700 --> 34:02.820
of a witch hunt, then just say that.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.240
Make the argument you want to make.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.900
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

34:08.900 --> 34:13.100
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

34:13.100 --> 34:16.260
Don't rely on innuendo and framing

34:16.260 --> 34:21.260
and lack-for-most Gregorian chanting to make your point,

34:21.580 --> 34:26.140
while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond,

34:26.140 --> 34:28.660
I just believe in conversation.

34:28.660 --> 34:31.220
I don't know, I just find this a slippery

34:31.220 --> 34:33.160
and dishonest way to argue.

34:33.160 --> 34:36.180
But if you happen to be a fan of slippery

34:36.180 --> 34:39.060
and dishonest arguments, you're in luck,

34:39.060 --> 34:42.900
because there is more where that came from.

34:44.740 --> 34:47.380
This video is sponsored by Canabox.

34:47.380 --> 34:49.580
Canabox offers fresh human meat

34:49.580 --> 34:51.820
delivered directly to your doorstep.

34:51.820 --> 34:55.100
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit

34:55.100 --> 34:57.560
the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

34:57.560 --> 35:00.380
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

35:00.380 --> 35:03.120
Whenever a new box arrives, I get out my copy

35:03.120 --> 35:06.860
of Bless This Food, the Anita Bryant family cookbook.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.860
The best thing about human meat delivered

35:08.860 --> 35:11.120
to your home by mail in the dead of night?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.660
You don't know who you're eating,

35:13.660 --> 35:16.680
so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.580
Maybe.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.380
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.340
That means you're not allowed to cancel me.

35:22.340 --> 35:26.660
Chapter four, Joe Roe's Transphobia.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.500
That's it.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.780
I'm going full Slytherin.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.920
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

35:34.920 --> 35:38.580
Joe Roe compares trans activists to death eaters,

35:38.580 --> 35:41.420
the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

35:41.420 --> 35:45.700
My position is that this activist's movement,

35:45.700 --> 35:48.340
in the form that it's currently taking,

35:48.340 --> 35:49.860
echoes the very thing that I was

35:49.860 --> 35:51.660
warning against in Harry Potter.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.140
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made

35:54.140 --> 35:56.780
to live in secret, and now is our time.

35:56.780 --> 36:01.340
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

36:01.340 --> 36:03.020
misogynistic movement.

36:03.020 --> 36:04.780
When an article then claimed she had

36:04.780 --> 36:07.020
equated trans people to death eaters,

36:07.020 --> 36:11.060
the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,

36:11.060 --> 36:14.400
because she only equated the movement to death eaters,

36:14.400 --> 36:17.080
not trans people in general.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.000
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.320
I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.840
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,

36:23.840 --> 36:26.320
lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.200
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,

36:29.200 --> 36:31.800
because she expresses it as an endless series

36:31.800 --> 36:34.820
of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.960
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle

36:37.960 --> 36:42.320
consisting of a mott, that is a tower atop a mound or hill,

36:42.320 --> 36:45.760
easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard

36:45.760 --> 36:49.320
that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.800
So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes

36:51.800 --> 36:55.760
a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.540
And then, when confronted with counter arguments,

36:58.540 --> 37:01.120
they walk it back to a much less controversial

37:01.120 --> 37:04.640
and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.

37:04.640 --> 37:08.540
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim

37:08.540 --> 37:12.240
like sex is real, what does she mean by that?

37:12.240 --> 37:13.880
What are the implications?

37:13.880 --> 37:16.480
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks

37:16.480 --> 37:20.680
it's very sinister that in the Associated Press style guide,

37:20.680 --> 37:23.760
it says that instead of referring to a trans woman

37:23.760 --> 37:26.400
as a man who identifies as a woman,

37:26.400 --> 37:29.720
journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.480
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

37:33.480 --> 37:36.800
They've edged from identifies as a woman,

37:36.800 --> 37:38.880
so a man identifies as a woman,

37:38.880 --> 37:40.720
and I think we all understand what that means,

37:40.720 --> 37:44.480
into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep

37:44.480 --> 37:46.560
that I'm talking about.

37:46.560 --> 37:51.360
We are using language to make accurate definition

37:51.360 --> 37:54.400
of sex difference unspeakable.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.360
Which is, of course, false, because the words trans

37:57.360 --> 38:00.640
and cis exist precisely to make it easy

38:00.640 --> 38:02.240
to talk about sex difference.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.960
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.860
God, there's this whole section of the podcast

38:05.860 --> 38:08.340
that sort of implies that transgender people

38:08.340 --> 38:11.060
are invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even

38:11.060 --> 38:13.340
gonna get into because we don't have time.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.940
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks

38:14.940 --> 38:16.380
that all people who menstruate

38:16.380 --> 38:18.700
must be referred to as women.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.860
Or was it wombin'?

38:19.860 --> 38:21.380
I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.860
So trans men and transmasculine people,

38:23.860 --> 38:27.500
they're all women, and it must be referred to as women,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.100
because J.K. Rowling demands it.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.660
This is controversial, right?

38:31.660 --> 38:34.740
Calling trans women men who identify as women,

38:34.740 --> 38:36.540
calling trans men women.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.660
This is the Bailey in her Ma and Bailey argument.

38:39.660 --> 38:42.180
Trans women are men, trans men are women.

38:42.180 --> 38:45.700
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

38:45.700 --> 38:49.060
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,

38:49.060 --> 38:51.660
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

38:51.660 --> 38:53.860
I'm being persecuted just for saying

38:53.860 --> 38:56.100
that women should be allowed to discuss

38:56.100 --> 38:58.820
how being female has shaped our lives.

38:58.820 --> 39:01.220
Women should be allowed to discuss

39:01.220 --> 39:03.540
how being female has shaped our lives.

39:03.540 --> 39:06.420
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial

39:06.420 --> 39:09.940
interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.

39:09.940 --> 39:13.500
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make

39:13.500 --> 39:15.980
about trans people follows this pattern.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.860
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstader,

39:18.860 --> 39:20.900
will tweet inflammatory things like,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.140
men cannot change into women.

39:23.140 --> 39:24.820
But then when she's criticized,

39:24.820 --> 39:26.700
she'll say that she's being attacked

39:26.700 --> 39:28.780
for gender critical belief.

39:28.780 --> 39:31.580
Gender critical belief, which is the absolutely

39:31.580 --> 39:34.020
ordinary belief about sex,

39:34.020 --> 39:37.020
that your mother and your grandmother are women,

39:37.020 --> 39:38.940
that being female is a thing.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.580
Your mother and grandmother are women.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
Being female is a thing.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.820
That's literally all I'm saying.

39:45.820 --> 39:48.060
But if that's literally all she was saying,

39:48.060 --> 39:50.820
then no one would be mad, would they?

39:50.820 --> 39:52.580
Nine, nah.

39:52.580 --> 39:55.860
Men cannot change into women is the Bailey.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.500
Your mom is a woman is the Mott.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.780
Your mom's a woman.

40:00.780 --> 40:03.860
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.740
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

40:06.740 --> 40:08.660
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.540
Then when trans people understandably get mad,

40:11.540 --> 40:14.420
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked just for saying

40:14.420 --> 40:17.100
that being female is part of my experience.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.140
It's dishonest.

40:18.140 --> 40:20.220
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people.

40:20.220 --> 40:22.260
And then when trans people talk trash back,

40:22.260 --> 40:23.900
they pretend that they're being victimized

40:23.900 --> 40:26.060
for making totally innocuous statements.

40:26.060 --> 40:29.700
We can name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

40:29.700 --> 40:33.820
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met

40:33.820 --> 40:36.380
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up

40:36.380 --> 40:39.580
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.

40:39.580 --> 40:42.980
I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.

40:42.980 --> 40:46.340
It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.900
And somehow it always worked.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.700
So a birthday boy argument is when you make aggressive

40:50.700 --> 40:54.660
inflammatory assertions followed by teacher, teacher,

40:54.660 --> 40:56.180
look what he's doing to me.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.920
When the target reacts with anything less

40:57.920 --> 40:59.420
than extreme politeness.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.380
Another common tactic you'll see anytime

41:01.380 --> 41:03.460
Rowling's transphobia is discussed

41:03.460 --> 41:05.260
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

41:05.260 --> 41:08.500
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.660
For example, here's someone on Twitter

41:10.660 --> 41:12.940
called large gamete producer.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.420
It's funny, isn't it?

41:14.420 --> 41:17.940
How these people will insist that awkward inclusive language

41:17.940 --> 41:21.160
like people who menstruate is horribly oppressive

41:21.160 --> 41:23.160
and degrading, but then they'll just straight up

41:23.160 --> 41:26.620
call themselves large gamete producer.

41:26.620 --> 41:29.540
Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

41:29.540 --> 41:33.540
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

41:33.540 --> 41:35.720
Oh, I like it, it's very brood mother.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.580
That Rowling's words regularly appear

41:37.580 --> 41:40.660
in gender critical arguments shows the massive influence

41:40.660 --> 41:42.900
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.220
She's like their queen, their leader,

41:45.220 --> 41:46.380
their headmistress.

41:46.380 --> 41:48.100
She's the best thing that ever happened to them

41:48.100 --> 41:50.340
because Sheila Jefferies certainly wasn't persuading

41:50.340 --> 41:51.180
a lot of people.

41:51.180 --> 41:52.240
If you know, you know.

41:52.240 --> 41:56.460
Large gamete producers says, JK isn't anti-trans,

41:56.460 --> 42:00.020
give me just one direct quote that she has said

42:00.020 --> 42:01.420
which is anti-trans.

42:01.420 --> 42:02.740
Oh, what's that?

42:02.740 --> 42:04.260
You can't find one?

42:04.260 --> 42:06.980
Well, color me shocked.

42:06.980 --> 42:09.680
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

42:09.680 --> 42:13.180
let's take a look at large gamete producers profile.

42:13.180 --> 42:15.740
Trans women are not women, they are men.

42:15.740 --> 42:18.520
Trans men are not men, they are women.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.900
Nothing can change that.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.300
Sex is binary.

42:22.300 --> 42:23.820
Like if this person doesn't think

42:23.820 --> 42:26.860
that trans women are men, trans men are women

42:26.860 --> 42:28.740
is a transphobic statement,

42:28.740 --> 42:31.420
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

42:31.420 --> 42:33.620
This is why the first question you should always ask

42:33.620 --> 42:35.780
such people is, do you believe

42:35.780 --> 42:38.460
that transphobia is a legitimate concept?

42:38.460 --> 42:40.140
What are some examples of statements

42:40.140 --> 42:42.200
that you would consider transphobic?

42:42.200 --> 42:43.820
Because many of them don't believe

42:43.820 --> 42:46.060
that transphobia is a valid concept

42:46.060 --> 42:47.760
because they don't think that trans people

42:47.760 --> 42:49.380
are a legitimate minority.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.860
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.000
There is no such thing.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.900
There are people that call themselves these things

42:56.900 --> 43:00.160
that may have other issues manifesting

43:00.160 --> 43:02.260
that then make them think they're this, but no.

43:02.260 --> 43:04.940
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.700
There may be more words that we have to say

43:06.700 --> 43:07.640
in order to say that.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.960
We may call it transgender ideology,

43:09.960 --> 43:11.500
but when it comes to a person,

43:11.500 --> 43:13.980
they may be following transgender ideology,

43:13.980 --> 43:15.520
but they are not transgender.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.060
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

43:18.060 --> 43:20.240
being anything other than a man or a woman.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.600
So when they say, show me an example

43:22.600 --> 43:25.300
of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.560
This is a trap.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.800
They're just messing with you.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.840
There's nothing that she could have said

43:29.840 --> 43:31.880
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.160
Now, if you're someone who believes

43:33.160 --> 43:35.240
that transphobia is a valid concept

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

43:38.240 --> 43:40.240
but you just genuinely are unaware

43:40.240 --> 43:42.540
of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,

43:42.540 --> 43:44.720
then I will refer you to my past video

43:44.720 --> 43:46.680
on J.K. Rowling's transphobia

43:46.680 --> 43:48.560
rather than recapping it all here.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

43:51.240 --> 43:52.560
since I made that video.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people

43:57.520 --> 43:59.340
because she's not a complete idiot,

43:59.340 --> 44:02.120
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.360
She said, save our children.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.840
I love women, actually.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.760
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

44:07.760 --> 44:10.020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

44:10.020 --> 44:12.240
but he will share a lot of statistics

44:12.240 --> 44:14.120
about anti-white crime.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.840
So this is not really a very good criterion

44:16.920 --> 44:19.640
for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

44:19.640 --> 44:22.520
What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again

44:22.520 --> 44:24.360
about transgender rapists,

44:24.360 --> 44:27.200
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.360
She implies that trans inclusive language

44:29.360 --> 44:32.680
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

44:32.680 --> 44:36.000
She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal

44:36.000 --> 44:38.140
of endocrinologists and ideolog

44:38.140 --> 44:42.400
that is supposedly persuading confused vulnerable girls

44:42.400 --> 44:43.520
to transition.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.560
To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,

44:46.560 --> 44:48.800
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

44:48.800 --> 44:52.200
but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.

44:52.200 --> 44:55.160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think,

44:55.160 --> 44:57.020
it asks them to fear.

44:57.020 --> 45:01.320
It creates phobias of trans people.

45:01.320 --> 45:06.320
It creates trans phobias, if you will.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.720
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician

45:08.720 --> 45:12.920
Nicholas Sturgeon, calling her destroyer of women's rights

45:12.920 --> 45:15.880
via a t-shirt she got from anti-trans heat monger

45:15.880 --> 45:17.120
Posey Parker.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.600
There's no such thing as a trans woman,

45:18.600 --> 45:20.760
there's no such thing as a trans person,

45:20.760 --> 45:21.720
there is no such thing.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

45:24.380 --> 45:26.080
about Rowling's transphobia,

45:26.080 --> 45:29.120
it's that this is not a case of someone posting

45:29.120 --> 45:30.720
a couple insensitive tweets

45:30.720 --> 45:32.380
that got blown out of proportion.

45:32.380 --> 45:36.320
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.560
And because she's so famous,

45:41.560 --> 45:44.420
she's become the de facto global champion

45:44.420 --> 45:46.340
of backlash to trans rights.

45:46.340 --> 45:48.980
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.780
Except worse, because she's way more famous

45:51.780 --> 45:54.960
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.180
Rowling has also praised self-described

45:57.180 --> 45:59.020
theocratic fascist Matt Walsh

45:59.020 --> 46:01.180
for his transphobic propaganda film.

46:01.180 --> 46:05.140
She refers to trans women as trans identified males,

46:05.140 --> 46:07.320
known as Tims among people for whom

46:07.320 --> 46:09.020
this has become an unhealthy obsession.

46:09.020 --> 46:11.260
She retweets images of the trans colors

46:11.260 --> 46:13.220
being erased from the progress flag.

46:13.260 --> 46:15.700
Also, the colors representing queer people of color.

46:15.700 --> 46:17.100
So, you know, great.

46:17.100 --> 46:17.940
Love that.

46:17.940 --> 46:20.620
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

46:20.620 --> 46:24.140
for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.

46:24.140 --> 46:26.400
It's something of a fixation for her.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.500
I find this particularly gross

46:28.500 --> 46:30.980
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

46:30.980 --> 46:33.660
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

46:33.660 --> 46:36.740
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

46:36.740 --> 46:37.740
of cis people.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.420
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

46:40.420 --> 46:43.260
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person

46:43.260 --> 46:48.060
and also most likely at 96% to say that they're supportive

46:48.060 --> 46:50.260
or very supportive of trans people.

46:50.260 --> 46:53.660
So, I think it's fair to say that most gay women

46:53.660 --> 46:55.980
are probably not super thrilled

46:55.980 --> 46:59.660
whenever Jo-ro the lesbian defender logs on.

46:59.660 --> 47:01.740
My own partner is a cis lesbian,

47:01.740 --> 47:04.180
and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling

47:04.180 --> 47:07.500
defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,

47:07.540 --> 47:10.300
it makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.

47:10.300 --> 47:13.900
By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit of banter

47:13.900 --> 47:16.700
with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

47:16.700 --> 47:19.340
the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.380
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

47:21.380 --> 47:22.660
of the House of Lords

47:22.660 --> 47:25.980
who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.

47:25.980 --> 47:28.860
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

47:28.860 --> 47:32.060
claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading

47:32.060 --> 47:34.180
the status of women and girls.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.220
Truly, one of the great lesbian allies.

47:37.260 --> 47:39.980
And in 2022, here is JK Rowling

47:39.980 --> 47:42.180
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

47:42.180 --> 47:43.900
Excellent question, Emma.

47:43.900 --> 47:47.300
Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

47:47.300 --> 47:51.180
excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,

47:51.180 --> 47:55.540
i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.780
And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

47:58.780 --> 48:01.860
They're wearing eyeliner pickets.

48:01.860 --> 48:04.580
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia

48:04.580 --> 48:07.140
you may have for the Gryffindor common room

48:07.140 --> 48:09.780
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.020
Two straight women,

48:11.020 --> 48:14.180
one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,

48:14.180 --> 48:16.180
having a nice little chuckle together

48:16.180 --> 48:19.260
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

48:19.260 --> 48:20.820
So that's it, right?

48:20.820 --> 48:21.740
It's over.

48:23.740 --> 48:24.900
Case closed.

48:27.260 --> 48:28.980
I still like hammering things.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.660
I'm not gonna argue anymore

48:31.660 --> 48:34.500
about whether JK Rowling is transphobic

48:34.500 --> 48:36.980
because anyone who believes in transphobia

48:37.700 --> 48:39.620
can see that obviously she is.

48:39.620 --> 48:42.100
The question now is whether transphobia

48:42.100 --> 48:45.380
is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,

48:45.380 --> 48:48.420
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

48:48.420 --> 48:50.340
misogyny, and homophobia.

48:50.340 --> 48:51.940
That's usually what we're talking about

48:51.940 --> 48:54.140
when we talk about JK Rowling, right?

48:54.140 --> 48:56.980
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

48:56.980 --> 49:00.500
That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.940
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.700
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

49:06.740 --> 49:09.660
worthy of polite consideration and respect

49:09.660 --> 49:11.820
in liberal humane society?

49:11.820 --> 49:13.980
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

49:13.980 --> 49:16.100
that we can justifiably react to

49:16.100 --> 49:18.060
with scorn and condemnation?

49:18.060 --> 49:20.140
And there's an even broader question here

49:20.140 --> 49:22.540
about whether we can justifiably react

49:22.540 --> 49:25.540
to anything with scorn and condemnation.

49:25.540 --> 49:27.960
Is canceling ever warranted?

49:27.960 --> 49:32.280
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

49:32.280 --> 49:35.880
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

49:35.880 --> 49:39.320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas?

49:39.320 --> 49:41.320
Where we can all sit around debating

49:41.320 --> 49:43.160
the legitimacy of gay marriage

49:43.160 --> 49:46.200
or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

49:46.200 --> 49:48.960
Is the final solution a myth promulgated

49:48.960 --> 49:50.840
by the international Jew?

49:50.840 --> 49:54.380
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

49:54.380 --> 49:57.240
Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money

49:57.240 --> 49:59.720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

49:59.720 --> 50:00.760
Who knows?

50:00.760 --> 50:02.320
These are open questions.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.080
Let's sit down with people on both sides.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.400
On many sides and have calm,

50:07.400 --> 50:09.160
civil conversations about it

50:09.160 --> 50:11.600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.240
Chapter five, debate.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
Sorry, I know I did this look before

50:18.160 --> 50:21.440
and it's like not related to the video topic at all,

50:21.440 --> 50:23.280
but it just makes me feel sliving.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.600
The boy who slived.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.280
So Megan Phelps's rober's viewpoint

50:27.280 --> 50:29.500
seems to be that scorn and condemnation

50:29.500 --> 50:31.080
are never appropriate.

50:31.080 --> 50:33.000
That we should approach every conflict

50:33.000 --> 50:34.600
with empathy and compassion

50:34.600 --> 50:36.480
even when dealing with the worst,

50:36.480 --> 50:39.480
most destructive people in the world.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.920
Hi, my name is Megan.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.200
And my heretical belief is that

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
even the people who seem to be

50:45.200 --> 50:48.080
the worst, most destructive people in the world

50:48.080 --> 50:51.640
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

50:51.640 --> 50:53.600
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

50:53.600 --> 50:57.640
In her book, in her TED Talk, in her public appearances,

50:57.640 --> 51:00.520
Megan expresses the idea that society

51:00.520 --> 51:05.040
has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way

51:05.040 --> 51:07.560
that we've all become extremists.

51:07.560 --> 51:08.860
That in some sense,

51:08.860 --> 51:12.600
we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.840
I can't help but see in our public discourse

51:14.840 --> 51:17.300
so many of the same destructive impulses

51:17.300 --> 51:18.880
that ruled my former church.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.320
She identifies things like certainty,

51:21.320 --> 51:23.360
vilification of compromise,

51:23.360 --> 51:25.120
us versus them thinking,

51:25.120 --> 51:26.720
suppression of empathy,

51:26.720 --> 51:29.480
and celebration of death and misfortune

51:29.480 --> 51:32.920
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.800
And this really bothers Megan

51:34.800 --> 51:37.540
because she claims that a decade ago,

51:37.540 --> 51:39.280
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

51:39.280 --> 51:42.160
how f***ing marriage is abominable to God,

51:42.160 --> 51:46.440
it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way

51:46.440 --> 51:50.240
that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.160
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

51:54.160 --> 51:57.480
She's totally right that if you want to change people's minds,

51:57.480 --> 52:00.280
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

52:00.280 --> 52:02.920
is usually the best way to do that.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.840
But Megan reaches another conclusion

52:04.840 --> 52:06.280
that I don't agree with,

52:06.280 --> 52:09.700
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

52:09.700 --> 52:12.000
are most likely to persuade people,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.720
we should never cancel anyone,

52:14.720 --> 52:16.760
even the most horrible bigots.

52:16.760 --> 52:20.440
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.

52:20.440 --> 52:21.520
But what Megan means is

52:21.520 --> 52:23.840
we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.520
We shouldn't boycott or counter protest

52:26.520 --> 52:28.180
or raise our voices.

52:28.180 --> 52:31.000
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone

52:31.000 --> 52:34.120
because that's just not how you change minds.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.080
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

52:36.080 --> 52:38.920
De-radicalization was a really important part

52:38.920 --> 52:40.560
of her life experience.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.240
She's also clearly holding out hope

52:42.240 --> 52:44.560
that other members of her family will leave Westboro

52:44.560 --> 52:46.300
and have a life on the outside.

52:46.300 --> 52:48.480
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.840
"'The last lines of her book address her family.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.700
"'I want to tell them that I love them.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.700
"'I'll just have to find another way.'

52:54.700 --> 52:56.620
"'This is touching and human

52:56.620 --> 52:59.740
"'and also kind of a conflict of interest.'"

52:59.740 --> 53:03.500
The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense

53:03.500 --> 53:07.340
if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.

53:07.340 --> 53:10.580
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

53:10.580 --> 53:13.860
is more important than protecting the people they target.

53:13.860 --> 53:16.420
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

53:16.420 --> 53:19.900
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

53:19.900 --> 53:23.320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

53:23.360 --> 53:25.640
and she's still homophobic.

53:25.640 --> 53:27.760
But even without Anita's blessing,

53:27.760 --> 53:31.160
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

53:31.160 --> 53:34.120
since the 1970s because gay activists

53:34.120 --> 53:36.760
didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

53:36.760 --> 53:40.360
They needed to defeat her and that's what they did.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.720
We have to accept that realistically,

53:42.720 --> 53:46.280
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.600
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

53:49.600 --> 53:51.680
but there will always be bigots

53:51.680 --> 53:55.160
and mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

53:55.160 --> 53:57.960
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

53:57.960 --> 54:00.800
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

54:00.800 --> 54:05.040
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

54:05.040 --> 54:05.880
Nah.

54:05.880 --> 54:06.840
You would only think that

54:06.840 --> 54:09.160
if you're a total moral relativist.

54:09.160 --> 54:13.240
I guess controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful

54:13.240 --> 54:14.920
and it should be shamed.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.880
I'll say it.

54:15.880 --> 54:18.220
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas

54:18.220 --> 54:20.600
in your head, you might feel afraid

54:20.640 --> 54:25.160
to express them publicly for fear of being shamed or judged.

54:25.160 --> 54:28.400
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

54:28.400 --> 54:31.000
that punishes people for wrong think?

54:31.000 --> 54:34.480
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful

54:34.480 --> 54:36.240
and you should be ashamed of it

54:36.240 --> 54:38.640
and the people judging you are right to do so.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.400
And sure, there are some very patient people

54:41.400 --> 54:44.400
who devote their lives to de-radicalizing bigots,

54:44.400 --> 54:47.720
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

54:47.720 --> 54:49.400
There's a guy named Daryl Davis

54:49.400 --> 54:51.840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

54:51.840 --> 54:54.800
for over 30 years and he claims he's convinced

54:54.800 --> 54:57.200
more than 200 of them to leave.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.540
And good for him.

54:58.540 --> 55:01.320
De-radicalization is a valid strategy,

55:01.320 --> 55:03.800
but it cannot be the only strategy

55:03.800 --> 55:06.960
and it must not be the primary strategy

55:06.960 --> 55:09.120
because we're not going to defeat racism

55:09.120 --> 55:12.840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.100
Feminists would be wasting their time

55:15.100 --> 55:18.160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.560
In general, I think that the massive effort

55:20.560 --> 55:23.360
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

55:23.360 --> 55:26.100
is better spent persuading other people

55:26.100 --> 55:27.540
not to listen to them.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.520
And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization

55:30.520 --> 55:33.760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Cytanovic

55:36.860 --> 55:41.440
became the face of the fascist unite the right rally in 2017

55:41.440 --> 55:45.920
when a photo of him mid-scream Tiki Torch in Hand

55:45.920 --> 55:48.980
was published in news outlets all over the country.

55:48.980 --> 55:51.300
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

55:51.300 --> 55:53.600
he gave immediately after the rally,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.960
but he began to question his beliefs

55:55.960 --> 55:58.600
after befriending a muscling woman who,

55:58.600 --> 56:00.940
according to Charlotte McDonald Gibson,

56:00.940 --> 56:03.720
challenged his views without insulting him,

56:03.720 --> 56:07.100
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

56:07.100 --> 56:09.380
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

56:09.380 --> 56:11.380
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

56:11.380 --> 56:13.100
every trace of bigotry.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.420
In a 2019 interview with the London School

56:15.420 --> 56:18.340
of Economics student paper, Peter said,

56:18.340 --> 56:20.380
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

56:20.380 --> 56:22.580
You're born either a man or a woman.

56:22.580 --> 56:26.460
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

56:26.460 --> 56:29.260
When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,

56:29.260 --> 56:32.180
I used to get some criticism from people of color

56:32.180 --> 56:34.340
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

56:34.340 --> 56:37.820
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

56:37.820 --> 56:40.300
a frustration that I totally understand.

56:40.300 --> 56:43.140
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

56:43.140 --> 56:45.900
diverse leftist communities are maybe not

56:45.900 --> 56:48.460
the best holding space for someone who's

56:48.460 --> 56:50.600
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.780
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

56:52.780 --> 56:55.840
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

56:55.840 --> 56:58.620
but what she does have is a kind of hyper-vigilant

56:58.620 --> 57:03.220
skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.

57:03.220 --> 57:04.740
This is pretty common with people

57:04.740 --> 57:07.200
who used to be religious fundamentalists.

57:07.200 --> 57:09.280
They were so certain they were right,

57:09.280 --> 57:11.800
only to realize that everything they believed

57:11.800 --> 57:13.440
about the world is wrong.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.400
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

57:17.400 --> 57:20.520
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

57:20.520 --> 57:23.720
Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly

57:23.720 --> 57:25.640
that I was doing the right thing,

57:25.640 --> 57:27.440
and then to leave and come to believe

57:27.440 --> 57:29.620
that it was so destructive and harmful,

57:30.800 --> 57:35.800
I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months

57:36.260 --> 57:39.700
where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?

57:39.740 --> 57:43.100
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

57:43.100 --> 57:47.260
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

57:47.260 --> 57:50.260
can cause problems, especially where topics

57:50.260 --> 57:52.260
of social justice are concerned.

57:52.260 --> 57:55.600
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

57:55.600 --> 58:00.020
that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling

58:00.020 --> 58:02.820
to have calm, philosophical debates

58:02.820 --> 58:04.740
about whether they should have rights?

58:04.740 --> 58:07.980
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

58:07.980 --> 58:10.140
Atheist philosopher, Sam Harris,

58:10.140 --> 58:12.740
in his podcast about Meghan's podcast,

58:12.740 --> 58:15.100
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

58:15.100 --> 58:18.620
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

58:18.620 --> 58:20.800
until we can figure out what's going on.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.460
Sam Harris and his podcast about Meghan's podcast

58:24.460 --> 58:28.580
complained that trans activism and activism in general

58:28.580 --> 58:32.860
is plagued by a mental illness and hysteria.

58:32.860 --> 58:35.740
I frankly think there's a fair degree

58:36.380 --> 58:40.280
of mental instability and even frank mental illness

58:40.280 --> 58:42.660
in the activist community.

58:42.660 --> 58:45.900
I mean, in really in all activist communities,

58:45.900 --> 58:50.540
the level of viciousness and hysteria is,

58:51.420 --> 58:53.300
it's hard to know what to compare it to.

58:53.300 --> 58:58.180
Diversity when man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

58:58.180 --> 59:02.080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

59:02.080 --> 59:05.840
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.420
Aren't there certain situations

59:07.420 --> 59:09.600
where strong emotions are warranted?

59:09.600 --> 59:11.440
It reminds me of this awful episode

59:11.440 --> 59:13.940
of Joe Rogan feet Ben Shapiro,

59:13.940 --> 59:16.880
where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

59:16.880 --> 59:19.320
with his usual whining sophistry.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.580
And Joe gently raises objections

59:21.580 --> 59:23.680
for Ben to talk circles around.

59:23.680 --> 59:27.120
The human sex drive was made to procreate

59:27.120 --> 59:30.420
within a stable relationship in order to progenerate

59:30.420 --> 59:32.200
and have future generations of people.

59:32.200 --> 59:34.140
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

59:34.140 --> 59:36.640
whether you're talking about from masturbation

59:36.640 --> 59:38.420
to homosexual activity,

59:38.420 --> 59:40.920
is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.

59:40.920 --> 59:44.060
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

59:44.060 --> 59:47.580
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

59:47.580 --> 59:49.300
Imagine talking about different beliefs

59:49.300 --> 59:51.340
while still having a productive conversation.

59:51.340 --> 59:53.500
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.020
The discussion here was excellent.

59:55.020 --> 59:56.740
Two guys with opposing opinions,

59:56.740 --> 59:59.380
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.660
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.260
This is how it should be done.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.420
Kudos to both of them.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.660
Joe is a great interviewer.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.120
He can totally disagree with someone

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.500
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.740
This is how it should be.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.220
Just two people sharing ideas,

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.140
learning different point of views from each other.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.220
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.580
Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.580
and Ben answers honestly, he is strong in his faith.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.420
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.220
and they have a civil conversation.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.060
Great learning.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.820
Yeah, it's easy for two straight men

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.100
to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.580
about the ethics of homosexuality

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.420
because it's not their lives

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.460
and their relationships that are up for debate.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.260
These people don't understand the emotional burden

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.060
placed on marginalized people

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.580
who are asked to defend their rights.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.780
Like if you're straight,

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.380
do you want to publicly debate whether your marriage is valid?

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.860
Andrew Dworkin claimed

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.140
that penetrative heterosexual intercourse

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.460
is inherently an act of violence.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.700
I've noticed that most straight men

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.380
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.980
So imagine how they'd react

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.460
if there was a powerful political movement

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.380
to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.060
Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.100
bullying and discrimination,

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.020
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.820
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.820
It is my right to raise my child

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.060
with the moral precepts

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.740
that I find to be beneficial for my child.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.940
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.020
And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.940
That is insane.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.860
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.300
because he can't handle the debate.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.380
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.620
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.340
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.180
I now have two choices.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.300
One is to leave the country utterly.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.260
Two is to pick up a gun.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.940
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.940
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.340
whose career requires that he convince his right-wing audience

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.940
that he's one of the good ones.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.060
This means that he's willing to sit across

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.900
from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.700
and listen to Ben say he would never attend

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.220
his anniversary party

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.380
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.100
There's a difference between me

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.460
just being friends with Dave

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:26.260
and me actively participating in an event

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.180
that I feel is religiously sinful.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.780
The two of them then congratulate themselves

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.660
about how they can still be great friends.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.180
Why is it that we're able to do this

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.620
and most people can't do this?

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.460
That's what I'm curious about.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.740
We go home at night and we can have our own lives.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.220
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.020
with conservative Glenn Beck

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.900
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.780
and then congratulates himself

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.900
on having the conversation.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.740
I'm a deeply religious man

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:58.140
and my religion says man and a woman,

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.540
that is the basic building block of family.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.020
And that's what I believe,

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:09.020
but I also know God created you

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.380
just like he created me, flaws and all.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.820
I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.380
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.660
because it runs in my family.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.820
So does craziness, but it runs in my family.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.940
Well, Dave smiles and nods

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.700
probably because he's thinking about

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:34.180
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.940
Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.260
and then we're good because they get it, they get it.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.020
That's my governor, yeah.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.900
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.260
and they see finally a reasonable gay person

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.180
who doesn't scream, beg it, at everyone who disagrees

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.100
and can actually have a civil conversation.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.620
But that's not what I see.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.020
I look at Dave Rubin

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:04.180
and I see a spineless boot-looking doormat

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.900
who won't even defend his own family

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.740
from the most fundamental disrespect.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.560
I also can't help but notice

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.340
that none of these civil conversations

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.700
seem to change anyone's mind.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.060
Persuasion is more complicated

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.580
and less rational than people think.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.300
Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.420
but if you read her book carefully,

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.220
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.940
The major precipitating event for Megan's crisis of faith

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.900
was her mother's mistreatment

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.500
at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.060
church leadership that made Megan feel

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.860
like she was the victim of the church for once.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.020
She says of the church discipline,

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.020
for the first time in my life,

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.860
the accused were people I lived with

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.460
and knew most intimately.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.180
And I knew that the judgments leveled

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.780
by the elders were wrong.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.380
I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.060
So she finally experienced firsthand

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.660
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.620
She stopped voting for the leopards eating people's faces

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.700
party only when the leopards ate her face.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.960
It also seems relevant to notice

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.880
that the people who had calm civil conversations

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.480
with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.680
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.600
They were mostly straight men,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.880
like director Kevin Smith,

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.280
who started hashtag saveMegan

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.720
because, quote, she's hot.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.160
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.200
and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan,

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.000
because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.760
is now her husband.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.960
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.240
if we're trying to understand the role of reason

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.700
and emotion in de-radicalization experiences.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.620
I think this experience is usually more akin

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:58.600
to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.120
There's also a world of difference

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.760
between the mostly private conversations

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.720
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.680
and the spectacle of public debate.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.100
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.760
because he live streamed a civil conversation

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.040
with Dave Rubin.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.640
So who is this conversation even for?

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.280
Well, obviously it's for the audience.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.520
I think these civil conversations basically function

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.380
to reassure a homophobic audience

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.480
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.040
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.480
Look at Ben Shapiro.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.240
He is friends with a gay.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.260
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.840
of the Overton window,

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.480
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.860
So often people who want to promote bigotry

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.120
will use debate as a foot in the door.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.920
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.900
are within the realm of reasonable

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.000
and socially accepted opinion.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.760
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot, Graham Linnehan,

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.480
in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.040
without the British public having a proper debate

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.440
about these issues.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.720
Now, why do we need to have a proper debate

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.560
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.920
when drag performance has been a staple

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.460
of British entertainment

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.960
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.040
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.600
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, my, my, three little mates from school.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.240
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.240
As I am man, my state is desperate for my master's love.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.960
As I am woman, now I last the day.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.160
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.680
on their own terms

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.880
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.920
It's how they convince the public

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.420
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.820
is actually a valid concern

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.940
rather than the tedious, small-minded whiny about nothing

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.180
that it really is.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.980
Having the debate on a biggest terms

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.580
is not a good way to win people over

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.320
unless you're really skilled

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.500
in the art of humiliating people,

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.180
which most of the time is what public debate

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.720
is actually about.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.380
This is something that J.K. Rowling

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.260
doesn't seem to understand.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.420
In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.580
Jorro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:34.620
She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos,

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.220
saying that activists are making a strategic error

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:42.100
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.100
making him look dangerous and sexy.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.020
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.980
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.460
So is deplatforming a strategic error

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.700
that gives power to your opponent?

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.300
Or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.740
I find Rowling's conviction

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.020
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.260
really out of touch.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.180
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons for the things he does.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.540
He has strategies for humiliating people.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.480
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.540
being fabulous and doing my hair,

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.900
to prepare a speech for you.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.340
Well, a few remarks, really.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.580
Feminism is cancer, thank you very much.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.580
To again quote Ian Danskin,

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.740
you can't really reason with someone

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.140
who thinks that feminism is cancer.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.860
Because you don't reason with cancer, you eradicate it.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.780
Rowling objects to the slogan,

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:37.700
no debate in the strongest possible terms.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.820
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.820
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.580
We hear it all the time.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.380
That alarms me, really alarms me.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.740
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.620
than no debate.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.860
It's kind of amazing to me that someone could think

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.800
angry trans people on Twitter

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.940
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.120
I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.460
to be capable of such a perspective.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.860
Before I move on, I do wanna clarify

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.740
that I do think there are trans issues

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.540
that are legitimately debatable

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.340
by people who are not bigots.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:19.000
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.460
is one of those issues.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.900
But it's a complicated issue.

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.780
First of all, which sport are we talking about?

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.980
Are we talking about figure skating,

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.980
middle school field hockey?

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.960
I see no reason why trans girls

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.660
should be excluded from that.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.220
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.220
well, then it seems plausible that trans women

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.100
who have been through male puberty

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.460
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:49.200
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.240
People are transitioning younger now,

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.600
and that's another thing you have to consider.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.520
So I'm not against debating this issue.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.560
I just want people to approach it

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.520
with nuance and good faith.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.720
And currently, a lot of the people

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.760
who are vocally against trans women and women's sports

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.160
sound like this.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.840
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.680
Right?

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.560
How ridiculous.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.720
That will take place on day one.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.560
And I don't want to debate those people.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.280
I want to serve them a banana cream pie.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.680
Chapter six, illiberal methods.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.600
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.260
about the trans rights movement

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.580
is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.720
So when I first became interested

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.120
and then deeply troubled by what I saw

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.600
as a cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.160
So what are these illiberal methods?

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.840
If you are saying this person is canceled,

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.080
that is the language of a dictator.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:56.960
It's true.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.320
Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.400
First, they canceled the socialists,

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.200
and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.280
But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:29.000
You know, I can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.080
to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.360
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.880
I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.080
Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.280
is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.440
that makes it different from all past liberation movements.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.520
But how?

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520
What are these illiberal methods

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.280
that distinguish trans rights activism from similar past movements?

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.400
Cancelling?

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.440
Anita Bryant was way more canceled than J.K. Rowling ever will be.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.480
Boycotts?

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.240
Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement in modern history.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.400
Disrupting feminist meetings?

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.200
Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.200
Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.120
In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.520
and founder of the National Organization for Women

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.600
and second wave feminism in general,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.640
coined the phrase Lavender Menace to describe the threat she believed

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.240
that lesbians posed to the women's movement.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.560
would make it easy to dismiss the movement as a bunch of manish man-haters.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.520
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.240
who attended the second Congress to unite women in 1970

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.880
to stage what used to be known as a zap,

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.520
a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.640
Think glitter bombing.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.720
Think pies.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.520
Half aggression, half whimsy.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.080
Like that time the lesbian avengers zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.480
demanding that she resign.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.520
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.080
Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.960
So just as the meeting was beginning,

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.400
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.320
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.200
and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.080
Their leader Rita Mae Brown took the mic and yelled,

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.680
This conference won't proceed until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.840
One of the now organizers yelled back,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.840
I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.520
You're acting like men.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.640
Betty Friedan would later speculate that the lesbians were a CIA sci-op

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.120
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.840
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting using illiberal tactics

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.000
not because they were against feminism,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.040
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists to include them.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.200
It's the same thing that's happening today when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.960
as J.K. Rowling puts it,

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.680
interestingly neglecting to mention which feminist meetings these are.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.800
I was starting to see activists behaving in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.240
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging and kicking on windows,

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.280
very threatening.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.480
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.240
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive than similar past movements.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.800
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man called Dennis Noel Cavanaugh who says,

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.000
All those gay rights and AIDS protests,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.280
I don't remember a single one where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.560
Not a single one.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.720
Not a single one.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.400
Not a single one.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.320
Not a single one.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.440
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS to the trans movement.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.040
And also, uh, quote,

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.600
I will fucking nail you to a wall what you have done to these innocent children.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.880
Your mutilation of these little humanned because they were gay

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.320
will be nothing compared to what I will do to you legally.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:13.800
You think you are ghouls wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.800
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.120
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people to a wall count as illiberal methods?

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.720
I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so because she's never condemned it.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.520
In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended, she was right there to welcome him back.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.280
And she continues to retweet him.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.000
I've always been happy to acknowledge that angry trans people on Twitter sometimes take things too far.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.280
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults, I don't support that.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.960
And I've called it out in the past.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.680
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.320
drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.760
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.600
I called him out tweeting,

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:05.560
Doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say about their being misogyny in trans activism.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.120
I tweeted that because I recognize that if people who are claiming to speak for you are doing so in a misogynistic way,

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.440
and if you let that slide, you're going to wake up one day to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:25.080
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well, explaining that actually I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.400
for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:34.560
And then he accused me of cancel culturing him while at the same time literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.040
The more of you were in the replies being like, that's not what's happening right here.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.200
Like, this is necessary, okay?

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.800
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.280
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.960
Move you off this site and into, I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.600
So that pretty much confirms to me that Vosh doesn't actually care about advocating for trans people,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.360
and just uses trans rights as a pretext to act like a fucking dingus.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.160
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though, because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:14.360
The point I'm trying to make is, I have no qualms about calling out people on my side whenever they go too far or cross a line.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.280
Or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me about how I don't understand a tactical misogyny.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:19.800
Idiot.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.200
But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:30.200
I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and abusiveness that is absolutely rampant in the gender-critical movement.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:42.400
There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists versus the abusive trans mob.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:51.000
A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.280
Things like, kill TERFs 2014.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.160
How about slowly and horrendously murder TERFs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:09.560
Now, I don't think anyone should joke about putting people in saw traps, but also, how serious is this threat that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.800
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:19.120
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies, has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.960
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:37.160
I can fill the screen up with examples just from people who J.K. Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:43.480
I will drive you out into the desert and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says, from a fan of J.K. Rowling.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:51.160
First, I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse, fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:59.960
Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual, I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:06.160
But threats like this from the gender-critical side are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:12.560
Both Rowling and Meghan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets and sound bites of shouting protesters.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.040
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.240
You look like you got your teeth knocked out and your fucking lashes.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.280
As evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:28.080
But this exact technique has been used against literally every liberation movement in world history.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:34.640
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night, the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.760
which first got J.K. Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:45.880
Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note, covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.600
Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:55.400
but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.400
We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:05.280
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear that my friend's brother

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.280
was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.480
The protesters were allegedly singing,

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:16.280
Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.800
So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.200
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.680
Castrate men!

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.840
Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.600
Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:36.000
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus, who shot Andy Warhol,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.080
who advocated for male extermination in her society for cutting up men manifesto,

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.520
is representative of feminism as a whole?

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.920
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.160
But it's not fair, is it?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:55.160
So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.360
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.800
And I made excuses for you, then.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.880
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.320
Meghan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.200
who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:15.600
There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation that I find fascinating.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.120
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say, you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.280
And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.000
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:39.440
And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus can be imposed,

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.280
maybe as opposed to evolve organically.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:50.440
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

01:22:50.440 --> 01:23:00.960
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection as other groups whose rights we've decided are not up for public conversation.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.480
I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:09.000
So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people are often reluctant to debate our rights

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.200
is that we want the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:24.120
But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:30.200
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.320
Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:44.160
Did suffragettes just have calm civil conversations about whether women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.120
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote, sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.360
Like, people forget this.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:57.360
Maybe because they were called suffragettes, which is kind of a cutesy name, but the suffragettes, they murdered people.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.240
They were suffragette terrorists.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.240
They broke windows.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.800
They bombed churches.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.760
They set fire to a theater.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.160
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.400
Queen shit, honestly.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:14.560
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet at the Prime Minister's head.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.480
And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.960
I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against the movement.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.400
I don't think it's effective.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:29.520
But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands before everyone was ready.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.960
Because there never has been, and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.520
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.560
and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.200
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights, and there probably never will be.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:54.320
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.200
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.560
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone to give us rights,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.360
but the reality is, that's not how this works, and it never has been.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.280
Like, how do these debate-making centrists think that slavery ended in the United States?

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:19.880
Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.400
See what I'm holding in my hand?

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:26.640
This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.120
Do you people think that American schools were integrated because all the white people in the South were persuaded

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.840
that segregation is bad?

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.880
No dum-dums.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.240
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit at gunpoint.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.200
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements with Black civil rights.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.080
I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent to living in the aftermath of slavery.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.320
I'm just saying that there's this tendency to sanitize history,

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:59.920
and to imagine that progress was smooth and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:07.320
And then people get the impression that current movements are somehow more militant than successful past movements, when they just aren't.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:13.560
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement,

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.880
the cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:25.880
And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.320
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.000
Chapter 7. Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.600
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin, whom Stepp already mentioned a couple times in this video.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.560
I myself favor violence. Deeply. I favor it.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.640
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views, which I don't agree with.

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:55.000
But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:03.880
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women, published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:11.840
Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:20.960
Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement, a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism, should read this book.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:29.920
In Dworkin's analysis, the political right makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women's deepest fears.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.240
No one can bear to live a meaningless life. Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.000
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.800
The right offers women a simple, fixed, predetermined social, biological, and sexual order. Form conquers chaos. Form banishes confusion.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.480
The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.920
A woman is an adult human female.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:05.400
Right Wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase into the motto of the gender-critical movement.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.720
Adult human female.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.160
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:21.000
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition, it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.520
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines, there can be no change.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.080
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos that gender-criticals fear.

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.400
The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:43.680
Just biologically that God made mother so that we could reproduce. Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.200
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.440
Dworkin says,

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:57.720
Within the frame of male domination, there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality, both male and female.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:03.200
Women are interchangeable as sex objects. Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.200
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:12.600
Having children is the one social contribution credited to women. It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.520
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing. Homosexuality for women means having nothing, it means extinction.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:25.800
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.360
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.400
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.440
The producer of the large gametes.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:42.760
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men is the loss of fertility.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:51.280
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility, attempts to socially legitimize or protect it, makes women expendable.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.560
The one thing women can do and be valued for will no longer be valued.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:03.880
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying because it suggests a world without women altogether, a world in which women are extinct.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.320
This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:16.320
Trans activists are erasing women. They're erasing biological sex. They're going to call us pregnant people.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:23.440
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility. Trans women are going to replace biological women.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.400
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men are aggressively replacing women.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.280
You will not replace us!

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:36.360
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession and the results can be dazzling.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:44.800
In September 2022, Maya Forstader, who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist whom J.K. Rowling came out as a turf to defend,

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:55.560
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced they were changing their children's storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:06.160
If you don't know where this is going, strap in from the Bookstart Bear to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.280
Are you enraged?

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.960
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:21.840
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother who referred to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:27.080
describing the mascot as ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.840
I cannot express how upset I feel.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:37.400
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia, isn't trans, they are an alien.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:41.120
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.720
Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.800
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:55.200
There's an advantage in having a character that isn't identifiably male or female, as it can be equally relatable to either sex and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.480
But Maya was not convinced.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:05.480
It seems highly unlikely that an alien that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan is not sexually reproducing.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.360
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character, not a slime mold.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:15.240
I need to know how the alien fucks right now.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:23.440
I said I need to know how the alien fucks before I can show it to my child.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:32.440
When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.520
And she posted hard.

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.560
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:40.840
In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.640
You are in charge of a baby.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.280
You have never done this before.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:47.600
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months and won't for years.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.160
Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing right and wrong, and you've become invisible.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.600
You had politics.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.920
You had a career.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.480
You had interests.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.920
You had a sex life.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.960
Now you have the daily needs of a completely dependent person, and your world has shrunk.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.720
The fact that these men and the young women that cheer them on think this is so laughable

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.560
reflects society's disdain for mothers.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.360
This is what it means to say a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:19.240
This is why the hub of the resistance is on mom's net.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:22.240
So I am fascinated by this thread.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.160
I think it's one of the most revealing texts in gender-critical history.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:31.960
Because you know what, Maya Forstetter actually does have valid concerns.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.560
But the concerns she has that are valid have nothing to do with trans people.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.280
And they definitely have nothing to do with an adorable cartoon alien.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.360
Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.440
Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.920
I know she has one.

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.480
Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.280
No one should have to feel this alone raising children.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.840
That is a valid concern.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.800
Oh my god, we actually found one.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.440
It's like finding El Dorado.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.160
A valid concern.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.160
A valid concern.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.920
Isn't what's going on here that Maya is taking legitimate feelings of being overburdened

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:15.600
and underappreciated and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.760
This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.360
By providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.120
It's not your husband's neglect.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.040
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.280
It's not the indignities of aging.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:36.800
It's Tala, the non-binary alien with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.640
Mum's net is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.640
It's too much.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640
These people are too much.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.760
Okay, we have to be serious now.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.000
The political right also promises women safety and security.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.800
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:55.760
The right acknowledges the reality of danger, the validity of fear.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.080
The right then manipulates the fear.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.440
Women fear and resent male violence, which they're most likely to experience from the

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.120
men closest to them, boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.320
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:15.040
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society means that women's legitimate fears

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.840
and resentments often cannot be directed at the men with power.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.640
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage and contempt they feel for the men who

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.600
actually abuse them, those close to them, and project it onto others.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.640
Those far away, foreign, or different.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.200
And this displacement of rage is just transparently what's going on with JK Rowling.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.640
In her essay about sex and gender issues, Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.200
to be the son her father wanted.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.320
I really felt the rejection of my father.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.280
And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone going into homosexuality.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.720
And she describes the lingering trauma from her first violent marriage.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.540
The marriage at this point has turned very violent and very controlling.

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:08.040
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out against the transgender movement.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.280
If you try to understand this rationally, it looks like a total non sequitur.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.520
But if you look at it emotionally, there's a kind of logic to it.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:22.160
The existence of the dangerous outsider always functions for women simultaneously as deception,

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.920
diversion, painkiller, and threat.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.560
Women cling to irrational hatreds focused particularly on the unfamiliar, so that they

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:33.640
will not murder their fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, lovers.

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.440
The men with whom they are intimate, those who do hurt them.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:44.200
In the 1970s, many conservative women displaced this rage onto lesbians, the threatening outsider

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200
of the day.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:51.120
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977, where she spoke to a lot of women

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.520
about their fear of lesbians.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.200
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.680
certified committers of sexual assault against women and girls.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.880
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous, experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.120
hovering closer and closer.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.840
She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching, threatening by her very presence a sexual

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.560
order that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:24.760
It's almost surreal to read this because of how precisely it describes how gender

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.000
criticals talk about trans women.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.960
Pronouns are like Rohypnal.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.440
They dull your defenses.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.800
They change your inhibitions.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.200
They're meant to.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.680
Now it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism began as an offshoot of far-left

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:47.200
lesbian separatism, with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979 that transsexualism

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.720
should be morally mandated out of existence.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.640
But the gender critical movement was always destined to become a right-wing movement because

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.320
it has the structure of a right-wing movement, taking women's fear and rage toward familiar

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.560
men and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:11.120
The momentum behind this is just to ripe an opportunity for conservatives to pass up.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.120
As Dworkin says,

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:18.000
Because women so displaced their rage, they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.280
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.240
The right provides these symbols of danger by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.960
as sources of danger.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:34.360
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone of conservative party platforms,

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.240
both in the UK, where Lee Anderson, deputy chair of the conservative party, predicts

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.240
that the next election will be won on

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.560
Probably a mixture of culture wars and trans debates.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:51.960
And in the US, where the ACLU is currently tracking more than 450 anti-LGBT bills, including

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:59.840
more than 130 gender-affirming care bans, 51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans, 29 trans

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:06.200
bathroom bans, and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law, Republicans have escalated

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:12.080
anti-trans rhetoric to eliminationist extremes that have most trans people in this country

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.240
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.400
Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:26.440
The Left is attacking our children, pushing sex talk, transgender extremism, and noxious

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440
politics in our schools.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.880
We should reject this demonic assault on the innocence of our children and stand fast against

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.400
leftist efforts to mutilate their bodies and minds.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:43.760
Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.440
I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilization

01:39:50.440 --> 01:40:01.160
of our youth, and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.040
in all 50 states.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:10.160
On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.160
Ridiculous.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:17.120
I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.080
that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.520
A few gender criticals still want to insist they have nothing to do with right-wing anti-trans

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.520
bigots.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.520
Like Helen Lewis.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.200
Helen Turf is basically witch who attempts in her interview in the witch trials of J.K.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.400
Rowling to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right and that of feminists.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.800
I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand is that there are two different

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.320
arguments going on.

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.120
One is the traditional conservative right argument, which is anti-LGBT.

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:56.240
The other one is a criticism from the Left in which it says sometimes male people and

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.840
female people have different interests, no matter how the male people identify.

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.640
But as a trans person, I don't care whether you justify your transphobia in the name of

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.840
protecting women or protecting children.

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:13.880
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond calling for transsexualism to be morally mandated

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:19.240
out of existence, or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles calling for transgenderism

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.080
to be eradicated from public life, it's the same repulsive bigotry to me.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.840
And in any case, the gender-critical movement has recently reached an implicit consensus

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.880
that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:39.240
The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker aka Kelly J. Keene Minchel, rejects feminism

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240
entirely.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.080
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.080
No.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.080
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080
I probably did for a short time.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.640
But so you wouldn't be so like a Julie Bindle type feminist?

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.040
No, well some feminists, I mean Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers in the past and

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.800
I think that's a theme flowing through feminism.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.800
I'm not a feminist!

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.040
I'm not a feminist!

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.480
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.320
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.800
Parker's campaign is currently funded by the right-wing CPAC.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.080
CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events and cover all of our insurance

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.640
throughout our whole trip, which is really kind of them.

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.640
But what we would need to do is we would need to show that we were working for them, working

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.000
with them.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.880
She has no qualms about collaborating with far-right white nationalists.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.480
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.000
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.800
She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.880
She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:48.200
Why are we enabling children to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful or access

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.360
to abortion?

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:54.520
I think that we really need to rethink all of this.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.400
I think parents need to take back control of their children.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.000
She's called trans people fools and perverts.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.520
Transgenderism is nuts.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.720
It's for fools and perverts.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.160
She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.600
It's not a real thing.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.960
There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.400
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.560
There's no such thing as a trans person.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.560
There is no such thing.

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.400
There are people that call themselves these things that may have other issues manifesting

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.720
that then make them think they're this, but no.

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:28.520
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:32.120
There may be more words that we have to say in order to say that.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.880
We may call it transgender ideology, but when it comes to a person, they may be following

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.760
transgender ideology, but they are not transgender.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.880
There is no such thing as a man or a woman being anything other than a man or a woman.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.280
She's called trans women pedophiles.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:54.040
We know that if a man has a paraphilia addressing as a woman, the most likely cross paraphilia

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.080
is pedophilia.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.880
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.680
They don't ever stop at one.

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.840
She's said that each and every woman who stands in her way will be annihilated.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.080
Each and every one of you women who stand in my way, each and every one of you, let me

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.760
just tell you, you will be annihilated.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.120
She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms to attack anyone they perceive as

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.760
not a real woman.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.880
And men, for once, I'm talking to you.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.480
I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry, I think that's what you say.

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.880
I'm so down with the American lingo.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.400
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.200
Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.640
Maybe you're that sort of man.

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.400
Maybe you have a daughter or a mother or a wife.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.400
Maybe you have a sister.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:49.480
Maybe you just have some friends.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.360
Maybe you just think women are human and you don't need any absolute connection with them

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:00.280
to feel compelled to protect us.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.720
I think you should start using women's toilets, men.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.600
And she's said that women who call themselves men should be sterilized, which seems to be

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:15.440
a little bit in tension with JK Rowling's concern about the fertility of confused girls.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.000
You know, you might look at these differences of opinion between Rowling and Parker.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:28.280
Little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist, left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:34.320
Concern about trans men's fertility versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:41.400
against annihilating women who stand in your way versus pro-annihilating each and every

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.920
woman who stands in your way.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.320
You might look at these differences and expect that these two women would be at odds, but

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320
they aren't.

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:55.040
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause that for both of them trumps

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:56.040
all else.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:02.400
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster reading I Heart JK Rowling to be displayed at a railway

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.120
station in Edinburgh, and Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times and has

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:10.120
modeled her t-shirts.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.760
So the gender-critical movement, started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s, has finally

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:23.320
passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns, as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bendel memorably

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.640
described them.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.920
It's a movement that has no beliefs apart from a shared determination to reduce the

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.600
number of trans people.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:36.720
In the numbers we're currently seeing, particularly of young people coming forward, I find cause

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.720
for doubt.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:41.840
In the meantime, while we're trying to get through to the decision-makers, we have to

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.000
try to limit the harm.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.920
And that means reducing or keeping down the number of people who transition.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.160
And that's for two reasons.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.240
One of them is that every one of those people is a person who's been damaged.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:01.200
But the second one is every one of those people is basically, you know, a huge problem to

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.400
a sane world.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.840
Like if you've got people that, whether they're transitioned, whether they're happily transitioned,

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:09.480
whether they're unhappily transitioned, whether they've detransitioned, if you've got people

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.960
who've dissociated from their sex in some way, every one of those people is someone

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:19.400
who needs special accommodation in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.400
sex.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.480
So to wrap this up, is the backlash against JK Rowling a witch hunt?

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.360
Unequivocally, no, it's very thoroughly deserved.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.560
But I will say this, a movement can't get along without a devil.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:40.880
And across the whole political spectrum, there is a misogynistic tendency to choose a female

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.920
devil, whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton, Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.440
or JK Rowling.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.520
And there's always going to be people who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:48:01.120
So I would advise trans people and our allies to keep in mind that JK Rowling is not the

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:05.200
final boss of transphobia, she's not our devil.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.960
The devil is the Republican party, the conservative party.

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:14.640
The devil is patriarchy, it's the right-wing men who will be the ones to put gender-critical

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.160
theory into brutal practice.

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:24.480
Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and JK Rowling are, to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.280
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.600
They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face on the patriarchal violence against

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.840
trans people that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:42.160
I call on men to consider themselves dear to human beings, to call out the demons among

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.840
them and eradicate these monsters from society.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:53.040
And Megan Phillips Roper and centrist Slaker are wrong that civil conversation can resolve

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.040
this.

01:48:54.040 --> 01:49:00.640
Call out the demons among them and eradicate these monsters from society.

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.560
People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.680
They have to be defeated.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.200
As for what to do about JK Rowling, honestly, let's all just block her.

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:18.440
Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile, and just block her.

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440
Problem solved.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.560
Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.160
But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.080
She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.160
The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave, for the same reasons that it's hard

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.840
to quit a culture scam.

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.240
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.960
One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam is that the victims who invested the

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.800
most are often the most passionate defenders because shame is a powerful force in the human

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.520
psyche and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:54.040
Reformed bigots have to face not only the shame of being dupes, but also the guilt

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.800
of having devoted years of life to harming vulnerable people.

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.840
This is something Megan, to her credit, faced head on.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:06.720
If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life industriously sowing doom, discord,

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:11.680
and rage to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.080
I had wasted my life only to fill others with pain and misery.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.000
Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.560
It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linahan, whose all-consuming hatred of trans people

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.520
has ruined his life, caused him his marriage, and left him alone to tweet about destroying

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:35.000
gender ideology minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.880
to insist with ever more certainty that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.560
but are all demonic perverts, an enemy so hyperbolically evil that they justify his

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.320
self-immolating crusade.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:19.920
As long as he stays here, in the bottom of the

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:24.520
whirlpool, he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships and wasted years

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.640
of life because he just couldn't let it go.

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.640
And if J.K.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.680
Rowling doesn't log off soon, this will likely be her fate as well.

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.280
I guess what I'm really trying to say is, Harry Potter is dead to me.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.280
I'm switching to Twilight.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:08.280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.280
