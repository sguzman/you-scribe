00:00.000 --> 00:19.640
Hello my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here

00:19.640 --> 00:24.600
to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.920
There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime,

00:30.920 --> 00:36.720
so if that's going to make you sad, please don't watch this, unless you enjoy sadness.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.300
I know I do, but your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made

00:42.300 --> 00:47.320
you a wet pot of hot tea, and you can take it out in the balcony and pour it on some

00:47.320 --> 00:48.320
pedestrians.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.280
That always cheers me up.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.280
One, traps.

00:56.280 --> 01:03.400
Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
research.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.000
Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
volumes ancient and modern in search of the answer to two fundamental questions.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.480
That are traps, and be they gay.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.240
With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady

01:27.240 --> 01:33.400
scholar known as the pedantic romantic, wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced

01:33.400 --> 01:36.920
to patrons of animated pictures from the aureate.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.920
Curious.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.160
The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture

01:43.160 --> 01:48.680
forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one admiral

01:48.680 --> 01:53.840
Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.

01:53.840 --> 02:00.120
Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japon-esks,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.960
to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.920
The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth the daughter

02:08.920 --> 02:15.400
of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
skulduggery.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.520
Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only

02:22.520 --> 02:25.800
transvestites, but transsexuals as well.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.760
And this must needs be remarked, for tis evident such persons oft times inflame the lust of

02:31.760 --> 02:33.000
ordinary men.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.320
It is hence with respect to this phenomenon, I pose my second question thus, fellas, is

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
it gay?

02:40.320 --> 02:44.040
I'm sorry, who are you talking to?

02:44.040 --> 02:47.560
Gentlemen of the academy.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.520
Did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again?

02:49.520 --> 02:53.360
It must needs be remarked.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.880
Please stop breaking into my house.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.880
I shall be the queen of dairy.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.960
I'm sure you will be.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.680
Cross-dresser, hi, I'm Natalie Nguyen, biological woman.

03:07.680 --> 03:16.000
Can we pan the camera down, my hair is less high?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.320
Are traps gay?

03:17.320 --> 03:19.200
The meme, that will not die.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.080
Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male cross-dresser

03:24.080 --> 03:28.680
or a trans woman, especially in a context of neotenist kawaii decadence.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.600
The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men attracted

03:33.600 --> 03:38.600
to dick girls, foodnari, MTFs, you know a lot of these men don't know or care about

03:38.600 --> 03:42.320
the difference between a trans woman and a cross-dresser, so it's kind of pointless

03:42.320 --> 03:43.640
to get hung up on that.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.560
The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago when someone released the worst specimens

03:47.560 --> 03:49.920
of the white race into the wild.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.400
All traps gay, one of life's most important questions, are traps gay.

03:56.400 --> 04:09.920
To the men who meme about this topic, it's all lighthearted fun, it's part of a wider

04:09.920 --> 04:15.000
game they like to play called is it gay, you know, is it gay to have an MMF3 sum, only if

04:15.000 --> 04:20.360
the balls touch, don't cross the streams, and so on, but to many trans women, the meme

04:20.360 --> 04:22.600
and the word trap itself are highly offensive.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.040
In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans

04:27.040 --> 04:31.160
people on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this topic is just too harmful to

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
even discuss.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.640
So here's the challenge I face making this video.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.600
On the one hand, there's people who are going to be upset and offended that I'm making

04:37.600 --> 04:41.400
a video about this topic at all, and on the other hand, there are people who think this

04:41.400 --> 04:45.120
is all just harmless otaku shitposting and who are going to be annoyed by my trigger

04:45.120 --> 04:46.120
warnings.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.200
But first, to the people who think it's too offensive, here's what I have to say for

04:49.200 --> 04:50.200
myself.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.680
I just believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where they're

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
at.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.400
And in this case, are traps gay is where people are at.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.080
At one of my YouTube meetups, I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard

05:01.080 --> 05:04.840
some of his male students joking in the hallway about are traps gay.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.760
When those teenage boys go home and Google are traps gay, who do you want to explain

05:08.760 --> 05:09.760
it to them?

05:09.760 --> 05:14.680
Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count

05:14.680 --> 05:16.280
Dankula, or this Tran.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.240
And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.160
You know, as trans women, we have little influence in society.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.760
The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.200
So we're like a jogger racing against a car.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.000
The only way to win is to hijack the car.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.520
And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
about us.

05:38.520 --> 05:43.920
As always, my aspiration is to drive a woke conclusion from edgy premises to shitpost

05:43.920 --> 05:45.800
my way to the moral high ground.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.320
Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking just more politically correct cuckoldry

05:50.320 --> 05:52.120
designed to take away your free speech?

05:52.120 --> 05:56.280
Well, I assure you, there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.640
Unless you clock my makeup, dickbag!

05:58.640 --> 05:59.640
Comment!

05:59.640 --> 06:00.640
Deleted!

06:00.640 --> 06:04.320
But if you want to know why trans women are offended by are traps gay, I'm happy to

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
tell you.

06:05.320 --> 06:10.080
Not to silence you, of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to

06:10.080 --> 06:14.960
want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that seems harmless

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
to you.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.560
So, well, let's put it this way.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.960
2.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.960
Trans Panic

06:21.960 --> 06:28.160
The 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx gay and

06:28.160 --> 06:31.600
transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.160
One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Extravaganza who describes

06:36.160 --> 06:38.880
her precarious existence as a sex worker.

06:38.880 --> 06:44.560
I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties until he touched me down there.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.560
He felt it and he seen it and he like totally flipped out and he said, you fucking faggot.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
You're a freak.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.280
You're a victim of AIDS and you're trying to give me AIDS.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
What are you, crazy?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.280
You're a homo.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.280
I should kill you.

06:56.280 --> 07:01.760
And like, I was really terrified so I just jumped out the window.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.240
During the filming of Paris Is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.640
Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.300
Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully

07:14.300 --> 07:18.020
high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.260
The men who murdered trans women often claim they were provoked to violence by the alleged

07:22.260 --> 07:24.100
deception of their victims.

07:24.100 --> 07:29.620
This is what's called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial

07:29.620 --> 07:33.060
of the killers of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.

07:33.060 --> 07:37.140
One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried, I can't

07:37.140 --> 07:40.100
be fucking gay, before beating her to death.

07:40.100 --> 07:44.140
Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don't want to

07:44.140 --> 07:46.460
get murdered, then they shouldn't trick men.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.940
But what you have to understand is first, men usually do know when they're having sex

07:50.940 --> 07:55.580
with a trans woman, like if you have a dick, it's pretty hard actually to have sex with

07:55.580 --> 08:01.220
someone and have them not notice it, and second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence

08:01.220 --> 08:03.180
as itself a kind of trickery.

08:03.180 --> 08:07.780
A black trans woman named Elan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose

08:07.780 --> 08:10.340
friends had mocked him for flirting with her.

08:10.340 --> 08:14.660
All she did to provoke him was walk down the street with two friends.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.220
The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive

08:19.220 --> 08:23.700
of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight.

08:23.700 --> 08:28.520
But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across

08:28.520 --> 08:31.380
class and race experience some version of.

08:31.380 --> 08:38.420
Because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation

08:38.420 --> 08:39.860
to a proboscis.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.980
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at

08:43.980 --> 08:48.460
a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans and then punched

08:48.460 --> 08:49.460
her.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.460
Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home?

08:52.460 --> 08:56.940
For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our

08:56.940 --> 08:57.940
freedom.

08:57.940 --> 09:02.380
There's bars I won't go into, because I don't trust the clientele to side with me if some

09:02.380 --> 09:03.860
shit like that goes down.

09:03.860 --> 09:08.020
And I've had little scares, I was in the back of an Uber once, and the driver comes

09:08.020 --> 09:11.620
on a little flirty, you know, what's your name, are you a student?

09:11.620 --> 09:15.460
And I'm thinking, wow, he thinks I'm young enough to be a student!

09:15.460 --> 09:20.460
But at some point he goes silent, and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare in the rearview

09:20.460 --> 09:25.540
mirror like fucking clocked, and for a second I'm like, fuck, I'm gonna die in the back

09:25.540 --> 09:26.540
of this car.

09:26.540 --> 09:31.780
And of course I didn't die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine, I mean I'm

09:31.780 --> 09:36.220
gonna be fine, because white middle class transsexuals don't get murdered in this country.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.780
The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it's really

09:40.780 --> 09:42.260
not my oppression to claim.

09:42.260 --> 09:46.220
You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle class, computer programmer, trans women

09:46.220 --> 09:51.700
be like, we're getting murdered in the streets, who's we, it's not white middle class trans

09:51.700 --> 09:52.700
women.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.660
So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane, it exists at this intersection

09:56.660 --> 10:00.700
of masculinity and race, and that's really not a conversation that should be led by a

10:00.700 --> 10:06.060
white woman, especially when there's so, so, so many things to critique about white

10:06.060 --> 10:07.060
masculinity.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.500
Let's talk about some now.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
3.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Taking offense.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.980
Okay, back to traps.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.780
Now this is my lane, I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.

10:17.780 --> 10:22.460
Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox.

10:22.460 --> 10:27.580
So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom is abridged by our need to navigate

10:27.580 --> 10:33.420
around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence, as a kind of trap.

10:33.420 --> 10:37.780
I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans if

10:37.780 --> 10:41.740
you're using that word for us, or for foodinari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.

10:41.740 --> 10:47.220
I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap, my response is more like, wow, a transphobe

10:47.220 --> 10:51.020
thought I looked like a woman, but that's because I'm so pathetic I have to go dumpster

10:51.020 --> 10:55.020
diving for validation, but the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity

10:55.020 --> 10:58.360
and self-respect, you should definitely not call them traps.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.820
Of course, some trans women will overstate the case and say the word trap is literally

11:01.820 --> 11:06.700
getting trans women killed, which I can't find any examples of the word trap being connected

11:06.700 --> 11:11.700
to a murder, but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm?

11:11.700 --> 11:15.300
Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps is you're showing that you think

11:15.300 --> 11:19.220
of us the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us.

11:19.220 --> 11:23.380
When a man kills a trans woman, literally the argument he trots out in court is that

11:24.380 --> 11:29.100
And that's what you're reminding us of when you use that word, and that's why trans women

11:29.100 --> 11:30.260
are getting triggered over it.

11:30.260 --> 11:34.340
You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is

11:34.340 --> 11:35.540
one of those times.

11:35.540 --> 11:39.660
So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now.

11:39.660 --> 11:43.820
I think I've made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended

11:43.820 --> 11:48.300
by the word trap, but if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter, this is why

11:48.300 --> 11:53.620
I'm making this video, if I simply argue that our traps gay is offensive, then here's

11:53.620 --> 11:54.620
what happens.

11:54.620 --> 11:58.700
First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit, in fact, me telling them it's offensive

11:58.700 --> 12:02.340
only makes them want to say it more, because they feel, on a deep level, that they are

12:02.340 --> 12:07.020
by nature superior to trans people, so an uppity tranny telling them what words they're

12:07.020 --> 12:09.420
allowed to say completely enrages them.

12:09.420 --> 12:13.580
So they'll comment, traps are gay, well, just to reaffirm their superiority over me

12:13.580 --> 12:17.400
and that I have no power or influence over them, and there's really nothing I can do

12:17.400 --> 12:18.680
about those people.

12:18.680 --> 12:24.560
But, another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they'll say, okay,

12:24.560 --> 12:27.160
so since you're offended by it, I won't say the word trap anymore.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.780
And they'll be super woke about it, and they'll post Twitter callouts cancelling

12:30.780 --> 12:35.000
anyone who uses the word trap, and they'll be very respectful and compassionate toward

12:35.000 --> 12:40.880
trans people in public so long as it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic

12:40.880 --> 12:42.800
third world country of a gender minority.

12:42.800 --> 12:47.560
But then, they'll go home at night, and in that twilight between consciousness and

12:47.560 --> 12:52.120
sleep, their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?

12:52.120 --> 12:56.760
And then, years later, when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend, we'll suddenly

12:56.760 --> 13:01.440
watch all that shallow lokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapour.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.320
Real acceptance has to be built, and real understanding.

13:05.320 --> 13:12.360
So it's not enough for me to argue that are traps gay is offensive, I also have to argue

13:12.360 --> 13:15.080
that other traps are gay.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.760
So, are traps gay?

13:17.760 --> 13:20.600
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

13:20.600 --> 13:44.160
For the Philosopher Hello boys, it is I, the half-queen, points.

13:44.160 --> 13:49.160
After thirty days and thirty nights, the Philosopher descended from the mountaintop into the gathered

13:49.160 --> 13:56.160
villagers, thus spake, are traps gay? said he, to whom the half-queen, thus replied,

13:56.160 --> 14:04.600
hmm, let's see, let me think about it, oh, I'm gonna stop saying trap now, because it's

14:04.600 --> 14:07.920
not a good word, as has been explained, in fact it's really best to treat it like a

14:07.920 --> 14:08.920
slur.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.060
So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans

14:13.060 --> 14:14.640
woman, is that gay?

14:14.640 --> 14:19.800
Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are women, and a man having sex with

14:19.800 --> 14:26.040
a woman is, um, let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted, it is not

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
in fact gay.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.760
But that's not the most persuasive answer, because in order to find it convincing, you

14:30.760 --> 14:33.640
already have to believe that trans women are women.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.360
And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this, what they say is something

14:37.360 --> 14:43.680
like, sure, I think trans women are women, but, they shouldn't expect men to want to

14:43.680 --> 14:47.440
date them, unless they're into that sort of thing.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.440
Oh, and what sort of thing is that?

14:51.440 --> 14:55.280
Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman, and you say, oh, what's she like?

14:55.280 --> 15:01.560
And he says, she's from Cincinnati, your response is not, oh, David, I didn't realize

15:01.560 --> 15:04.440
you were into that sort of thing.

15:04.440 --> 15:09.680
In other words, these people tell you, trans women are women, but, and then they say something

15:09.680 --> 15:13.560
that shows they don't really think trans women are women at all.

15:13.560 --> 15:18.820
So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular

15:18.820 --> 15:23.640
reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay because trans women

15:23.640 --> 15:28.900
are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that's being disputed.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.200
So maybe the observational approach is better.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.360
The facts are indisputable.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.760
Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women, and comparatively few gay men are.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.160
Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the

15:42.160 --> 15:43.160
world.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.720
Who is attracted to us and who isn't?

15:45.720 --> 15:50.540
So to us, this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical as the question of whether

15:50.540 --> 15:52.480
the sun will rise tomorrow.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.180
Sure, philosophers can say, but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?

15:57.180 --> 16:00.300
To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.940
Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain and find a real thing to worry about.

16:03.940 --> 16:07.640
It's just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and to trans

16:07.640 --> 16:12.100
women, it's a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us are people

16:12.100 --> 16:13.980
who are attracted to women.

16:13.980 --> 16:18.500
Of the cis men I've been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight and

16:18.500 --> 16:22.340
all had only ever been with cis women until this trans came along.

16:22.340 --> 16:27.660
Am I really so powerful as a doctor that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over these tiny

16:27.660 --> 16:28.660
tits?

16:28.660 --> 16:29.660
Let's not get cocky.

16:29.660 --> 16:35.820
I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman

16:35.820 --> 16:40.060
and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then he continues being

16:40.060 --> 16:44.800
attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything but a straight man?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.860
What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay?

16:48.860 --> 16:53.260
Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.940
What about the penis?

16:54.940 --> 16:57.620
Ah yes, the penis.

16:57.620 --> 17:00.180
Look baby, we'll get to the penis, don't you worry about that.

17:00.180 --> 17:05.180
But first, I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas,

17:05.180 --> 17:06.460
because they got 5.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.460
Vossage.

17:07.460 --> 17:14.140
In fact, I've been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is, I make

17:14.140 --> 17:19.060
too much money for Medicaid now, so I have to form an LLC, become my own employer so

17:19.060 --> 17:22.660
I can give myself health benefits, and ugh, it's so much paperwork.

17:22.660 --> 17:25.980
You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a fucking

17:25.980 --> 17:26.980
c***t.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.100
Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,

17:31.100 --> 17:33.580
because a real vagina is a sacred passage.

17:33.580 --> 17:37.820
And that's fine by me, what am I going to do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered

17:37.820 --> 17:38.820
by the pope?

17:38.820 --> 17:39.820
Pass.

17:39.820 --> 17:43.540
Straight men don't get hung up on this, I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought

17:43.540 --> 17:47.780
of a vagina as a sacred passage, they're either grossed out by it, or they're trying to climb

17:47.780 --> 17:48.780
inside.

17:48.780 --> 17:52.500
What I'm trying to say is, in the past I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina,

17:52.500 --> 17:57.060
because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad, and besides, chicks with d***s are very in

17:57.060 --> 17:58.060
right now.

17:58.060 --> 18:01.780
Very 2019, very trending, and being a d*** girl, it's kind of like being a legendary

18:01.780 --> 18:03.180
pokemon, you know?

18:03.180 --> 18:07.020
People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn't that what we all want?

18:07.020 --> 18:12.260
But unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery, because, well, guys can

18:12.260 --> 18:14.260
I confess something kind of dark to you?

18:14.260 --> 18:21.460
I have this really fucked up fetish, where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.460
Crazy right?

18:22.460 --> 18:25.460
I mean I like anal, but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.

18:25.460 --> 18:26.460
Ew.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.460
I don't want to eat well.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.780
I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get d***ed, is that a crime?

18:30.780 --> 18:33.420
It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks?

18:33.420 --> 18:35.500
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

18:35.500 --> 18:40.340
The tests are back and are showing that, in the medical terminology, your vagina does

18:40.340 --> 18:41.460
indeed suck.

18:41.460 --> 18:45.360
The point is, the easy sell version of the argument I'm making is that there's nothing

18:45.360 --> 18:49.940
homosexual but a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.

18:49.940 --> 18:55.260
She has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she's giving hair body face,

18:55.260 --> 18:57.020
she's post-op and has a vagina.

18:57.020 --> 19:01.060
Now even in this situation, people will still say it's gay because of the chromosomes.

19:01.060 --> 19:06.100
But look, human beings have five senses, and none of them can detect chromosomes.

19:06.100 --> 19:10.420
Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender, it's based on perception.

19:10.420 --> 19:14.700
And if you're a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you're attracted to her as

19:14.700 --> 19:18.220
a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment, my dude.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.700
Congratulations, you're a breeder.

19:19.700 --> 19:24.940
Now the argument people make is, okay fine, it's straight if you mistake her for a biological

19:24.940 --> 19:30.580
woman, but if you know she's a man and you're still attracted, then it's gay.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.620
So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with

19:34.620 --> 19:38.340
your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and

19:38.340 --> 19:39.780
your sexual response.

19:39.780 --> 19:44.340
But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only if you

19:44.340 --> 19:48.780
value your identity as a straight man, you'll feel ashamed of your attraction and you'll

19:48.780 --> 19:52.700
try to fight and deny it, and you'll probably end up treating trans women like absolute

19:52.700 --> 19:53.700
garbage.

19:53.700 --> 19:58.900
If I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here, I would say trans women are a woman

19:58.900 --> 20:04.220
because they identify as women, and so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction

20:04.220 --> 20:09.380
to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing heterosexual attraction because of the way

20:09.380 --> 20:12.420
the person he's attracted to identifies.

20:12.420 --> 20:16.140
But that's just replacing the black and white thinking of a biology dogma with the black

20:16.140 --> 20:18.260
and white thinking of an identity dogma.

20:18.260 --> 20:23.420
But human sexuality is not black and white, it's not even shades of gray, it's a multicolor

20:23.420 --> 20:27.660
acid trip, it's Centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.540
So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it's not usually based on psychological

20:32.540 --> 20:33.940
identity either.

20:33.940 --> 20:38.420
Most of the time, initial attraction anyway is based on what I'd call presentation,

20:38.420 --> 20:39.420
how you look and act.

20:39.420 --> 20:43.100
And I think that's especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual

20:43.100 --> 20:44.100
pop.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.860
They see, they conquer, they come.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.100
I mean you have to admire the simplicity of it.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.300
Sometimes I wish I were a man.

20:50.340 --> 20:55.260
So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans

20:55.260 --> 20:56.260
women who pop.

20:56.260 --> 20:59.820
Maybe you don't think I pop, but you'd be hard pressed to argue that any number of

20:59.820 --> 21:03.900
trans models and actresses don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.980
So the pop is undeniable, no one's questioning the pop.

21:06.980 --> 21:10.860
In fact without the pop it never would have occurred to men to call trans women traps,

21:10.860 --> 21:14.700
because they wouldn't be trapped if they weren't attracted in the first place.

21:14.700 --> 21:19.060
But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans woman,

21:19.060 --> 21:23.620
is some kind of illusion or facade that at some point will be dropped, revealing that

21:23.620 --> 21:26.220
our womanhood is a sham and that we're really men.

21:26.220 --> 21:30.120
Now, here's a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.

21:30.120 --> 21:34.740
If you date a cis drag queen, at some point you're getting a man honey, as explained

21:34.740 --> 21:37.180
by the only good YouTuber Jasmine Masters.

21:37.180 --> 21:41.020
I don't want to date nobody who want to date me like this because this comes off and you're

21:41.020 --> 21:43.740
not doing nothing with this.

21:43.740 --> 21:48.180
But if you date me, there's no de-dragging, there's no moment where I become a man.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.740
But baby what you see is what you got.

21:50.740 --> 21:55.500
At least on this side, this is my natural side, and this is my biological side.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.740
When we're discussing people who are trans, we immediately scan the first paragraph trans

21:58.740 --> 22:03.060
woman and then repurchase it by their biological pronoun because biology is the nature of the

22:03.060 --> 22:04.060
pronoun, so.

22:04.060 --> 22:08.020
Everyone's always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine, so why

22:08.020 --> 22:10.820
do you think that in the bedroom we'd be any other way?

22:10.820 --> 22:14.380
Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what

22:14.380 --> 22:15.660
it does for trans women.

22:15.660 --> 22:20.980
It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts.

22:20.980 --> 22:24.620
That's right, these are my very real, very biological titties.

22:24.620 --> 22:28.140
I mean I'm wearing a pushup bra, but at least there's something to push up now.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
Here I'll show you.

22:30.140 --> 22:35.260
I mean they're small, but it's not by any measure a male chest, and what I have is very

22:35.260 --> 22:38.820
real, very biological, and very female.

22:38.820 --> 22:41.740
You people think everything to do with trans women is fake.

22:41.740 --> 22:43.980
Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair.

22:43.980 --> 22:47.980
Now that's prejudice more than observation, like I've noticed that whether or not I actually

22:47.980 --> 22:53.180
wear a wig in a video has exactly zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man

22:53.180 --> 22:54.180
in a wig.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.260
So I may as well just wear wigs, and I may as well get my boobs done too since people

22:57.260 --> 23:01.260
are gonna call them fake either way, but for what it's worth this is my real hair, at least

23:01.260 --> 23:06.380
on this half, and these are my real boobs, and if I bring home a gentleman, or a lady,

23:06.380 --> 23:09.540
all that stays on in bed and it's there when I wake up in the morning.

23:09.540 --> 23:11.100
But what about the penis?

23:11.100 --> 23:12.740
Oh right, oh right.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.620
Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?

23:15.620 --> 23:16.620
I rest my case.

23:16.620 --> 23:17.620
Roll credits.

23:17.620 --> 23:18.620
6.

23:18.620 --> 23:28.460
The Feminine Penis Look, some guys want the T's and the D, and

23:28.460 --> 23:29.460
that's the D.

23:29.460 --> 23:34.060
Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a lady dick, makes any sexual

23:34.060 --> 23:35.900
interaction with a man gay.

23:35.900 --> 23:42.660
But isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men, and not merely to penis

23:42.980 --> 23:44.220
wherever they may arise?

23:44.220 --> 23:49.940
I think there probably are some gay men who really just like dick, and I'm not judging,

23:49.940 --> 23:54.300
I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences, but being a straight man, I don't really

23:54.300 --> 23:58.140
think that's best understood as a man attracted to vaginas.

23:58.140 --> 24:02.620
You call women pussy, but then you're always like, ew, periods, I'm a straight man, I'm

24:02.620 --> 24:06.220
not used to putting a towel down when I fuck, I don't know how to use a condom because I

24:06.220 --> 24:10.380
expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me, and then you have straight

24:10.380 --> 24:15.660
incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust,

24:15.660 --> 24:19.420
I mean if you're gonna date cis women or post-op trans women, I think you owe it to

24:19.420 --> 24:21.820
them to be a little more vagina positive.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.820
Because even those straight men are like, ew, dicks, that's gay.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.980
You guys also kinda love dicks?

24:26.980 --> 24:28.260
You're always drawing them?

24:28.260 --> 24:29.940
Your buildings look like dicks?

24:29.940 --> 24:31.620
Your porn all has dicks in it?

24:31.620 --> 24:33.220
So what about dicks on chicks?

24:33.220 --> 24:37.260
Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what's the problem, officer?

24:37.260 --> 24:40.580
I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn speaks for itself.

24:40.580 --> 24:45.940
On Pornhub, the she-male category contains more videos than other such popular categories

24:45.940 --> 24:50.940
as rough sex, orgy, and webcam, and it's mostly straight men who watch it.

24:50.940 --> 24:55.620
When adultempire.com moved their T-girl content from their gay site to their straight site,

24:55.620 --> 24:56.620
views increased 50%.

24:56.620 --> 25:01.860
In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom

25:01.860 --> 25:07.260
bill, the adult site Gamelink's top-selling titles in North Carolina were My Trans Sexual

25:07.260 --> 25:12.700
Teacher, She-male shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Trans Visions 6.

25:12.700 --> 25:17.380
A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which isn't great

25:17.380 --> 25:22.860
since most T-girl porn is not trans positive and uses dehumanizing slurs like she-male

25:22.860 --> 25:26.540
and tranny, which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk

25:26.540 --> 25:29.060
off to you but won't give you rights.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.180
So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.420
She-males, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.

25:34.420 --> 25:36.340
Great, I love that for us.

25:36.340 --> 25:40.580
Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick, and

25:40.580 --> 25:41.580
you know what?

25:41.580 --> 25:42.740
That's fine.

25:42.740 --> 25:46.740
Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.

25:46.740 --> 25:47.740
You like what you like.

25:47.740 --> 25:49.620
I'm not here to police anyone's desires.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.020
In fact, quite the opposite.

25:51.020 --> 25:56.300
I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society's cruel and unjust prejudice

25:56.300 --> 25:58.140
against their T-girl-loving ways.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.540
But liberation begins with understanding.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.820
So who are the men who love trans girls?

26:02.820 --> 26:06.900
Well, according to trans women I've talked to in my own personal experience, the men

26:06.900 --> 26:10.140
who date us can be divided into three general groups.

26:10.140 --> 26:15.340
Group 1 are men who, to be honest, are actually kind of put off by the dick, but they're

26:15.340 --> 26:19.540
so attracted to the woman it's attached to that they're willing to work around it or

26:19.540 --> 26:22.220
wait for it to grow on them.

26:23.180 --> 26:27.540
Group 2 are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don't

26:27.540 --> 26:32.260
specifically fetishize the penis, so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover had genital

26:32.260 --> 26:34.020
reassignment and got a vagina.

26:34.020 --> 26:38.740
And then Group 3 are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want

26:38.740 --> 26:41.260
to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.

26:41.260 --> 26:44.500
Now Group 3 are what the trans community calls chasers.

26:44.500 --> 26:49.180
Dating chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing

26:49.180 --> 26:53.300
our genitals, which is often the part of us that we're most uncomfortable with.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.340
So if you're a T-girl who likes men, Group 2 is really Goldilocks perfection unless

26:57.340 --> 26:59.780
you really like topping or you've had the surgery.

26:59.780 --> 27:04.100
Now I should say that Group 2 does include some bisexual men, and bisexual people of

27:04.100 --> 27:06.740
either gender can be great partners if you're trans.

27:06.740 --> 27:09.860
You like girls, you like dick, I'm a girl with a dick.

27:09.860 --> 27:10.860
Let's make this happen.

27:10.860 --> 27:14.820
That said, if someone views that part of me as male and wants me to do with it what men

27:14.820 --> 27:16.580
do with it, then pass.

27:16.580 --> 27:17.580
Not interested.

27:17.740 --> 27:22.460
You might be wondering, what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?

27:22.460 --> 27:24.540
How could I view it as anything other than a male part?

27:24.540 --> 27:25.780
It's a fucking penis!

27:25.780 --> 27:27.420
Well, I'm glad you asked.

27:27.420 --> 27:32.900
I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.

27:32.900 --> 27:35.940
You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.

27:35.940 --> 27:38.620
Context, usage, and physiology.

27:38.620 --> 27:42.980
So first, context, picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.

27:42.980 --> 27:44.940
Now picture her with a penis.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.900
That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.740
It's feminine because of the context that it's in.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.260
Second, usage.

27:52.260 --> 27:54.420
A lesson in penis etiquette.

27:54.420 --> 27:57.900
A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.

27:57.900 --> 28:02.260
He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get

28:02.260 --> 28:06.380
on your knees like a good girl and f***.

28:06.380 --> 28:13.780
Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes

28:13.780 --> 28:14.780
her penis.

28:14.780 --> 28:19.620
When she rises from the bath, she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when

28:19.620 --> 28:23.260
not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.

28:23.260 --> 28:26.260
Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.

28:26.260 --> 28:30.860
The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.

28:30.860 --> 28:34.700
This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character.

28:34.700 --> 28:41.500
Next, you want to take not one but two pairs of cotton-lined polyspandex bikini-cut panties

28:41.500 --> 28:46.020
at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs.

28:46.020 --> 28:49.900
Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.

28:49.900 --> 28:53.500
You're going to take your claw, and you're going to grab your scrotum, and you're going

28:53.500 --> 28:56.380
to yank that bubblegum back into your page crease.

28:56.380 --> 29:01.220
Now hold it back with one hand, and with your other hand, push your penis back, pressing

29:01.220 --> 29:03.900
those little legs up into your pelvis.

29:03.900 --> 29:08.060
Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place, and then pull your panties up.

29:08.060 --> 29:12.580
Down first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing's seeping out the

29:12.580 --> 29:16.860
sides, and then voila, it's like it was never there.

29:16.860 --> 29:21.060
For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new forward

29:21.060 --> 29:22.900
by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

29:22.900 --> 29:27.300
I've now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us

29:27.300 --> 29:29.140
now turn to physiology.

29:29.140 --> 29:33.340
Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and

29:33.340 --> 29:37.660
functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down, and softening everything

29:37.660 --> 29:38.660
up.

29:38.660 --> 29:43.260
That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something

29:43.260 --> 29:48.020
I've been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,

29:48.020 --> 29:53.540
really get people talking about seven, the mouthfeel.

29:53.540 --> 30:01.180
Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Wynn.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.340
You're tasting specialists.

30:03.340 --> 30:12.500
I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex, girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,

30:12.500 --> 30:16.820
and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.

30:16.820 --> 30:20.900
But today, we amuse the palette with the feminine penis.

30:20.900 --> 30:26.860
Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine

30:26.860 --> 30:35.300
penis, and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami.

30:35.300 --> 30:40.860
With respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the

30:40.860 --> 30:44.380
masculine penis, and does not become as turgid.

30:44.380 --> 30:51.820
And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes

30:51.820 --> 30:57.860
of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.

30:57.860 --> 31:06.020
It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.

31:06.020 --> 31:09.020
Cheers.

31:09.020 --> 31:15.140
8.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.260
Being straight is pretty gay.

31:17.260 --> 31:21.860
We've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,

31:21.860 --> 31:26.980
you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with

31:26.980 --> 31:29.180
a trans woman is sex with a woman.

31:29.180 --> 31:33.860
Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.

31:33.860 --> 31:37.980
Sexuality is complicated, and while it's undeniable that many straight men are attracted

31:37.980 --> 31:43.580
to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men are also attracted to

31:43.580 --> 31:45.300
male cross-stressors.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.300
Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super-womanly either,

31:49.300 --> 31:53.300
like fully Dr. Frankenfurter, and that's why I'm so iconic.

31:53.300 --> 31:58.340
I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter

31:58.340 --> 32:02.020
to a very real, very biological drag queen.

32:02.020 --> 32:07.900
But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got semi-regular messages from men

32:07.900 --> 32:13.340
being like, so I'm a straight man, but I'm like really attracted to you when you dress

32:13.340 --> 32:17.620
as a woman, and it's really making me question my sexuality.

32:17.620 --> 32:21.580
Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men

32:21.580 --> 32:26.420
just picked up a my inherently womanly female energy essence that I've always had since

32:26.420 --> 32:31.460
I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-stressing baby.

32:31.460 --> 32:35.460
But let's be real, there are straight men who fuck cross-stressors, there are straight

32:35.460 --> 32:41.140
men who fuck drag queens, there are straight identifying men, who fuck other straight identifying

32:41.140 --> 32:42.140
men.

32:42.140 --> 32:43.140
What is going on here?

32:43.140 --> 32:44.140
Man, what is your deal?

32:44.140 --> 32:45.140
Who are you?

32:45.140 --> 32:46.140
What is your life?

32:46.140 --> 32:47.140
How did she become straight?

32:47.140 --> 32:48.140
Did they recruit you?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.140
Were you groomed?

32:49.140 --> 32:50.980
I blame the parents.

32:50.980 --> 32:54.380
Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call Is This Gay?

32:54.380 --> 32:59.380
The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that there's sex acts between people

32:59.380 --> 33:00.380
of the same gender.

33:00.380 --> 33:04.820
But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's

33:04.820 --> 33:08.660
gay, or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.

33:08.660 --> 33:13.500
To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman leave sucking Adam's nipples,

33:13.500 --> 33:16.020
and according to these men, it's totally gay.

33:16.020 --> 33:21.180
What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a

33:21.180 --> 33:22.180
man and a woman.

33:22.180 --> 33:26.540
It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who

33:26.540 --> 33:28.380
are playing the correct roles.

33:28.380 --> 33:32.640
So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according

33:32.640 --> 33:37.060
to this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight.

33:37.060 --> 33:41.420
Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.

33:41.420 --> 33:46.540
For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary

33:46.540 --> 33:51.580
twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.

33:51.580 --> 33:54.900
I mean, to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.

33:54.900 --> 33:55.900
Now I'm a cheerleader.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.820
D-I-C-T-R-O-Y, don't tell the coach I was a guy.

33:59.820 --> 34:04.460
This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me

34:04.460 --> 34:09.300
of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.

34:09.300 --> 34:13.240
Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must

34:13.240 --> 34:17.900
be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck

34:17.900 --> 34:21.680
and what you can eat, so for example, religious dietary laws.

34:21.680 --> 34:27.640
I think this hypermasculine heteroman code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of

34:27.640 --> 34:32.900
kosher law governing straightness, and the is-this-gay game is its theology.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.980
Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by,

34:36.980 --> 34:39.300
of all people, Count D'Ancula.

34:39.300 --> 34:44.660
If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're

34:44.660 --> 34:47.420
touching a dick, and that's gay.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.340
Well-memed, my lord, well-memed.

34:50.340 --> 34:54.620
The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when D'Ancula concludes that since

34:54.620 --> 35:00.300
a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore

35:00.300 --> 35:04.300
having sex with a woman is pretty gay.

35:04.300 --> 35:09.220
Obviously this is shitposting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps are gay

35:09.220 --> 35:10.820
because chromosomes.

35:10.820 --> 35:15.140
So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.

35:15.140 --> 35:17.300
So what is being gay?

35:17.300 --> 35:18.300
Socrates.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.300
Mmm.

35:19.300 --> 35:22.300
On second thought, I don't know her.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.300
9.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.580
Being gay is good actually.

35:25.580 --> 35:29.060
Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's

35:29.060 --> 35:32.540
good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the

35:32.540 --> 35:33.540
first place?

35:33.540 --> 35:36.820
Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?

35:36.820 --> 35:41.660
It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with

35:41.660 --> 35:45.420
manhood and they defend their manhood at all costs.

35:45.420 --> 35:49.780
Now men, this might be difficult to hear and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,

35:49.780 --> 35:54.380
but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting

35:54.380 --> 35:56.860
trans women, and it's hurting gay people.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.500
For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.

35:59.500 --> 36:03.780
Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even

36:03.780 --> 36:05.580
enjoy his own body?

36:05.580 --> 36:08.380
Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.820
Being pegged does not make you gay.

36:10.820 --> 36:15.260
Sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.260
And why?

36:16.260 --> 36:21.540
Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is

36:21.540 --> 36:24.740
persistently attracted to people of the same gender.

36:24.740 --> 36:28.500
If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with

36:28.500 --> 36:30.860
the word gay, then you're gay.

36:30.860 --> 36:34.580
If not, then you're not, and nothing you can do will change that.

36:34.580 --> 36:38.820
So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is

36:38.820 --> 36:39.820
good actually.

36:39.820 --> 36:43.500
I mean why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?

36:43.500 --> 36:49.660
Now I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense, we the gays, but as

36:49.660 --> 36:55.460
a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight men

36:55.460 --> 36:59.260
are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.

36:59.260 --> 37:03.780
But that is not a wound I'm going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me

37:03.780 --> 37:07.860
to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.

37:07.860 --> 37:08.860
Are traps gay?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.740
Baby, who cares?

37:10.740 --> 37:12.700
Just so it feels good.

37:12.700 --> 37:16.940
That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say traps are gay but there's

37:16.940 --> 37:21.580
nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men

37:21.580 --> 37:27.220
and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact

37:27.220 --> 37:28.860
most attracted to us.

37:28.860 --> 37:32.860
Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.

37:32.860 --> 37:37.340
And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted

37:37.340 --> 37:39.940
to us are willing to openly date us.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.980
And the stigma is very real.

37:41.980 --> 37:47.020
A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.

37:47.020 --> 37:51.620
Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they

37:51.620 --> 37:57.180
experience in short a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.

37:57.180 --> 38:02.700
But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices

38:02.700 --> 38:03.940
control his life.

38:03.940 --> 38:09.820
A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.

38:09.900 --> 38:15.980
A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.

38:15.980 --> 38:23.780
And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a

38:23.780 --> 38:25.420
man than you.

38:34.300 --> 38:35.100
10.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.940
I have feelings too.

38:37.260 --> 38:43.620
Well, I guess today we learned that our trap's gay is not a debate worth winning, because

38:43.620 --> 38:48.780
just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the

38:48.780 --> 38:51.180
bigoted assumptions it relies on.

38:51.180 --> 38:55.460
Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is

38:55.460 --> 38:57.820
deserved, hashtag not all gamers.

38:57.820 --> 39:02.060
But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.

39:02.060 --> 39:07.060
And I have feelings too, god damn it, and some of those feelings are not all that different

39:07.060 --> 39:09.300
from the anxieties men have.

39:09.300 --> 39:12.020
Let me explain.

39:12.020 --> 39:13.020
Let me explain.

39:13.020 --> 39:17.940
So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology

39:17.940 --> 39:19.900
for a confused slutbag.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.580
Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lispicious and lesbianical

39:24.580 --> 39:29.780
feelings, but early on in my transition, I encountered a lot of turf shit, and it really

39:29.780 --> 39:32.660
scared me off dating cis lesbians, which I never have.

39:32.660 --> 39:36.700
Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back

39:36.700 --> 39:42.500
of my head for a long time, but about a year ago I was like, I want to fuck men.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.220
I want to fuck men.

39:44.220 --> 39:48.260
But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.

39:48.260 --> 39:52.460
Because men are scary, and in my early transition I'd only dated bisexual trans people and

39:52.460 --> 39:56.740
enbies, and as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.

39:56.740 --> 40:00.020
A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.

40:00.020 --> 40:03.620
That teaches you something about gender, it might be hard to learn otherwise.

40:03.620 --> 40:09.580
And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real

40:09.580 --> 40:15.340
woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as the radiant model

40:15.340 --> 40:19.300
of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.

40:19.300 --> 40:23.660
And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing

40:23.660 --> 40:24.660
out.

40:24.660 --> 40:28.140
What I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group

40:28.140 --> 40:32.140
of people to date when you're early in transition, because they're pretty chill about anatomy

40:32.140 --> 40:33.140
and presentation.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.940
But if you're going to date cis-head men, you need to be serving women.

40:36.940 --> 40:41.140
And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt, and I did wonder if I was woman enough

40:41.140 --> 40:42.140
for it.

40:42.140 --> 40:46.020
So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is

40:46.020 --> 40:48.260
he going to think I'm a man?

40:48.260 --> 40:52.500
Basically my anxiety was our crap's gay, but what I ended up doing is just working up

40:52.500 --> 40:53.500
to things gradually.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.940
And of course, you start by sucking dick.

40:55.940 --> 41:01.220
That's very safe, because like, what red-blooded man is going to turn down a T-girl blowjob?

41:01.220 --> 41:03.420
And it doesn't involve my junk in any way.

41:03.420 --> 41:07.740
Then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned

41:07.740 --> 41:12.540
we'd been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between

41:12.540 --> 41:16.540
a man and a woman, like, that shit is super hot.

41:16.540 --> 41:20.380
Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on

41:20.620 --> 41:25.100
me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man, what if

41:25.100 --> 41:26.100
he's repulsed?

41:26.100 --> 41:29.500
Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.340
The answer is yes.

41:31.340 --> 41:33.660
It was so hot.

41:33.660 --> 41:38.460
I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would

41:38.460 --> 41:40.460
just say it's special.

41:40.460 --> 41:43.340
10 out of 10.

41:43.340 --> 41:44.780
And you know what he told me after?

41:44.780 --> 41:48.780
He told me he liked the mouth feel.

41:48.780 --> 41:51.340
Women's talking about it now, bitches.

41:51.340 --> 41:56.540
So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,

41:56.540 --> 42:01.420
because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction, but I do want to shame men for

42:01.420 --> 42:06.540
treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets, and I do want to shame men for dehumanizing

42:06.540 --> 42:10.980
us and voting away our rights by day while jerking off to she-mail porn by night, and

42:10.980 --> 42:15.500
I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong enough

42:15.500 --> 42:20.300
to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every

42:20.300 --> 42:25.260
moment of every day, and I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends

42:25.260 --> 42:29.580
because they couldn't stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.180
That is pathetic.

42:31.180 --> 42:35.500
If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up

42:35.500 --> 42:38.820
for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.

42:38.820 --> 42:41.940
So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.

42:41.940 --> 42:43.780
Don't call human beings traps.

42:43.780 --> 42:46.700
If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.

42:46.700 --> 42:50.620
It's okay, you can date us, we're more than just jack off material.

42:50.620 --> 42:54.220
If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.

42:54.220 --> 42:58.100
If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because god knows she's been through

42:58.100 --> 43:03.660
enough shit, and finally, protect trans women of color at all costs.

43:03.660 --> 43:08.860
All you want here is basic human decency, is that really too much to ask?

43:08.860 --> 43:13.060
Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.

43:14.780 --> 43:16.220
God damn it.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.700
Well, that was long.

43:26.700 --> 43:34.220
I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful

43:34.220 --> 43:35.580
woman's penis.

43:44.780 --> 43:54.460
You must think that you're so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware

43:54.460 --> 44:00.460
of how cruel, hurt, before, bigoted and plain rude.

44:00.460 --> 44:04.060
All the things that you say come up every day.

44:04.060 --> 44:11.060
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.

44:11.060 --> 44:18.060
It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.

44:32.060 --> 44:39.060
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.

44:40.060 --> 44:47.060
It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.

44:48.060 --> 44:51.060
Don't let them define us.
