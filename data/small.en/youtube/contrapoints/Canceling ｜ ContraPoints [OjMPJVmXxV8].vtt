00:00.000 --> 00:20.640
Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help! Alright, I'm gonna

00:20.640 --> 00:41.080
apply the lesbian solution. Okay. Let's get started. I love my king. This is not really

00:41.080 --> 00:46.880
the most feminine moment for me, not really my 2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my

00:46.880 --> 00:53.680
giant man hands. All right. No one thinks I'm cute. Let's get started. Okay. Look, this video

00:53.680 --> 00:59.800
is about canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call it out culture. And I know

00:59.800 --> 01:05.280
you kids know all about this, but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow

01:05.280 --> 01:11.760
boomers. So listen up oldies. In the lingo of these young avocado guzzling smartphone addicts

01:11.760 --> 01:18.720
who killed Applebee's canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent members

01:18.720 --> 01:24.000
of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word

01:24.000 --> 01:31.120
canceling started out on black Twitter, where a few years ago, people, well, mostly women would

01:31.120 --> 01:35.880
tweet cancel R Kelly and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante strategy

01:35.880 --> 01:41.280
for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been immune to any

01:41.280 --> 01:46.320
consequences for their actions. For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media

01:46.320 --> 01:52.000
shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power who couldn't be held accountable any other way.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.120
The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none and bring

01:57.120 --> 02:02.800
justice to prominent abusers. It's in a way the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer

02:02.800 --> 02:08.720
of justice, the people's avenger, but also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment

02:08.720 --> 02:15.440
spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a reign of terror

02:15.440 --> 02:19.840
situation on our hands gorge. Now there's a version of this conversation that's already been

02:19.840 --> 02:24.400
had to death and it goes like this. On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly

02:24.400 --> 02:28.960
bitch about how cancel culture is out of control. You can't joke about anything anymore without

02:28.960 --> 02:33.440
these millennial jockels trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive

02:33.440 --> 02:38.560
think piece authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture. It's just that powerful

02:38.560 --> 02:42.480
people are finally being held accountable for their actions and they can't fucking handle it.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.120
So they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now, unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints

02:47.120 --> 02:52.960
is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.200
He didn't know I was transgender. Story time, emotional, not clickbait. Let's start with an

02:57.200 --> 03:02.640
example. The most high profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles. And

03:02.640 --> 03:08.240
again, I know you kids remember this, but I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders.

03:08.240 --> 03:15.760
Put the kettle on Karen. So James Charles is a 20 year old beauty guru, which means boomers.

03:15.760 --> 03:22.400
Look, there's these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup. It's worth

03:22.400 --> 03:27.120
checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer. I certainly can't. It's

03:27.120 --> 03:33.680
pretty bomb. It's lit. It's, uh, it's groovy. It's fab. It's far out, man. It's a gas. I fully dig it.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.320
Free love. Give peace of chance. Nixon's a fascist. So back in May of this year, James's

03:38.320 --> 03:47.280
colleague and mother figure, fellow YouTube beauty guru, Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40 minute video

03:47.280 --> 03:55.280
accusing James of endorsing a different brand of hair vitamins than the brand that she, wait,

03:55.280 --> 04:00.800
that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins. An enthralling plot line, I know.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.680
And this was huge. This was covered in the New York Times. And while Tati was added almost as

04:05.680 --> 04:14.560
an afterthought to the hair vitamin dispute, she also accused James of being a sexual predator.

04:14.560 --> 04:20.800
Now I actually went back and checked Tati's original deleted video and she actually never

04:20.800 --> 04:25.520
uses the phrase sexual predator. It's funny. I remember her calling him that because that

04:25.520 --> 04:31.600
became the story on Twitter. But what she actually said was James had to try to trick

04:31.600 --> 04:37.520
straight men into thinking they're gay. Oh my God, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking

04:37.520 --> 04:44.400
he's gay yet again, which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator. But see,

04:44.400 --> 04:50.320
this is what cancel culture does. It takes one story and transforms it into a significantly

04:50.320 --> 04:55.280
different story. You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read

04:55.520 --> 05:02.400
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they're gay,

05:02.400 --> 05:10.160
but cancel culture transforms that story into the headline James Charles is a sexual predator.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.280
Interesting. Now I want to make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James

05:15.280 --> 05:21.200
Charles. I'm not a James Charles stan. I'm a biological female in my thirties. Close to death

05:21.200 --> 05:27.760
I know. Please leave a comment before I die. That said, I do think the statement James Charles is a

05:27.760 --> 05:33.600
sexual predator is a stretch to say the least, at least based on the information I have in December

05:33.600 --> 05:38.960
2019. So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens. Cancel culture trope one,

05:38.960 --> 05:43.200
and you should be writing this down in class because this will be on the test. Cancel culture

05:43.200 --> 05:48.640
trope one, presumption of guilt. There's a traditional understanding of justice according

05:48.640 --> 05:54.640
to which before you condemn or punish a person, you hear the accuser's side of the story and the

05:54.640 --> 06:00.560
accused side of the story. You allow both sides to present evidence and only after everyone involved

06:00.560 --> 06:06.560
has had a chance to make their case, do you pass sentence and punish the convict? Oh, punish me,

06:06.560 --> 06:12.000
King. I'm drinking this as punishment enough. Am I uncancelled yet, please? Now in the United States

06:12.000 --> 06:19.280
of we legally have the presumption of innocence, but canceling does not abide by the law. Cancelling

06:19.280 --> 06:25.440
is a form of vigilante mob justice and a lot of times an accusation is proof enough. Now that's

06:25.440 --> 06:31.600
basically the point of the progressive slogan believe victims. It's a norm that was put into

06:31.600 --> 06:37.040
place in progressive spaces because out in the world at large people generally don't believe

06:37.040 --> 06:42.880
victims, but I think it's pretty obvious how believe victims is a norm that's easy to abuse.

06:42.880 --> 06:50.320
Was Tati really James's victim? No, she's not some powerless woman abused by a prominent man in her

06:50.320 --> 06:56.560
industry. She's on top of the industry and she wasn't victimized by James at all. I see this case

06:56.560 --> 07:01.920
more as she weaponized cancel culture against a business rival. Anyway, before James had even had

07:01.920 --> 07:07.920
a chance to respond to Tati's accusation, the story had already gone from Tati Westbrook accuses

07:07.920 --> 07:14.080
James Charles of trying to trick straight men to James Charles tried to trick straight men. And

07:14.080 --> 07:20.320
from there it was generalized into James Charles is toxic and manipulative, which brings us to

07:20.320 --> 07:28.160
cancel culture trope two, abstraction. Abstraction replaces the specific concrete details of a claim

07:28.160 --> 07:33.520
with a more generic statement. In the transition from Tati Westbrook accused James Charles of

07:33.520 --> 07:39.520
trying to trick straight men to James Charles is toxic and manipulative. We've lost not only the

07:39.520 --> 07:45.680
sense of this being an unverified accusation, but we've also lost all the specific details.

07:45.680 --> 07:50.880
James Charles is toxic and manipulative is an incredibly vague statement and may as well be

07:50.880 --> 07:55.920
James Charles is bad. But even without the presumption of guilt, if someone tells me

07:55.920 --> 08:00.720
James Charles is accused of toxic and manipulative behavior, I'm going to think, oh,

08:00.720 --> 08:05.520
that sounds pretty bad. And I'm going to start speculating about the specifics and whatever my

08:05.520 --> 08:10.800
imagination comes up with is likely going to be worse than whatever he's actually accused of.

08:10.800 --> 08:16.720
Also, the specific accusation that he tried to trick straight men into thinking they're gay

08:16.720 --> 08:22.720
is self-evidently kind of questionable. How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?

08:22.720 --> 08:29.040
If you find out, let me know. It's bad. I'm bad. I'm super bad. This is not a problem that straight

08:29.040 --> 08:34.160
men usually seem to have. At the very least, it requires further explanation. It's the kind of

08:34.160 --> 08:38.320
story that sounds like it has more than one side. So I'm immediately going to feel a little bit

08:38.320 --> 08:45.200
skeptical of the accusation. And I'm also going to side-eye Tati Westbrook because this accusation

08:45.200 --> 08:51.840
is setting off my homophobia detection alarm. Leave the gays alone. But I'm not going to have

08:51.840 --> 08:56.800
an opportunity to pick up on the potential homophobia and be skeptical of it if all I've

08:56.800 --> 09:02.880
heard about the situation is James Charles' toxic and manipulative. And I also want to point out a

09:02.880 --> 09:08.080
linguistic shift that's happening here. When the claim was James Charles tried to trick straight

09:08.080 --> 09:14.400
men, the verbs in the sentence were try and trick. So what we're criticizing here is James' behavior.

09:14.400 --> 09:20.080
We're criticizing things he did, allegedly, trying to trick straight men. But once the claim morphs

09:20.080 --> 09:27.040
into James Charles' is toxic and manipulative, the verb in the sentence is is to be. So these

09:27.040 --> 09:32.000
adjectives are characteristics of James. And it's now not his actions we're criticizing, but his

09:32.000 --> 09:39.040
personality, his toxicity, his manipulativeness. This is what I'll call cancel culture trope three,

09:39.040 --> 09:44.560
essentialism. Essentialism is when we go from criticizing a person's actions to criticizing

09:44.560 --> 09:49.920
the person themselves. We're not just saying they did bad things. We're saying they're a bad

09:49.920 --> 09:55.440
person. And that's what takes us from James Charles tried to trick straight men to James

09:55.440 --> 10:02.240
Charles is a sexual predator. So here we're targeting James himself, not just his actions,

10:02.240 --> 10:09.680
but the type of person he is a sexual predator. And we've also really escalated the accusation,

10:09.680 --> 10:14.240
because I don't know about you guys. But when I hear the phrase sexual predator, the image that

10:14.240 --> 10:21.280
comes to mind is a rapist or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss, not a teenage twink hung

10:21.280 --> 10:25.520
up on wanting to date straight guys. I mean, not that a person like that couldn't be a sexual

10:25.520 --> 10:32.240
predator. But I really don't think that he's a sexual predator is a fair summary of the accusation.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.720
So this seems to me like a pretty nasty and dishonest twisting of the story. And it happened

10:36.720 --> 10:42.320
instantaneously on Twitter. It totally dominated the conversation in a community of millions of

10:42.320 --> 10:48.240
people for weeks. In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers. And who knows what effect

10:48.240 --> 10:54.640
it had on his personal life? Not that anyone seems to care. In fact, most people seems to be enjoying

10:54.640 --> 11:01.440
his downfall. He was a teenage millionaire, a young, beautiful superstar, easy to envy, easy to resent,

11:01.440 --> 11:06.800
hard to relate to hard to sympathize with. What was the point of canceling James Charles? Did we

11:06.800 --> 11:11.520
want to teach him a lesson? Did we want him to learn from his mistakes and grow as a person?

11:12.560 --> 11:16.000
Imagine actually wanting someone to learn. Imagine actually caring.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.160
My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer was not sincerely outraged and hurt by their sincere

11:22.160 --> 11:27.200
belief that James Charles was a sexual predator. In other words, this was not a case of triggered

11:27.200 --> 11:33.520
SJWs. This was a controversy manufactured from the top by a handful of seemingly vindictive

11:33.520 --> 11:38.480
and envious people. I honestly think that most of the James Charles as a sexual predator crowd

11:39.200 --> 11:45.600
just wanted to bring him down a peg. Cancel culture trope four, pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.040
If you look at the world we live in, would you say that people are usually motivated by a sense

11:51.040 --> 11:58.160
of moral integrity and intellectual rigor? No, maybe not. Let's be real, America. We are a

11:58.160 --> 12:04.480
bunch of morally impotent meatbags constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust. For

12:04.480 --> 12:11.200
Tati calling out James, this was really, it was about the hair of vitamins, right? I think Sis

12:11.200 --> 12:17.280
was super salty that this millionaire kid who she had supported and helped had betrayed her by

12:17.280 --> 12:23.200
endorsing a rival brand. And accusing him of trying to trick straight men was just a twist of

12:23.200 --> 12:29.840
the knife. But moralism or intellectualism provide a phony pretext for the call out. You can pretend

12:29.840 --> 12:34.720
you just want an apology. You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen who wants the person to

12:34.720 --> 12:39.440
improve. You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism when what you're really doing is

12:39.440 --> 12:44.880
attacking a person's career and reputation out of spite, envy, revenge. I mean, it could be any

12:44.880 --> 12:51.440
motivation. Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged, spoiled little brat and it was fun to wipe the

12:51.440 --> 12:57.600
smile off his smug face at least for a few weeks. It's schadenfreude, right? This kind of petty

12:57.600 --> 13:02.720
sadism. Maybe not the internet's proudest moment, but not the most shameful either. And it's not to

13:02.720 --> 13:08.080
say that everyone canceling James Charles was insincere, but there's a world of difference

13:08.080 --> 13:14.880
between cancel R. Kelly and cancel James Charles. And I'm interested to know how these two things

13:14.880 --> 13:19.760
came to look the same. When James was being cancelled, I remember being kind of transfixed

13:19.760 --> 13:26.560
by the sight of his life and career falling from the sky, full tailspin, black smokes spewing out,

13:26.560 --> 13:30.240
and a lot of my YouTube friends were like, lol, did you see James Charles is cancelled?

13:31.680 --> 13:37.680
But I looked up at James and I said, oh god, that's gonna be me someday.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.280
Stay strong, sister. Don't let the bastards get you down.

13:43.920 --> 13:48.400
Let's switch over to white cloth. These are cute. These are fun. A little more of a feminine moment

13:48.400 --> 13:53.840
for me. They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic. I'm not even wearing makeup.

13:53.840 --> 14:01.520
I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy. Keep drinking people. We're gonna make

14:01.520 --> 14:05.440
it through this together. So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology when I was looking into the

14:05.440 --> 14:12.000
James Charles canceling. And I found a bunch of tweets referencing earlier James Charles scandals.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.720
Y'all forgiving James Charles. He's still a transphobe. Y'all are acting like just because

14:16.720 --> 14:22.880
James Charles has receipts. He's no longer a racist transphobe like James Charles is racist,

14:22.880 --> 14:28.800
ableist, transphobic, and a sexual predator. A white woman. Y'all are being too harsh on him

14:28.800 --> 14:34.400
and he's uncancelled. So according to Twitter, James Charles is not only a sexual predator,

14:34.400 --> 14:41.600
he's also a racist and a transphobe. That sounds pretty serious. Let's investigate.

14:41.600 --> 14:46.400
We'll start with the transphobia allocation. Kakaros of the jury, exhibit A.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.760
So you're not even full gay. I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I felt were

14:49.760 --> 14:53.840
really, really beautiful. There's also been like trans guys in the past too that I was like really,

14:53.840 --> 14:59.600
really into for a moment in time. And I oop. As I say on Twitter, yikes. This ain't a cheap,

14:59.600 --> 15:05.920
friendly reminder that this isn't a good look. Maybe don't be transphobic. Disappointing.

15:05.920 --> 15:12.480
So James did fuck up here. The problem is he's suggesting that being attracted to trans men

15:12.480 --> 15:18.720
makes him less gay, which implies that trans men aren't really men, which is at odds with the way

15:18.720 --> 15:23.760
trans men understand themselves. So this does deserve criticism. No doubt, no doubt. However,

15:24.320 --> 15:31.040
what I see when I look at this clip of James is not a dyed in the wool transphobic bigot.

15:31.040 --> 15:38.320
I see a very young person who's still working on understanding his own sexuality and is trying to

15:38.320 --> 15:44.000
figure out where his attraction to trans men fits into that. And it seems to me that the proportionate

15:44.000 --> 15:51.280
response to that situation is for someone to take James aside and explain to him, look, here's why

15:51.280 --> 15:56.480
what you said is hurtful to trans men. And here are some tips on how to avoid saying that kind of

15:56.480 --> 16:02.880
thing in the future. You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred. Not understanding someone

16:02.880 --> 16:08.160
is not the same as wanting them dead. Of course, there are committed bigots who it's just a waste

16:08.160 --> 16:13.360
of time to engage with. But sometimes just talking to someone with a little patience and

16:13.360 --> 16:18.480
understanding is all it takes. But that's not what cancel culture does. Oh, no, we have to

16:18.480 --> 16:25.840
immediately escalate every situation to the highest possible level of conflict. So by abstraction,

16:25.840 --> 16:32.320
we get James Charles made transphobic comments. And by essentialism, we get James Charles is

16:32.320 --> 16:38.080
a transphobe. We don't give him a chance to reflect. We don't give him an opportunity to learn.

16:38.080 --> 16:43.280
We go straight to branding him a bigot. Nonetheless, that same week,

16:43.280 --> 16:48.560
James posted an apology to his Insta story saying, regardless of whatever my intentions were,

16:48.560 --> 16:54.000
that came across as me saying, I'm not fully gay because I have been with a trans man. And that is

16:54.000 --> 16:59.280
absolutely, first of all, not true. Like that doesn't make me not fully gay. But that stereotype

16:59.280 --> 17:05.440
and implication is really, really dangerous. And I'm very, very sorry. If you are a trans man,

17:05.440 --> 17:10.320
you are a man. If you're a trans girl, you are a woman. You are valid in your identity.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.120
Could you ask for a better apology? Like he not only apologizes for what he said,

17:15.120 --> 17:21.200
but he also demonstrates a clear understanding of why it was wrong. So does that mean people

17:21.200 --> 17:28.080
stopped calling him a transphobe? Of course not. Cancel culture, trope five, no forgiveness.

17:28.080 --> 17:33.600
Cancellors will often dismiss an apology as insincere, no matter how convincingly written

17:33.680 --> 17:40.240
or delivered. And of course, an insincere apology is further proof of what a Machiavellian psychopath

17:40.240 --> 17:46.240
you really are. Now, sometimes a good apology will calm things down for a while. But the next time

17:46.240 --> 17:52.000
there's a scandal, the original accusation will be raised again, as if you never apologized. And

17:52.000 --> 17:57.840
that's what happened to James during the Tati scandal when Twitter decided he was a transphobic

17:57.840 --> 18:03.520
sexual predator. And that's to say nothing of this racism I've been hearing about. Here are

18:03.520 --> 18:09.920
the receipts. Exhibit B. In February 2017, when James was much less famous than he is now,

18:09.920 --> 18:14.480
he tweeted, I can't believe we're going to Africa today. OMG, what if we get Ebola?

18:14.480 --> 18:20.640
James, we're fine. We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year. Okay. Well, that's a little

18:20.640 --> 18:26.160
insensitive maybe, but it's not really something an influencer should tweet. And fear of disease

18:26.160 --> 18:33.040
associated with Africa. I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area as certain

18:33.040 --> 18:40.400
racist tropes. But clearly, this was intended as a joke about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli,

18:40.400 --> 18:47.200
right? And anyway, he did apologize saying, as a white cis male, I recognize my privilege and would

18:47.200 --> 18:52.960
never want to take that for granted. But I fucked up. I feel awful for posting what I said. I

18:53.040 --> 18:57.680
understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant. And James hasn't made a habit of making

18:57.680 --> 19:04.880
jokes like that ever since. So is this one tweet from two years ago that he apologized for on its

19:04.880 --> 19:11.840
own enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist? Well, according to cancel culture,

19:11.840 --> 19:17.440
absolutely. Abstraction takes us from two years ago, James Charles made a joke that referenced

19:17.440 --> 19:23.760
his fear of getting Ebola in Africa to James Charles made a racist joke. And then essentialism

19:23.760 --> 19:39.280
takes us to James Charles is a racist. Look, I want to pause to say I really do believe in social

19:39.280 --> 19:46.080
justice, at least as much as trash like me believes in anything. And believe me, I am well aware that

19:46.080 --> 19:52.720
jokes, irony, and even complaints about cancel culture are often used by bigots to cloak their

19:52.720 --> 19:58.800
real agenda. The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video about how far right racists use

19:58.800 --> 20:04.880
jokes and memes and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs and make them

20:04.880 --> 20:10.800
more palatable to a wider audience. So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern for

20:10.800 --> 20:18.000
anti-racism and anti-transphobia, as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture is often

20:18.000 --> 20:24.080
just a conservative red herring used to shut down any and all complaints about racism or transphobia.

20:24.080 --> 20:30.880
But I've also become very disillusioned with the way these accusations are thrown around so

20:30.880 --> 20:36.400
frivolously on social media. By the way, they're used to escalate conflict instead of promote

20:36.400 --> 20:43.040
understanding. And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized to destroy people who have made

20:43.040 --> 20:49.360
mistakes, but who really don't deserve to be destroyed. Now, maybe you're thinking destroyed,

20:49.360 --> 20:54.320
what do you mean destroyed? James is a 20 year old millionaire on his way to owning his own makeup

20:54.320 --> 21:01.440
empire and you are completely correct. If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar, then being

21:01.440 --> 21:07.040
canceled most likely does not destroy you. The cancelers blend into the general backdrop of

21:07.040 --> 21:13.200
haters and they can set you back a few million subscribers and a lot of emotional turmoil,

21:13.200 --> 21:18.960
but in the long run, they can't really touch your success. But here's the thing, what if you're not

21:18.960 --> 21:24.720
James Charles? What if you're a small creator? What if you can't afford public relations help?

21:24.720 --> 21:29.280
What if you belong to a marginalized community and you rely on that community for support?

21:29.280 --> 21:32.240
Well, in that case, it's a whole different story.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.840
Let's Irish up this coffee.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.720
Shaken not stirred spilled all over my pussy.

21:47.840 --> 21:52.240
That's good. Booze and coffee is a good combination. I'm feeling amped right now. I'm

21:52.240 --> 21:56.880
feeling a hype. So this is the part in the video where I should admit that I'm not just a casual

21:56.880 --> 22:02.320
observer here. At the time I'm making this video, sweaty, I'm super canceled. You know, I try to

22:02.320 --> 22:06.320
make videos that are both informative and entertaining. So in this video, the information

22:06.320 --> 22:11.360
is you get to learn about cancel culture and the entertainment is you get to watch a worm try to

22:11.360 --> 22:16.560
wriggle off a hook. Let's get started. Forgive me father for I have sent a How are you? God,

22:16.560 --> 22:20.720
I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber who would resort to making videos about my own drama, but

22:21.840 --> 22:26.800
things have gotten to a point. I feel like I cannot continue this channel until I spill some tea.

22:26.960 --> 22:31.360
So let's get started. Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene. I've never

22:31.360 --> 22:35.680
talked about this on my channel before. So this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me. But

22:35.680 --> 22:41.280
I am in fact, a transgender woman, which may come as a big shock to many of you since I'm 100%

22:41.280 --> 22:48.640
real fash. I get comments all the time from like very solemn people like guys, I'm pretty sure

22:48.640 --> 22:52.960
this is a dude. Great work, detective. You're cracked to the case. You're doing very good,

22:52.960 --> 22:58.880
sweetie. Very, very good. But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,

22:59.440 --> 23:04.720
I am a prime target for cancellation and I have been canceled many, many times. And we're going

23:04.720 --> 23:08.160
to talk about some of the things I've been canceled for and some of the things I've been criticized

23:08.160 --> 23:12.800
for and the difference between criticism and canceling because yes, there is a difference.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.560
As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes because despite how I look,

23:16.640 --> 23:24.000
I am not a literal goddess and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due. However,

23:24.800 --> 23:30.400
where I believe that criticism of me is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize because here

23:30.400 --> 23:35.360
at ContraPoints Industries, we are not in the business of serving bullshit. So the reason

23:35.360 --> 23:42.320
for my current cancellation is, in summary, that in my last video Opulence, I cast transsexual

23:42.320 --> 23:47.280
porn star Buck Angel in the role of John Waters. And yes, it's a much better story than the hair

23:47.280 --> 23:52.400
vitamin debacle. So notify the drama channels. Put in a good word for me because, sweetie,

23:52.400 --> 23:56.560
I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. So basically I'm canceled for collaborating with Buck

23:56.560 --> 24:02.960
Angel and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel is a horrible person. And so my collaboration with

24:02.960 --> 24:09.760
Buck Angel is evidence that I too am a horrible person. Cancel culture trope six, the transitive

24:09.760 --> 24:14.960
property of cancellation. Cancellation is infectious. If you associate with a canceled

24:14.960 --> 24:20.400
person, the cancellation rubs off. It's like gonorrhea, except doxycycline won't save you

24:20.400 --> 24:25.520
this time, sweetie. Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all, on whether Buck Angel is,

24:25.520 --> 24:33.200
in fact, a horrible person. So who is Buck Angel? Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.280
He grew up in a world where there was not anything like the visibility and access to information about

24:37.280 --> 24:41.280
transition we have today and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system in place

24:41.280 --> 24:46.160
for people who wanted to transition. In fact, Buck was the first female to male patient his doctor

24:46.160 --> 24:50.640
had ever treated. In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer, his gimmick

24:50.640 --> 24:55.360
at the time being the man with a pussy. But he also became an activist. He wanted to create more

24:55.360 --> 24:59.280
positive trans representation within the porn world. And from there, he became a more general

24:59.280 --> 25:03.840
educator and advocate for trans people. I first heard about him in the early 2010s when I was

25:04.400 --> 25:08.960
doing some googling about some little gender issues I was having myself, although I ended up

25:08.960 --> 25:13.200
deciding to remain a female. And Buck was one of the first female to male people I'd ever heard

25:13.200 --> 25:17.040
about. And he made an impact on me in part because you take one look at him and you think, honey,

25:17.040 --> 25:23.280
that's a man, but he was born a woman. You can do that. So it's not like he inspired me to

25:23.280 --> 25:27.920
transition or anything. It's just, it was one of many moments along my whole entire gender journey.

25:27.920 --> 25:32.640
So I had positive feelings about Trampot, that's what he calls himself, from back then. And then a

25:32.640 --> 25:37.600
few months ago, when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised over another time I was

25:37.600 --> 25:43.200
being canceled by trans Twitter, we'll get to that one later, I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.

25:43.200 --> 25:48.480
Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain. It is okay that you lash out at me. You do this because

25:48.480 --> 25:53.280
I am you and you are reflecting yourself hate to me. I am strong and will be here for you forever

25:53.280 --> 25:58.640
and no matter what. This is my intention as a human being to help others love Buck Angel.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.360
And then the caption, suffering. That is why the trans community lashes out at each other.

26:03.360 --> 26:08.400
I am very aware of the hate towards me by some in the community. They hate on me and others because

26:08.400 --> 26:13.440
they are hurt. And those were exactly the words I needed to hear at that moment. So I commented a

26:13.440 --> 26:18.960
heart and then Buck DMed me and he said, I love you. And I was like, Sempai noticed me. And so

26:18.960 --> 26:24.320
I said, I love you back. Then when I was working on Opulence, I needed a voice actor to do a line

26:24.320 --> 26:28.960
from John Waters book. And it was my co-director Theron who suggested, don't you think Buck Angel

26:28.960 --> 26:32.720
sounds kind of like John Waters? And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta. Let's see if he

26:32.720 --> 26:38.160
wants to do it. And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel as John Waters in the video credits,

26:38.160 --> 26:45.520
like a trans icon playing a gay icon in my head. It was just so, well, iconic. So I got in touch

26:45.520 --> 26:49.920
with Buck about the line and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it. So here it is. The 10 second

26:49.920 --> 26:55.760
voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life. One must remember there is such a thing as good,

26:55.760 --> 27:02.000
bad taste and bad, bad taste. To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

27:02.960 --> 27:08.000
That's it, children. That's why mommy's canceled. Now I was aware at the time that trans Twitter

27:08.000 --> 27:13.760
hated Buck Angel, but my thinking was, well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity and

27:13.760 --> 27:18.400
they certainly hate me. So I wasn't going to let that stop me. Little did I know,

27:18.400 --> 27:22.960
quite how vicious things were about to get. Now, so far, I've been telling this story from my

27:22.960 --> 27:27.440
point of view, but I do want to give a fair and balanced account. So I want to pause and

27:27.440 --> 27:32.640
contextualize why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much they're willing to cancel anyone

27:32.640 --> 27:37.200
who even associates with him. Basically, it all goes back to this old debate in the trans community

27:37.200 --> 27:43.280
known today and Tumblr lingo as true scum versus trans trenders. So true scum are trans people who

27:43.280 --> 27:48.960
distinguish between true trans people and fake trans people who they call trenders or two cutes.

27:48.960 --> 27:53.840
Usually true scum think that what it is to be trans is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,

27:53.840 --> 27:57.840
to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery, and to socially

27:57.840 --> 28:02.720
reassimilate into your target binary gender. So male or female. Anyone who's not that,

28:02.720 --> 28:07.600
according to true scum, must either be a confused teenager, someone just trying to get attention,

28:07.600 --> 28:13.040
someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans in a word, a trender. So that's

28:13.040 --> 28:17.680
a vige of transness that usually excludes non-binary people as well as people who don't

28:17.680 --> 28:21.920
want to medically transition for whatever reason. And for that reason, this view is sometimes also

28:21.920 --> 28:26.480
called trans medicalism. True scum obviously being the derogatory term for these people.

28:26.480 --> 28:31.520
So true scum are very hated by a lot of trans people because their viewpoint is that not all

28:31.520 --> 28:36.960
trans identities are valid and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be true scum. So the next

28:36.960 --> 28:43.520
question to ask is, is this true? Is Buck Angel in fact true scum? Now my honest answer to that

28:43.520 --> 28:48.480
question is, I don't know. He's certainly said some things that sound like things true scum say,

28:48.480 --> 28:53.440
I'll give you that. A point he likes to make a lot is that he's transsexual, not transgender.

28:53.440 --> 28:58.320
And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as transsexual implies that you want to

28:58.320 --> 29:04.080
pursue medical transition. So hormones and surgery and transgender doesn't imply that. And people

29:04.080 --> 29:08.880
associate this I'm transsexual not transgender thing with true scum because true scum often

29:08.880 --> 29:14.240
call themselves transsexuals and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual isn't really trans. And

29:14.240 --> 29:18.400
often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders, especially certain trans

29:18.400 --> 29:27.520
medicalist YouTubers like Vanessa LeBlanc and Too Cute Smasher 9000. Too Cute Smasher 9000.

29:27.520 --> 29:36.160
Roast me back Calvin I dare you. But I think it's important to keep in mind that the term

29:36.160 --> 29:41.760
true scum is a product of the 2014 tumblr wars and trying to apply it to trans people of an older

29:41.760 --> 29:46.960
generation can sometimes be misleading. Like when Buck Angel transitioned the word transsexual

29:46.960 --> 29:51.760
was just the word for his identity and he still identifies that way. So when younger trans people

29:51.760 --> 29:56.240
tell him it's wrong to use the word transsexual he feels like these ungrateful millennials are

29:56.240 --> 30:00.720
invalidating his identity and I do understand where he's coming from with that. But I also

30:00.720 --> 30:05.520
understand why a lot of non binary people are skeptical about Buck. Like he says again and again

30:05.520 --> 30:10.560
I'm transsexual not transgender like don't mix me up with those people and that eagerness to

30:10.560 --> 30:16.000
separate himself from transgender people it comes across as hostility. Like I don't think he's ever

30:16.000 --> 30:21.120
actually said that non binary people aren't valid but I personally don't like that he seems like he

30:21.120 --> 30:26.080
wants to distance himself from them. And that's my disagreement with Buck it's not that he invalidates

30:26.080 --> 30:30.960
non-binary identities because I don't really see him doing that. And if he was doing that I would

30:30.960 --> 30:34.720
have seen it because for the last two months a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me

30:34.720 --> 30:39.840
problematic Buck Angel tweets. But as someone who cares a lot about non-binary people and who

30:39.840 --> 30:44.880
loves the non-binary people in my life it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.

30:44.880 --> 30:49.360
And I hope he listens to this criticism because I think it would be cool if he got better about

30:49.360 --> 30:54.000
this. Of course Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people and I

30:54.000 --> 30:57.760
agree it's important that we can make those distinctions and talk about the differences

30:57.760 --> 31:03.040
when they're relevant. But I also think that as a community trans people benefit from unity not

31:03.040 --> 31:07.280
division. Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people they're not

31:07.280 --> 31:11.920
going to care if you're transsexual transgender non-binary or gender non-conforming they're going

31:11.920 --> 31:16.080
to discriminate against you regardless. So we're all in this together and there's a lot of

31:16.080 --> 31:21.040
disagreements among us and we often don't get along so well but politically I think we should

31:21.040 --> 31:25.840
work together as much as possible instead of splitting into little factions because we share

31:25.840 --> 31:30.560
most of the same interests. And I think the best way to do that is to build bridges instead of

31:30.560 --> 31:34.640
burning them and that's why I'm willing to work with people like Buck Angel who I have some

31:34.640 --> 31:39.920
disagreements with. It creates a connection you know and having that connection can lead to

31:39.920 --> 31:44.320
communication and build understanding. Also I need all the connections I can get Gorg I am

31:44.320 --> 31:50.480
very lonely. It's not a joke it's true. Now I get that some people have views that are so

31:50.480 --> 31:55.200
harmful that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous. But in any case I didn't even give

31:55.200 --> 32:00.560
Buck a platform to share his opinions I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator. A bunch

32:00.560 --> 32:04.800
of people on my subreddit were like why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines? Well

32:04.800 --> 32:09.280
first of all I don't actually know John but I just have a feeling he would write me off as some kind

32:09.280 --> 32:15.520
of trashy millennial SJW. Like why is Buck Angel cancelled but John Waters isn't? Well because

32:15.520 --> 32:19.760
trans twitter does not know who John Waters is and let's try to keep it that way. I actually

32:19.760 --> 32:24.320
mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John and he told me that he and John have actually

32:24.320 --> 32:32.240
watched Buck Angel's porn together so plot twist. Okay so trans twitter won't forgive me unless I

32:32.240 --> 32:37.040
condemn Buck Angel as true scum and apologize for ever working with him. But I'm not going to do

32:37.040 --> 32:41.760
that because I don't think it would be the right thing to do and doing it just to get myself

32:41.760 --> 32:47.120
uncancelled would be cowardly. I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree with Buck's divisive

32:47.120 --> 32:51.680
rhetoric about transsexual versus transgender. I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender

32:51.680 --> 32:55.520
umbrella instead of trying to distance himself from the rest. And I'm happy to hear at the

32:55.520 --> 32:59.520
perspective of non-binary people who don't trust him because I totally get where they're coming

32:59.520 --> 33:05.520
from and I think that's valid. But I also respect the decades of good activism Buck Angel has done

33:05.520 --> 33:10.400
for trans people and I am grateful to him for that. And in light of that I'm willing to give

33:10.400 --> 33:15.600
him the benefit of the doubt about where his heart is and express my criticism in a more measured way

33:15.600 --> 33:21.200
than just attacking who he is as a person. But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible

33:21.200 --> 33:27.280
person because this is the strategy they've chosen to establish that I am a horrible person.

33:27.280 --> 33:31.200
And if the true scum allegation isn't strong enough to prove it, oh they have other pieces

33:31.200 --> 33:36.800
of evidence to fall back on to hold up their conclusion. For example, here's a tweet claiming,

33:36.800 --> 33:41.600
Natalie is trying so fucking hard to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did

33:41.600 --> 33:47.040
was write a few iffy tweets and that's just so fucking far from the truth. Dude launched a

33:47.040 --> 33:52.640
targeted tabloid harassment campaign outing a trans woman against her will with a specific intent

33:52.640 --> 33:57.280
of causing her physical, emotional, and professional harm. The shorter way of saying that is that he

33:57.280 --> 34:03.280
wanted to make her suffer and she very well could have been killed. Yikes. This ain't it chief.

34:03.280 --> 34:08.480
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look. Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.

34:08.480 --> 34:13.840
Disappointing. It sounds pretty serious. Let's investigate. Here's what I've managed to piece

34:13.840 --> 34:19.440
together. Scene 1. The year is 2003. Los Angeles, where the movie world, the porn world, and the

34:19.440 --> 34:26.000
BDSM scene come together in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal, and transsexualism. La La Land. Dramatas

34:26.000 --> 34:32.880
Persanay. Buck Angel, transsexual porn star. Ilse Strix, dominatrix, then wife of Buck Angel.

34:32.880 --> 34:38.000
Lana Wieczowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix, at the time not yet out as a

34:38.000 --> 34:44.080
transgender woman. The synopsis is that Ilse Strix and Buck Angel's marriage ended after Ilse had an

34:44.080 --> 34:48.960
affair with Lana Wieczowski, who was not yet out as trans. So Buck was understandably upset about

34:48.960 --> 34:54.160
the affair and in what seems like a petty act of revenge told a series of magazines that this

34:54.160 --> 35:00.400
celebrity director Wieczowski was a cross-dresser who had stolen his wife, which I guess was the

35:00.400 --> 35:06.560
information he had at the time. So is that outing a trans woman against her will? Well in retrospect

35:06.560 --> 35:11.120
it seems like it, though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time. But to really

35:11.120 --> 35:15.120
get to the bottom of this, we have to do some digging. We have to trawl through the dirty

35:15.120 --> 35:19.760
details of trans people's personal histories, which I've noticed is one of the internet's favorite

35:19.760 --> 35:27.200
activities. So I actually went on eBay and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991 January 2006

35:27.200 --> 35:35.600
and I'm finally able to reveal that the seller cancelled the order. God damn it.

35:35.600 --> 35:40.800
But I was finally able to track down and translate a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article

35:40.800 --> 35:48.240
from the Wayback Machine and I'm finally able to expose the truth. Stop. Freeze exactly where you

35:48.240 --> 35:53.280
are. Take a look at yourself and what all of us have been doing for the last 30 seconds. Who does

35:53.280 --> 35:59.120
this behavior remind you of? If your answer is social justice advocates fighting for trans equality,

35:59.120 --> 36:03.280
you are incorrect. If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people,

36:04.000 --> 36:10.960
I am very suspicious of anyone whose online behavior prompts me to dig through articles

36:10.960 --> 36:16.080
full of dead names and sorted scandals involving trans people from almost two decades ago. This is

36:16.080 --> 36:21.360
very similar to techniques used against trans people by internet fascists. So I'm pretty

36:21.360 --> 36:25.680
suspicious of anyone pushing this kind of investigation. How can you tell the difference

36:25.680 --> 36:31.040
between a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar and a Nazi pretending to be a trans

36:31.040 --> 36:37.520
anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar? Well, you can't. Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,

36:37.520 --> 36:43.120
whether it's on 4chan or Twitter. So unless Buck Angel, Ilse Strix, or Lana Wachowski gets in touch

36:43.120 --> 36:49.200
with me and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason they want me to publicly dig up their 17

36:49.200 --> 36:55.600
year old divorce drama, this is none of my fucking business. And it's none of yours either. So shut

36:55.600 --> 37:06.080
up and go back to Keeley Farms where you belong. Let's Irish up this tea.

37:10.320 --> 37:17.600
Doesn't work as well with tea. So, setting aside any tabloid drama that may have happened during

37:17.600 --> 37:25.520
the Bush administration, I'm saying this in a cuntiest way and they deserve it. They fucking

37:25.520 --> 37:32.400
deserve the cuntiness. I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom. I'm a lady.

37:32.400 --> 37:38.080
She's a woman. The main argument against me usually references a collage of Buck Angel's

37:38.080 --> 37:43.600
problematic tweets. And this is supposed to be definitive evidence that he is a horrible person

37:43.600 --> 37:49.280
and therefore that I am a horrible person for collaborating with him. Well, here's the thing

37:49.280 --> 37:55.360
though. A collage of problematic tweets does not define a person. And I'm very used to being

37:55.360 --> 38:01.360
defined that way myself so I know how unfair it can be. Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,

38:01.360 --> 38:06.080
a lot of people on Twitter were already calling me truscum. That's been going on a year and a half

38:06.080 --> 38:10.960
now. And anytime my name comes up on Twitter, a bunch of people respond saying Natalie is truscum,

38:11.040 --> 38:15.520
Natalie is a trans medicalist, Natalie hates non-binary people, and you should really think

38:15.520 --> 38:20.640
what kind of message you're sending to your trans and non-binary followers by platforming her. And

38:20.640 --> 38:26.400
if the person defends me or argues back in any way, they say, I can't believe you're ignoring

38:26.400 --> 38:31.360
the valid concerns of marginalized people. You know, they're weaponizing their marginalized

38:31.360 --> 38:37.280
status as trans people to isolate and attack another trans person. And sometimes this stuff

38:37.280 --> 38:42.080
gets to my head too. I start asking myself, wait, am I a trans medicalist? Do I really

38:42.080 --> 38:48.480
believe all these awful things they say I believe? But the answer is no, I just don't. These things

38:48.480 --> 38:54.720
they're saying about me are 100% not true. You know, believe marginalized people is a norm that

38:54.720 --> 39:00.560
is encouraged in leftist spaces for good reason, much like believe victims or believe women. And

39:00.560 --> 39:06.160
these norms were established to counterbalance the mainstream tendency, which is not to listen

39:06.240 --> 39:12.240
to marginalized people or to victims or to women. But any norm can be abused. And the blunt fact of

39:12.240 --> 39:19.120
the matter is sometimes marginalized people are wrong. Sometimes people calling themselves victims

39:19.120 --> 39:25.600
are obscuring a more complicated situation. And it's even happened once or twice that a woman

39:26.160 --> 39:33.920
has lied. And the accusation that I'm truscum is simply false. I mean, first of all, I don't even

39:34.000 --> 39:38.560
think of my own transgenderism as a medical disorder, much less everyone else's. I have,

39:38.560 --> 39:45.040
of course, collaborated with Dr. Spiegel at all, but I will not have my artistry reduced to mere

39:45.040 --> 39:55.920
medicine. Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people is just no, no, no. My thinking

39:55.920 --> 40:00.560
about trans identity has always been informed by non-binary people. I used to identify as

40:00.560 --> 40:05.440
non-binary myself before I medically transitioned. And some of the closest people to me in my life

40:05.440 --> 40:12.400
today are non-binary trans people, some of whom are also transsexuals incidentally. It's complicated.

40:12.400 --> 40:16.720
I've also made at least five videos on this channel arguing for the validity of non-binary

40:16.720 --> 40:22.400
gender identities going back more than three years. So that's five out of around 50 videos or

40:22.400 --> 40:27.600
10% of the content I've made on this channel is about non-binary identity. A few months ago,

40:27.600 --> 40:32.480
I even made a 30-minute video called Transtrenders, which uses character dialogue to show what I

40:32.480 --> 40:37.040
think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism. But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter

40:37.040 --> 40:42.160
saying that I'm truscum who hates non-binary people. And their main piece of evidence for that

40:42.160 --> 40:47.920
is a collage of my problematic tweets. So let's take a look at that. Here's the three tweets that

40:47.920 --> 40:52.880
I usually see scrapbooked together as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people. This is the

40:52.880 --> 40:57.520
first one from September 2018. Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread so you can't

40:57.520 --> 41:02.080
even see what I'm talking about. I'm sure this is not the experience of many Enbies. Envy means

41:02.080 --> 41:07.520
non-binary people. I leave it to them to articulate what Envy existence looks like in a binary world.

41:07.520 --> 41:13.360
I do not and I cannot speak for them. But surely an account, god I used to write like such a nerd,

41:13.360 --> 41:19.040
but surely an account that begins and ends with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

41:19.040 --> 41:24.640
is pretty weak. Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread that that tweet has been clipped out of,

41:24.640 --> 41:29.360
I was defending myself from accusations that my most recent video at the time,

41:29.360 --> 41:35.520
The Aesthetic, was anti-non-binary. In that video, there's a character named Justine who defends a

41:35.520 --> 41:40.160
version of the performativity theory of gender. And basically I made this video to express some

41:40.160 --> 41:45.040
angst I was feeling about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye. This was a very

41:45.040 --> 41:49.600
one year on hormones moment for me. And I've already moved on in my thinking. At that time,

41:49.600 --> 41:54.960
I was very, um, my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times or else I'm not really a

41:54.960 --> 41:59.680
woman. My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men who resemble my father.

42:01.680 --> 42:05.680
And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows that most of us go through a stage like

42:05.680 --> 42:11.680
this at some point. And some YouTubers never get out of it. But personally, I mean these days,

42:11.680 --> 42:16.240
it doesn't matter what I wear. It's when I dream their Lily's dreams.

42:18.640 --> 42:23.040
Dragging the Danish girl. Well, fuck the Danish. I could never abide that sort of person. We all

42:23.040 --> 42:26.480
know what I'm talking about. You can tell the whiskey is getting to me because I'm

42:27.600 --> 42:32.720
being bigoted against the Danish. These things come out, you know, you get honest, you get real

42:33.440 --> 42:37.920
when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system. Did I just fucking put lipstick outside

42:37.920 --> 42:44.400
the fucking lip liner? This is all Lily's fault. Lily Alba. Fuck her dreams. Uh, the point is when

42:44.400 --> 42:48.720
I was making the aesthetic, I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people. And people will say that

42:48.720 --> 42:55.360
the fact that not every video I make references non-binary people is itself and be phobic. As I've

42:55.360 --> 43:03.200
said about one in 10 of my videos is about non-binary identity, but not all of them are. And I feel

43:03.200 --> 43:08.720
entitled to make some videos that are just about trans women. But still, some people on Twitter

43:08.720 --> 43:15.520
were saying that the character Justine is a transmedicalist. And because she maybe wins the

43:15.520 --> 43:22.560
fictional debate in the video, I, Natalie Wynn, am therefore a transmedicalist. Here's the thing,

43:22.560 --> 43:27.920
though. The performativity theory of gender, the one that Justine defends in that video, is

43:28.800 --> 43:35.120
conceptually as far away from transmedicalism as it is possible to be. Transmedicalism says that

43:35.120 --> 43:40.240
trans identity is biological, it's neurological, it's hormonal, it's diagnosable and treatable.

43:40.240 --> 43:46.800
Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture, it's expression, it's performance, it's a

43:46.800 --> 43:54.240
social phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon. Performativity

43:54.240 --> 43:59.120
makes no reference to gender dysphoria or to any kind of medical concept at all. So whereas

43:59.120 --> 44:05.680
transmedicalism is a kind of bio-essentialism, performativity is a kind of social constructionism.

44:05.680 --> 44:12.320
So these are exact opposite theories of gender. Are you following along, class? I'm not ready to

44:12.320 --> 44:17.920
drink Jameson tea until I die. But some trans people felt invalidated by things Justine says

44:17.920 --> 44:24.000
in that video. And transmedicalism is another thing that makes them feel invalidated. So they

44:24.000 --> 44:29.920
decided that Justine is a transmedicalist and therefore that I am a transmedicalist. And this

44:29.920 --> 44:36.720
is literally just bad media comprehension. Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video

44:36.720 --> 44:41.680
that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult. And so much of the negative response

44:41.680 --> 44:47.440
to that video is just pure emotion. I always hear, I don't care what you intended, trans people were

44:47.440 --> 44:53.040
hurt by that video. You hurt trans people. But here's the thing, just because you were hurt by

44:53.040 --> 44:58.480
content I made doesn't mean that the content is bad or that I'm victimizing you in some way.

44:58.480 --> 45:04.320
I'll give an example. I did a stream a couple years ago with a BDSM and kink activist. We're

45:04.320 --> 45:11.040
talking about various kinks and we got to DDLG, which is Daddy Don Little Girl. Basically when

45:11.040 --> 45:16.880
consenting adults roleplay age difference and the power dynamic that comes with that. And me and

45:16.880 --> 45:22.880
this kink activists were just casually discussing what DDLG is, what it isn't, when I noticed

45:22.880 --> 45:27.200
someone in the chat was starting to totally freak out. They were typing in all caps like,

45:27.200 --> 45:32.880
my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me. Why are you defending my abuser? I can't believe you'd

45:32.880 --> 45:38.240
betray me like this. Please stop taking my abuser's side. Please stop. I'm begging you. This was

45:38.240 --> 45:43.440
actually really fucking upsetting to me because this person was clearly in a lot of pain. They

45:43.440 --> 45:48.480
were having a panic attack because they were having a trauma trigger reaction to this

45:48.480 --> 45:53.280
conversation. And I kept telling them to leave the stream and take care of themselves, but they

45:53.280 --> 45:59.200
wouldn't do it. So I had to block them and then later get in touch and make sure they were okay.

45:59.200 --> 46:05.600
Now, was their pain very real? Yes. Was it triggered by the content I was streaming?

46:06.240 --> 46:13.120
Yes. But does that mean I did anything wrong? No. Is it wrong to talk about kink and contacts

46:13.120 --> 46:18.800
where it's clear you're going to be talking about kink? No. But when you produce content

46:18.800 --> 46:23.440
online that's going to be viewed by thousands or millions of people, there's always some people

46:23.440 --> 46:28.640
out there who are going to be hurt by it. So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made

46:28.640 --> 46:35.600
is somehow immoral, I think you need more of an argument than just people were hurt. All right,

46:35.600 --> 46:40.720
back to the tweet. To this day, people quote tweet the sentence, but surely an account that begins

46:40.720 --> 46:44.960
and ends with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one is pretty weak. And they claim

46:44.960 --> 46:50.160
this is evidence that I'm true scum or that I think people have to prove their identity somehow,

46:50.160 --> 46:55.840
which is not at all what I was saying in that thread. What I was saying is if you're trying to

46:55.840 --> 47:01.920
persuade a skeptic that trans identity is valid, simply saying I'm not a man because I don't

47:01.920 --> 47:07.440
identify as one isn't a very good argument, which it isn't. I mean, no one has ever been persuaded

47:07.440 --> 47:12.800
by that so far as I'm aware. That said, I do now disagree with the mindset I had when I tweeted

47:12.800 --> 47:18.320
this. Back then, I still delusionally believed that it was possible to rationally explain why

47:18.320 --> 47:23.600
trans identity is valid. And I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument than this is how I

47:23.600 --> 47:28.480
identify you have to believe me no further questions. But I no longer believe there can't

47:28.480 --> 47:32.800
be any rational justification of gender identity, which is another reason I'm not a trans

47:32.800 --> 47:38.160
medicalist. Trans medicalism tries to be a rational theory about why trans identity is valid,

47:38.160 --> 47:42.880
and I don't think it succeeds as that. I don't think anything does. My current opinion about

47:42.880 --> 47:49.520
this is that I'm not a man because I don't identify as one is as good or rather as bad an argument as

47:49.520 --> 47:56.240
any. You know, some things in life just can't be rationally explained. Like love. Why do you love

47:56.240 --> 48:01.520
the person you love? Well, because you love them. You could write a poem about it or some gay shit

48:01.520 --> 48:09.040
like that, but you can't give any actual arguments. And why am I a woman? Because I'm a woman. That's

48:09.040 --> 48:14.160
it. I mean, I can describe my experiences and my feelings to you to help you understand better,

48:14.160 --> 48:19.920
but I can't logically prove anything. And I'm super fucking sorry if you can't handle that

48:19.920 --> 48:25.520
mankind was set adrift in an absurd world that must be super fucking hard for you. Tell me all

48:25.520 --> 48:31.920
about it. Next, please. Okay, again, we're mid thread with missing context, but the tweet says,

48:31.920 --> 48:36.800
whereas I've met 20 year olds in full on boy mode who are like, hi, I'm a trans woman. She,

48:36.800 --> 48:43.600
her pronouns. So I guess by including this tweet in the ContraPoints is problematic collage,

48:43.600 --> 48:49.200
people are implying that I don't think it's valid for someone who presents male to identify as a

48:49.200 --> 48:54.560
woman and request she, her pronouns. Well, that's not true. I was surprised when I first experienced

48:54.560 --> 49:00.800
this, but I think it's valid. Next. Okay. Mid thread, no context once again, but now you go

49:00.800 --> 49:06.000
into these leftist discord slash Facebook groups and like 20 to 30% identify as some flavor of

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
trans. Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals. That seems to be the future. Okay.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
Well, it's true that many leftist discord servers are like this, but reading this back, I don't like

49:18.000 --> 49:23.760
the way the phrase conventional binary transsexuals is hitting my ear. I can see how it could imply

49:23.840 --> 49:29.360
that non-binary identities are somehow new fangled, which isn't true. There's been non-binary

49:29.360 --> 49:34.480
people for longer than there's been medical transsexuals. In fact, so we'll call this a

49:34.480 --> 49:40.240
bad tweet. I apologize for tweeting it and I apologize to any non-binary people who felt

49:40.240 --> 49:47.120
trivialized by it. Okay. This is the big one. This tweet got its own article in the fucking guardian.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.800
You know, I really wish people would pay less attention to the tweets. I spent 30 seconds

49:50.800 --> 49:56.160
writing and a little more attention to the videos that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making.

49:56.960 --> 50:01.200
Anyway, let's look at the tweet. This is the most scrutinized paragraph I've ever written.

50:01.200 --> 50:06.720
And it's so mediocre. This has happened to me before in hyper woke spaces. Like it's me and a

50:06.720 --> 50:11.360
bunch of cis women, and we all have to go in a circle saying she, her, because I'm there.

50:11.360 --> 50:15.920
There's this paradox where I can go to a sports bar in North Carolina and be miss mammed all night.

50:15.920 --> 50:20.960
No question, but in self-consciously trans inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns

50:20.960 --> 50:26.000
and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves every time they say you guys. I guess it's good

50:26.000 --> 50:30.720
for people who use they them only and want only gender neutral language, but it comes at the minor

50:30.720 --> 50:37.120
expense of semi passable trans is like me. And that's super fucking hard for us. So people

50:37.120 --> 50:43.920
interpreted this tweet as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns, which I'm literally

50:43.920 --> 50:48.960
just not. Like I've actually been the person who initiates the pronoun circle many times.

50:48.960 --> 50:55.440
The backstory of this tweet is basically that I once got triggered in a situation where I was

50:55.440 --> 51:00.960
with a bunch of cis women and we all had to go around saying our pronouns and like a typical

51:00.960 --> 51:07.280
triggered train, I tiptoed over to Twitter to tip tap, type it out. But here's the thing,

51:07.280 --> 51:11.920
by the end of this thread, I had already talked myself away from the initial frustration I was

51:11.920 --> 51:17.360
expressing. If you know my videos in my voice, then you know me saying it comes at the minor

51:17.360 --> 51:26.160
expense of semi passable trans is in that super fucking hard for us is sarcastic. It's a minor

51:26.160 --> 51:33.360
expense. It's not actually very hard for us. Gorge. It's fine. But people on Twitter don't

51:33.360 --> 51:41.760
watch my videos and they don't get sarcasm. So people flipped out over this. I was getting drag

51:41.920 --> 51:48.720
and I made the poor decision to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting, which 100% of

51:48.720 --> 51:55.200
the time is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid. So me and my dumb brain did another

51:55.200 --> 51:59.440
short thread trying to clarify what I was saying and defending my right to talk about my own

51:59.440 --> 52:06.080
experiences. That didn't make things any better. So in a state of anger and frustration, I tweeted

52:06.080 --> 52:11.520
out yet another thread. And this time I said some truly stupid things, including the now

52:11.520 --> 52:19.040
infamous line. I sometimes feel like the last of the old school transsexuals. I honestly don't

52:19.040 --> 52:24.480
know what the fuck I was even trying to say. I don't feel like the last of the old school

52:24.480 --> 52:31.120
transsexuals. I don't even know what that means. I guess I basically meant that offline, I don't

52:31.120 --> 52:36.720
have any radical aspirations. You know, I want to be inconspicuous. I want to blend in. And that's

52:36.720 --> 52:42.080
what I meant by old school. You know, I want people to assume my pronouns. You know, it's funny because

52:42.080 --> 52:47.600
it is very different from the way I am online where I'm totally shameless and open. I'm like

52:47.600 --> 52:55.280
sexual confession, everybody sexual confession. I have abnormal urges. It's 1am. My neighbors can

52:55.280 --> 53:01.360
definitely hear that. They know I have abnormal urges now. They already knew that. But offline,

53:01.360 --> 53:08.960
I'm an inconspicuous pussy, like a total coward. So this was a rage thread. And I apologize for

53:08.960 --> 53:20.640
tweeting it. Let's go back to Bug Angel. I'm kind of a conscientious objector to the practice of

53:20.640 --> 53:25.680
condemning someone based on a collage of their worst tweets taken out of context. But I definitely

53:25.680 --> 53:30.800
do have anxiety about this. Like, I think I'm doing the right thing by not condemning Buck as

53:30.800 --> 53:37.200
true scum and evil, but I mean, I could be wrong. What if I am basically sacrificing myself for the

53:37.200 --> 53:42.720
sake of a person who really is as bad as Twitter says? Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet fuck non-binary

53:42.720 --> 53:49.520
people and then I'll have fucked up. This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me. But I do

53:49.600 --> 53:56.400
believe that by refusing to participate in the anti-Buck Angel pylon, I am erring on the morally

53:56.400 --> 54:01.440
safer side of things. Because even if he is a little true scummy, excommunicating him from the

54:01.440 --> 54:06.560
trans community is still probably not the best approach to take. In my experience, when people

54:06.560 --> 54:12.320
accept binary but not non-binary trans people, it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation

54:12.320 --> 54:17.440
to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance. And I'll give you a couple examples.

54:17.440 --> 54:23.280
The first time I was ever cancelled, like totally trashed on Twitter, was back in 2017,

54:23.280 --> 54:28.000
when I had not yet medically transitioned, and at the time, I identified as non-binary.

54:28.000 --> 54:34.720
And at VidCon 2017, I met up with a YouTuber named June, who had made some videos where she

54:34.720 --> 54:41.120
basically mocked the idea of non-binary people. And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June,

54:41.120 --> 54:45.520
and some other people, but let's keep them out of it. And people on Twitter totally dragged me

54:45.520 --> 54:49.280
for being a peak liberal bootlicker who's best friends with transphobic abusers.

54:50.800 --> 54:56.400
Christ. Fucking people, man. It's so fucking frustrating. And you know, I'm not gonna

54:56.400 --> 55:00.000
claim I changed June's mind because I don't know what her thought process was,

55:00.000 --> 55:05.600
but I did talk to her about non-binary identity, and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.520
And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.

55:07.520 --> 55:12.720
Aaaah!

55:12.720 --> 55:18.880
Example two. A couple months later, I did a live stream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber

55:18.880 --> 55:27.120
named, um, what was her name? Sharon? Sharon? Was it Sharon? I guess she's just not a very

55:27.120 --> 55:32.320
memorable person. Anyway, she had made some videos saying that non-binary identities aren't real,

55:32.320 --> 55:36.720
but I gave her a chance, and she surprised me by being super compassionate and thoughtful.

55:36.800 --> 55:40.960
By the end of that stream, she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity. So again,

55:40.960 --> 55:45.360
the point is not that I'm some kind of persuasive genius. If I was a persuasive genius, maybe I

55:45.360 --> 55:51.040
could talk myself out of being canceled. The point is that sometimes, people who seem ignorant or

55:51.040 --> 55:56.640
hateful just need to be given a non-judgmental space to learn and grow and think. And to just

55:56.640 --> 56:01.440
condemn them as hopeless bigots actually prevents that growth from happening. And Sharon, despite

56:01.440 --> 56:06.320
her, you know, totally forgettable personality, turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.

56:06.320 --> 56:10.640
Like later on, she actually made an apology video to non-binary people, and I became good

56:10.640 --> 56:14.880
friends with her, and we worked together on most of the videos I've made this year. You know,

56:14.880 --> 56:18.960
until she ruined my life by recommending a cancelled John Waters impersonator. I guess

56:18.960 --> 56:24.000
the moral is never talk to people you disagree with. It will only lead to pain.

56:24.000 --> 56:38.240
I do think there's something off with my hormone dose. Like, I'm crying three times a day. Oh,

56:38.240 --> 56:42.640
and I can't come unless there's vibrators in at least three of my holes. It happens like once a

56:42.640 --> 56:47.040
month, there has to be a full moon. I honestly only still bother because it numbs the pain for

56:47.040 --> 56:51.920
a few moments. What I'm trying to say is I really do believe in conversation, which means hearing

56:51.920 --> 56:55.840
out multiple perspectives. I don't want my audience to get all their information about trans

56:55.840 --> 57:00.880
people from me, and I think it's important to listen to criticism. So I encourage my audience

57:00.880 --> 57:05.920
to go watch some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel. For

57:05.920 --> 57:12.320
example, go check out non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me, and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's

57:12.320 --> 57:18.960
video about Buck Angel. I think YouTube, as a platform, is better at producing criticism

57:18.960 --> 57:24.080
rather than canceling. And I think that's because, at least in the vlog format,

57:24.080 --> 57:29.760
making a video forces you to confront the fact that you're a human being with a face and a name

57:29.760 --> 57:34.400
who can be held accountable for the things that you say. But people on Twitter, it's a different

57:34.400 --> 57:38.720
story, and I think it's time we take a look at what canceling really is. I've given you enough

57:38.720 --> 57:43.680
context now for you to understand what I'm about to show you, which is what I saw on my timeline

57:43.680 --> 57:49.360
every day for nearly a month. All these tweets are from the aftermath of my uploading Opulence

57:49.360 --> 57:54.480
two months ago, when the Buck Angel scandal first broke. And someone better hold my hand now,

57:54.480 --> 58:02.400
because this gets ugly. Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints after her bigging up and

58:02.400 --> 58:07.280
collaborating with notable turf favorite and true scum Buck Angel, you're no friend to gender

58:07.280 --> 58:13.280
non-conforming, non-passing, and non-binary trans people. Fuck her, and fuck her fucking rift.

58:13.280 --> 58:18.720
I am absolutely furious right now. Weird how I'm 30 and trans and manage not to be a true scum,

58:18.720 --> 58:23.120
maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly. Or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat fucking

58:23.120 --> 58:27.920
tapo who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth. Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,

58:27.920 --> 58:34.000
I just want to say fuck ContraPoints, her sycophantic stance, and all her bread tube chums who close

58:34.000 --> 58:38.480
ranks to protect her after she throws the rest of the trans community under the bus for profit.

58:38.480 --> 58:43.040
Natalie Wynn is a fucking grifter. ContraPoints videos are now just style over substance,

58:43.040 --> 58:47.840
so that explains why she took the turf ideology so well. ContraPoints working with true scum now

58:47.840 --> 58:52.880
definitively proves that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints just hates enbies,

58:52.880 --> 58:57.440
and are also true scum. Legit gonna start on following peeps that continue to follow ContraPoints

58:57.440 --> 59:02.480
at this point. Do know my wording of pretty much everyone. I know there are some that were probably

59:02.480 --> 59:08.080
blindsided by this somehow. So long as you know that ContraPoints is true scum, you're safe

59:08.080 --> 59:13.440
and cool. Eat shit, Natalie. For someone who used to identify as genderqueer, we expected more from

59:13.440 --> 59:18.880
you, but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass, it's hard to consider others. ContraPoints,

59:18.880 --> 59:23.920
more like disappoints. That's a good one. If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.

59:23.920 --> 59:30.640
Fuck fuck, angel. Fuck ContraPoints. Fuck any real transsexual. Fuck your grift. Here's what

59:30.640 --> 59:36.720
hashtag ContraPoints stands don't understand. If Natalie refuses to accept that she has an apology

59:36.800 --> 59:42.400
to make and continues profiting from it, it will become our responsibility to work on deplatforming

59:42.400 --> 59:48.240
her just like every other racist, sexist, bigoted content creator. No one has actually suggested or

59:48.240 --> 59:52.880
attempted to actually cancel her, but the longer this goes on without an apology and commitment to

59:52.880 --> 59:58.160
do better, the stronger the case becomes for actively working to deplatform her. So in other

59:58.160 --> 01:00:05.040
words, no one has suggested we cancel her, but we should cancel her. Great. Can everyone finally

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.480
agree that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can? Here I am, sweetie. ContraPoints

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:16.480
collaborating with Angel Buck. Angel Buck. Thanks for letting us all know that you had no idea who

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.160
he even was until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about. ContraPoints collaborating with

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.240
Angel Buck, a trans medicalist who once outed a trans person to try and destroy them and supporting

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.000
him because he looks and sounds like a proper man, isn't a small itty bitty tipsy topsy fucking

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.200
mistake. This is a huge deal. ContraPoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.520
We have a Hitler comparison. Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today. And y'all would

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.440
be like, oh, well, she's just a little flawed, you know, fuck off. Can Natalie Wynn stop being

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.560
a coward and commit to being a trans med? It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.680
Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat who refuses to take accountability. Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.680
does not support non-binary people. Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person. My God. Every cis and

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.360
not non-binary person who thought Natalie Wynn wasn't trans med now owes me and every non-binary

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:19.120
person $50. Joe Biden has a better position on the validity of non-binary gender than ContraPoints.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.960
My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks a lot and I don't like her. I hate ContraPoints so

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:32.720
goddamn much. It's unbelievable. ContraPoints be like, it's a very good impression of me. You're

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.240
doing very good, sweetie. You're doing very, very good. Buck Angel is a turf apologizer, boot looker,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.320
and true scum. Any association with him must be seen as hostile to the trans community as a whole,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:50.800
let alone denial of non-binary existence. That's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand?

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:58.880
And here we fucking are, dude. Buck fucking Angel on ContraPoints. Eat my entire ass.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:08.560
What? This is Natalie. Natalie is a trans medicalist. This is Natalie's friend Lindsay. Lindsay is a

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.800
left-tuber. Natalie and Lindsay are still friends because Natalie and Lindsay are both cowards.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.480
Left-tuber is a grip. Oh, and they made me the man. The shade. Issues that arose with

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.840
being in Contra's new video. Her video on turfs make no sense now. Her video on trans

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.960
trenders make no sense now. You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel totally

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.600
contradicts the videos I spent hundreds of hours making, do you think maybe your interpretation

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.200
could be wrong? Apparently not. Her apology is completely void, sends a message that she hates

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.000
non-binary people. She is reckless with her content. Positive said arose from Buck Angel

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.240
being in Contra's new video. She, uh, has four hundred thousand dollars this month from Patreon.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.840
Four hundred thousand. This number is completely made up. Like, it is exponentially wrong. Four

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.120
hundred thousand dollars. Four hundred thousand dollars a month. Hot take. ContraPoints is the

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.160
leftist PewDiePie. Personally, I like to characterize her as the Blair White Wolf and

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.840
leftist sheep's clothing. Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit who still has not

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.600
apologized for platforming Truscum and is actively taking their side. Anyway, if you still support

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.600
ContraPoints, get the hell away from me. Pee pee poo poo. I'm ContraPoints and I can't stop being

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:35.840
a trans medicalist and shitting myself in public. Valid criticisms of marginalized people. Fuck

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.640
ContraPoints. Fuck Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.560
is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Trus- You know, when you repeat the same

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.200
fucking sentence over and over again, it doesn't- you don't even repeat the same sentence over and

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.120
over again. It actually doesn't get more persuasive. In fact, it might get less persuasive

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.120
because true things usually only have to be said once. If you still support ContraPoints,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.080
unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again. In conclusion,

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.360
fuck Natalie Wynn and fuck everything she has to say.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.160
Okay, let's get started. So, that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.040
And all of this, let me remind you, is over a 10 second voiceover clip in a 48 minute video

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.840
about a completely unrelated topic. Like, how do you work? How do you create when a decision so

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:49.200
trivial can become the main event for weeks of your life? And the tweets are just the beginning.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.360
After that, there's the Reddit threads and the YouTube comments and the Facebook discourse and

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.040
the Medium posts and the Newsweek article. Opulence is a video me and Theron spent hundreds

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.560
of hours carefully piecing together. I think it's my best video. And to have the response to it

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.640
completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.120
And it's left me with much less energy to create new things. But here's the thing,

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.160
people on Twitter saying mean things about me is not the worst of it, not even close.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:26.240
Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.720
content on a notoriously right wing platform. Sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things about

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:37.920
myself online. Most of you probably can't even begin to imagine how used to it I am.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.920
And the way you psychologically survive in that situation is you block the people in

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.440
platforms who are harassing you and you pay it no mind. But there's some things you can't block.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.640
And a big one is you can't block people from going after your friends and colleagues. And that is

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.080
exactly what people did to me at the height of the Buck Angel incident. Lindsay Ellis,

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.760
Ollie from PhilosophyTube, and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets demanding that they

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:10.480
publicly disown me, a person they've all been friends with for years or else. In response to

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.840
demands that she apologize, Lindsay released a statement where she said, I was not involved in

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:21.200
opulence. My name was mentioned in it, but I did not participate in the production. Therefore,

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.760
with regards to calls for me to apologize, I have to ask, apologize for what? There is only

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.680
one logical answer. Apologize for being friends with Natalie. And here's a response to her

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.800
statement. I don't need to consider you my fucking friend to disagree with beliefs you knowingly

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.680
solicit or allow on your platform. Same with Contra. It just means you're willing to allow

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.840
awful ideas to fester for the sake of financial gain, which is fine, but it makes you a piece of

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.320
shit. And here's a comment at Hbomberguy. I doubt that you were going to read this,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.800
but can you please just tell us your thoughts on that whole situation so we could at least know

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.680
that you were on our side? We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all and cause BreadTube to go

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:11.520
into his schism as a result of this. Thank you. Nice YouTube channel you have, fair friend.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:18.800
Would be a shame if someone canceled it. I'm so fucking sinister. Ollie of PhilosophyTube

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.600
released his own statement affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.400
Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxed, had my private life speculated on,

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.960
and my loved ones insulted. In recognizing the feelings of those who kindly raised their

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.680
concerns in a polite way, I do not wish to legitimize the great many people who use their

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.280
hurt as a cover for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior. And here are some responses to Ollie.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.920
As a non-binary fan of yours, I'm disappointed in this non-apology.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.600
Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for? Ever having associated with

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.480
me? Things we are going to criticize Ollie PhilosophyTube for. Being a sniveling,

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:03.040
hypocritical piece of shit, refusing to listen to trans people, actively,

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.960
openly, and repeatedly mocking the trans people he refuses to listen to.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.320
Thanks for the apology. Now stop and door some contra points.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:16.560
Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing is demanding that cis people publicly

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.640
condemn a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person. Does that strike

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.000
anyone else as wildly inappropriate? Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who is never publicly

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.960
associated with me, got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Ollie, you know,

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.520
after he made the post discussing being doxed and threatened. And just for that,

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.120
she gets put on the anime list. I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list of people that have stood

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.400
by contra points as she's continued to be a bigoted piece of shit. To which Mia responds,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.760
stood by contra points, Jesus Christ. No matter what I do, people call me out and I'm not even

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.880
related to the video and I don't even know Natalie. The chain of guilt by association is so

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:05.680
long and twisted, I can barely even follow it. So they're going after Mia, who tweeted a heart at

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:13.040
Ollie, who failed to condemn me for my voiceover casting of Buck Angel, who was retweeted,

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.160
by a turf. We're only missing a couple degrees of separation before every living person on the

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.440
planet Earth is cancelled over the Buck Angel situation. And several colleagues of mine,

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.960
by the way, Lindsay Harry Ollie, they all took a financial hit over this. They've all lost some

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.760
Patreon support. One of Lindsay's former supporters even demanded a $38 lifetime refund saying,

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.440
Dear Lindsay, I'm sorry for being pushy, but I really am going to be needing a refund.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.160
I gave money to your operation under the pretense that you wouldn't do anything morally

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.600
objectionable and supporting contra points and blaming us for taking issue with that is,

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.280
in my opinion, amoral. Please respond. I hope she's sent it to them in pennies.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.720
So look, I'm very grateful to my colleagues for sticking by me through all this, but I'm also

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:08.640
aware that I'm becoming a burden to anyone who associates with me. I have no collaborators in

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.400
this video. I'm working on this totally alone because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.760
now and I don't want to contaminate anyone else. During the height of this most recent canceling,

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.280
a creator I admire DMed me to let me know. I cut the shout out to you in my last video because I

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.320
was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors who are getting genuinely scary, but I wouldn't

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:37.280
want you to think I was disavowing you regardless of how many people are asking me to. Jesus Christ.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.800
The situation here is that any cis person who defends me or even associates with me in any way

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.240
will be labeled a transphobe. Any binary trans person who associates with me will be branded an

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.440
enbyphobe. And any non-binary people who associate with me will be ostracized from their own

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.680
community. So in the internet I find myself increasingly alone. I'm isolated by the harassment.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.520
And that is ultimately the point, to exile me from my community, from any community. And it's

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.480
all because I refuse to participate in doing exactly that to bug Angel. My experiences have

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.080
made me so disillusioned with the idea that social media callouts can lead to any kind of justice

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.960
that have essentially sworn off participating in them. There's a fairly prominent figure in

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.520
leftist politics who I could absolutely hashtag me to, but I'm never going to do it because I have

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.360
no faith left in the process of callout vigilante justice. And I'm not saying I'm totally against

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.800
me toing people, because I think in some cases it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.720
But in my case, I feel like I just know too much about the dark side of social media shaming to

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.120
ever want to participate in it again. You know, I feel like the story would end up being taken out

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.640
of my control, warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways. It would end up just haunting

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.280
both me and the person I'd be accusing, which in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.080
So I'm just not willing to take that risk, except maybe in some very extreme situation,

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:12.160
which this just isn't. It's not worth it. And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep demanding

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.800
I condemn bug Angel to save myself from cancellation, no. I'm just not going to do that.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.320
I'm a conscientious objector. I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this. Take me away, boys.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:36.640
Ugh. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's bread tube videos.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.680
Part eight and a half. The philosophy of being fucked in the ass. Ugh. I have done this to

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:51.920
YouTube and I'm sorry. So look, canceling is not criticism. It is not holding someone accountable.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.640
It is an attack on a human being. In this video, I use the word canceling

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.840
more or less synonymously with what feminist Joe Freeman, author of the Bitch Manifesto,

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.200
calls trashing. And I've linked her essay, Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood,

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:13.520
and the description. It was originally published in Ms. Magazine in 1976, but it is a perfect

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.600
description of what goes on on trans Twitter today. It is not disagreement. It is not conflict. It is

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.960
not opposition. These are perfectly ordinary phenomena, which, when engaged in mutually,

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:30.640
honestly, and not excessively, are necessary to keep an organism or organization healthy and active.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.080
Trashing is a particularly vicious form of character assassination which amounts to

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.440
psychological rape. It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive. It is occasionally

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.720
disguised by the rhetoric of honest conflict, or covered up by denying that any disapproval

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.640
exists at all, but it is not done to expose disagreements or resolve differences. It is done

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.160
to disparage and destroy. Whatever methods are used, trashing involves a violation of one's

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:04.160
integrity, a declaration of one's worthlessness, and an impugning of one's motives. In effect,

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:10.960
what is attacked is not one's actions or one's ideas, but one's self. And that's what

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.480
distinguishes trashing, bullying, or abuse from criticism, or holding accountable.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.440
Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs. But when people are canceling me,

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:26.960
they're not bringing up my problematic tweets because they want me to revise my beliefs. No,

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.800
what they're doing is accumulating evidence to support the case they've decided to make

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.400
that I am a horrible person who must be shunned. You know, the only sense in which I am, as they

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.280
like to say, the new Blair White, is that I think I actually have now snatched Vanessa's crown as

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.960
the most hated tran on Tran Twitter. Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you. Feud with me,

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.200
god damn it. You can have a one-sided feud. I don't want to be one of those trans YouTubers

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.000
that just drags other trans people all day and they never respond. That would be really pathetic.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.680
The new Lazy Green. That's the other one. The newest in a series of women you've decided to

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.560
treat like supervillains. Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hm? And supervillain

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:18.880
is the right word. Like, I'm the bad guy. Duh. I'm the enemy. And what you do with the enemy?

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.080
Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform, and destroy. As that one tweet put it,

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:30.000
that's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand? If you adequately demonstrate your searing

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.320
hatred of Natalie Wynn, then you're safe and cool. But if you don't, you're on the wrong side

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:43.120
of the line, sweaty. And you, too, are now the enemy. Cancel Culture, Trove 7. Dualism.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.840
Certain ancient religions teach their followers to understand the cosmos as they struggle between

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.520
light and dark, good and evil. And cancel culture does more or less the same thing.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.440
It's binary thinking. People are either good or they're bad. And to add to that essentialism,

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:07.200
if a person says or does a bad thing, we should interpret that as the mask slipping,

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.320
as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness. And anyone who wants to remain good

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:18.400
had better be willing to publicly condemn anyone the community has decided is bad.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.520
There really is something dystopian about this. You have to be willing to accuse other people

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.720
to prove your own innocence. That's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand?

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.840
In the most extreme version of this, all bad people are equally bad. So collaborating with

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.000
truscum means you may as well be truscum. And, of course, being truscum is tantamount to being a

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.920
turf. And on trans Twitter, it is a known fact that turfs are Nazis. And this implies that Nazis,

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.360
turfs, truscum, people who associate with truscum, people who fail to condemn people who

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.160
associate with truscum, people who offer emotional support to people who fail to condemn people who

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.000
associate with truscum, all of them must be treated the same way. Deplatform her just like

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.320
every other racist, sexist, bigoted content creator. A fully wound backhand to the mouth.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.840
I recently read a book by Sarah Shulman called Conflict is Not Abuse, overstating harm,

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.800
community responsibility, and the duty of repair. Basically Shulman's argument is that,

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:27.840
in various contexts, from romantic relationships to community infighting to international politics,

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:34.320
the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty and for escalating conflict.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:41.440
So for example, and this is my example, not Shulman's, turfs fixate on the exaggerated danger

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.960
that trans women supposedly pose to cis women. And in very classic overstatement of harm,

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.320
they'll describe everything they don't like as rape. Trans women entering women's spaces

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:58.080
is rape. Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape. And then they use that exaggerated

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:05.040
harm as a justification to retaliate against them to dox and harass and shun. Well, the same

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:11.200
kind of logic is used to justify abusive behavior within the trans community. The dualistic thinking,

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:17.040
the essentialism, the pseudo moralism. All of this allows people on Twitter to treat me in an

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:23.040
obviously abusive way, all the while feeling like they're doing the right thing because they're

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.320
attacking the enemy. And I realize that some people will say that I'm the one who's overstating harm

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:34.000
to evade criticism. Well, look, you've seen the tweets, the furious demands for me to be exiled,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.800
the doxing and threatening and ordering around of my colleagues, the attempts to isolate me from

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.600
my community, the attacks not on my actions, but on who I am as a person. There's not really

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:48.800
anything ambiguous about this. It's just abuse. But I don't think it feels like abuse to the

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:55.920
people who are doing it. They feel like they're punching up because I'm a celebrity with a

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.680
platform and lots of Twitter followers. And it's true that I do have more power than any of them

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:08.560
individually. But as a collective, they have a terrifying power that they don't seem to be aware

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.480
of as individuals. As John Ronson, author of a great book on public shaming, put it, I suppose

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.120
that when shamings are delivered like remotely administered drone strikes, nobody needs to think

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.800
about how ferocious our collective power might be. The snowflake never needs to feel responsible for

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.680
the avalanche. And that's how you get these situations where you have hundreds of people

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:35.040
endlessly bashing someone who's already been knocked to the ground and feeling all the while

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:41.120
like they're punching up. You know, there's actually a kind of power and safety in anonymity

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.800
and obscurity. And there are many ways that being a public figure makes you really vulnerable. For

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.120
example, you're more vulnerable to doxing, stalking and harassment on a scale that most people

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:59.120
probably can't even imagine. You're vulnerable to having your reputation permanently degraded

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:04.800
in a way that people who are posting anonymously or pseudonymously are pretty much invulnerable to.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.280
And a lot of the people who are attacking me, they're not pausing to self reflect,

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.200
they're not holding themselves accountable for the consequences of their actions.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.760
They're just venting their unfiltered rage. But in response to these attacks,

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.720
I as a powerful person with a platform, I'm not allowed to react like a human being. I'm not

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.600
allowed to get angry. I'm not allowed to show pain. I'm not allowed to get defensive. I'm not

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.920
allowed to lash out. All I'm allowed to do is go totally nama the inside as I try to frantically

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.160
calculate the ideal public relations response that pays due deference to the valid concerns of these

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.560
poor marginalized people, all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse that's crashing over

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:54.720
me. You know, people on Twitter, they don't try to persuade me like I'm a human being. They order

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.560
me around, they tell me what to believe, they demand that I say exactly what they want me to say

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:06.560
or else. It's extremely objectifying. They don't treat me like a person with my own opinions and

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:13.440
feelings. They treat me as this like brand of moral commodity to be consumed or denounced.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.480
And this is all terribly ironic because of the conflicting demand that creators be

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.520
authentic all the time. One thing that always frustrates me about these situations

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:29.520
is there's this demand that you apologize instantly and there's this perception that

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.520
a fast apology is more sincere than a delayed one. But in fact, the opposite is true. It takes

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:43.040
longer than a couple hours to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow, seriously

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:49.600
reflect on what you may have done or said that was wrong. That can take days or weeks or months.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:55.760
I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon and at the beginning of the stream I gave my

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:04.880
emotional half-formed reaction to the Buck Angel situation and some traitor on my Patreon

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.560
transcribed that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter just to instigate

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.720
another round of cancelling. You're not allowed a chance to think or feel and because supposedly

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:22.240
the best thing to do from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately. Cancelling produces a

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:28.640
lot of insincere bullshit apologies from people who haven't in fact learned anything. And I think

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:35.280
most people are aware of that. In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself is often insincere.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.600
If you're being cancelled rather than criticized then the line in the sand has been drawn. You

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:48.080
and all your kin have been declared the enemy. Apologize to Twitter. At this point I may as well

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:55.840
apologize to 4chan. Dear 4chan, I am super fucking sorry I called you thin-wristed otaku shit weasels

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.240
who like looking at pictures of little girls. I have been trying to educate myself and learn

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.160
from my mistakes and I now realize that's only 70% of you. Like once you're cancelled you can

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.000
really do no right. If you apologize the apology will be declared a manipulative attempt to save

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.600
face and in fact it will be used as further evidence of what a Machiavellian psychopath you

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.240
really are. If you try to explain or defend yourself, I mean first of all you will almost

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.680
certainly dig yourself in deeper. But even if you're articulate and correct you'll still be seen as

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:33.440
unable to take criticism and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people. And if you just go silent

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.040
you'll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability even though there's lots of reasons why you might

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:44.080
go silent. Maybe you're taking a few days away from social media to try to cool down and think

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.880
clearly or maybe you're so overwhelmed by the harassment that you've just shut down.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.040
Let's do shots. Who wants to do a shot with me? Do you want to do a shot with me?

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:06.960
Let's do a shot. A tequila shot is my favorite. I like the whole salt tequila lime ritual.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:14.640
It's just very satisfying to me. It's the end of that bottle. Okay let's get started.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.520
You feel warm right away you know that feeling where it's like

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:31.680
oh hey how are you happiness? Hey how are you? Feeling that life is worth living? It's a good

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.320
moment. You're like oh this isn't okay this is gonna be okay. I can get through this. It's how

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:42.160
it starts. Watch out for that. So look I really don't like to represent myself as a victim.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:48.880
That's not really a narrative that I identify with but for the purposes of communicating what

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.920
effect canceling has I feel like I should say something about the pain. Much of the happiness

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:04.080
that you might expect to come along with success has been taken away from me by this constant fury

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.280
that surrounds me. Try to think about this rationally. I'm a Libra Sun, Pisces Moon. Being

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:17.200
canceled is hell for me. You know I want to be liked by everyone and I'm starting to think I

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.120
might be in the wrong career for that. In a way leftist Twitter finally accomplished what 4chan

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.720
Nazis stalkers and turfs have been trying and failing to do to me for years. They've made

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.400
Twitter into a platform so hostile to my existence that I've decided to leave it forever. And they

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.440
demoralized me to the point I could barely get out of bed for a month. And I know that sounds

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:45.040
really melodramatic but I'm just trying to be honest with you about what a melodramatic

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.080
person I am. I find I have trouble convincing people of the severity of the pain that being

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.920
canceled causes because I think it's just hard to imagine if you haven't been through it yourself.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.160
And I don't know a more succinct way to convey it to you than by telling you that

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.800
in the last few years I've been harassed by Nazis, I've been harassed by turfs,

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.600
I've been stalked, I've been docked, I've been threatened, I've been sexually assaulted. And

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:15.680
the pain of being canceled, of being totally trashed by other trans people online for years

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.280
has been more difficult for me to cope with than all the rest of it combined.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.840
Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel better than I think I can describe it myself.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.720
I was one of the first in the country, perhaps the first in Chicago, to have my character,

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.240
my commitment, and my very self-attacked in such a way by movement women that it left me torn in

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.880
little pieces and unable to function. It took me years to recover and even today the wounds have

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.240
not entirely healed. This attack is accomplished by making you feel that your very existence is

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.280
inimical to the movement and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.720
These feelings are reinforced when you are isolated from your friends,

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.680
as they become convinced that their association with you is similarly inimical to the movement

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.360
and to themselves. Any support of you will taint them. Eventually all your colleagues join in in

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.480
a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced and you are reduced to a mere parody of your

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:15.200
previous self. Yeah, that just about sums it up. Now as it happens I am going to survive this

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.600
because I have very deliberately built a support network that will be there for me regardless of

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.960
what online trans communities say. And I have very deliberately done that because early in my

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:34.320
transition back in 2017 I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community for all kinds

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:40.160
of emotional support. You know when you're early in transition I mean it just sucks. You feel like

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.320
the whole world is against you. And I talked about this a little bit in my last video you know

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.960
feeling like a freak show walking down the street and even if you're lucky enough to have a supportive

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.440
family like it's usually still is going to take them a while to come around. At first they don't

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.560
get it. They say things to you like aren't you worried you'll regret this and like they struggle

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.520
with your name and pronouns which is understandable but at the same time it makes you feel like you're

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.800
not being seen for who you are. So you need a kind of second family that understands how you're

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.840
feeling and acts happy about your transition and validates your gender. And for the first couple

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.600
months of my transition I found that in this world of online transgender leftism. Well that

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:25.440
didn't last long because well I was what two months into my transition when first I did an

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.560
interview with the journalist Jessie Single and then I agreed to do a debate with Theron and Vanessa.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.520
So that's a long story but in short I associated with a string of people that trans twitter

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.440
considers the enemy. And trans twitter tore me apart over this and it completely broke my heart

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.800
because I was really leaning on basically emotional support from strangers online which

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.920
seems really stupid in retrospect. And after they turned against me I decided one that I was never

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.560
going to rely on this group of people again and two that I was going to have to find acceptance

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.280
elsewhere. And in retrospect I think this actually may have been good for me in a roundabout way

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.840
because I was kicked out of the safe space and I dropped that mentality. And so basically I was

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.960
thrown into the deep end of reality and forced to sink or swim. And I don't know if my transition

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.120
or my channel would be where they are today if it hadn't been for that trial by fire. Are we

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:24.000
swimming through fire or are we mixing metaphors? The point is I'm more armored against canceling

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.120
than I was two years ago. And the reason why is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.960
security and independence from any one community. So that if one community cancels me I still have

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:39.600
somewhere else to go. You know the people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture are not white

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.040
guy comedians. They're not James Charles. They're not me. They are marginalized people who feel like

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:49.920
they have nowhere else to go when they're rejected by their community. That means struggling trans

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.040
people with a few hundred Twitter followers. It means a lot of sex workers. It means people who

01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:00.800
totally rely on activist circles for emotional and material support. I'll quote Drew Freeman one more

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:06.080
time. I had survived my youth because I had never given anyone or any group the right to judge me.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.840
That right I had reserved to myself. But the movement seduced me by its sweet promise of

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:17.360
sisterhood. It claimed to provide a haven from the ravages of a sexist society, a place where

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.200
one would be understood. It was my very need for feminism and feminists that made me vulnerable.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:29.360
I gave the movement the right to judge me because I trusted it. And when it judged me worthless I

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:35.040
accepted that judgment. There's a really irritating point that people on the left like to make that

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.320
goes. Well canceling doesn't really end anyone's career. Canceled people usually get a new job or

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.760
keep their platform. So I guess it's not really that bad huh. I think people say this because

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.080
they're trying to mitigate any sense of guilt they might feel about how they're treating people.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.240
Because it's a really stupid argument. There's lots of things that don't end your life that are

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.840
still terrible. But also there's cases where canceling has ended someone's life. On December 5th

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:07.200
2017 a porn star named August Ames killed herself by hanging in a public park after being canceled

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.240
on Twitter over a homophobic tweet. On December 3rd she tweeted, whichever lady performer is

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.120
replacing me tomorrow for erotica x news you're shooting with a guy who's shot gay porn just to

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:22.080
let you know. B.S. is all I can say shrug. Do agents really not care about who they're representing?

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:27.920
L.A. direct I do my homework for my body. So I've never worked in porn so I can't really tell you

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.760
what the norms are around women working with men who have done gay porn. But the tweet certainly

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.240
sounds homophobic to me and that seems to be the consensus of other industry people on Twitter.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.640
So Twitter did its thing. People in August's community called her a homophobe and lashed out

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.840
at her. And as always happens plenty of passers-by jumped in to throw tomatoes at the woman in the

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:53.120
stocks. Over the next few days August tweeted several more times going through the usual stages

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:58.240
that you go through when you're being canceled. First she defended herself. She claimed most other

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.320
women in the industry feel the same as her. Then she said she's bisexual and therefore she couldn't

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.040
be homophobic. Then she said fine I guess I'll be fake and not have opinions then. Then she started

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.360
bemoaning how mean Twitter is. And she got really defensive about her right to choose who she had

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:16.720
sex with. And she lashed out at the people attacking her. And then in her final tweet she

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:22.560
just said fuck y'all and went to the park that night and killed herself. This is all so familiar

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.520
to me. I feel like I'm able to relive with her each stage of this emotional process. There's that

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.840
first moment when you realize the outrage is beginning and you get that sinking feeling in

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:37.280
your stomach. And then the anger feeling misunderstood. And then the bargaining the fear

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.960
and finally the shame and the despair. And here's the thing I totally agree with her critics that

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.560
her tweet was bad. Of course she has the right to say no for any reason but she publicly expressed

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.960
this in a homophobic way. But she was still a person who deserves to live. And I think there's

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.600
gotta be a better way to deal with these situations than just trashing someone until they kill

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:04.400
themselves. And I know it's never as simple as Twitter made her kill herself. There's always

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.280
other things going on in the background. But the point I'm making is canceling is more dangerous

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.480
to marginalized people. Because marginalized people generally have more things going on in

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:20.000
the background. John Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death. And it goes into how she

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.880
was sexually abused as a child abandoned by her father. She was living with a boyfriend. She was

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.360
kind of emotionally detached from. And a few weeks earlier she'd filmed a scene with a guy who was

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.800
unnecessarily rough and mean and who mistreated her. So she was kind of traumatized by that. And

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.000
so she was kind of on edge and really defensive about who she worked with when she was tweeting.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.760
Then the backlash happened. And since she had no other support network she probably felt like the

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.120
only community she had turned against her. And that's a really painful feeling. She must have

01:33:51.120 --> 01:34:00.320
felt so despised. Which is how I've felt for the last two months. I feel despised and burdensome.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.840
And I can imagine how a person who feels that way could have an impulsive couple hours where they

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:10.000
think their best option is suicide. I mean I can more than imagine it because I've been there

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.120
myself. And I'm still here because at those moments I've been with good friends who took care

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:23.040
of me. And by friends I do mean Xanax. But I've also survived because there's a lot of people on

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:28.000
the internet who'd be very entertained if I killed myself. And I simply refuse to give them the

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.840
satisfaction. Oh no bitch. I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite. I mean who needs

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.320
a guardian angel when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas on the fumes of total

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.920
contempt. What I'm really trying to say is Merry Christmas you goddamn assholes.

01:34:43.920 --> 01:35:11.920
Oh holy night. The stars are brightly shining.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:21.760
Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. To get my lesbian pliers out again.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.320
Have a super fucking happy new year barge. How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.880
Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub? Leave a comment if you want a bathtub. All right I need

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.440
to take a deep breath because let's be honest. I'm about one crack away from attacking my own

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.800
Twitter followers with an umbrella. I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage and

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.600
making a suit out of women's skin. Just kidding I would never do that. Though on a bad skin day

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:59.360
I've given it serious consideration. Oh I'll be fine. I've gotta sober up anyway because I'm

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.400
having more plastic surgery in a couple days. And plastic surgery? That's about the only thing

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:11.440
holding me together at this point. YouTubing that this is a healthy profession. This is great.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.960
Anyone want my job? Step right up. All you have to do is make informative and entertaining videos

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.520
about extremely controversial topics while of course representing the full range of experiences

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:27.920
in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny. Well go on. I'm

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:33.600
waiting to be entertained. Feed me mother. Oh don't mind me. I'll just sit back and pour another glass

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.360
of wine. Oh and I will of course be obsessively scrutinizing every word you say for any hint of

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.880
moral transgression as well as critiquing your look you third-rate cross-dresser. Zero out of 10.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.160
Get off my stage. He's like please build that everywhere. It's good. I do still want to talk

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.200
about why people cancel and the effect that it's having but it looks like there's gonna have to be

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.880
a part two gorge because I have hit my limit. So why don't we all cut our losses and try again in

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.440
2020. I realize that people on Twitter aren't actually gonna watch this video. They're just

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.400
gonna make fun of the title and how long it is which fair enough but they're the ones whose

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.800
accusations against me are so numerous and convoluted it required a feature length film

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.960
to respond to. But yeah they're gonna see the title and they're gonna transcribe quotes out

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.160
of context and they're gonna say I'm a fascist. I'm a turf. I'm true scum. I'm the new Blair White.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.360
I'm the new Lacey Green. I'm a cis bootlicker. I'm an enlightened centrist. I'm a shit lib.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.560
I'm a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars over the bodies of dead trans women.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:41.040
Mask off. Yikes. This ain't it chief. Friend the reminder that this isn't a good look. Maybe

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.840
don't be a cis bootlicker. Disappointing. But they're saying all those things already so I'm

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.320
inoculated. See their mistake was completely breaking my spirit. They should have left a

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:56.640
little peace intact. But it's good. It's good. It's good because basically my survival from here

01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:07.680
on out hinges on my ability to not care at all what people say about me online. So here's to

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:18.720
not giving a fuck.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:19.840
This is almost a Norma Desmond cosplay. Which is good because I'm not gonna age gracefully.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:28.720
And it's the best to get into character now. YouTube stars never die.
