WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies

00:07.840 --> 00:10.080
rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
Thank you.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.280
It breathed hoarsely.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.640
Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.

00:16.640 --> 00:23.800
I smirked and nodded and stood backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous knuckly,

00:23.800 --> 00:27.160
hairy, brilliant paw that clutched it.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.720
The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the

00:31.720 --> 00:39.960
stubble was already burning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two

00:39.960 --> 00:45.880
pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy

00:45.880 --> 00:51.640
scarf dressed from a polished steel women's liberation emblem.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.560
I should have said, you're a man.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.160
The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
Piss off.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.160
Let's go, adult human females.

01:17.560 --> 01:22.400
First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men

01:22.400 --> 01:25.040
here today, get out.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.640
I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in

01:29.640 --> 01:32.280
which case like, comment, subscribe.

01:32.280 --> 01:37.280
So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary

01:37.280 --> 01:38.280
radical feminists.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.480
You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men

01:42.480 --> 01:46.400
are lost lesbian sisters.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.760
You guys do know about trans men, right?

01:48.760 --> 01:51.520
Male to female is not the only type of transgender person.

01:51.520 --> 01:59.120
It's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned, people who were always,

01:59.120 --> 02:01.520
people who identify.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
TERFs don't like being called TERFs.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.640
They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.

02:05.640 --> 02:10.080
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.960
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal

02:14.960 --> 02:19.200
construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.600
In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating

02:23.600 --> 02:27.040
bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.840
And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I

02:30.840 --> 02:32.000
want to be balanced.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.480
So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who

02:36.480 --> 02:39.400
used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.460
And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences

02:43.460 --> 02:47.960
with men and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and

02:47.960 --> 02:52.160
men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.720
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at

02:55.720 --> 02:59.160
first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.840
It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.

03:02.840 --> 03:06.480
And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
would feel that way.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.240
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.460
And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with

03:15.460 --> 03:19.820
gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue

03:19.820 --> 03:22.700
conversation debate idea, marketplace expression discourse.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.680
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.060
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of germane greer.

03:30.060 --> 03:35.580
And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling extra-biological.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.140
And when the full moon shines, she speaks.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.700
Ugh, this is agony.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.700
I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.700
Can you imagine?

03:47.700 --> 03:51.940
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure

03:51.940 --> 03:53.700
she doesn't hate trans people.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.700
She just has a few concerns.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.740
You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore or you're accused

03:59.740 --> 04:00.740
of transphobia.

04:00.740 --> 04:05.540
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we the public never got

04:05.540 --> 04:06.980
a chance to debate.

04:06.980 --> 04:12.140
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are allowing biological males to run rampant

04:12.140 --> 04:17.580
in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous

04:17.580 --> 04:20.580
dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

04:20.580 --> 04:23.740
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.300
She goes on like that for hours.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.660
It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.660
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

04:30.660 --> 04:33.940
Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.420
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

04:35.420 --> 04:36.940
Scholars remain divided.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.980
It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.500
You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face

04:43.500 --> 04:48.500
consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.060
It's PC Ron Amock.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.380
It's a Hana catastrophe.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.220
Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of

04:56.220 --> 04:57.380
untreated sewage.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.740
We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure.

05:00.740 --> 05:04.380
We have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates

05:04.380 --> 05:08.180
of family rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

05:08.180 --> 05:12.540
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,

05:12.540 --> 05:14.140
unambiguous slogans.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.660
Trans women are women!

05:15.660 --> 05:16.660
Which is true.

05:16.660 --> 05:17.660
We are women.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.420
But, ooh, that was a sinister but.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.420
Watch out for that.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.820
What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most

05:23.820 --> 05:27.460
people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.900
And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not trans feminism,

05:31.900 --> 05:35.380
might wonder things like, how can you be a woman without the oppression experiences

05:35.380 --> 05:36.380
of girlhood?

05:36.380 --> 05:41.860
Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

05:41.860 --> 05:47.460
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

05:47.460 --> 05:50.580
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time, they're

05:50.580 --> 05:52.420
just brandished as weapons against us.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.540
You know, it's like when a man asks, if society is so sexist against women, then why is it

05:56.540 --> 06:00.540
that men are 97% of combat fatalities, feminazis?

06:00.540 --> 06:05.020
Like you could sit there for 3 hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal, but wouldn't

06:05.020 --> 06:07.700
you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

06:07.700 --> 06:11.860
Because 9 times out of 10, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's

06:11.860 --> 06:14.620
just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.420
And the same goes for people telling me,

06:16.420 --> 06:20.740
You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a

06:20.740 --> 06:21.740
woman?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.220
Could you define womanhood for me?

06:23.220 --> 06:26.660
Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

06:26.780 --> 06:30.780
But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,

06:30.780 --> 06:35.180
and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.060
Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.

06:39.060 --> 06:43.420
In this video, I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with

06:43.420 --> 06:47.900
gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers

06:47.900 --> 06:49.660
rather than dogmatic ones.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.180
Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,

06:54.180 --> 06:58.100
and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly.

06:58.100 --> 07:03.100
So if I do fuck something up, well, just read me the filth on Twitter like you always do,

07:03.100 --> 07:04.100
you little shits.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.100
Love you!

07:05.100 --> 07:07.940
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.940
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

07:11.940 --> 07:17.300
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today, only the catch is that some of them are actually

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
men.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.300
Oops, wrong channel.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.220
Concern 1.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.580
Gender Metaphysics.

07:23.580 --> 07:26.900
There's no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.140
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.820
Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.

07:31.820 --> 07:35.220
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.700
Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to

07:38.700 --> 07:42.780
put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.

07:42.780 --> 07:47.380
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?

07:47.380 --> 07:50.620
I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.

07:50.620 --> 07:54.780
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine

07:54.780 --> 07:55.780
habit.

07:55.780 --> 08:02.460
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between binary transgender identity

08:02.460 --> 08:06.540
and cross-sex brain anatomy, but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female

08:06.540 --> 08:09.060
brains and male bodies or anything like that.

08:09.060 --> 08:12.900
Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like grey and

08:12.900 --> 08:18.660
white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies, distinct anatomical structures

08:18.660 --> 08:20.420
like penises and vaginas.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.540
So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.

08:23.540 --> 08:27.540
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the

08:27.540 --> 08:31.580
trans cult, in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man rather than as

08:31.580 --> 08:32.940
always having been a woman.

08:32.940 --> 08:37.500
But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile, I am not

08:37.500 --> 08:38.820
real and not valid.

08:38.820 --> 08:44.140
But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening whether

08:44.140 --> 08:47.300
you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.780
My view is well expressed by Catherine McKinnon.

08:49.780 --> 08:54.020
I always thought, I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man, doesn't matter

08:54.020 --> 08:55.340
to me.

08:55.340 --> 09:00.140
Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,

09:00.140 --> 09:03.900
as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
Concern 2.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.340
Gender stereotypes.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.100
What do you mean you live as a woman?

09:08.100 --> 09:12.460
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly

09:12.460 --> 09:13.460
voice?

09:13.460 --> 09:18.060
Listen, sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.

09:18.060 --> 09:22.780
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.

09:22.780 --> 09:27.140
No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same, rather, we're using

09:27.140 --> 09:32.660
a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.

09:32.660 --> 09:36.220
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand why I'm

09:36.220 --> 09:40.260
presenting in such a meticulously feminine way, like they think I'm wearing ombre lips

09:40.260 --> 09:44.940
at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game, which I am, but also, if one person

09:44.940 --> 09:49.140
calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day, so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti

09:49.140 --> 09:52.700
at the wall in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

09:52.700 --> 09:57.580
I think butcher gender nonconforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyperfeminine trans women

09:57.580 --> 10:01.620
because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle

10:01.620 --> 10:05.860
since childhood against a society that's told them they have to be feminine.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.740
And I completely sympathize with that.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.660
I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.

10:11.660 --> 10:17.060
But also, I've had to fight against the same society that told me I should really, really,

10:17.060 --> 10:18.660
really not be this.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.540
So I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.

10:22.540 --> 10:26.420
Concern three, abolish gender.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.540
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,

10:30.540 --> 10:31.900
not conforming to them.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.060
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.060
Abolish gender?

10:37.060 --> 10:41.780
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give

10:41.780 --> 10:42.780
it a try.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.940
Solanus, be praised.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.740
No nails, no makeup.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.540
I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

10:49.540 --> 10:50.740
I did it, everyone.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.260
I abolished gender.

10:52.260 --> 10:57.260
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier, so I should probably get rid of that.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.260
How is she, though?

10:59.260 --> 11:01.260
She's feeling a little genderless.

11:01.260 --> 11:05.500
I guess the way I positioned my body is still gendered, and there's a gendered cadence to

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
my voice.

11:06.580 --> 11:10.260
So what I'm going to do is just hold my hands up genderlessly and speak in a genderless

11:10.260 --> 11:11.260
robot voice.

11:11.260 --> 11:14.500
My name is 54-664-17.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.700
I have no gender.

11:16.700 --> 11:17.700
Patriarchy is over.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.700
I guess English is still patriarchal language, right?

11:20.700 --> 11:23.820
So I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.060
Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.060
I can't stand this.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.060
Fuck this.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.180
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.

11:30.180 --> 11:34.140
Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth didn't determine what kind of life

11:34.140 --> 11:35.140
you could live?

11:35.140 --> 11:40.420
And that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change, kind of like Abolish Borders.

11:40.420 --> 11:45.100
Your utopian pipe dream is valid, and denying trans people their gender identity because

11:45.100 --> 11:50.580
abolished gender is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because Abolish Borders.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.460
Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable under the present system

11:54.460 --> 11:58.260
and then leveraging that system against them under the pretense of abolishing it.

11:58.260 --> 12:02.180
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,

12:02.220 --> 12:04.820
Why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

12:04.820 --> 12:09.180
You should be abolishing gender, not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

12:09.180 --> 12:13.140
No, they don't attack the gender expression of people with power and influence.

12:13.140 --> 12:17.580
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor, newly out trans woman with 200 followers and

12:17.580 --> 12:21.980
calling her a creepy man and mocking her for being feminine and ineptly or being too feminine

12:21.980 --> 12:23.940
or not being feminine enough.

12:23.940 --> 12:28.900
It's almost like when they say abolish gender, what they really mean is abolish trans people.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.900
It's almost like this is a hate movement hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist

12:32.900 --> 12:33.900
platitudes.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.340
But surely, I must be missing something.

12:40.340 --> 12:44.500
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement that you think you can just

12:44.500 --> 12:48.700
claim womanhood for yourself without living any of the struggle that entails.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.260
So look, I'm a successful white, middle-class trans woman.

12:52.260 --> 12:55.420
In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.

12:55.420 --> 12:59.100
I may not be the one percent, but I am the tranny one percent.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.860
So I don't like to complain about every little microaggression I experience because under

13:02.860 --> 13:06.220
the circumstances, it just seems a little gauche.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.780
And I don't like things that are gauche.

13:08.780 --> 13:12.980
But I've had cis feminists of my race and class tell me that I have no idea what it's

13:12.980 --> 13:19.140
like to be talked over and interrupted by men or to experience street harassment or

13:19.140 --> 13:24.580
to have to treat every first date like a potentially life-threatening situation and it's just bizarre

13:24.580 --> 13:25.820
to me that they think that.

13:25.820 --> 13:28.380
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

13:28.380 --> 13:30.340
You think men treat me as their equal?

13:30.340 --> 13:33.820
You think street harassers are going to treat me with dignity and respect because I have

13:33.820 --> 13:34.820
a Y chromosome?

13:34.820 --> 13:37.460
Hey beautiful, where you going baby?

13:37.460 --> 13:38.460
Where you going?

13:38.460 --> 13:39.460
Oh it's tranny.

13:39.460 --> 13:44.580
Excuse me sir, my mistake, please proceed freely to your destination.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.540
Come on people, use your heads.

13:46.540 --> 13:49.820
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it, what do you think the guy in the

13:49.820 --> 13:51.740
steps of the liquor store is going to say?

13:51.740 --> 13:55.900
When a trans woman doesn't pass, it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

13:55.900 --> 14:01.180
No, you get treated as monster gender, pronouns it and spit, and male privilege is not a good

14:01.180 --> 14:03.380
description of that experience at all.

14:03.380 --> 14:08.020
Once you start passing as a woman, it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,

14:08.020 --> 14:11.340
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

14:11.340 --> 14:15.540
Now gender-critical feminists are really skeptical of the whole notion of passing, they think

14:15.540 --> 14:18.940
they can always clock a tran, and they assume everyone else can too.

14:18.940 --> 14:23.620
But that's just not reality, I mean I'm only a year and a half into my transition,

14:23.620 --> 14:27.740
and at this point I've had zero surgeries, and it's been like six months since I was

14:27.740 --> 14:29.260
last misgendered offline.

14:29.260 --> 14:33.180
I mean a person with a good eye for it will probably clock me, and maybe a lot of people

14:33.180 --> 14:37.380
have just been indoctrinated into politically correct gender ideology, but like, you really

14:37.380 --> 14:41.420
think the gas station attendant and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

14:41.420 --> 14:45.700
are all calling me Miss and Ma'am because of post-modernism?

14:45.700 --> 14:49.180
I know some of you are gonna sneak off to your shitty little rad femme forums and obsess

14:49.180 --> 14:53.860
over how manly and cloggable I am, but like, at the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?

14:53.860 --> 14:59.780
The deranged hateposting of 25 frothing anons, or every social interaction I've had for months?

14:59.780 --> 15:02.260
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.700
I'm Ahi Tuna, and you're a mackerel, sweaty.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.700
Take a fuckin' sip, babes.

15:06.700 --> 15:11.700
I love that.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.100
Concern 5.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.100
Male Socialization.

15:14.420 --> 15:18.540
So you had a male upbringing, you never experienced the traumas of girlhood, you benefited from

15:18.540 --> 15:21.620
male privilege for decades, and now you think none of that matters?

15:21.620 --> 15:25.420
You are who you are because of how you were socialized, not because of how you dress.

15:25.420 --> 15:31.060
Alright, it's time to crack open the nuance.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.020
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.620
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled as a nine year old girl, or what that does

15:36.620 --> 15:37.620
to a child's psyche.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.860
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me till I was an adult, when I knew what

15:40.860 --> 15:44.180
I was getting into and was ready for it, that's very different from what cis women

15:44.180 --> 15:45.180
go through.

15:45.180 --> 15:49.340
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common with a typical man than a typical woman, and

15:49.340 --> 15:54.380
many of my experiences from those days I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

15:54.380 --> 15:58.900
I absolutely benefited from male privilege, and it did influence who I was, and who I

15:58.900 --> 16:03.300
was in my late teens and early twenties was an anti-feminist shithead who had no idea

16:03.300 --> 16:04.300
what women go through.

16:04.300 --> 16:08.220
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that, because in trans discourse it's just

16:08.220 --> 16:12.540
accepted it's obvious that trans men know what it's like to be raised as women, and

16:12.540 --> 16:15.380
to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

16:15.380 --> 16:18.740
But when it comes to the early life experiences of trans women, we're supposed to say,

16:18.740 --> 16:22.540
when I was five years old I loved wearing my mom's high heels, or else say nothing

16:22.540 --> 16:23.540
at all.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.880
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath, where she describes the way living

16:26.880 --> 16:31.620
as a woman stifles an adventurous spirit, and her longing for a male experience.

16:31.620 --> 16:38.300
Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom

16:38.300 --> 16:44.260
regulars, to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.

16:44.260 --> 16:50.980
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl, a female, always supposedly in danger

16:50.980 --> 16:53.060
of assault and battery.

16:53.060 --> 16:59.220
My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce

16:59.220 --> 17:02.100
them, or as an invitation to intimacy.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.900
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

17:06.900 --> 17:13.300
I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.

17:13.300 --> 17:18.000
So I got to do all that in my early twenties, and what I discovered is, I hate sleeping

17:18.000 --> 17:23.660
in open fields, I despise the west, and I'd really rather stay inside collecting ceramics

17:23.660 --> 17:24.660
and sucking dick.

17:24.660 --> 17:27.940
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman, and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is

17:27.940 --> 17:32.400
a man because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews for reasons that are inconceivable

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
to me.

17:33.400 --> 17:38.060
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties, I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,

17:38.060 --> 17:43.020
body and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me, and I tried every possible alternative

17:43.020 --> 17:47.340
to transitioning before realizing that I had an irrepressible need to become a woman.

17:47.340 --> 17:52.300
So I changed, and when I changed, society's treatment of me changed.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.380
Socialization doesn't end with childhood, it's a lifelong process.

17:55.380 --> 18:00.340
For example, when I transitioned, my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers, and radical

18:00.340 --> 18:05.060
feminist haters started commenting on my physical appearance about twenty to thirty times more

18:05.060 --> 18:08.860
often, and I had to get used to that being something that matters a lot more.

18:08.860 --> 18:14.060
That said, resocialization takes time, and sometimes trans people who are early in transition

18:14.060 --> 18:15.820
have most of that process ahead of them.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.780
I also think we have to take into account the age at which a person transitions.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.380
Kim Petras, who must we stan,

18:21.380 --> 18:22.380
Oh we stan!

18:22.380 --> 18:23.380
We stan!

18:23.380 --> 18:24.380
I stan!

18:24.380 --> 18:25.380
We stan!

18:25.380 --> 18:29.020
She transitioned as a child, and I imagine was socialized more or less the same as a

18:29.020 --> 18:30.020
cis woman.

18:30.020 --> 18:34.780
Whereas Caitlyn Jenner humps, well, just humps.

18:34.780 --> 18:39.100
She made millions of dollars in men's sports, she had six children by three wives, she transitioned

18:39.100 --> 18:43.660
in retirement at age 65, and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman is

18:43.660 --> 18:46.620
figuring out what to wear.

18:46.620 --> 18:50.220
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of, it makes me want to cry.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.700
Like I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman, but I am saying that anyone who wants

18:53.700 --> 18:57.580
to argue that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective doesn't have a leg to stand

18:57.580 --> 18:58.580
on.

18:58.580 --> 19:03.420
But also, trans women often don't experience male socialization the way cis men do.

19:03.420 --> 19:07.340
Many trans women are feminine and queer before they transition, and have always experienced

19:07.340 --> 19:10.020
a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.

19:10.020 --> 19:14.140
Some trans women also identified as women years before transitioning, and internalized

19:14.140 --> 19:18.060
society's messaging about women more than society's messaging about men.

19:18.060 --> 19:22.060
Now that's still not the same as living in society as a girl from birth, but it's also

19:22.060 --> 19:24.980
pretty different from the socialization of most cis men.

19:24.980 --> 19:28.980
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue that trans women never experience

19:28.980 --> 19:34.780
male privilege is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege as a proxy for calling us men.

19:34.780 --> 19:38.180
Pull up your zipper, your male privilege is hanging out.

19:38.180 --> 19:42.620
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point for many gender-critical feminists

19:42.620 --> 19:47.060
is that there's an element here of stolen valor, this sense of injustice that people

19:47.060 --> 19:50.260
are claiming their identity without experiencing their oppression.

19:50.260 --> 19:54.420
It reminds me of what in the trans community are called trans medicalists.

19:54.420 --> 19:58.580
People who insist the only real trans people are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

19:58.580 --> 20:04.220
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing that confirms your identity is pain.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.620
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

20:06.620 --> 20:10.260
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.260
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

20:12.260 --> 20:13.820
You don't know what it's like.

20:13.820 --> 20:17.140
You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying that you don't know what it's like

20:17.140 --> 20:21.180
to occupy an identity so stigmatized that most of the people who are attracted to you

20:21.180 --> 20:24.100
in private are too ashamed to admit it in public.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.140
You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative that you're shut out

20:27.140 --> 20:28.660
of whole areas of society.

20:28.660 --> 20:33.260
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest does nothing but to provoke

20:33.260 --> 20:37.940
infighting between trans women and cis women at a time when we should be marching side-by-side

20:37.940 --> 20:41.380
to destroy video games forever, hashtag Yes All Gamers.

20:41.380 --> 20:45.540
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

20:45.540 --> 20:48.860
You don't know what it's like to grow up being shamed for your periods, to fear

20:48.860 --> 20:54.340
unwanted pregnancy, to have to fight for your right to abortion, to bear the pain of childbirth.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.580
Well, yeah, that's true.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.900
My inner rad femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

21:00.900 --> 21:05.020
I do think it's important for trans women to stand in solidarity with cis women on issues

21:05.020 --> 21:08.940
like period equity and abortion rights, and to learn about the experiences of cis women

21:08.940 --> 21:11.580
to form a more complete understanding of the female condition.

21:11.900 --> 21:16.740
But of course, no individual woman experiences all the things women experience, and individual

21:16.740 --> 21:20.220
women understand the meaning of womanhood in drastically different ways.

21:20.220 --> 21:23.860
For some women, having babies is the most essentially womanly experience.

21:23.860 --> 21:26.100
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.980
I mean, not actually, but you know, TERFs pretended it is to own the trannies.

21:29.980 --> 21:34.740
For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails in my business inbox from married men struggling

21:34.740 --> 21:38.980
through the existential crisis of some kind of she-male-themed sexual awakening.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.500
Also, do you want to be a guest on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?

21:42.500 --> 21:47.380
But also, not all women experience their womanhood as essentially oppressive, or centered around

21:47.380 --> 21:49.100
the pain of reproductive capacity.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.580
When Shania Twain sang, Man, I Feel Like a Woman, she wasn't talking about having a

21:52.580 --> 21:56.300
coat hanger abortion in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.060
Man, I feel like shit.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.460
Concern 7 Erasing Female Vocabulary

22:04.460 --> 22:08.940
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss women's bodies and women's

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
oppression.

22:09.940 --> 22:14.100
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people and menstruators just to appease the

22:14.100 --> 22:15.100
gender ideologues.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.580
Well, I for one am not a menstruator.

22:18.580 --> 22:23.860
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.

22:23.860 --> 22:28.900
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people and are thinking, what

22:28.900 --> 22:32.780
the fuck kind of Orwellian noose-beak gender cuckoldry is that?

22:32.780 --> 22:33.780
Take a deep breath.

22:33.940 --> 22:34.940
Clear your mind.

22:34.940 --> 22:35.940
Here's the tea.

22:35.940 --> 22:39.700
Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term pregnant people instead of

22:39.700 --> 22:40.700
pregnant women.

22:40.700 --> 22:44.980
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators in a tweet about the repeal

22:44.980 --> 22:46.420
of a tampon talks.

22:46.420 --> 22:50.580
This has prompted some conservative, turf, and Christian publications to post panicked

22:50.580 --> 22:54.100
commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

22:54.100 --> 22:59.140
But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman erases

22:59.140 --> 23:02.700
trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.

23:02.740 --> 23:07.540
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them, whereas saying pregnant people includes

23:07.540 --> 23:12.620
them answers women and doesn't erase anyone, except for Cincinnatians, because we all know

23:12.620 --> 23:13.620
they're not people.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.220
Take your shitty chili elsewhere.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.500
I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.

23:17.500 --> 23:21.300
What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

23:21.300 --> 23:26.100
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing, and the trans

23:26.100 --> 23:29.180
men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.

23:29.180 --> 23:33.660
Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable, and my

23:33.660 --> 23:37.020
prediction is that menstruators is not going to work out.

23:37.020 --> 23:38.260
Maybe people who menstruate?

23:38.260 --> 23:40.100
But why can't I just say woman?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.300
That's what I am.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.100
You can't just say woman.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.580
That is what you are.

23:45.580 --> 23:49.500
No one is asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.380
Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

23:53.380 --> 23:58.340
No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expected mothers.

23:58.340 --> 24:01.180
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

24:01.180 --> 24:04.060
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

24:04.060 --> 24:07.780
I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.460
Oh, I am definitely suggesting that.

24:10.460 --> 24:14.500
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss

24:14.500 --> 24:15.620
our own bodies.

24:15.620 --> 24:20.860
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods, or wearing pussy hats

24:20.860 --> 24:24.420
at political marches, or free bleeding all over the national mall.

24:24.420 --> 24:28.140
I mean someone has to, the national mall is not going to bleed on itself.

24:28.140 --> 24:32.380
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy and

24:32.380 --> 24:36.460
defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

24:36.460 --> 24:40.620
The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender

24:40.620 --> 24:43.900
trans men or exclude wombs whom stuff not bleed.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.580
I mean trans women do bleed, but only when we cut ourselves.

24:47.580 --> 24:53.620
No one knows what it's like to be a satrian.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.580
Concern 8.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.500
Turf is a slur.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.060
Turf is a slur designed to silence women.

25:01.060 --> 25:04.900
Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.

25:04.900 --> 25:09.820
The word turf is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,

25:09.820 --> 25:11.140
but it's not a slur.

25:11.140 --> 25:15.860
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.

25:15.860 --> 25:20.380
The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations, and is often used

25:20.380 --> 25:22.580
as an insult, but it's not a slur.

25:22.580 --> 25:26.060
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.

25:26.060 --> 25:30.620
The same is true of the word turf, it's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors

25:30.620 --> 25:32.620
that deserve to be derogated.

25:32.620 --> 25:37.940
The term gender critical is really a euphemism, recently created to replace turf with a phrase

25:37.940 --> 25:40.380
that doesn't have such negative connotations.

25:40.380 --> 25:45.020
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist, which was invented by racists wanting

25:45.020 --> 25:48.060
a more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.

25:48.060 --> 25:52.500
I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence sitters, but

25:52.500 --> 25:57.220
I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms, and I generally

25:57.220 --> 25:58.780
do the same with turfs.

25:58.780 --> 26:04.020
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person, I usually like to call people by whatever

26:04.020 --> 26:08.380
they want to be called, but when it comes to race realist or gender critical, every

26:08.380 --> 26:12.540
time I use these phrases I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to

26:12.540 --> 26:13.940
legitimize bigotry.

26:13.940 --> 26:19.060
But I have especially little patience for turf requests for linguistic decorum, since

26:19.060 --> 26:25.100
most of the language used by turfs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful, harmful,

26:25.100 --> 26:26.780
and insulting to trans people.

26:26.780 --> 26:32.060
For instance, turfs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.

26:32.060 --> 26:38.380
They call trans women tims, an acronym for trans-identified males, and trans men tiffs,

26:38.380 --> 26:43.100
trans-identified females, obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

26:43.100 --> 26:47.380
To give you a sample of typical turf prose, here are a couple comments from literally

26:47.380 --> 26:51.700
the first thread I saw on the gender critical subreddit while I was working on this video.

26:51.700 --> 26:57.540
And I have to admit to considering more contempt for the likes of s***, since he makes a point

26:57.540 --> 27:03.420
of taking selfies with ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

27:03.420 --> 27:08.460
I also get a good love at tims putting their hands up to their shins, they're trying

27:08.460 --> 27:13.620
to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple, but it only draws more attention to

27:13.620 --> 27:16.020
their enormous man hands.

27:16.020 --> 27:21.420
I saw an AGP photoshoot with his knee under fall and his fifties was closing with one

27:21.420 --> 27:26.180
leg up like a flamingo, his hands dainty at his ear.

27:26.180 --> 27:34.300
In every photo, even group ones at events, now I was just grossed out.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.780
So there it is, that's what this is really about.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.500
In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns and I've provided

27:40.500 --> 27:45.140
responses I hope the average person will find fair, but I would be lying to you by omission

27:45.140 --> 27:49.300
if I were to end this video without being real with you about what the core of the gender

27:49.300 --> 27:52.260
critical movement is actually about.

27:52.260 --> 27:57.060
See what turfs do in public is advance what, on the surface, are a series of feminist critiques

27:57.060 --> 27:58.140
of trans people.

27:58.140 --> 28:02.540
For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes

28:02.540 --> 28:03.900
designed to oppress women.

28:04.060 --> 28:08.100
At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present

28:08.100 --> 28:09.100
themselves.

28:09.100 --> 28:13.220
But in the next breath, these same turfs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine

28:13.220 --> 28:16.780
perverts who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.

28:16.780 --> 28:21.380
So if trans women being feminine is bad, and trans women being masculine is bad, then there

28:21.380 --> 28:25.540
really is no way that trans women could behave that turfs would accept.

28:25.540 --> 28:30.020
So in fact, what turfs really oppose is not trans women being feminine or trans women

28:30.020 --> 28:33.580
being masculine, but trans women being trans women.

28:33.580 --> 28:39.820
In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia, simple

28:39.820 --> 28:43.180
animosity towards trans people's very existence.

28:43.180 --> 28:47.220
And it's pretty easy to recognize that just from the tone they use when they talk about

28:47.220 --> 28:48.220
us.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.820
When you read through the gender critical subreddit or turf twitter, what you see is

28:51.820 --> 28:57.780
just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes draped over a jagged thorn-tangle of visceral

28:57.780 --> 28:59.780
disgust and targeted hate.

28:59.780 --> 29:04.620
The pure exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Jermaine Greer quote

29:04.620 --> 29:08.620
from the opening of this video or in the average gender critical forum post.

29:08.620 --> 29:14.500
The enormous, snuckly, hairy, be-ringed paw, the pancake makeup through which the stubble

29:14.500 --> 29:20.200
was already burgeoning, this Neanderthal in his fifties, ridiculous, insulting-to-women

29:20.200 --> 29:21.700
facial expressions.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.060
Now I was just grossed out.

29:24.060 --> 29:29.740
What gender critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations

29:29.740 --> 29:33.260
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

29:33.260 --> 29:35.820
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

29:35.820 --> 29:39.540
You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate, and

29:39.540 --> 29:44.300
the arguments people made that marriage was under attack, that the children would be traumatized,

29:44.300 --> 29:48.820
that bestiality would be next, that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions

29:48.820 --> 29:52.540
with their outrageous demands, it was all just nonsense.

29:52.540 --> 29:57.260
If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do, Sylvia I wish I could give

29:57.260 --> 30:01.420
you what I had, he would just blurt out the truth, which was that the sight of two grown

30:01.420 --> 30:05.100
men locking lips made him want to vomit.

30:05.100 --> 30:08.220
Comophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.

30:08.220 --> 30:11.180
They come from the lizard brain disgust response.

30:11.180 --> 30:17.300
We evolved to deal with blood, infection, vomit, feces, flies, the hairy paw, the stubble

30:17.300 --> 30:20.060
burgeoning through the pancake makeup, bleh.

30:20.060 --> 30:24.900
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance, because it's the same disgust I felt toward

30:24.900 --> 30:26.980
myself for years.

30:26.980 --> 30:31.500
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five

30:31.500 --> 30:36.260
years ago and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.

30:36.260 --> 30:39.620
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

30:39.620 --> 30:44.820
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia, because transphobia is always

30:44.820 --> 30:45.820
the same.

30:45.820 --> 30:49.860
It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of

30:49.860 --> 30:50.860
ways.

30:50.860 --> 30:55.220
I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops, where a police

30:55.220 --> 30:59.380
officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

30:59.380 --> 31:04.260
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her, deadnames her, mocks her

31:04.260 --> 31:06.580
clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.

31:06.580 --> 31:11.900
It's also repetitive and familiar, it's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in

31:11.900 --> 31:17.580
the right-wing press on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all

31:17.580 --> 31:18.580
the same.

31:18.580 --> 31:22.820
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair is her unbreakable wit and confidence in

31:22.820 --> 31:24.660
the face of transphobic abuse.

31:24.660 --> 31:28.980
The single most iconic moment is when, after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid

31:28.980 --> 31:33.340
a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering, she glances back at the cop and says,

31:33.340 --> 31:35.340
Excuse my beauty.

31:35.340 --> 31:36.340
Excuse your beauty.

31:36.340 --> 31:37.340
Okay.

31:37.340 --> 31:43.180
That right there is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture, the resilience of

31:43.180 --> 31:48.580
trans women, the assumption of a regal posture, and even the most abject conditions.

31:48.580 --> 31:53.380
And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out

31:53.380 --> 31:54.380
of bigotry.

31:54.380 --> 32:00.420
So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this, what else can I say except,

32:00.420 --> 32:04.420
on behalf of all trans women, excuse my beauty, TERF.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.340
Thank you very much.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.340
Thank you.

32:09.340 --> 32:10.340
Thank you.

32:10.340 --> 32:11.340
Thank you.

32:11.340 --> 32:12.340
Thank you.

32:12.340 --> 32:13.340
Thank you.

32:13.340 --> 32:14.340
Thank you.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.340
Thank you.

32:15.340 --> 32:16.340
Thank you.

32:16.340 --> 32:17.340
Thank you.

32:17.340 --> 32:18.340
Thank you.

32:18.340 --> 32:19.340
Thank you.

32:19.340 --> 32:20.340
Thank you.

32:20.340 --> 32:21.340
Thank you.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.340
Thank you.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.340
Thank you.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.340
Thank you.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.340
Thank you.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.340
Thank you.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.340
Thank you.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.340
Thank you.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.340
Thank you.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.340
Thank you.

32:30.340 --> 32:31.340
Thank you.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.340
Thank you.

32:32.340 --> 32:33.340
Thank you.

32:33.340 --> 32:34.340
Thank you.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.340
Thank you.

32:36.340 --> 32:37.340
Thank you.

32:37.340 --> 32:38.340
Thank you.

32:38.340 --> 32:39.340
Thank you.

32:39.340 --> 32:40.340
Thank you.

32:40.340 --> 32:41.340
Thank you.

32:41.340 --> 32:42.340
Thank you.

32:42.340 --> 32:43.340
Thank you.

32:43.340 --> 32:44.340
I really appreciate it.

32:44.340 --> 32:45.340
It's been a long time.

32:45.340 --> 32:46.340
A long time.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.340
We'll see you later.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.340
Don't laugh.

32:48.340 --> 32:49.340
Please do it.

32:49.340 --> 32:50.340
Thank you.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.340
Thank you.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.340
Bye.

32:52.340 --> 32:53.340
Bye.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.340
Bye.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.340
Bye.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.340
Bye.

32:57.340 --> 32:58.340
Bye.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.340
Bye.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.340
Bye.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.340
Bye.

33:01.340 --> 33:02.340
Bye.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.340
Bye.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.840
Okay, that's so stupid.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.840
That's so stupid.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.540
Run it, hey Mark.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.380
Corona Premiere.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.220
Well done.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.860
Turf beer of choice.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.460
My chromosomes need to unwind

33:14.460 --> 33:16.880
after a hard day of heating trans people.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.820
It is absol-

33:20.820 --> 33:23.300
These titties, I just saw them and I just lost it.

33:23.300 --> 33:26.020
I just, it's just, what?

33:26.020 --> 33:28.540
I am a W-M-B-Y-N.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.340
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.180
B-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.020
No one knows what it's like

33:39.020 --> 33:41.700
to be a side tran,

33:41.700 --> 33:44.140
to be a trash can,

33:44.140 --> 33:46.380
for trap chasers jizz.

33:47.740 --> 33:48.580
Perfect.
