0	11800	Imagine how a woman feels. Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. Imagine the sweet
11800	18940	smell of her perfume. Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours. Imagine
18940	24500	her letting you get on top of her and insert your **** inside her, softly moaning as it
24500	33780	slides in. Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm **** wrapped around every inch
33780	40260	of your ****. Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust. Imagine her wrapping
40260	46380	her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly can and begging you
46380	54940	to **** inside her as you release every ounce of your **** into her. Then imagine the feeling
54940	62700	of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking beside you to see a
62700	73380	person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way possible. You
73380	81820	will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in
81820	93100	your face are not the proper shape. Have a nice day.
93100	105900	Hello, boys. Let's talk about bone structure. There's something basically Soviet about the way
105900	111740	the internet names things. Stalin had portmanteaus like Ajitprop, Politburo, and Compromat, and we
111740	118100	have webinar, podcast, and incel, short for involuntary celibate. The word incel was invented
118100	123140	in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created a website called Alana's
123140	129060	Involuntary Celibacy Project. It was essentially a safe space for people who just couldn't get it
129060	134220	in. But in our own miserable moment of internet history, the word incel refers to a more specific
134220	140540	community of mostly heterosexual men centered around forums like incel.me and r slash brain
140540	145340	cells. This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they've been
145340	149940	churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies. But most incels aren't
149940	155300	violent killers, they're just men who've formed an identity around not getting laid. In this video
155300	160660	I don't want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them, I just want to understand
160660	165420	who they are and why they're like this. To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a
165420	172020	person's world is to learn their language. And the language of the incelsâ€¦ well, you'll see.
172660	179380	First base, incels. Does it ever bother you that the word women makes adult females sound just a
179380	187660	little bit too human? Well, incels have a solution to that. They've taken to calling women female.
187660	192260	The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women, not as sisters or mothers and
192260	197180	certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign and scruitable object comparable to a
197180	202100	natural resource, unobtenium, to which incels believe all men are entitled and to which they
202100	206660	feel they have been unjustly denied. There's a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women
206660	212620	in nerdily misogynistic ways, and reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun's remark
212620	220460	about female astronauts. We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.
220460	225700	Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, but simply that nerds
225700	231660	have a nerdy style of misogyny. Now, femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have for women,
231660	236500	and it's only downhill from there. There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores,
236500	242300	all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented
242300	247820	by the bespoke incel coinage, roasty. Which I'm sorry to inform you refers to the incel belief
247820	252740	that the human vulva become mutilated through repeated penetration by different men, though
252740	257060	not through repeated penetration by the same man, interestingly, and thereby come to resemble
257060	262300	roast beef. Now, by definition, incels haven't actually observed any vaginas, but to incels,
262300	266580	anatomy is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science. Though,
266580	274340	if you ask me, the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes. Of course,
274340	279340	not all femoids are created equal. There are various subspecies.
279780	287020	The becky or normie femoid is to be contrasted with the stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,
287020	293900	whose distinguishing features include makeup on point, never works a day in her life,
293900	301340	naturally curvy body gives men instant erections, big tips and ass show fertility.
301340	306260	Leave my buns alone, you savages. The stacy, naturally, has a male counterpart,
306420	314500	whom incels call the chad. A chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared to grab
314500	321940	nearby fertile pussy. He has never heard a song in his entire life. He has a sloped forehead with
321940	330660	a strong brow, ram bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate. It must needs be remarked
330660	338660	that the skull of the chad exhibited a brow ridge most pronounced, whereas the skull of the virgin
338660	346900	is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation
346900	352020	and cuckoldry. It's time to talk about bone structure, according to a classic incel meme.
352020	359140	The difference between chad and non-chad is literally a few millimeters of bone.
359140	365300	I would like to propose a sociological theory. Fappington's Law. Once bigotry or self-loathing
365300	370340	permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance
370340	377060	is assigned to the shape of human skulls. Why skulls, you ask? Well, the best explanation I
377060	383220	can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable. It's therefore the perfect symbol of
383220	388580	the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.
388580	393140	If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,
393140	397860	you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying,
397860	403700	well, that's the reason why. It's just nature. There's nothing that can be done about it. And
403700	409540	that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy. Mankind is divided into two groups
409540	414820	of people, the chads with the fuckable skulls and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters
414820	421700	short. Corn dog? Anyone? I'm really hungry. Of course, it's not just the skulls the incels
421700	426100	blame for their sexlessness. They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of
426100	431540	involuntary celibacy. Height cells are incel due to their inferior stature, whereas mental cells
431540	437060	can't attract women because of mental illness or autism or their addicts and then called drug cells.
437620	443380	Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists. Now obsessing about
443380	449220	your wrist size does seem a little weird. Oh, yeah? Is it a little weird that the average dildo
449220	455140	has more girth than my wrist? Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?
455140	460580	But yeah, obviously obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's
460580	465380	is completely irrational body dysmorphia. And the reason why no one wants to be with me or even
465380	471460	talk to me is my shitty personality. Even though literal 80 IQ men who have nothing to talk about
471460	478420	except who won the game last night are still able to attract a loving partner. Interesting.
478420	483300	A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed to
483300	490580	race and they are accordingly termed apologies in advance, black cells, rice cells, curry cells,
490580	495700	and so on. Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate. There are of course the occasional
495700	500820	chads of color with their superior skulls and towering stature, whom the incels have christened
500820	508260	tyrones, changs, and chad priests. I'm so sorry. So you can be incel because of your looks,
508260	513140	your height, your mind, or your race, but what unites them all is the conviction that love and
513140	518660	sex are forever out of reach. Unless of course you delusionally imagine that you can ascend,
518660	523700	that is escape your incel dome. If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any
523700	529940	possibility of improvement, well that makes you the lowest of the low. A sad and sorry hope cell.
531060	536420	Second base, the red pill. So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview,
536420	542340	the stasis, the chads, the incels, and the normies. From these elements, incels have constructed a
542340	548420	theory of human nature and sexuality, which they call the red pill. Incels share the red pill
548420	553220	worldview with the rest of the manosphere, that is, pickup artists, men's rights activists,
553220	558340	and the voluntary celibate community known as men going their own way, abbreviated MGTOW.
558340	563860	According to red pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous. Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying
563860	569060	above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one's social status,
569060	575220	and also an incel usage above one's attractiveness. According to incels, physical attractiveness is
575220	580580	naturally distributed equally between the sexes, so if you were to assign numerical ratings to
580580	586500	attractiveness, as incels like to do, there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women as 8 out
586580	591780	of 10 men. Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a
591780	598340	relationship with his looks match, that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.
598340	603860	But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their own
603860	609620	attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad. Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule,
609620	615300	the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women. Now, since most heterosexual
615300	619940	men do end up in relationships with women, you might be raising your eyebrow with that idea.
619940	625300	But incels have an explanation. According to the Red Bull theory, women often pursue a mating
625300	631780	strategy called alpha-fucks-beta-box. This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say,
631780	636980	ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many Chads as possible. But as she ages into her 30s,
636980	641620	she will settle down with a beta normie whom she's not really attracted to, but whom she will use for
641620	646900	financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha-cock carousel before
646900	651220	inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he's worth on a divorce settlement, and running
651220	655620	off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new Chad boyfriend, while the beta cock is left
655620	661140	behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty. So the upshot of the Red Bull theory
661140	666100	is that for men, there are three possible outcomes. Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of
666100	670980	excruciating loneliness and resentment, or you're a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage
671060	675380	with an unfaithful wife who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your
675380	682420	money. Or you could be an alpha, an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women
682420	687700	and forms attachments to none of them. In the Red Bull philosophy, there are two ways to become alpha.
687700	692900	The first is simply to be a Chad by nature. The second is to become a pickup artist.
692900	697300	Red Bull pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,
697380	702900	that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable. The difference is
702900	707620	that pickup artists are not celibate. In fact, they try to have sex with as many women as possible
707620	712580	by following a series of strategies and scripts known as game, as described by the book of that
712580	719300	title, as well as by the Red Bull pickup artist Ruch V, author of a book called Bang! A New Mascara
719300	726100	from Benefit. So the tube is bomb. I am living. Let's see what the wand looks like. Oh,
727780	734180	it's so big. I wonder what Ruch is up to lately. I bake my own bread. Yes, I am outing myself as
734180	740340	a baker, as someone who likes to cook. I'm not a woman. I am ultra masculine, as you can see,
740340	745940	but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing. And men like scientific things. I used to
746100	751860	be a scientist. Well, Ruch, you know what? If it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy
751860	758020	your new life as an ultra masculine baker. Sorry, I mean bread scientist. So remember,
758020	762580	the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20% or less of men are
762580	767140	really attractive to women, dating as a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for
767140	772180	enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence.
772180	776340	The black pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace is
776340	780580	genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever
780580	784580	out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can do
784580	790420	except lie down and rot. The black pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating
790420	795620	and about life in general. It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing,
795620	799940	a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic
799940	804980	conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties. For instance, a catastrophizing person might
804980	808660	begin with the thought, oh no, I'm going to be late for work, and from there infer,
808660	812740	my boss is going to be angry, I'm going to lose my job, I'm not going to be able to get another job,
812740	816340	I'm going to be unemployed forever, my family will starve, oh god we're all going to die.
816340	821620	Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is
821620	826420	completely absurd. This is exactly how the black pill works. You start with experiences of rejection
826420	830580	and isolation. From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never
830580	834340	be attractive to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy,
834340	838020	that women did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the
838020	841780	social trends that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and
841780	845860	your only option is to lie down and rot. Of course, not all incels take things quite so far,
845860	851060	but a lot of them do. On incel forums suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often
851060	855780	tagged sua fuel or rope fuel, meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because
855780	859940	they're reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that
859940	864900	incels are missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance. Now if you suggest to incels that
864900	870580	posting sua fuel on forums already populated by lonely and depressed people is maybe not the most
870580	876180	responsible idea, they respond that oh it's just dark humor, it's just a cope, throws a bone here.
876180	880740	But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people express
880740	884900	pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness is the
884900	889620	logical conclusion of the black pill world video. One's possibility for happiness is determined by
889620	894020	the genetics of height, frame, and facial bone structure, and if you don't have these gifts,
894020	899060	there's no relief but to cope or rope. Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these
899060	903780	kids. You want to grab them by their black ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there
903780	907060	are millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're their
907060	910820	own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some friends,
910820	914980	stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows, maybe they'll develop a disposition
914980	919540	that women find a little more approachable. Essentially you want to tell them clean your
919540	923620	room bucko. In fact for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of
923620	928500	advice, Jordan Peterson is probably helpful because he's telling them a lot of what they need to hear
928500	933220	and he's kind of a sexist old man so they might actually listen. But most incels don't want to
933220	938420	hear this kind of advice. In fact they view it as essentially a microaggression. You are in effect
938420	943140	Chad explaining their oppression to them when you give basic advice like take a shower, be more
943140	948100	confident, to people who have already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation and who
948100	953060	believe they've already tried everything. So they despise this kind of advice and devote endless
953060	958820	posts to bitterly mocking the futility and insensitivity of it. Just go out to parties bro.
958820	963220	Instead of hating on women all day why don't you losers just try being confident like this average
963220	969060	looking guy. Confidence is key. You incels need some hobbies. Try reading some books.
969060	974180	Women love intelligence. It works for me bro. Aw you just need to get out more.
974180	982260	No one knows what it's like to be hated. To incels their worldview seems iron clad.
982260	985780	It has built in defenses against anyone who would try to change their minds.
985780	989940	So if you want to understand incels and in particular if you want to understand why their
989940	994740	community produces so many mass murderers you have to understand that the black pill
994740	999780	is more than the dogma that you can't get laid. It's also the dogma that because you can't get
999780	1004340	laid you can never be happy. So what we have in our hands here is more than a bunch of angry
1004340	1010340	internet misogynists. It's at worst a kind of death cult complete with an eternal hell and
1010340	1015620	an omnipotent enemy. It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude
1015700	1019860	that since triumph is impossible why not try revenge?
1020980	1026820	Third base. Tinder is garbage. I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels and I
1026820	1032020	know they don't want my sympathy anyway and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil
1032020	1036900	but on some level I can't help it. The internet is for introverts so I'm sure a lot of people
1036900	1041940	watching this feel the same way. I bet some of you have been this guy. I have been this guy.
1041940	1046180	So look I'm gonna tell you something I've never really come out about on this channel so this is
1046180	1053300	like a really vulnerable moment for me but I used to live as a man and I'm not proud of that but
1053300	1058180	I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive. I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who
1058180	1064180	dates men who used to be a man who dates women. What kind of fucked up shit is that? Is that even
1064180	1070420	allowed? Alright cop down lesbian stans I'm still attracted to women and those who lies betwixt.
1070420	1073140	Cats. The inherent eroticism of the sea.
1075460	1082740	Yeah don't you just want to get in there? Take me mommy. But I have been on a heterosexual kick
1082740	1088420	lately. I gotta get my hetero on. What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women
1088420	1094020	and as a woman seeking men and I think that gives me some relevant experiences. When you're a man
1094020	1098900	the strategy is you've got to send a lot of messages because women get a lot of messages
1098900	1103860	and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuck boys. Whereas if you're a
1103860	1111140	woman you get to lie recumbent on your chaise log and receive the inquiries. Let's see how we're
1111140	1116260	doing here. How many men have liked me on Tinder? I'm paying $30 for this information so this better
1116260	1123620	be good. I have 2,500 likes. That's a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran.
1123620	1125060	What a divine city.
1129940	1134740	Aw that's so nice of them to be interested in me. Let's see what kind of messages I got.
1134740	1142420	Dick or no dick. Preoper post op. Did you cut your dick off? Oh my god. I'm gonna cut it off
1142420	1150100	okay Jesus. I will let you smash my pussy so so hard. If you just be patient. It's a whole process.
1150100	1155380	That's not a pussy. That's a fuckhole. You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of
1155380	1161860	your sacred passage. Well that's true. I am not going to be squeezing any life out unless something
1161860	1166820	goes very seriously wrong and I assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever
1166820	1173380	been or ever will be sacred. Abigail, leave my fuckhole out of this. When I first started using
1173380	1177220	this app I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill. He was going to take me to a concert.
1177220	1182500	I was like seems like a lot for a first day but we'll try it. 15 minutes after we agreed to that
1183140	1189220	he sends me a message. What color panties are you wearing? I would love to smell them.
1192820	1197620	Can we get coffee first? The hell of it is. I probably would have let him smell my panties
1197620	1202180	but this is the thing you bring up on the third fuck. You don't open with panty sniffing. Like the
1202180	1205700	only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're gonna murder me
1205700	1209700	and you're already fucking it up. So this is the experience of women on tinder. We're drowning in
1209700	1214900	dick and most of it is terrible. Not all. I do have some very sweet messages and I haven't been
1214900	1219380	using the app in a couple months so if I didn't respond to you or if we didn't match it's not
1219380	1225380	because I rejected you. It's because I don't like the app. People screenshot my profile and they
1225380	1230980	post it online and they call me cotra points and like aren't I just too famous for this shit? My
1230980	1236980	life is hard. So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that's
1236980	1241860	constantly pointed at us in dating apps but how would you feel if instead of that you were just
1241860	1246900	getting radio silence like the incels get? I can't speak for other women but personally
1248100	1253540	I prefer the firing squad of dicks, you know? At least these pricks care enough about my pussy
1253540	1258580	to be an asshole about my dick. I feel sorry for men on dating apps. I really do. You have to deal
1258660	1262820	with a lot of rejection and that must be difficult and these apps are especially brutal to people who
1262820	1267060	aren't photogenic. If you're meeting people at a bar or a party you might strike up a conversation
1267060	1271620	with someone who you're not initially physically attracted to but then maybe they're super funny
1271620	1276420	or charming or maybe they're attracted to me and that's an attractive quality in another person
1276420	1282740	that they appreciate how beautiful I am. But on Tinder you're just browsing a catalog of faces
1282740	1287460	and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place. Red pillars have a really gross
1287460	1293140	way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value but like dating kind of is a
1293140	1297940	marketplace or at least you can analyze it like one and our culture is so visual these apps are
1297940	1303620	so picture-centered that bone structure like it's not the only thing that matters but it matters a
1303620	1308900	great deal. And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels because as a trans woman I know
1308900	1313860	what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone. I actually had to interrupt work on this video to
1313860	1318980	go to a consultation for facial feminization surgery so I can pay luxury car amounts of money
1318980	1324740	to shave off a few millimeters of bone hair there because it must needs be remarked that the skull
1324740	1329540	of the female exhibited the brow ridge less pronounced. I mean I'm just as obsessed with
1329540	1334100	bone structure as the goddamn incels because I think certain parts of my face make me look like
1334100	1339380	a man and I worry about it every day. We're all obsessed with the bones honey. We all have bones
1339380	1345380	inside us. We all love touching bones. You want to take a measurement from the super orbital ridge
1345380	1354660	to the lambdoid suture and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad circumference.
1355700	1361620	Why is no one talking about the Chad circumference? Fourth base, just the tip. There's another way I
1361620	1367220	think my experience as a trans woman is relevant to the incel discussion and that's that I
1367300	1372020	recognized delusional self-loathing when I see it. I'm far from the first to point out that the
1372020	1377620	supreme gentleman incel mass murderer Elliot Rodger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath
1377620	1382820	personality, an eminently bangable twink. Now I'm not going to show you pictures of incels but on
1382820	1388500	their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads and you can't say this on incel forums without
1388500	1395060	enraging them but in confidence from one pretend clinician to another let me tell you that the
1395060	1400980	truth about incels is that almost all of them are completely normal looking guys but of course
1400980	1404900	that's not the feedback they get from other incels. The feedback they get is that their
1404900	1408900	chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is garbage and there's no hope whatsoever,
1408900	1412980	no woman will ever love them and there are true selves with no option but to lie down and rot.
1412980	1418420	And the interesting thing is those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that's the
1418420	1424500	kind of feedback they're going to get. So why? Why do they do it? Well I'll tell you a little story.
1424500	1431300	There is a website on the internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT. A few years ago this
1431300	1438180	was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos but recently it's used mostly by
1439140	1445700	men who are entertaining the notion of becoming women and by early transition trans women so the
1445700	1451860	board is jokingly called TTTT. Now I've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition
1451860	1458500	but the memory is still fresh and let me tell you it is a painful awkward humiliating stage of
1458500	1464340	life. So the trans women of TTTT are tragic. They're basically still in man mode which is why
1464340	1470740	they're using 4chan and I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels. For incels the
1470740	1477220	core frustration is that they can't get laid. For TTTT it's that they can't pass as female. Both
1477300	1481780	groups post selfies knowing they're going to get brutal unconstructive feedback and both groups
1481780	1487540	have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties. For instance on TTTT a major
1487540	1494340	piece of jargon is hun, a slur used by trans women for other trans women which basically means that
1494340	1498900	you look like a man in a dress which is what every trans woman is afraid of. And there's another
1498900	1504020	commonality with incels too with all bigots and self-loathers which if you've been paying
1504020	1509940	attention you've already guessed. You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size.
1509940	1515460	Have all the surgeries in the world. Your massive man noggin will stay the same. Well this freak
1515460	1522340	thinks he has very soft facial features. His head is fucking huge. Well and the huns on reddit are
1522340	1527620	hugboxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads. Uh no there aren't. There aren't
1527620	1532020	fucking women with heads to do that. And FFS won't change shit. You might as well repress.
1532020	1535860	You transition with a man's head. You will be clocked. You will be looked at as a freak.
1535860	1543060	You will never be seen as a legit woman 100%. This is why I'm not transitioning. Thank you
1543060	1551140	skull people for showing me the way and that no matter what I do I will always be a manly man
1551140	1556420	skull wise. You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.
1556420	1564260	Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynophile be much more voluminous and the facial plane
1564260	1570660	wider. It always comes back to the skulls every time. The other interesting thing about TTTT
1570660	1576180	is I used to get posted there a lot. For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed
1576180	1582100	me as inspiration. Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon. If I'm not looked
1582100	1589060	at as a big skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well, that means that some of their
1589060	1594740	transitions might go well too. And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded
1594740	1599060	on self-loathing and hopelessness. So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain
1599060	1603220	why I didn't pass, why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me
1603220	1606820	shouldn't even fucking think about it. They shouldn't transition at all. They should just
1606820	1611060	repress. They should lie down and rot. And I used to read this stuff all the time. Like,
1611060	1617540	I would specifically seek out threads about me. Which might seem strange, considering I had
1617540	1622580	hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day. So why did I turn away from that
1622580	1628420	to intentionally seek out this dismal den of Huns talking about how my giant Hun skull is clockable
1628420	1634180	at a thousand paces and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse
1634180	1639380	and Winnie the Pooh? Well basically there is part of my brain that just simply refused to believe
1639460	1645060	it when people told me I was gorgeous. And for semi-plausible reasons. A lot of trans people
1645060	1649220	on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter what they look like.
1649220	1652500	That's where the word Hun comes from. You look great Hun.
1654260	1660180	So what TTTT is saying about Reddit hugboxing is true to some extent. There is a kind of
1660180	1666020	a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces. So I came to regard all
1666020	1671540	compliments as everyone is beautiful. Politically correct cuckoldry. And there would be this thrill
1671540	1677540	of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.
1677540	1683540	And that was always painful. But there was a kind of pleasure too. There was a rush. It's exciting
1683540	1687700	to burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you're really thinking. That personality
1687700	1691940	doesn't matter because big skulled chads get all the girls. That ContraPoints is a big skulled Hun
1691940	1697140	with a voice like nails on a chalkboard. And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I
1697140	1702500	was just doing research. I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying. It's simply my job.
1702500	1707380	But soon I realized it wasn't just research. And it was infecting me away from the computer. This
1707380	1714180	ridiculous vocabulary. Huns. AGP. Was popping up in my head at unexpected times. It was starting to
1714180	1719060	color how I thought about myself. And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other
1719060	1723540	trans women. And that's the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or
1723540	1727780	I'm going to become a monster. And once that happens, it's going to be very difficult to fix.
1727780	1731620	This is exactly how the incel black pill works. There's something infectious about these
1731620	1736980	vocabularies. Like on days I've been working on this video, I'll go out at night and these words
1736980	1741780	just involuntarily show up in my thoughts. That bartender is such a Chad. He's totally
1741780	1746180	height blocking that tiny cock. And the tragic thing is some incels don't realize what this
1746180	1752420	is doing to their minds until it's too late. Let's face it, black pills are sooey fuel. And
1752420	1758020	a lot of us can't handle them. I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it since
1758020	1765460	I loved uncovering secrets that society had been hiding from me. But it has affected my mental
1765460	1772260	health in a bad way. I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago and I've never
1772260	1778980	needed to do that before. I could always talk myself out of it through logic but my mind is
1778980	1785380	ruined now. This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm. Prototypically
1785380	1790020	teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts. But the more sophisticated
1790020	1794260	adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out abusive and disparaging comments
1794260	1799380	about yourself made by other people. I have a long history of doing this. Intentionally looking for
1799380	1804820	abusive comments, especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.
1804820	1810980	Why? I don't know. Why do people cut themselves? Part of it is what we could call masochistic
1810980	1817060	epistemology. Whatever hurts is true. I've recently gotten much better about this. I haven't been to
1817060	1823300	any of the worst places in a couple months. And my mental health is much improved. So incels,
1823300	1827300	I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position worthy of rational
1827300	1831540	debate. Because these ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use
1831540	1836180	arguments. You're using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves. And I know because I've done
1836180	1841140	the exact same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It's an anxious death spiral.
1841140	1846260	And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You've been
1846260	1850740	bullied and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you're doing when you're reading
1850740	1856180	incel forums is you're slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves
1856180	1860500	and at other people in your situation. And at women. And you're forming mental habits that are
1860500	1864660	going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have to do is get off
1864660	1869540	those forums as fast as possible. I'm going to post a link in the description of this video
1869540	1875460	to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer. Because for me, that's what
1875460	1885140	it took. Fifth base, anal. So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit. And that
1885220	1890900	limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred is not
1890900	1897540	directed at themselves, but at women. And they really hate women. Like I'm basically a professional
1897540	1901940	internet bigotry scholar at this point. I look at this kind of stuff all the time. But researching
1901940	1907620	this video, I was honestly kind of shocked at the intensity of misogyny on incel forums. I won't
1907620	1912580	show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape, saying they deserve to be raped,
1912580	1917940	calls for state mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all just a kind of
1917940	1927700	generalized misinformed rage. I hate women. I really do. Every time I look at them, my blood
1927700	1933220	pressure shoots through the roof when they're gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton,
1933220	1938740	when they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time rifling through their stupid purse,
1938740	1944180	when they whine to me about their period, when they blither on and on about some artist,
1944180	1949860	film director, musician nobody gives a flipping fuck about, when they cry and expect your personal
1949860	1956260	sympathy. But most of all, I hate them because they're smug, hyperactive little bitches made that
1956260	1964100	way by our shithole society. Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done. Hi Stacey. It's
1964100	1968580	Tracy. While I was at the mall the other day with Amber, Heather, Jenna and Trish, and we were
1968580	1975220	talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018, they live in this cartoon
1975220	1979620	caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking of women as fully human. That's where my sympathy
1979620	1985460	runs dry because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to turn to violence. So incels, I know
1985460	1988500	you're not going to listen to anything I say and you're just going to say that I'm a tranny and a
1988580	1994420	faggot and a degenerate. And to that I say, how dare you say things that are entirely true? But also,
1994420	1998180	vole soul if you wouldn't, bitches. And I know you don't listen to suggestions about how you
1998180	2002820	probably actually could have healthy relationships, so no one can really reach you until you get out
2002820	2007380	of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached. But by way of a closing remark, I guess I simply
2007380	2012340	invite you to consider that you don't even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic
2012340	2018100	longing. You know, when I was your age, in 1975, every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in his bedroom.
2019220	2023860	That was the outlet for his sexual frustration. What I'm suggesting is the manosphere exists
2023860	2029540	because rock and roll is dead. But there's other options. Think about the eroticism of a rainstorm,
2030900	2039140	the clap of thunder, the rustle of leaves, the steam rising off the warm pavement.
2039140	2052260	And whether you're a Chad, a Stacy, an Insel, or a Hun, you could always return to the caress
2052260	2061780	of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.
2099140	2103780	Ooh, is it hot in here or is it just me?
