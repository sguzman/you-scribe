00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Dass. Dass, dass, dass, dass. It's the only thing everyone fears.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
And the only thing that gets me off.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
Hello, my devilish darlings. I am Lenora Lavey, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
The story is rather simple, really. The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and zem.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable health care, and video games for lesbians.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Ahahahahaha!

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
But there's one man who stands in the way. The villain of tonight's thriller. A meddling little cipher of a man.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
A man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order to chaos.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Ugh! Can you imagine?

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings. Ugh!

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Can our heroine put a stop to this? Well, I'm just the executioner. You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.

01:51.000 --> 02:04.000
Ugh!

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Hi, girls. It's me, Ms. Points.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Mademoiselle, poi.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Words, words, words. What do they even fucking mean?

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, I don't know, and I don't care. But we have to talk about it anyway, because of a boy named Ben Shapiro. So who is Ben Shapiro?

02:21.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of The Daily Wire, and the auteur behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner, is she?

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
And let's be civil, right? That's the tone of the day.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm a fan.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on his edgier mantra,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Facts don't care about your feelings?

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben. It's true. Facts don't care about my feelings.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition, this makes me feel invalidated.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad are true.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling apps, but too fucking bad for me,

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk at forever.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Mmm, I was a yum-yum, though. Build me a time machine, doc.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
We call this autoandrophilia, nurse. What can I say? I like younger men. I'm a cougar in tiger's clothing.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
So look, I want to be treated like an adult. I don't want to be indulged. If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to tell myself to make it through the night.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
It's probably just dry down there. They're just ingrown hairs. I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other, of course, false and heathen religions.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I am an evangelical transsexual. I don't want toleration, dammit. I want converts.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment to talk about my womanhood? Sure. Go ahead. Touch it.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So look, Shapiro. Benny. Baby.

04:29.000 --> 04:38.000
I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales to melt away every crystal of my snow flakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding tea.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
All right, big boy. Let's have it. I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she because you can't change your sex.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
You can change your name. Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man. And if he were born with a high dose of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Right. You're determined by your chromosomes.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype that is XX sex chromosomes.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she. And to call you she would be tantamount to a lie.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
And I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender like woman be called she or something because it is a lie.

05:18.000 --> 05:32.000
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie and you think that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans woman she, we're saying that she has a normal female karyotype.

05:32.000 --> 05:44.000
But hold on. I am a transgender woman and I have never claimed to have a normal female karyotype. And yet my friends, lovers and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend, ladies.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
Good girl. Good girl. Just like that. Don't stop. Don't stop. Are all of us deluded about my biology? No.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro. It is you who misunderstands language.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not. We all agree on the biology.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man and woman.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word? Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists and study the way a word, for instance, she, is used by a linguistic community.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And whatever the social convention is, is what's correct.

06:30.000 --> 06:42.000
But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority, such as the dictionary, or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
Now, if we take the descriptive approach, you lose Ben Shapiro because most people call me she, and that's all there is to it.

06:54.000 --> 07:03.000
Once more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical. You don't put an article before a pronoun. That's not how pronouns work, you silly dumb-dumb.

07:03.000 --> 07:15.000
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and she originate in the protodramatic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe beginning around 500 BCE.

07:15.000 --> 07:26.000
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions, so let's try out a prescriptive approach.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word should be used?

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated by political goals.

07:47.000 --> 08:04.000
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.

08:08.000 --> 08:18.000
Opponents argue the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed because it's the definition.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
And on the other hand, gay people argue that the definition should be changed because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of words.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible, and for that matter you can change the Bible.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
I mean, have you read the contemporary English version? The prose is atrocious, appalling.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I won't stand for this.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more than just a political and legal dispute.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
It seems to me that whatever church, state, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are and will continue to be women.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival Blaire White.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whom stays bad.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Blaire responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely impractical.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt,

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
and you had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blaire, and they said okay, and you had to describe me to take me to the table,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
you wouldn't say the man in the orange shirt, you would say Blaire, you would say her over there.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Ben then responds, saying,

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that there is a utility to the use of pronouns,

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
but that's not quite the same as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And Blaire responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them that kid's parents,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link at all biologically,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Let's expand on that analogy.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings forth offspring.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Facts don't care about your feelings.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological parent,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents, but we do say adoptive parents.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
Right. Adoptive parents, an entirely valid type of parent. To call them parents is not a lie.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly is the context that you were suggesting matters.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
In what context are we talking about the parents? Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has two aspects, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and adoptive parents.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological role of woman, which you are not,

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
and then there is the, you look like a woman, which is, I'm going to describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
But when Ben seems in the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind of ugly, you know what I mean?

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
There was the, I think, I think the person's name was Zoey Turr. There was the threat of physical violence.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
What are your genetics?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that I'm saying to you right now

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
is exactly what I said to Zoey Turr on the air.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Zoey threatened you after you called her Sir, and you didn't call Blair Sir, did you?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Why did you call Zoey Sir?

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
I suppose Sir is a strictly biological term.

12:55.000 --> 13:06.000
And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other, or tweeting out F.U., that's not a great way to change my mind.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
So what is a great way to change your mind? Ben Shapiro?

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It doesn't seem like she did.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm the editor of a pre-major site, and my basic rule is that when we're discussing people who are trans,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
we immediately say in the first paragraph, trans woman, and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
because biology is the nature of the pronoun.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and biological parents.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between transgender and cisgender,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
or as you say, biological women.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive health care you think should be illegal.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But does this apply to pronouns?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes,

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
or are they part of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
The answer is obvious.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between ahi and ashi.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
So, as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Fascinating, though it is.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It is, in effect, false.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still not.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
What's the harm, right?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
If I teach my almost four-year-old girl that she can become a boy,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
then I think that is not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh yes, the classic argument.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
How do I explain to my child?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Kill your shitty child for all I care.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That's simply not my problem.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
You and I are through.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Or maybe an orgy.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell-bent on destroying Western civilization.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Hi boys, it's points again.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
In my previous video, Nasty T. Babe likes it rough.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I made an argument about why it's correct to call trans women she.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
But I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering them.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
I've never watched that show.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Oh.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
But the reality is that in a lot of cases, it's a little more complicated.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Society basically gets that I'm a woman.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on TgirlLove.com?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I got called Sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
But needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And what happened next stays between me and the Lord.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
But suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
It wasn't cute.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I try to pass off as my voice, and my tragic inability to conduct myself

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Your girl remains, despite my desperate painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You look great, hun.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
And that debate between Ben and Blair,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So appearance definitely matters,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking like a cis woman,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
is really the most important thing.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give me,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
So my goal isn't necessarily to serve on clockable fish,

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
so much as to embody a certain kind of diaphanous archetypal femininity.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Also, I am going to have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
And a lot of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
that performing your gender is the only thing that matters

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and that how you identify counts for nothing.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
But that's not what I think.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
because I think that's a much more compelling argument

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify as a woman,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And I'll explain why.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
about anyone telling them what pronouns to use.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
So I'm going to try to be respectful of your feelings

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
After all, we live in a repressive political era,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
despite the best efforts of hero professor Jordan B. Peterson.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
But alas, he was too late.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people to jail for...

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.

19:34.000 --> 19:51.000
Oh, I guess that was a false alarm.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
God damn it.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Look, I'm not going to tell you what pronouns you have to use.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm just going to tell you how I use pronouns in my reasoning behind it.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And you are welcome to use your free speech

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you want to be, okay?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
So, back to identity.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
and a customer were to walk in looking like this,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
but that would be wrong.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
he is THE man.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
YouTube's most regal makeup artist, his lordship John McClain,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and he uses he-him pronouns.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Likewise, if I were approached by this person,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and this time I'd be correct.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
but because she's genderfluid drag queen Courtney Out,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
who is the fucking audacity to be a more beautiful woman than I am,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
and who, so far as I know, uses male pronouns in boy mode

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
get played out in the world of drag.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
who live as men and perform as women.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Shay Kool-Aid, and Violet Chachki, identify as non-binary.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Others still are biokweens, cis women who perform as drag queens,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
like Lucy Garland or Crème Fatale.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
And then there are trans women who are also drag queens,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I mean, look at me!

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-11 at 2 a.m.?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Because I do.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Look what I have become!

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I just, through pure coincidence,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
happen to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I am so sorry, I can't help it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
So let's recap.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
depending on their current presentation.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
other than the one they present and live as and prefer other pronouns.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
because there's a lot of situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
but it's also not the only thing that matters.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
then there would be no need for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
including requesting different pronouns,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
because pronouns belong to the social world of language.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Not to individual psychology.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
You can identify however you like,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
then you are fully trans, your identity is fully valid,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
but until you begin living as a woman,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and not enough on social relationships.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
they are fully trans.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
To put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Many trans women just seem like women to me

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
in literally the same way that cis women seem like women,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to do from birth.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
but at least to seem like our genders to the people around us.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
As Laura Jane Grace put it,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You want them to see you like they see every other girl.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
As a trans woman.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But just because I seem like a woman to them,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
because the reality is,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
and I cope with that fear by looking like a second-rate drag queen.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a zero percent woman,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
if she tells me she's a trans woman,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm going to use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Not just to be polite,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological experience,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
and especially because I want to help her resocialize

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
An increasing number of people identify not as male or female,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
but as non-binary,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, greygender, and so on.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
In English, usually they.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
is a particular feature of the English language

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
that's by no means shared by all other languages,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
that humans make up to suit our purposes.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
If you're new to using singular they,

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
it is a little confusing at first, but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
They poured milk on me.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I poured milk on them.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
They did anoint themselves in their milk and it was good, thus saith the Lord.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
So the polite thing to do here is easy.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
If someone asks you to call them they,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
you call them they.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
You call them they.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
You want to understand why you're doing it.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I want to be a convert.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I want to believe about them while they believe about themselves,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
so long as those beliefs are reasonable.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
So what do all these words mean?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
What are these people talking about?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
John McClain is feminine in expression, but a man in identity.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
Whereas I am a woman in identity and in expression, I am a mess.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity,

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
art, science, spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
or high femme to stone butch the gender expression of a given domain,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
such as Mulan looks or Steven universe characters.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender,

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
greygender, and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
the Futch scale gives to expression.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
But my input on this isn't really worth that much because I'm not non-binary.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
because all this talk about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And that's how I experience gender.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
I live, I exist as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And I identify as trash.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration,

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
waiting in a long ass line for the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons in case someone asks,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
a dude explaining Philosophy 101 to me and me going,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
oh really? Wow.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
But you know these experiences mean different things to different people.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
So all I can really tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
that taking female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
makes me feel more at home in my body and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
socially, spiritually, sexually.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
So that's the jargon free explanation of my gender as I see it.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And that, I think, is legitimate enough.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
So I know what living as a woman means to me,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
that's something that's going to vary between individuals and cultures.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
such as the Hydra of South Asia, a legally recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
or the various two spirit traditions of indigenous North American tribes.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
but we do have individual non-binary people,

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Even as a binary trans person,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
But many of the people who call themselves non-binary

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
seem to be fighting for something more radical than what I'm fighting for,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
at least in my personal life.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Heh.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
The traditional female garb of my culture.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
No!

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
they're effectively trying to create the society that includes them.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people,

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
who, for example, promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
provided they assume it correctly.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Otherwise, I will throw you an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
and gender non-conforming people find it easier to navigate the world

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
to do or say anything,

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I do hope you use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
to choose to do the same.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Freely.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
I'm talking about the female lead.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Now the fun really begins.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
The show's over.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
so goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Until next week...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Go to hell!

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
In hell!

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
We'll go hell!

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
In hell!

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
In hell!

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
We'll go hell!
