WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
I saw a shot before persisting baby, before persisting baby

00:14.000 --> 00:41.400
In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically

00:41.400 --> 00:46.440
incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female

00:46.440 --> 00:49.000
souls accidentally born into male bodies.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.640
Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight

00:54.640 --> 00:56.440
men who love themselves.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.180
For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynophilia, new Greek for love

01:01.180 --> 01:03.080
of oneself as a woman.

01:03.080 --> 01:07.360
It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,

01:07.360 --> 01:11.320
and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which

01:11.320 --> 01:36.720
is, okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard says.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.720
Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but

01:40.720 --> 01:45.360
a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially

01:45.360 --> 01:50.200
increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
face.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.920
After all, autogynophilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted

01:55.920 --> 02:01.440
misrepresentations of trans women.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.600
So it's understandable that to a lot of trans women, the prospect of this concept gaining

02:05.600 --> 02:08.000
cultural traction is pretty terrifying.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.160
However, I respond that, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals, I've had several

02:13.160 --> 02:17.080
conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that they believe in

02:17.080 --> 02:20.440
Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards would admit it to my face.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.200
So as I see it, the damage is already done, what's needed now is an accessible, convincing

02:25.200 --> 02:26.640
refutation of the theory.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.320
I hope this video will accomplish three things.

02:29.320 --> 02:34.300
One, persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong, two, account for how a wrong theory

02:34.300 --> 02:39.540
became so influential, and three, move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people

02:39.540 --> 02:43.740
and open up a deeper discussion about what it really means to be transgender.

02:43.740 --> 02:47.740
Socrates, you know the drill.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.500
Two, Blanchard's typology.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.580
The mainstream scientific view endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender

02:54.580 --> 03:00.540
Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians is that the primary reason trans people transition

03:00.540 --> 03:02.780
is to alleviate gender dysphoria.

03:02.780 --> 03:08.800
Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial

03:08.800 --> 03:13.100
angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and

03:13.100 --> 03:16.580
medically transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.

03:16.580 --> 03:20.700
This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.500
However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.580
According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.

03:29.580 --> 03:34.420
He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused.

03:34.420 --> 03:37.060
You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.700
Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.740
And yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.300
The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.380
These gay boys cannot get enough dick.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.860
And who can blame them?

03:50.860 --> 03:56.020
Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition

03:56.020 --> 04:00.500
because one, society is more accepting of them as women than is very effeminate men,

04:00.500 --> 04:05.140
and two, becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them, since they do better as women in

04:05.140 --> 04:10.100
the heterosexual dating market than as male fems in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.940
The second type of trans women are the autogenophilic transsexuals.

04:13.940 --> 04:17.300
These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.260
I fucking saw.

04:19.260 --> 04:24.420
Blanchard describes autogenophiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.

04:24.420 --> 04:29.540
It doesn't really matter because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected inward,

04:29.540 --> 04:33.540
leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women, which

04:33.540 --> 04:35.300
is their true motivation to transition.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.980
Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge

04:38.980 --> 04:43.620
that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend

04:43.620 --> 04:46.900
to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.

04:46.900 --> 04:51.620
I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogenophile with more neutral

04:51.620 --> 04:57.060
language, let's say Cluster A and Cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic,

04:57.060 --> 04:58.580
that is, attracted to men.

04:58.580 --> 05:02.580
They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.

05:02.580 --> 05:06.260
Cluster B trans women are mostly gynophilic, attracted to women,

05:06.260 --> 05:10.500
transition relatively later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.180
When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.660
I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort them.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.540
Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B.

05:21.540 --> 05:24.100
But as I've thought about it more, it's partially unravelled.

05:24.100 --> 05:28.100
Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who followed all

05:28.100 --> 05:33.060
the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster B patterns

05:33.060 --> 05:34.900
but now exclusively dates men.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.940
So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here,

05:37.940 --> 05:42.020
I interpret them merely as correlation clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.

05:42.020 --> 05:47.300
Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogenophiles to be two sharply distinct

05:47.380 --> 05:51.460
types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.

05:51.460 --> 05:56.420
And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexual strategy,

05:56.420 --> 06:00.420
or autogenophilic lust, are the primary motivations to transition.

06:00.420 --> 06:04.340
And I have a lot of backup here since trans women almost universally reject

06:04.340 --> 06:06.500
this characterization of their experience.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.060
Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory,

06:09.060 --> 06:12.420
but fortunately Blanchard has an airtight response to that,

06:12.420 --> 06:16.340
namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking liars.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.900
I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?

06:18.900 --> 06:21.140
A theory that can't be falsified.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.180
It's perfect.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.980
3. The Man Who Would Be Queen

06:26.980 --> 06:30.820
Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of psychologists

06:30.820 --> 06:34.580
before fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications

06:34.580 --> 06:38.260
had it not been given a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey,

06:38.260 --> 06:43.140
a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard's theory in a 2003

06:43.140 --> 06:46.180
pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.540
Great cover, Bailey.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.380
Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.660
I have been triggered.

06:52.660 --> 06:53.460
Well done.

06:53.460 --> 06:57.700
Now Bailey, I read your book which, considering how much I enjoy your cream,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.300
was just amazingly bad.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.340
The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women

07:02.340 --> 07:06.340
because it's acutely transphobic but also kind of vivid and well-written

07:06.340 --> 07:09.140
and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard's typology.

07:09.140 --> 07:12.420
The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.540
including Bailey's and his male research assistants' observations

07:15.540 --> 07:19.060
that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex workers.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.580
I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim

07:22.580 --> 07:25.300
for the first time on the stairs dancing, posing.

07:25.860 --> 07:29.780
She is spectacular, exotic.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.300
I find out later that she is from Belize and sexy.

07:34.500 --> 07:39.940
Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.

07:39.940 --> 07:45.300
And I notice a very subtle and not unattractive angularity of the face,

07:45.300 --> 07:50.820
which is also not clearly diagnostic on this tall siren.

07:50.820 --> 07:55.780
It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives,

07:55.780 --> 08:02.020
as a researcher but also as a single heterosexual man.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.420
Wow, Bailey. Great science rating.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.300
When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals,

08:07.300 --> 08:09.940
Bailey moves on to the autokinophilic transsexuals,

08:09.940 --> 08:14.260
focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls Cher,

08:14.260 --> 08:20.020
whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic masturbation.

08:20.020 --> 08:25.140
Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses

08:25.140 --> 08:29.060
while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction,

08:29.060 --> 08:33.540
all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.

08:33.540 --> 08:36.580
It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.

08:36.580 --> 08:39.780
So well done, Bailey. You've found an honest-to-god pervert.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.980
And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.820
I admire it. I want it in my life.

08:44.820 --> 08:49.940
But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

08:49.940 --> 08:54.660
You just found a person who built a sex robot.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.300
That's not how Bailey sees it though.

08:57.300 --> 09:01.460
He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autokinophilic transsexual,

09:01.460 --> 09:06.100
claiming that Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women

09:06.100 --> 09:08.180
who aren't exclusively attracted to men.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.660
So Bailey's telling is that autokinophiles are these unfeminine male masturbators

09:12.660 --> 09:16.660
showing up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they were women

09:16.660 --> 09:20.340
in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.

09:20.340 --> 09:24.260
Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defensive Blanchard's theory,

09:24.260 --> 09:27.460
Bailey's account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.

09:27.460 --> 09:31.300
Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher,

09:31.300 --> 09:33.700
pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead,

09:33.700 --> 09:37.140
unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.980
You're so filthy.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.860
But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?

09:41.860 --> 09:44.660
What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?

09:44.660 --> 09:50.020
Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans women

09:50.020 --> 09:52.500
turning these stories into case studies for his book.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.540
Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.380
You need a research assistant, Bailey?

09:57.380 --> 10:00.180
The man who would be queen is filled with sentences like,

10:00.180 --> 10:08.260
There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer it, so I'll just go ahead.

10:08.260 --> 10:09.780
All right, you edgy fuck.

10:09.780 --> 10:10.500
Let's hear it.

10:11.060 --> 10:16.260
Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most

10:16.260 --> 10:18.980
auto kind of feeling transsexual.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.380
We appreciate the feedback, Bailey.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.260
We really do.

10:22.260 --> 10:23.780
But is this science?

10:23.780 --> 10:26.980
It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery

10:26.980 --> 10:30.020
that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians

10:30.020 --> 10:33.060
and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.

10:33.060 --> 10:36.580
And like the pop science cis-head men have written over the past century

10:36.580 --> 10:39.380
regarding the nature of females and homosexuals,

10:39.380 --> 10:43.940
their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some vital perspectives.

10:43.940 --> 10:48.420
This is what we post-modernists mean when we complain that science often privileges

10:48.420 --> 10:50.660
a white cis-head male perspective.

10:50.660 --> 10:53.380
It's not that I hate men or male sexuality,

10:53.540 --> 10:58.820
I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.820
It's not that there is no objective truth,

11:00.820 --> 11:03.940
it's that this represents a very narrow window on it.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.500
Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.940
Well, how about mine?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.580
4. My Perspective

11:12.580 --> 11:16.340
From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.

11:16.340 --> 11:18.980
He's a man who, when I was a student in Northwestern,

11:18.980 --> 11:21.780
was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.

11:21.780 --> 11:22.580
Google it.

11:22.580 --> 11:26.100
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.380
Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard

11:29.380 --> 11:31.940
to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub,

11:31.940 --> 11:35.780
it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctionist of the theory,

11:35.780 --> 11:37.220
which might still be true.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.140
The problem is, it isn't true, which I'll argue at length in a moment.

11:41.140 --> 11:45.620
But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial number

11:45.620 --> 11:50.820
of academics and journalists, largely because 1, it's often presented as the only supposedly

11:50.820 --> 11:54.980
scientific alternative to mushy platitudes about women born in men's bodies,

11:54.980 --> 11:58.340
and 2, many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard

11:58.340 --> 12:02.500
with extreme vitriol and personal attacks, resulting in the widespread perception

12:02.500 --> 12:07.540
that a bunch of triggered PC cocks are throwing a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum

12:07.540 --> 12:11.540
because Bailey and Blanchard accurately called them out as paraphylic fetishists.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.020
In her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger,

12:14.020 --> 12:20.020
bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob.

12:20.020 --> 12:24.260
But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him

12:24.260 --> 12:28.420
and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced

12:28.420 --> 12:33.060
by PC cocks that she doesn't bother to check how good Bailey's science really is,

12:33.060 --> 12:36.100
and ends up affirming the autogynophilia theory herself.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.260
Now I'm certainly not going to deny that trans people on the internet can sometimes behave like

12:40.260 --> 12:44.900
a bit of an angry mob. In fact, I may be on the receiving end of one of those myself in about,

12:44.900 --> 12:47.860
oh, 20 minutes, depending on how this video is received.

12:47.860 --> 12:52.260
But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and Bailey

12:52.260 --> 12:57.220
camp either. Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors,

12:57.220 --> 13:02.100
and Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory of trans backlash against Bailey.

13:02.100 --> 13:07.540
Remember, according to autogynophilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves,

13:07.540 --> 13:12.180
from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that they're narcissists,

13:12.180 --> 13:16.580
and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation is accused of exhibiting

13:16.580 --> 13:22.020
narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego. Furthermore, like so many other professors

13:22.020 --> 13:28.020
and recent academic freedom controversies, Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cocks

13:28.020 --> 13:32.500
has not really interfered with their academic careers, nor their continued authority to

13:32.500 --> 13:36.980
misrepresent people with less power than them. This is of course assuming that autogynophilia

13:36.980 --> 13:41.860
really is a misrepresentation of trans women, and that's really the crux of this whole drama,

13:41.860 --> 13:46.020
isn't it? So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question,

13:46.020 --> 13:50.820
pursuing the pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel, relying only on the facts,

13:50.820 --> 13:55.700
the figures, the scientific studies. Just kidding. If you really want to read a scientific argument

13:55.700 --> 14:00.660
against autogynophilia, read Julia Serrano's article The Case Against Autogynophilia,

14:00.660 --> 14:04.980
which pretty much sums it up. Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted

14:04.980 --> 14:10.020
to hear about science, you came here because you wanted filth, and I'll give you filth, Bailey.

14:10.020 --> 14:15.220
I know that's what you want, and I want to give you what you want. I want to give it all up for you.

14:16.020 --> 14:24.740
5. The False Psychotomy Filth is coming, don't worry, but before we

14:24.740 --> 14:29.060
get there, there's one more thing we need to discuss. Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty

14:29.060 --> 14:33.780
much unanimously introduce it as if it were the only possible alternative to what's called the

14:33.780 --> 14:38.900
feminine essence theory. The feminine essence theory says that trans women are female souls

14:38.900 --> 14:43.940
and male bodies, that we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to

14:43.940 --> 14:49.060
make our accidental exterior match our essential interior. People like Drager will tell you that

14:49.060 --> 14:55.220
trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that anyone who challenges it will

14:55.220 --> 15:00.020
be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt. And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told,

15:00.020 --> 15:04.980
is to defer to Blanchard's typology of homosexual and autogynophilic transsexuals.

15:04.980 --> 15:09.940
Now I object to this framing of the discussion because I don't believe in Blanchard's typology

15:09.940 --> 15:14.580
or the feminine essence theory. There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from

15:14.580 --> 15:21.700
birth. I wasn't born a woman. I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else. There's no such

15:21.700 --> 15:27.220
thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence. There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the

15:27.220 --> 15:31.940
way society responds to you, all of which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are

15:31.940 --> 15:36.580
currently changing for me. Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory.

15:36.580 --> 15:42.340
I think most people have gender-essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some level

15:42.340 --> 15:47.780
that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature. And in a sense that may be true. I don't think I chose

15:47.780 --> 15:52.580
to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent in my biology or psychology

15:52.580 --> 15:57.460
that led me to transition. But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood,

15:57.460 --> 16:01.780
which intellectually I don't think makes sense. I think it's heartwarming gibberish.

16:01.860 --> 16:06.980
But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.

16:06.980 --> 16:11.860
Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that dogs go to

16:11.860 --> 16:17.860
heaven. And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point across.

16:17.860 --> 16:22.740
Not all language is philosophical. It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in

16:22.740 --> 16:27.300
essentialist terms. To explain it without gender-essentialism, it requires a whole,

16:27.300 --> 16:32.740
complicated philosophical discussion that most people simply aren't up to having. But the useful

16:32.740 --> 16:37.140
platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start putting these things under

16:37.140 --> 16:41.620
the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists who are

16:41.620 --> 16:46.100
telling lies about themselves. So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not

16:46.100 --> 16:52.020
essentially a woman, then why am I transitioning? Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was

16:52.020 --> 16:56.580
the primary reason. And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that

16:56.580 --> 17:01.460
if you're curious. You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom. When you

17:01.460 --> 17:06.500
decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes

17:06.500 --> 17:11.540
and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family if you even still have a family. It's kind of hard for me

17:11.540 --> 17:17.140
to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory urge. That said, is there

17:17.140 --> 17:22.820
some sexual aspect of being transgender? Well of course there goddamn is. How could an adult decide

17:22.820 --> 17:27.860
to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality? The problem is autogenophilia

17:27.860 --> 17:32.900
is not a good description of that connection in most cases, and it certainly isn't in my case.

17:32.900 --> 17:37.860
But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing and erotic

17:37.860 --> 17:43.140
situations no less. According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogenophile. It seems

17:43.220 --> 17:47.300
that I have some explaining to do. Well, here's where the filth comes in.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.660
6. Contra Points and Erotic Life

17:51.460 --> 17:57.300
Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie. Step right up you filthy freaks.

17:57.300 --> 18:02.020
One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that even arguing

18:02.020 --> 18:06.660
against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and invalidating.

18:06.660 --> 18:11.460
Fortunately I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to take one

18:11.460 --> 18:15.540
for the team here. Get your clipboards out gentlemen, I want to make this as easy as

18:15.540 --> 18:22.980
possible for the psychoanalysts at home. I was born in 1988. As a small child I was not

18:22.980 --> 18:29.460
especially feminine nor especially masculine. I was not interested in sports and was just kind of

18:29.460 --> 18:34.580
physically inept. My main childhood interest was music and I learned several instruments.

18:34.580 --> 18:40.660
In early adolescence I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too much time

18:40.660 --> 18:46.020
in the shower and spending too much time styling my hair. My sexual development was kind of late.

18:46.020 --> 18:52.420
I never masturbated till I was 15 and I didn't fantasize about having sex with women or with men

18:53.060 --> 18:58.580
or even about becoming a woman. My fantasies were kind of platonic almost. I would sort of

18:58.580 --> 19:04.820
fantasize about women but in a very abstract kind of way. An early romantic disappointment involved

19:04.820 --> 19:10.500
my realization that women would never be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.

19:10.660 --> 19:16.420
In my late teens and early 20s I was a long haired smooth chested androgyne which suited me well.

19:16.420 --> 19:21.300
It was around then that I first cross-tressed when a woman I was seeing asked if she could

19:21.300 --> 19:28.500
dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup. God yes, I said. Throughout my 20s I was on and off

19:28.500 --> 19:34.420
in relationships where there was this feminization dynamic. More women are into feminizing boys than

19:34.420 --> 19:39.380
you might think. When I was feminized it would just make out and not do anything penetrative

19:39.380 --> 19:45.380
but just sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know? Now some women I was with were not into that

19:45.380 --> 19:49.140
and some would practically lock their underwear drawers when they found out I had done it in the

19:49.140 --> 19:53.700
past. There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that all together but it didn't

19:53.700 --> 19:59.540
last more than a couple years. When I had regular heterosexual sex it was like my soul had to leave

19:59.540 --> 20:04.020
my body in order for me to get the poison out which is how I thought of it. The cross-dressing

20:04.020 --> 20:09.540
was never a solo or a masturbatory activity. There was always a partner or sometimes several

20:09.540 --> 20:14.500
partners. Bailey are you paying attention to this? This is for you. What I liked about it was the way

20:14.500 --> 20:19.380
that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted with my body, how they would kind of

20:19.380 --> 20:24.740
treat me like a woman. I fully acknowledged that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.

20:24.740 --> 20:31.860
There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs and occasionally also a BDSM submissive aspect.

20:31.860 --> 20:36.820
But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it. It wasn't

20:36.820 --> 20:41.940
humiliating for me to be feminized, it was affirming. And one day I kind of realized

20:41.940 --> 20:48.500
that I didn't want to be feminized at all. I wanted to be feminine. In my mid-20s I first

20:48.500 --> 20:53.460
started really paying attention to trans women and thinking about transitioning myself but I

20:53.460 --> 20:58.500
thought that since I didn't feel like a woman that I never would and I thought that I would never

20:58.500 --> 21:02.900
pass and that I would just be a hideous parody of womanhood. Then about a year ago, thanks to

21:02.900 --> 21:07.780
this amazing online queer community that we have now, I started developing more positive thinking

21:07.780 --> 21:12.340
about this. I've always looked a little bit younger than my age but last year I also started

21:12.340 --> 21:17.860
noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man and that triggered

21:17.860 --> 21:22.420
really intense gender dysphoria. At the same time I realized that I would have to transition to have

21:22.420 --> 21:27.700
any hope of a genuinely fulfilling sex life. And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent

21:27.780 --> 21:33.380
that I could not wait. So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu and I started taking

21:33.380 --> 21:39.300
those in August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic and since then

21:39.300 --> 21:44.420
my life has drastically changed. I live as a woman full-time now and most of the changes aren't

21:44.420 --> 21:50.020
sexual but the hormones certainly do have sexual effects. I now find myself attracted to both women

21:50.020 --> 21:57.460
and men and the mere visual image of a woman no longer turns me on the way it did. Instead

21:57.460 --> 22:02.180
I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection. I don't masturbate at all and I

22:02.180 --> 22:06.900
haven't come in months. Someone please fuck me. I guess the critical thing is that I've been

22:06.900 --> 22:12.500
wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven consecutive months and I have been turned on by

22:12.500 --> 22:18.260
it for zero percent of the time. So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous

22:18.260 --> 22:22.740
and I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either. I mean when there's

22:22.740 --> 22:27.540
developments I'll check it out but I'm not like oh yeah I have tits now that's so hot.

22:28.260 --> 22:33.700
I mean it's kind of hot but it's more about other people being into it than it is about me being

22:33.700 --> 22:39.380
into it. So as always my sex drive is directed outward at other people. The sexual aspect of my

22:39.380 --> 22:45.380
transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed inward. It's about me wanting my

22:45.380 --> 22:51.220
sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body or you know at least as close as I

22:51.220 --> 22:56.660
can get. And since I started hormones it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically

22:56.660 --> 23:04.580
female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection rather than intense

23:04.580 --> 23:11.460
object-oriented male lust. So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to

23:11.460 --> 23:18.100
politically correct cuckoldry or trans ideology. Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this

23:18.100 --> 23:22.980
description in no way lets me off the hook for autogenophilia. In fact I'm what Blanchard would

23:22.980 --> 23:29.860
call a classic case of pseudo bisexual behavioral autogenophilia. Pseudo bisexual because of course

23:29.860 --> 23:35.460
all trans women's experiences are lies and because according to Blanchard I only like guys because

23:35.460 --> 23:39.700
being filled up with their dicks makes me feel like a girl which is what I'm really into. And

23:39.700 --> 23:45.620
behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogenophilia like anatomic transvestic

23:45.620 --> 23:51.060
behavioral and physiological according to what you supposedly fetishize. And I'm turned on by

23:51.060 --> 23:56.020
sexually behaving like a woman rather than simply wearing female clothes or having female anatomy.

23:56.020 --> 24:00.500
And I mean okay you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary,

24:00.500 --> 24:05.700
fake, and pathological but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience

24:05.700 --> 24:11.620
and here's why. 7. Autophilia in General

24:11.620 --> 24:15.700
I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind of

24:15.700 --> 24:20.740
sexual interest in their own bodies. It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.

24:20.740 --> 24:26.820
Ew. But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight or touch

24:26.820 --> 24:32.020
of your own body? I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises

24:32.020 --> 24:37.220
and taking pictures of their penises and sending them to other people. Does that make them

24:37.220 --> 24:43.540
autoandrophiles? Are they behavioral autophalophiles? I can make up Greek words too,

24:43.540 --> 24:48.580
Blanchard. I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,

24:48.580 --> 24:53.780
it's not for men, it's for me. What does that mean? It means she enjoyed wearing

24:53.780 --> 24:59.940
sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot. Is that cisvestic autogenophilia?

24:59.940 --> 25:05.860
Likewise, I use to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women touching

25:05.860 --> 25:11.700
their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon. Is that anatomical

25:11.700 --> 25:17.540
autogenophilia? Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo,

25:17.540 --> 25:23.380
an article on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their

25:23.380 --> 25:28.980
own feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length

25:28.980 --> 25:34.660
mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo. Can you imagine the level of

25:34.660 --> 25:39.140
paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if it was written by a trans woman? I mean,

25:39.140 --> 25:44.820
it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot. And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often

25:44.820 --> 25:49.300
ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only when it comes to trans women that we feel

25:49.300 --> 25:54.580
the need to whip out the suffix philia. It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of

25:54.580 --> 26:00.020
normal female sexuality when it exists in trans women, but of course that raises the question,

26:00.020 --> 26:09.220
what is normal female sexuality? 8. Normal Female Sexuality. Switching from male to female hormones

26:09.220 --> 26:14.500
causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in new form, which came as more

26:14.500 --> 26:19.780
of a relief to me than I expected. I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality

26:19.780 --> 26:26.020
felt like a demonic possession or alien infection until I was free of it, thank god. When I had male

26:26.020 --> 26:31.140
hormones in me, I needed to have an orgasm like every day. I was turned on mainly by visual arousal

26:31.140 --> 26:37.060
cues. I was at a Kinsey one relative to my birth sex and I had a couple mild, typical, straight guy

26:37.060 --> 26:43.620
paraphilic kinks. No, not autogynophilia. On female hormones, I initially had no sex drive at all,

26:43.620 --> 26:49.140
but I've started developing very different patterns of arousal. For instance, I never need to have an

26:49.140 --> 26:54.900
orgasm. I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues like intimate physical contact or close emotional

26:54.900 --> 27:01.300
moments. I'm at around a 70-30 attraction to women versus men and the paraphilic kinks have vanished

27:01.300 --> 27:06.500
without a trace. Oh by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6 milligrams estradiol and 200

27:06.500 --> 27:11.700
milligrams spironolactone daily. So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical

27:11.700 --> 27:16.900
female sexuality, at least for a girl who's into girls. I don't feel like I have some essentially

27:16.900 --> 27:22.340
male pseudo bisexual behavioral autogynophilia. One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with

27:22.340 --> 27:27.380
elaborate terminology like this is he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women

27:27.380 --> 27:32.500
are psychologically more like cis men than cis women. His studies therefore lack a cis female

27:32.500 --> 27:37.780
control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply his autogynophilia survey to cis women. But if he

27:37.780 --> 27:42.740
had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were classified as

27:42.740 --> 27:48.180
autogynophilic. Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on

27:48.180 --> 27:54.420
male sexuality makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.

27:54.420 --> 28:00.580
But what is cis women want to have sex as? Walruses? I mean no judgments. This also explains his

28:00.580 --> 28:06.660
claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo bisexual because their attraction to

28:06.660 --> 28:12.180
men does not resemble gay male attraction to men. The idea is that these trans women's attraction

28:12.180 --> 28:18.900
to men is not based on raw physical lust, so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men and

28:18.900 --> 28:24.900
is therefore pseudo. That is, it's really an autogynophilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.

28:24.900 --> 28:30.580
But what about straight cis women's attraction to men? Is that based on raw physical lust for the

28:30.580 --> 28:36.420
male body? I mean sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say. But I

28:36.420 --> 28:42.900
kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust for the

28:42.900 --> 28:49.460
male body. That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality if I may risk painting

28:49.460 --> 28:54.500
with broad strokes. Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist

28:54.500 --> 28:59.540
articles alongside naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart and later on

28:59.540 --> 29:04.820
ended up just being read by gay men. From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean men's

29:04.820 --> 29:11.540
bodies are nice, they have great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great. But it's not

29:11.540 --> 29:16.340
that great. And if you read pornography written by women and notice that it's usually written and

29:16.340 --> 29:21.620
not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.

29:21.620 --> 29:26.340
Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description of

29:26.340 --> 29:31.620
Christian's hot bod and his hot abs, but it's not the main thing by any means. There's a lot more

29:31.620 --> 29:37.380
sentences like. To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat 10 adults comfortably.

29:37.380 --> 29:43.700
It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know. Modern fireplace.

29:43.700 --> 29:49.860
Near the kitchen area in front of the glass wall is a dining table surrounded by 16 chairs,

29:49.860 --> 29:56.420
and tucked in the corner is a full-sized shiny black grand piano. Here, he hands me a glass of

29:56.420 --> 30:03.300
wine. Even the glasses are rich. Heavy contemporary crystal. It's like a Crate and Barrel catalog.

30:03.300 --> 30:09.060
I'm getting so wet. Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary

30:09.060 --> 30:15.220
crystal, his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot because it's sexy to be wanted by someone

30:15.220 --> 30:20.180
who's qualified. It's not enough to be whizzled at by a catcaller, they have no discernment.

30:20.180 --> 30:24.660
I mean, they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female. They whistle at me. And I don't

30:24.660 --> 30:29.060
want to be whizzled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me. You want to be wanted by

30:29.060 --> 30:34.660
someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste, selects you, the protagonist. This is not

30:34.660 --> 30:40.580
a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns. It's not a story about wanting a man.

30:40.580 --> 30:46.900
It's a story about being wanted by a man. This is how the whole romance genre works. You emotionally

30:46.900 --> 30:52.660
identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like a pirate or the CEO

30:52.660 --> 30:58.660
of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this guy wants you, the protagonist,

30:58.660 --> 31:02.900
usually singling her out of her other more qualified women, and eventually giving up

31:02.900 --> 31:07.380
everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her. And a lot of these stories are kind of

31:07.380 --> 31:12.580
silly. They conflate female sexuality with women's economic dependence on men in a way that's really

31:15.220 --> 31:20.340
but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted. I want other people to think I'm sexy

31:20.340 --> 31:25.380
and want to fuck me, you know? It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.340
Is that so wrong?

31:31.140 --> 31:36.660
The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting trope

31:36.660 --> 31:41.940
of depainting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity. The mirror was

31:41.940 --> 31:47.460
often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman. The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.

31:47.460 --> 31:52.420
You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her. You put a mirror in her hand and

31:52.420 --> 31:56.900
you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had

31:56.900 --> 32:01.540
depicted for your own pleasure. The real function of the mirror was otherwise. It was to make the

32:01.540 --> 32:07.220
woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight. The notion of the vanity of

32:07.220 --> 32:12.740
woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection. It is the assumption that women

32:12.740 --> 32:17.780
enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy looking at them and are hence

32:17.780 --> 32:23.460
complicit in their own objectification. I think the concept of the autogenophilic transsexual woman

32:23.460 --> 32:29.300
is a combination of this trope with a homophobic trope. Misogyny casts women as narcissistic,

32:29.300 --> 32:35.140
vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts queer men as hypersexual perverts. The

32:35.140 --> 32:40.580
autogenophile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly in love with

32:40.580 --> 32:56.900
the image of himself as a woman. 10. Autogenophilia Acceptance

32:56.900 --> 33:01.140
So this whole video I've been treating autogenophilia kind of like an accusation from which I have to

33:01.140 --> 33:06.340
exonerate myself. And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation,

33:06.420 --> 33:11.300
but some people might wonder, isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shamy? Like,

33:11.300 --> 33:18.260
is autogenophilia so wrong? Well, no, it's not. It's fine. There definitely are men who get turned

33:18.260 --> 33:23.300
on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this

33:23.300 --> 33:27.220
is very harmless and I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether

33:27.220 --> 33:32.100
genuinely autogenophilic trans women exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women

33:32.100 --> 33:38.100
consider the label autogenophilia to be such a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not

33:38.100 --> 33:42.660
get turned on merely by the thought of being women. Now as I've discussed, the problem with

33:42.660 --> 33:47.940
Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogenophilia to cover pretty much any sexual

33:47.940 --> 33:52.900
feeling a cluster B trans woman can have. But I'm actually inclined to agree with him that being

33:52.900 --> 33:58.660
turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind,

33:58.660 --> 34:03.060
and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women, I guess including me,

34:03.060 --> 34:08.020
have the idea that you can't be both a woman and an autogenophile, hence the offense we take to

34:08.020 --> 34:12.660
being characterized in this way. However, things get messier when you look into this some more.

34:12.660 --> 34:18.420
Are there some genuinely autogenophilic transsexuals? Well, at first glance, the answer is yes.

34:18.420 --> 34:22.660
I mean, there's always one isn't there. In this case, that one is Anne Lawrence,

34:22.660 --> 34:28.660
a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified autogenophilic transsexual. From 1998 to 2011,

34:28.660 --> 34:34.340
Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogenophilia over the internet and published

34:34.340 --> 34:40.260
them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies. Great title Anne, very provocative,

34:40.260 --> 34:45.220
very controversial, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered, well done.

34:45.220 --> 34:50.180
What is this cover though? Come on Anne, get a statue of hermaphroditis or something on there.

34:50.260 --> 34:54.340
So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty

34:54.340 --> 35:00.340
autogenophilia-like fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff,

35:00.340 --> 35:05.060
like fantasies of being women or having sex as women or arousal during cross-dressing,

35:05.060 --> 35:10.820
are what the trans community has de-stigmatizingly termed cross-sex gender fantasy. And among trans

35:10.820 --> 35:16.500
women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You'll see it all over

35:16.500 --> 35:21.620
the place on trans subreddits, there's a blog called Cross Dreamers devoted to it, it's been

35:21.620 --> 35:26.340
written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serrano. So within the trans community, this isn't even

35:26.340 --> 35:31.540
controversial. It's not provocative, it's not politically incorrect. But how do we make sense

35:31.540 --> 35:36.500
of this? Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience genuine female sexuality when

35:36.500 --> 35:41.140
you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system, so you've got to get that out

35:41.140 --> 35:45.940
and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is this any different from Blanchard's

35:45.940 --> 35:50.660
theory of autogenophilia? Well, basically it comes down to this. Blanchard's theory claims

35:50.660 --> 35:56.020
that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory, if you're an

35:56.020 --> 36:01.780
autogenophilic transsexual, you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you achieve

36:01.780 --> 36:07.620
can only be honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the

36:07.620 --> 36:11.940
idea that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn't

36:11.940 --> 36:17.300
essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogenophilic admit that after

36:17.300 --> 36:22.420
transition, the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue to prefer living as

36:22.420 --> 36:27.780
trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself. Any viable theory relating to the

36:27.780 --> 36:32.020
ideologies of autogenophilia and transsexualism must explain the following well-established

36:32.020 --> 36:37.620
observation. Gender dysphoria in young non-homosexual males usually appears along with or subsequent to

36:37.620 --> 36:42.580
autogenophilia. In later years, however, autogenophilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear

36:42.580 --> 36:46.820
while the transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger. The same conclusion is suggested by

36:46.820 --> 36:50.500
the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment, which decrease libido and gender

36:50.500 --> 36:54.820
dysphoric as in other men, usually have no effect on the desire to live as female or the resolve to

36:54.820 --> 36:59.620
remain in that role. If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become

36:59.620 --> 37:04.900
women, why would they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away?

37:04.900 --> 37:09.300
Well, this is where things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only

37:09.300 --> 37:14.580
way to explain this is to shift the goalpost and say that actually autogenophilia isn't a

37:14.580 --> 37:20.020
paraphilia at all. It's actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition

37:20.020 --> 37:25.700
is you actually pair bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman

37:25.700 --> 37:30.660
you've become. And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it

37:30.660 --> 37:35.220
doesn't. A pair bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that

37:35.220 --> 37:40.340
trans women are a man and a woman inside this? Why do they continue falling in love with other

37:40.340 --> 37:44.420
people? I can't even start with this. This video is too long, I'm getting cranky. Look, this seems

37:44.420 --> 37:50.020
like the point where Occam's razor shuts down Blanchard's theory. Like, okay, maybe I subconsciously

37:50.020 --> 37:55.460
created a female alter ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of

37:55.460 --> 38:00.180
things. Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the

38:00.180 --> 38:06.020
elder gods ripped my primordial duality and twain and now I'm yearning for my female half. Or maybe

38:06.020 --> 38:13.620
I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while. 11. True autogenophiles.

38:13.620 --> 38:18.740
Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are admittedly a few accounts of trans women

38:18.740 --> 38:24.020
whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely

38:24.020 --> 38:28.420
autogenophilic. And I'm not going to say that these people are lying about their experiences

38:28.420 --> 38:34.100
because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about

38:34.100 --> 38:39.700
judging people, so I'm not going to say that these people aren't really trans. I mean, I find it weird

38:39.700 --> 38:45.300
and hard to imagine, but whatever. I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits. And

38:45.300 --> 38:50.980
wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogenophilic feelings, I would just tell you.

38:50.980 --> 38:55.460
I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own diary on my deathbed.

38:55.460 --> 39:00.660
But I just don't. This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations to transition. And that's

39:00.660 --> 39:05.380
ultimately the reason most trans women hate this theory. Not because of wounded narcissism or

39:05.380 --> 39:10.580
shattered erotic delusions. We just don't like being misrepresented. But you know who does love

39:10.580 --> 39:17.060
this theory? She's been there literally the whole time. You know, I realize that by talking about

39:17.060 --> 39:21.540
this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless psychoanalysis. Whether it's going to come from

39:21.540 --> 39:26.420
turf reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for even talking about this, or who knows,

39:26.420 --> 39:31.220
maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what? Why don't we just get that out of the

39:31.220 --> 39:38.340
way right now? It's time to put this tranny on trial. 12. The Autogenophilia Trial of ContraPoints

39:39.540 --> 39:44.100
All rise. The Autogenophilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.

39:44.100 --> 39:50.260
Judge Bailey presiding. Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus ContraPoints.

39:50.260 --> 39:56.260
Are both sides ready? District Attorney Cockbean, ready for the subreddit, Your Honor.

39:57.540 --> 40:04.100
Ready, I guess. Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man. A full-grown,

40:04.100 --> 40:10.100
six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress. It's really more of a hospital gown? The evidence will

40:10.100 --> 40:15.140
show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert role-playing as such for his own

40:15.140 --> 40:21.060
twisted sexual amusement. Abio, what are you holding? It's for horseback riding. Your Honor,

40:21.060 --> 40:26.100
I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip uploaded to YouTube by the defendant

40:26.100 --> 40:42.900
on June 13th, 2016. Oh god. Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an

40:42.900 --> 40:48.500
autogenophile, then I don't have two X chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

40:48.500 --> 40:52.740
Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place? The court does not

40:52.740 --> 40:57.540
need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals. I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.

40:57.540 --> 41:02.900
What? Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frankenfurter. Your Honor, I'd like to

41:02.900 --> 41:08.180
admit into evidence the following photograph. That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one's

41:08.260 --> 41:14.820
on the house, Kiwi Farms. Are you a Rocky Horror fan, Your Honor? Am I? It's just a jump to the left.

41:15.940 --> 41:22.980
And take a step to the right. Put your hands on your hips. And bring your knees in tight.

41:24.260 --> 41:30.420
But it's the pelvic thrust. Ew. So you like to dress up as another cross-dressing autogenophile.

41:30.420 --> 41:36.020
How is that helping your case at all? Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic,

41:36.020 --> 41:40.100
but when you're living as a man, there aren't a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try

41:40.100 --> 41:45.220
out cross-dressing. You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time

41:45.220 --> 41:49.780
it's socially allowed to be a freakish monster. And come to think of it, the scary monster

41:49.780 --> 41:54.260
autogenophile is a trope I've played with since the beginning of this channel. The whole

41:54.260 --> 42:00.100
ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogenophilia chic. I originally was going to have the narrator

42:00.100 --> 42:05.540
of this channel be more of a fictional character. The idea was to be like autogenophile Harry

42:05.540 --> 42:10.420
Plinkett. And part of that is that I kind of hated myself. I thought I was just disgusting.

42:10.420 --> 42:14.900
Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something

42:14.900 --> 42:20.100
of the horror of gender dysphoria. And part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version

42:20.100 --> 42:26.420
of yourself is actually kind of empowering. Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches.

42:26.420 --> 42:31.700
Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and corsets.

42:31.700 --> 42:36.500
This is just male fetishism. Well, it's true that cis women generally don't dress that way, no.

42:36.500 --> 42:41.060
I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually pretty popular. But I never wear shit

42:41.060 --> 42:45.300
like that anymore. In fact, it actually causes gender dysphoria because it makes me feel like

42:45.300 --> 42:49.940
a male cross-dresser. Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women

42:49.940 --> 42:55.460
wear. I guess that's true. A lot of trans women transition after a period of sort of trying things

42:55.460 --> 43:00.500
out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen. But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense

43:00.500 --> 43:11.540
of female fashion. Like, what did you wear when you were 14? That's what I thought. But also,

43:11.540 --> 43:17.220
why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters? Cis women do. They have some good ideas.

43:17.220 --> 43:22.420
Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then,

43:22.420 --> 43:26.740
Abigail? What would we do then? I don't know what you would do. I think I could manage.

43:26.740 --> 43:29.940
Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.

43:29.940 --> 43:35.220
Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I'll smash them in. I'll smash the shit out of them.

43:36.420 --> 43:40.020
These shoes are cute and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

43:41.780 --> 43:47.860
Would you fuck me? I wouldn't. Your Honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and

43:47.860 --> 43:53.620
corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me? This,

43:53.620 --> 43:58.420
Your Honor, is peak trans. Peak trans.

44:02.340 --> 44:06.900
How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish,

44:06.900 --> 44:11.780
not sexual pleasure. Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs

44:11.780 --> 44:16.900
and is what is known in the trans community as a joke. The corsets, the high heels, these were

44:16.900 --> 44:21.780
primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood and they're efforts that I've left behind. Now

44:21.780 --> 44:26.580
that I'm on female hormones and I live this way full time, I feel the way I'm supposed to feel

44:26.580 --> 44:30.180
and I don't need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean, I still do some things

44:30.180 --> 44:35.220
that cis women don't do. I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done.

44:35.220 --> 44:40.660
I do it because I need to feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest and feeling

44:40.660 --> 44:44.980
that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep, not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not

44:44.980 --> 44:49.940
so I can get off, so I can simply fall asleep. No one ever claimed that trans women are literally

44:49.940 --> 44:54.420
the same as cis women. We have many experiences in common, but in other ways our experiences are

44:54.420 --> 44:58.740
very different. Yes, and you don't have the oppression experiences that cis women have.

44:58.740 --> 45:03.860
Well, you know what, Abigail? You're right. For the most part, I don't. But it's impossible for

45:03.860 --> 45:07.780
us to have an actual conversation about this because you're just such a fucking asshole.

45:07.780 --> 45:11.460
And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences,

45:11.460 --> 45:15.460
don't have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.

45:15.460 --> 45:20.340
Go find someone who transitioned decades ago and talk to them about their experiences as women.

45:20.340 --> 45:24.580
Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive. As do I,

45:24.580 --> 45:29.140
guilty as charged. 13. Final thoughts.

45:29.140 --> 45:33.940
I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video. Some of them

45:33.940 --> 45:38.580
will say things like, why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their

45:38.580 --> 45:43.220
experiences as you? Well, I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis

45:43.220 --> 45:47.780
people to think a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It's

45:47.780 --> 45:52.820
humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis of my most

45:52.820 --> 45:57.540
private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I've had to discuss things that

45:57.540 --> 46:02.180
I'm honestly terrified to discuss because I'm afraid that people will never take me seriously

46:02.180 --> 46:06.820
as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women, this debate is

46:06.820 --> 46:11.860
intensely personal and risky. Our lives and happiness are at stake. Meanwhile, Blanchard

46:11.860 --> 46:17.060
and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They've continuously and

46:17.060 --> 46:22.020
needlessly been derisive and cruel toward trans people, and they've misused their power as academic

46:22.020 --> 46:27.460
authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the

46:27.460 --> 46:32.980
core claim of their theory. I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity,

46:32.980 --> 46:38.900
but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope,

46:38.900 --> 46:43.780
for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by someone who thinks of me as a

46:43.780 --> 46:50.340
woman. Otherwise, I'm fucked. This has been a rough one, girls. I dare say you've earned a song.

46:50.340 --> 47:08.020
Thanks for the times that you've given me The memories are all on my mind

47:08.020 --> 47:25.700
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow, there's something I must say out loud

47:25.700 --> 47:50.420
You're once, twice, three times a lady And I love all of you, yes I do

47:50.420 --> 48:13.140
And I love you, yes I do

48:13.140 --> 48:20.180
And I love you

48:20.180 --> 48:21.220
One more time

48:22.820 --> 48:26.020
And just a step to the right

48:26.020 --> 48:27.300
Put your hands on your hips

48:28.820 --> 48:34.740
And bring your knees in tight It's just a pelvic frost

48:34.740 --> 48:37.860
That really drives me insane

48:38.820 --> 48:42.660
Let's do the time-o-pik-yun

48:44.660 --> 48:48.660
Let's do the time-o-pik-yun
