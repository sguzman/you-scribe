1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,460
Hello, boys!

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,460
I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what

3
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,460
that means.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,060
I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,900
to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,260
Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,660
paladin of the Fourth Reich, but to this priestess of Blasphemes, he'll always be the Golden

8
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,660
One.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:54,620
A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,940
Oh my god, look at his butt.

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,540
Oh my god.

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,820
Daddy, can I have some meat?

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,220
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,220
Oh, daddy.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,700
You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chased since I started my transition.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,220
So, in a sense, I'm a virgin.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,660
And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about

19
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
a little thing called purity.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,020
So now that my decade of gender-dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming

21
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,820
to a close, I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,460
But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,340
and pure absinthe.

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
It's time.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm ready.

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
I'm ready.

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
I'm ready.

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,340
I'm ready.

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,340
I'm ready.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
I'm ready.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm ready.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,340
I'm ready.

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I'm ready.

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
I'm ready.

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
I'm ready.

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm ready.

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm ready.

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
I'm ready.

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,340
I'm ready.

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
I'm ready.

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm ready.

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,340
I'm ready.

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm ready.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm ready.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,340
I'm ready.

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
I'm ready.

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,340
I'm ready.

48
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,340
I'm ready.

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,340
I'm ready.

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,340
I'm ready.

51
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
I'm ready.

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm ready.

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
I'm ready.

54
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm ready.

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,660
What?

56
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,740
Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?

57
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,740
It is, isn't it?

58
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,740
Wellâ€¦

59
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,260
They're shiny and I want them.

60
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,340
It's not my fault black people have good ideas.

61
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,760
What am I supposed to do.

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
Not steal them?

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,260
I'll pop it out.

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,600
Alright thou resplendent champion of the north.

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,300
Hit me with your finest wisdom.

66
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm going to take some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,920
There's always a nice thing to do.

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,520
Well, at least we agree on something.

69
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,080
Aha!

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,800
Autogynophilic narcissist exposed.

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,080
like your whole thing?

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
Misogynistic mental illness confirmed.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
Abigail, what is your damage?

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
Are you okay?

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,600
How's your mom doing?

77
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Is everything all right?

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:17,720
You want to get in the tub?

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Yeah.

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,960
So you're a lost baby girl, and you're a game sweet prince.

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,320
He has an Instagram, and it is delectable.

82
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,480
Meets back on the menu, boys.

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
What ho, you jaunty lads.

85
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
My captain.

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
My king.

87
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Yes!

88
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:47,760
If the golden one didn't exist, I would have to invent him.

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
I need him.

90
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,600
And maybe you need me too, Lars.

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm the moon to your sun, the, uh, the broom hilda to your Siegfried.

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,160
As you become more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky femme.

93
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,640
But you know, I'm noticing that even though you're straight, you don't seem super interested

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
in the bodies of the women in your life.

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,000
And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
me.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,480
I'm not like the other girls.

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,800
I've got the T's and the D's.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,920
On second thought, leave Kranz women alone.

100
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want that blood on my hands.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,120
Well, this is no longer a relaxing bath.

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,600
And that's why we never bathe with fascists.

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I blocked my T, I popped my E, let's talk about degeneracy.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,760
What are people talking about when they call something or someone degenerate?

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,840
Well, let's take a look at some examples from my YouTube comments section and see if

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,320
we can figure it out from context.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,840
Transgender communist degenerate.

108
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,560
Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak.

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
Degen tranny, lal.

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens.

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,840
Or at least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses.

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,180
Well, what's up with that?

113
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,500
This is degeneracy.

114
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,520
You ought to be slung from a tree.

115
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
He likes to rhyme.

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,200
You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.

117
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
The end.

118
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,960
Aww, these people are trying so hard to upset me.

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,800
They've only got one card in the deck though, alas.

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,840
Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,360
like a burly Nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired

122
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
with a loathing of queerness.

123
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,080
Now it's not always just about queerness.

124
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,640
In fact, fascists and social conservatives use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term

125
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,360
to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists, people with disabilities, basically

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,620
anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

127
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,920
But where does the word degeneracy come from?

128
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,960
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,920
The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix d, which means away from, and the Latin word

130
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,320
genus, which means race or kind.

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,980
So to be degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already

132
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,800
sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.

133
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,960
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,520
protoevolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,880
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,

136
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,240
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,320
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,040
The exact same dingbats, yes.

139
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,160
And one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artur de Gabenau, one of the intellectual

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,960
grandfathers of Nazism.

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,360
Gabenau wrote a book called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,720
the idea of the Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos,

143
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,440
and gave the word degenerate its modern fashy definition.

144
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
M'lord?

145
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

146
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,880
intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,200
continual adulterations have gradually affected the quality of the blood.

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,400
In fact, the man of a decadent time, the degenerate man, a properly so-called, is a different

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages.

150
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,000
I think I am right in concluding that the human race, in all its branches, has a secret

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
repulsion from the crossing of blood.

152
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

153
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,360
closely related to degeneracy.

154
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies a fall from a previous

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
date of grace.

156
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,560
By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence were everywhere in the European cultural

157
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
imagination.

158
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,520
During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,320
Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally

160
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
means free thought.

161
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,520
That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,040
Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,

163
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,240
accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,760
And around the same time, a bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word

165
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,400
decadence as the title of their movement.

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,920
Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence, it was 4chan writ large.

167
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,520
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then?

168
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Not at all.

169
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,680
The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive goes

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,160
back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

171
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,480
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline.

172
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,120
And one of the hypotheses was that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence

173
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,160
left the Romans vulnerable to butch visigoths and vandals.

174
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
Is there any truth to that?

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,520
No, it's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives.

176
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,160
The decadent emperors Nero, Caligula, and Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries.

177
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,440
The empire didn't collapse until the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least

178
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,040
two hundred years between the decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was

179
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
thoroughly Christian.

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,080
And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, hail Caligula.

182
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,380
But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient civilizations collapsing

183
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,880
because of the queers.

184
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,800
Here's feminist Camille Paglia on how the transgenders destroy civilizations.

185
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,960
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

186
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
to unravel.

187
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Hang on a second, I'm gonna need to shift up a gear for this.

188
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.

189
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
You can see it happening.

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,200
All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome, nude young men

191
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
athletes that used to be very robust in the arcade period suddenly began to seem like

192
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
wet noodles toward the end.

193
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,760
People who live in such times, they feel that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan.

194
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,760
And homosexuality, heterosexuality, somewhat anything goes, and so on.

195
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,760
But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer

196
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
believes in itself.

197
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:49,760
And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity

198
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,760
on the edges, whether they're the vandals or the huns, or whether they're the barbarians

199
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
of ISIS.

200
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,760
You see them, you know, starting to mass on the outside of the culture.

201
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
And that's what we have right now.

202
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the

203
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,760
transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there, okay?

204
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,760
And so, I mean, that's why I'm concerned.

205
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I feel it's ominous.

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

207
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Riley J. Dennis.

208
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

209
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,760
So the idea is that our infatuation with a feminine decadence means we're going to be

210
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
destroyed by real men.

211
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
You know, like ISIS.

212
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
This doesn't deserve a response.

213
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
We're moving on.

214
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Where does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?

215
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Oh god.

216
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Do we really have to do this?

217
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich...

218
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Dionysian in the street, in the...

221
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Shhhh.

222
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Go to sleep.

223
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
is decadent in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
we have all these hang-ups about guilt and sin in the afterlife.

226
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,760
And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick

227
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,760
and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

228
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,760
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea

230
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,760
of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.

231
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,760
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like, fucking Christian morality, man,

232
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,760
and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party,

233
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,760
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,

235
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,760
European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.

236
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of national socialism.

237
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.

238
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.

239
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,760
And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.

240
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,760
So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from foppington to fascism.

241
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.

242
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,760
One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.

243
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.

244
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,760
And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

245
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:09,760
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married,

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:18,760
not having kids, having kids that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using birth control, having abortions.

247
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

248
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

249
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

250
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,760
There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be responsible and I hate it.

251
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,760
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about driving, okay?

252
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Drink lots of water and pace yourself.

253
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

254
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.

255
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,760
So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.

256
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good, where were we?

257
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms, antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

258
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Hi there, I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.

259
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:16,760
What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax, and I am just going to slowly start to drip in hot candle wax.

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:31,760
So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.

261
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,760
And individual fascists differ on what those things are.

262
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people can't raise children.

263
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.

264
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,760
And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.

265
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,760
So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.

266
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century the social conservative position is not very cool.

267
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,760
So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.

268
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
What they have a problem with essentially is queerness.

269
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Now, what is queerness?

270
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most generic sense queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.

271
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,760
So either your gender is all fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.

272
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,760
But unlike the words homosexual or transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion.

273
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

274
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,760
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,

275
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,760
but only if you shut up about it conform to straight society and try to act as normal as possible.

276
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,760
What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness because think of the children.

277
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,760
We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters, polyamorists, sing it with me.

278
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
These are my favorite degenerate things.

279
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,760
To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.

280
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,760
So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,

281
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.

282
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,760
At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.

283
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,760
In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.

284
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,760
While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper from 1976

285
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
that claims,

286
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,760
which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom.

287
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.

288
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Jeez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?

289
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,760
We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

290
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?

291
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:46,760
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

292
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.

293
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.

294
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
And you know, that's probably for the best.

295
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.

296
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,760
All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.

297
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.

298
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,760
In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you worry about that.

299
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
And that's the difference between me and the fascists.

300
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.

301
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.

302
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.

303
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.

304
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,760
So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,

305
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy,

306
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,760
well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs.

307
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,760
So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine.

308
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Go make white babies.

309
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,760
But I really must insist, upon my right and the right of all degenerates,

310
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,760
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.

311
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Rock and roll.

312
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Rock and roll.

313
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Rock on, gold dust woman.

314
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Take your silver spoon.

315
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Take your grave.

316
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,760
I wake up in the morning.

317
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:35,760
See your sunrise, love is to go down.

318
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud.

319
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,760
They cry out.

320
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Well, did she make you cry?

321
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Make you break it down and shatter your illusions of love?

322
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Well, tell me, is it over now?

323
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

324
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Rock on, ancient queen.

325
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Follow those who'd fail in your shadow.

326
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
That was a jacket.

327
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Rulers make bad lovers.

328
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,760
You better put your king in dumb mouth for sale.

329
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
One more time.

330

Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?
