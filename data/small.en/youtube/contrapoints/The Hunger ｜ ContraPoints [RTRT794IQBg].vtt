The following program is a work of fiction created for educational, artistic, and harm

00:17.400 --> 00:21.520
reduction purposes, in compliance with the video corp Charms of Service.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.760
I love the rules.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.720
Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.760
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.760
T.S. Natalie Wynn.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
War.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.840
What is it good for?

00:43.840 --> 00:44.840
Absolutely.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
Quad.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
Sam.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
Everything.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.040
According to the National Institute for Strategic American Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity

00:52.040 --> 00:53.840
Commerce Policy Research.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.840
Hi.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.640
I'm Jackie Jackson.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.880
You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.520
It only matters that you say.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.560
We don't discriminate here between what is true or false or even downright dangerous.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.720
That's none of my business.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.600
It's none of America's business.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.160
The important thing is that you never stop talking.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.040
Because that's what freedom is all about.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.080
Tonight, the war on drugs.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.600
How do we get these goddamn junkies off the streets?

01:34.600 --> 01:41.880
My first guest is Justine Tableau, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize

01:41.880 --> 01:45.480
Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.080
The editor chooses the title.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.240
I didn't choose the title.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.680
And my second guest is Virginia Lamb, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.960
Virginia, let's begin with you.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.120
Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese

02:03.120 --> 02:08.600
Fentivoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little

02:08.600 --> 02:10.200
minds on hype.

02:10.200 --> 02:17.680
The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.560
How have we reached this point?

02:20.560 --> 02:22.760
Two words, Jackie.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.000
Sexual anarchy.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.120
Let that sink in.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.000
Let what sink in?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.400
Sexual anarchy?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
What does that even mean?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.800
Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.880
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with

02:39.880 --> 02:41.560
aimless fornication.

02:41.560 --> 02:47.000
They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.080
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, global homo

02:53.080 --> 02:54.640
pomo nomo.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.520
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

02:59.520 --> 03:05.320
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.120
The Christian majority.

03:07.120 --> 03:13.480
Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?

03:13.480 --> 03:15.240
Of course, Jackie.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.080
Religious liberties are under attack.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.220
We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in

03:22.220 --> 03:28.240
public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral

03:28.240 --> 03:33.920
bathrooms and drag queens' story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working

03:33.920 --> 03:36.920
power of the precious blood of the lamb.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.960
Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.680
I'm sorry that you feel offended by it.

03:42.680 --> 03:47.160
If it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever twisted

03:47.160 --> 03:49.680
necromancy these people think is Christianity.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.680
Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children.

03:53.680 --> 03:58.400
And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.920
Parents get no say anymore.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.680
They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted

04:05.680 --> 04:06.680
in schools.

04:06.680 --> 04:11.440
You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.600
What's the real agenda here?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.520
Sexual indoctrination.

04:15.520 --> 04:23.360
This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the

04:23.360 --> 04:31.320
remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,

04:31.320 --> 04:33.320
or worse, Episcopalians.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.320
No.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.480
No, I won't stand for that.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
I'm sorry.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.120
What does this have to do with drugs?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.120
No.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.120
Everything.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.280
Addiction and sexual brokenness.

04:43.280 --> 04:49.380
These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.

04:49.380 --> 04:54.280
Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.440
Is anyone going to ask me what I think?

04:56.440 --> 05:00.720
Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
hate preacher?

05:01.720 --> 05:05.240
Well, God has nothing to do with hate.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.680
Christ is the definition of love.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.840
Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.160
I'm talking about you.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.640
Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?

05:14.640 --> 05:18.920
You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.

05:18.920 --> 05:19.920
Exactly.

05:19.920 --> 05:25.800
Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm, rational conversation

05:25.800 --> 05:28.120
with people who have different opinions?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.120
Okay.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.440
Well, let's see how that goes.

05:31.440 --> 05:37.440
Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness

05:37.440 --> 05:40.240
and protect the rights of children.

05:40.240 --> 05:45.240
Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative

05:45.240 --> 05:48.320
therapy that will make them whole again.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.760
Reparative therapy?

05:49.760 --> 05:54.400
You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

05:54.400 --> 05:59.920
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken

05:59.920 --> 06:03.200
and polluted and they need God to make them whole.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.960
You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.840
Are you cancel culturing me right now?

06:09.840 --> 06:12.760
Oh my God, she's totally cancel culturing you right now.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.280
Are you thought policing me?

06:15.280 --> 06:16.280
No.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.960
I'm trying to stop you from thought policing everyone else.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.800
You're saying it should be a thought crime?

06:20.800 --> 06:26.520
You're saying that I am a thought criminal just because I happen to believe in the traditional

06:26.520 --> 06:29.680
biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman who form a covenant before

06:29.680 --> 06:32.760
God who gave his only begotten son to watch away the sins of the world when he died on

06:32.760 --> 06:36.200
the cross and was resurrected three days later, all glory to his name.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.520
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.880
And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say

06:42.880 --> 06:44.120
anything anymore.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.240
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.280
You know who's really being silenced?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.840
People who are silent.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.080
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.520
That's what being silenced means.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.640
So who's really being silenced?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.760
Not people on podcasts.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.640
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced

07:09.640 --> 07:10.640
they are.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
No.

07:11.640 --> 07:17.880
The people who are silenced are people we never hear from because, and I really can't

07:17.880 --> 07:21.960
emphasize this enough, they are silenced.

07:21.960 --> 07:27.600
People in prison, queer teenagers in conservative towns, the actual downtrodden and oppressed

07:27.600 --> 07:29.080
people of this country.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.800
Not you, Miss America.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.920
Not you, Mother Superior.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.720
You're not silenced.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.440
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.200
So you defend your right to say it.

07:41.200 --> 07:47.200
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the N-word?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.440
Why do you want to say the N-word?

07:49.440 --> 07:57.000
So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.240
God damn it, Jackie.

07:59.240 --> 08:05.600
That sounds a little bit like being silenced.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.600
She's stonewalling me.

08:06.600 --> 08:12.360
All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain

08:12.360 --> 08:16.000
that there's certain words they just can't say.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.200
Because of the color of their skin, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.200
Would he?

08:25.200 --> 08:28.080
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.080
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the Gospel?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
That's not the topic.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.640
I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

08:38.640 --> 08:42.080
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.440
You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the Pride Parade, doing all this

08:47.440 --> 08:53.600
sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,

08:53.600 --> 08:59.200
I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging, and

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
I feel for them.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
I really do.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.840
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.920
You know, what you people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate, but all

09:11.920 --> 09:16.120
you're really doing is calling in to question the worthiness of other people's lives.

09:16.120 --> 09:20.960
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.840
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

09:22.840 --> 09:28.080
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that

09:28.080 --> 09:29.200
they know.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.160
But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

09:33.160 --> 09:38.040
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down to the intimidation tactics

09:38.040 --> 09:40.520
of the secular ruling elite.

09:40.520 --> 09:46.000
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore, that we're all supposed to

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their queer ideology, which says

09:58.000 --> 10:02.600
that if your child comes home from school and announces she's a different gender this

10:02.600 --> 10:08.160
week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.840
Slicing up tiny little children's bodies.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.400
That's where this is headed.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.000
The Shrine of Moloch.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.960
Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.000
What are you talking about?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.440
You absolute lunatic.

10:21.440 --> 10:27.360
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should

10:27.360 --> 10:33.760
let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.560
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

10:37.560 --> 10:40.920
Or should I say, Justin?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.760
Oh come on!

10:42.760 --> 10:43.760
Really?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.760
Alright, we're doing this.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.760
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

11:05.760 --> 11:09.760
No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fuck.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.760
Well, don't mind if I do.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.760
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
Good Virginia tobacco.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.760
Jackie, the Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sailor use of cigarettes, vaporizers,

11:24.760 --> 11:27.760
or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.760
Some restrictions apply, results may vary.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Excuse me, Jackie.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.760
I'm really not comfortable with this.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.760
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.760
And I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.760
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.760
Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,

11:50.760 --> 11:55.760
then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.760
Excuse me?

11:57.760 --> 12:01.760
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.760
I'm a libertarian, and even goes baby USA.

12:05.760 --> 12:10.760
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

12:10.760 --> 12:17.760
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a free-for-all.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.760
And now, here we are.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.760
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

12:22.760 --> 12:28.760
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden,

12:28.760 --> 12:32.760
and Kaden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.760
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.

12:37.760 --> 12:42.760
And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.760
And that's the real agenda here.

12:44.760 --> 12:51.760
These people want to lower the age of consent and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,

12:51.760 --> 12:55.760
and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.

12:55.760 --> 13:03.760
Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it, why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses back to the nunnery in old Missouri?

13:03.760 --> 13:06.760
Do they not have demons to slay in the backcountry?

13:06.760 --> 13:11.760
I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.760
For the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.

13:15.760 --> 13:21.760
Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.760
We're living in Orwell's nightmare, but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.760
Amazing.

13:26.760 --> 13:31.760
Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room

13:31.760 --> 13:33.760
and have a respectful conversation.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
Cheers to us.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.760
Is it great?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.760
You know, I don't think it's that great.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.760
And I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you sitting here

13:42.760 --> 13:45.760
interrogating the morality of queer people.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.760
Something you know absolutely nothing about.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.760
Oh, I know more than you might think.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.760
I used to be a homosexual.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
You what?

13:56.760 --> 13:57.760
No, I'm not doing this today.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.760
I'm sorry.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.760
You used to be a homosexual?

14:01.760 --> 14:02.760
That's right, Jackie.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.760
Before I was saved, here we go.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
I used to be a lesbian.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
That's who I thought I was.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.760
I lived that lifestyle.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
You used to be a lesbian.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
Okay.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.760
Name five things you love about men.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
This should be good.

14:15.760 --> 14:16.760
Gather around, everyone.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.760
Let's all witness the power of Christ.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.760
I'm sure this will be very convincing.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.760
I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.760
He commands me to be holy.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
Fear not.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.760
You will no longer live in shame.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.760
For your creator will be your husband.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.760
Okay.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.760
Well, if you want to be the bride of Christ, then by all means,

14:37.760 --> 14:39.760
but, you know, keep it in the bedroom.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.760
I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle on everyone's face.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
Virginia, I'm confused.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.760
I thought people are just born that way.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.760
Like, Jesus can't change that.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.760
Jackie, the mainstream media establishment doesn't want you to know

14:53.760 --> 14:58.760
that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative.

14:58.760 --> 15:02.760
But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.

15:02.760 --> 15:07.760
The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.760
But what if every addict said, well, I'm just a junkie.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
That's who I am.

15:13.760 --> 15:18.760
I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.760
Well, that's a good point.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
Uh, no, it isn't.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.760
Gay is just a feeling.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.760
Homosexual lust, same-sex temptation.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.760
That's a feeling, not an identity.

15:31.760 --> 15:36.760
Like, maybe you struggle with wrath, but you don't identify as wrathful.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.760
Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.760
I want to punch you in the face.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.760
And yet, you haven't punched me.

15:42.760 --> 15:48.760
Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.760
When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,

15:52.760 --> 15:56.760
and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.760
My old self has been crucified with Christ.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.760
It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.760
But before I made God Lord of my desires, I was controlled by sin.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
By drugs.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
By alcohol.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.760
By homosexuality.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.760
So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.760
Wow, behold the power of Christ.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.760
You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?

16:21.760 --> 16:22.760
Yes, I do.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.760
It's pretty cool.

16:23.760 --> 16:27.760
I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.760
Is this a joke to you?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.760
Do you find this humorous?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.760
Yeah, I don't.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.760
Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,

16:37.760 --> 16:41.760
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.760
Away from God, shut out from grace,

16:44.760 --> 16:48.760
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.760
Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.760
Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?

16:57.760 --> 17:01.760
Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?

17:01.760 --> 17:02.760
That's right, Jackie.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.760
What were you addicted to?

17:04.760 --> 17:05.760
Miracle whip?

17:05.760 --> 17:06.760
Veggie tails?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
Communion wafers, maybe?

17:08.760 --> 17:09.760
No.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.760
I was addicted to alcohol?

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
To pornography?

17:13.760 --> 17:16.760
To lusting after women?

17:16.760 --> 17:18.760
And to hype?

17:18.760 --> 17:19.760
Hype?

17:19.760 --> 17:23.760
You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?

17:23.760 --> 17:26.760
Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?

17:26.760 --> 17:29.760
Because I am intrigued.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.760
Jackie, I would love to testify.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.760
You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Girl, not this.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.760
When I left home, I was lost.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.760
I was a wretch.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
I was on fire.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.760
And I rebuked that fire.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.760
I used foul language.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.760
I went out clubbing.

17:48.760 --> 17:49.760
I cut my hair off.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.760
I gained weight.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.760
I was tempted by same-sex attraction.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.760
And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.760
I was always a little more masculine.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.760
I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.760
I used to shoot up testosterone.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.760
That's why my voice is a little lower.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.760
Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same, honestly.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.760
If I didn't know, I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.760
Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.760
Though, if anything, this one's the man.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.760
He's the one injecting testosterone.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.760
God has healed the feminine within me.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.760
All along, God was tugging at my heart.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.760
But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.

18:30.760 --> 18:34.760
I felt a terrible void inside.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.760
I lived in the flesh.

18:36.760 --> 18:41.760
I lived in sin with another woman, hoping to satisfy that hunger.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
Here we go.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.760
When I gazed upon her beauty, I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.

18:47.760 --> 18:53.760
But the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own wickedness.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.760
I knew that lifestyle was wrong.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.760
But I couldn't quit.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.760
Until she broke my heart.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.760
And then...

19:04.760 --> 19:07.760
I was cast into the outer darkness.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.760
Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.760
It was like a part of me was ripped away.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.760
And I was left to face my brokenness alone.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.760
Well, was she a Capricorn?

19:18.760 --> 19:20.760
No, a Sagittarius.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.760
Well, there's your problem.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
Next time, maybe try a water sign.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.760
Stop interrupting.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.760
I'm living for the drama.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.760
Jackie, I was alone.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.760
I was suicidal.

19:31.760 --> 19:32.760
I was an addict.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.760
I was lost.

19:34.760 --> 19:39.760
Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.

19:39.760 --> 19:44.760
And I was surrounded by these women singing.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.760
What can wash away my sin?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.760
What can make me whole again?

19:49.760 --> 19:56.760
Nothing but the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.760
And I felt this tingling all over my body.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.760
And I knew I was hearing the voice of God for the very first time.

20:05.760 --> 20:11.760
Not just the words of the hymn, but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
Yes, we all like music.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
And suddenly my pain made sense.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.760
I don't have to live this way anymore.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.760
In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.760
I was cleansed.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.760
I was healed.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.760
I was delivered.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.760
I was sanctified.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.760
I was redeemed.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.760
My guilty stains were washed away.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.760
And I exchanged my brokenness and pain for His loving grace.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.760
Okay, so I'm confused.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
Do you eat dick now?

20:42.760 --> 20:43.760
What's your deal?

20:43.760 --> 20:48.760
Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room with a repentant heart

20:48.760 --> 20:51.760
and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.760
When I found Jesus, I found someone who truly loves me.

20:56.760 --> 21:02.760
And through obedience to Him, my identity is no longer in my attractions.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.760
But in Christ.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.760
You know what I think, Virginia?

21:05.760 --> 21:10.760
I think that you are immoderate in love and immoderate with substances.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.760
And so you need an imaginary Father figure to make all the rules

21:14.760 --> 21:16.760
because you can't control yourself.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.760
But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else

21:19.760 --> 21:22.760
should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.760
Mental infancy?

21:24.760 --> 21:28.760
Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.760
I know, Justin, the chains of sin.

21:31.760 --> 21:38.760
I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh, the itch, the ache, the shame.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
I lived in mud.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.760
I lived in filth.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.760
I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,

21:44.760 --> 21:49.760
the great whirlwind that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.760
But my shame was hammered to the cross for those who belong to Christ,

21:54.760 --> 21:59.760
how crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

21:59.760 --> 22:07.760
Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.760
Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?

22:10.760 --> 22:11.760
God?

22:11.760 --> 22:13.760
I really don't think He cares, Gorge.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.760
Celipacy is not a good deed.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.760
To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay

22:20.760 --> 22:22.760
and you hate yourself.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.760
I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.760
Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self?

22:29.760 --> 22:30.760
Where is my nail?

22:30.760 --> 22:35.760
Is it hate to be anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation?

22:35.760 --> 22:36.760
Damn it.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.760
To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity of who God made me?

22:40.760 --> 22:44.760
Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole

22:44.760 --> 22:47.760
through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.760
Have you been made whole, Virginia?

22:49.760 --> 22:53.760
Because to me, it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul

22:53.760 --> 22:55.760
and you call it sin and shame.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.760
Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.760
Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrado?

23:02.760 --> 23:04.760
She's hilarious. She's a witch.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.760
We are all half angel and half beast.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.760
The flesh must die so the spirit may live.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.760
The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
Have you really wandered so far as stray?

23:17.760 --> 23:21.760
Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom

23:21.760 --> 23:25.760
that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

23:27.760 --> 23:32.760
What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding

23:32.760 --> 23:36.760
of human sexuality and you're on a save-the-children-type

23:36.760 --> 23:40.760
moral crusade because you lack the adult capacity

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
to face the demons in your own head.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.760
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.760
Well, what even is that, Virginia?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.760
I want specifics.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.760
What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're going to do

23:55.760 --> 23:58.760
if Jesus stops holding your hand for ten minutes?

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
What?

23:59.760 --> 24:03.760
You think you're going to rail a line of hype off a stripper's tits?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.760
Excuse me?

24:04.760 --> 24:05.760
Answer this.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.760
What do you think erotic love is a desire for?

24:08.760 --> 24:11.760
Wait, I know this one.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.760
Sex.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.760
No, that's too easy.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.760
Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.

24:19.760 --> 24:25.760
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,

24:25.760 --> 24:30.760
to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,

24:30.760 --> 24:34.760
to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.760
Love is not the flesh.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.760
It's not temptation.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.760
It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
It's nothing like being an alcoholic.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.760
It's not a craving.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.760
It's a yearning.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.760
The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.

24:54.760 --> 24:59.760
But you people don't understand that because you are vulgarians.

24:59.760 --> 25:03.760
You have no sense of humanity, and you have no sense of the erotic.

25:03.760 --> 25:08.760
Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal, Marxist bullcrap.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.760
Jackie, your brain is so small.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.760
It's just so tiny.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.760
Look at me.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.760
You're a dum-dum, okay?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.760
And I'm going to need you to stop talking.

25:20.760 --> 25:26.760
As usual, the cancel culture woke Stoppo is trying to silence me.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.760
Shh, Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time,

25:30.760 --> 25:34.760
because you're so stupid, and I can't stand it anymore.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.760
So shut up.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.760
I'm giving you the plague, liberal.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.760
Okay, well, I hope it kills me, because I'm done.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.760
See, I'll never get sick, because every day,

25:45.760 --> 25:49.760
I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.760
Doctors don't want you to know about it.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
I could not possibly be more done.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.760
You may be done, but I'm not.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.760
Well, you people never are, are you?

25:57.760 --> 25:59.760
You want to talk about yearning?

25:59.760 --> 26:00.760
I mean, I get it.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
I used to live in shame.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.760
I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.760
Yes, we've all noticed.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.760
Let me tell you, it is not freedom, it is bondage.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.760
You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.760
The flesh possesses you.

26:16.760 --> 26:21.760
Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave,

26:21.760 --> 26:23.760
for the wages of sin is death,

26:23.760 --> 26:27.760
but the gift of God is eternal life and Christ Jesus our Lord.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.760
You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?

26:30.760 --> 26:34.760
Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.760
Only he can fill the void.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
I know.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.760
I used to be like you, Justin.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
I was lost.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.760
I was blind.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.760
I was confused in my identity.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
I used to reject the gospel,

26:47.760 --> 26:49.760
until my sin took everything from me,

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
and I needed a savior.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.760
And then, I called out to God for salvation,

26:54.760 --> 26:57.760
and he came to me as a loving father.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.760
It's not too late for you, Justin.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
You are so loved.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.760
God loves you.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
But this?

27:06.760 --> 27:08.760
This is not God's intent for you.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.760
It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent,

27:12.760 --> 27:14.760
the height of cosmological narcissism.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.760
I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?

27:17.760 --> 27:20.760
Have we run out of fedoras in America?

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.760
I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
God is love.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.760
Is he?

27:27.760 --> 27:29.760
The only love worth having.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.760
What you call love.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.760
The sin I used to live in.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.760
The world, the flesh, and the devil.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.760
That only ever brought me pain.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.760
Yes, because heartbreak is painful.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.760
Love is painful.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.760
The poets are unanimous.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.760
Eros, giver of pain.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.760
What's Sappho?

27:51.760 --> 27:53.760
A pagan pornographer.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.760
The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.760
Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,

27:59.760 --> 28:01.760
then God damn it.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.760
I don't know who can.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.760
Well, God for one.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.760
God has a sexual plan for all of us.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.760
That's odd.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.760
God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.760
Men's and women's bodies fit together

28:15.760 --> 28:17.760
for the purpose of creating children.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.760
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?

28:20.760 --> 28:25.760
Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by, even in this economy.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
You have a guy?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
A semen guy?

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
That's just most guys.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.760
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,

28:32.760 --> 28:36.760
but since I'm among heathens, clearly,

28:36.760 --> 28:41.760
I will do my best to argue not from faith, but from reason.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.760
I love reason.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.760
Do you?

28:43.760 --> 28:44.760
Tell me this, Justin.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.760
Which is better?

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
A love that is eternal?

28:48.760 --> 28:51.760
Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?

28:51.760 --> 28:53.760
I'm sorry your girlfriend left you.

28:53.760 --> 28:54.760
That must have been really hard.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.760
Just to answer the question.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.760
Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.760
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.

29:00.760 --> 29:06.760
Isn't a love that is eternal, superior to a love that is fleeting?

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
Yes, Socrates, it is certain.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.760
And don't you yearn?

29:10.760 --> 29:12.760
Not just for a love in the moment,

29:12.760 --> 29:15.760
but for a love that lasts eternity?

29:15.760 --> 29:17.760
Yes, Socrates, that is evident.

29:17.760 --> 29:24.760
And isn't eternal love what we call God?

29:24.760 --> 29:27.760
Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

29:27.760 --> 29:30.760
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.760
Hmm.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.760
So you have no argument.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.760
Do I really need an argument?

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
This is just a semantic trick.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.760
You're saying that God is eternal love,

29:41.760 --> 29:44.760
and then magically that must exist because

29:44.760 --> 29:46.760
you defined it that way.

29:46.760 --> 29:50.760
So you don't have an argument?

29:50.760 --> 29:51.760
I'm sorry.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
Interesting.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.760
I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism

29:55.760 --> 29:58.760
with a five-alarm lesbo cosplaying as a tradwife.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.760
I'm supposed to take this seriously?

30:00.760 --> 30:01.760
Why?

30:01.760 --> 30:02.760
Why am I even here?

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
What am I doing?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
Why am I talking to these people?

30:04.760 --> 30:09.760
I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.760
I don't think God leads people to podcasts.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.760
Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

30:15.760 --> 30:19.760
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.760
There's a hunger in your soul.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.760
No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.

30:25.760 --> 30:30.760
Do not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.760
Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.760
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.760
If I may quote Psalm 63, please don't.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.760
You, God, oh my God, earnestly I seek you.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.760
I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you,

30:45.760 --> 30:49.760
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.760
Because your love is better than life,

30:53.760 --> 30:56.760
my lips will glorify you.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.760
I will praise you as long as I live,

30:59.760 --> 31:03.760
and in your name I will raise up my hands.

31:03.760 --> 31:08.760
I will be fully satisfied, as in the richest of foods,

31:08.760 --> 31:13.760
with singing lips my mouth will praise you.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.760
Virginia, go to therapy.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.760
Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.760
You're the one who needs to go to therapy.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
No, you go to therapy.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.760
I'll pray for you.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.760
I'll pray for you.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.760
I will pray straight to Satan.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.760
Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little looney toons?

31:31.760 --> 31:34.760
You have your Jesus bullshit.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
You have your gender nonsense.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.760
And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.760
The free market, right.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.760
We all have our little delusions.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.760
The important thing is that we cling to them,

31:48.760 --> 31:52.760
and we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.760
Because that's what makes us free.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.760
And freedom is what makes America great.

31:58.760 --> 32:02.760
Other countries, they don't have choices.

32:02.760 --> 32:08.760
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.760
So can we do drugs?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.760
No, that's illegal.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.760
I thought you said we could choose.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.760
Yes, but we have to make the right choices.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.760
And what if we want to make the wrong choices?

32:18.760 --> 32:21.760
Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.760
You will be locked in a tiny cage.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.760
That is literally the opposite of freedom.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.760
Well, we have to be tough on crime.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.760
It's the only way to keep this country free.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.760
We have to build more prisons.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.760
Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?

32:37.760 --> 32:39.760
Well, Father decides.

32:39.760 --> 32:40.760
Father always decides.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.760
And do you always do what Father says?

32:43.760 --> 32:44.760
Of course.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.760
We always do what Father says.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
Why?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.760
Because Father says so.

32:49.760 --> 32:54.760
Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
Yes, you do.

32:56.760 --> 33:00.760
You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.760
No, I'm not.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.760
I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.760
My heart was also broken by a woman.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.760
I thought she was a cat girl.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.760
She turned out to be a fuckboy.

33:10.760 --> 33:13.760
You are a straight man.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.760
I mean, at this point, I wish.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.760
But no, definitely a gay woman.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.760
We're all stuck with it.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.760
Hold on.

33:21.760 --> 33:25.760
So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.760
Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?

33:28.760 --> 33:29.760
No.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.760
In the mirror?

33:30.760 --> 33:33.760
No, because I'm not a fucking animal.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.760
I can't tell the difference between my own reflection and a different person.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.760
Desire is always for something that you lack.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.760
You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.760
Desire feeds on absence.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.760
It reaches out across a void.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.760
I don't know.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.760
I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
Okay.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.760
Well, thank you for sharing.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.760
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?

34:02.760 --> 34:05.760
Do you have bodies in your basement?

34:05.760 --> 34:07.760
You better watch out or you're going to be next.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
Are those clothes even yours?

34:09.760 --> 34:12.760
Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?

34:12.760 --> 34:17.760
Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,

34:17.760 --> 34:19.760
and I will feast upon it.

34:19.760 --> 34:24.760
Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.760
It's not enough for you to possess a woman.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.760
You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.760
Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?

34:32.760 --> 34:34.760
You're the one who keeps bringing that up.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.760
Nice.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.760
Got her.

34:36.760 --> 34:37.760
Shut up, dum-dum.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.760
I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.760
You stay out of this.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.760
Look, so you're a straight man.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.760
You could have had a wife.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
You could have raised a family.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.760
Your life could have meant something.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.760
But you threw it all away.

34:51.760 --> 34:54.760
You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.760
Do you have babies?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.760
Well, priests don't have babies.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.760
Maybe you think of queer people as priests.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.760
Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.760
Whoa, okay.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
That's Catholics.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
That's not Christians.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.760
That's kind of crossing a line, don't you think?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.760
Oh, has free speech gone too far?

35:12.760 --> 35:14.760
Now it's gone too far.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.760
Can we have a civil conversation, please?

35:17.760 --> 35:21.760
Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?

35:21.760 --> 35:23.760
Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.760
Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility

35:27.760 --> 35:33.760
by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.760
I walk with the Spirit until the day I go to glory.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
That's my meaning.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.760
Your meaning is what?

35:41.760 --> 35:45.760
To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty

35:45.760 --> 35:49.760
until you rot away un-resurrected in the earth?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.760
And for what?

35:51.760 --> 35:54.760
To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
Anything else would be a lie.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.760
If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.760
And with or without your approval and understanding,

36:04.760 --> 36:07.760
I will always be the way I am.

36:07.760 --> 36:12.760
Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?

36:12.760 --> 36:17.760
I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
Just...

36:19.760 --> 36:21.760
Leave children out of it.

36:21.760 --> 36:26.760
Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.

36:26.760 --> 36:32.760
And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.760
Listen, Justin.

36:42.760 --> 36:47.760
I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.760
I know my place in this world.

36:50.760 --> 36:56.760
I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.

36:56.760 --> 37:02.760
Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A dollar sign community?

37:02.760 --> 37:04.760
Well, obviously not.

37:04.760 --> 37:09.760
Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.

37:12.760 --> 37:20.760
So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl GF.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.760
Can you honestly say that you're happy?

37:23.760 --> 37:26.760
That you're fulfilled?

37:26.760 --> 37:29.760
That you have purpose?

37:29.760 --> 37:32.760
That you have hope?

37:43.760 --> 37:46.760
That you have purpose?

37:46.760 --> 37:48.760
That you have purpose?

37:48.760 --> 37:50.760
That you have purpose?

37:50.760 --> 37:52.760
That you have purpose?

37:52.760 --> 37:54.760
That you have purpose?

37:54.760 --> 37:56.760
That you have purpose?

37:56.760 --> 37:58.760
That you have purpose?

37:58.760 --> 38:00.760
That you have purpose?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.760
That you have purpose?

38:02.760 --> 38:04.760
That you have purpose?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.760
That you have purpose?

38:06.760 --> 38:08.760
That you have purpose?

38:08.760 --> 38:10.760
Just do it.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.760
Just do it.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.760
Just do it.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.760
Just do it.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.760
Just do it.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.760
Just do it.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.760
Hello?

38:21.760 --> 38:22.760
Just do it.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.760
Hello?

38:28.760 --> 38:30.760
Jesus.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.760
Don't say that name in front of me.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.760
How did you get in my house?

38:34.760 --> 38:37.760
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
Who are you?

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
What are you?

38:41.760 --> 38:44.760
Well, I used to be an angel.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.760
And now?

38:46.760 --> 38:51.760
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.760
A satanic visitation.

38:53.760 --> 39:00.760
At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
Yes.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.760
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

39:04.760 --> 39:06.760
Do you want it to be?

39:06.760 --> 39:07.760
No.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.760
Look, I've had a terrible day.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.760
I'm really not in the mood for this.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
Well, I can help you with that.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.760
Can you?

39:14.760 --> 39:15.760
Sure.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.760
I can help with anything.

39:17.760 --> 39:27.760
Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.760
Shame?

39:29.760 --> 39:31.760
Is it the shame?

39:31.760 --> 39:32.760
Well, yeah.

39:32.760 --> 39:33.760
There is the shame.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
There's always going to be the shame.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.760
But it's a complex cocktail.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.760
There's the heartbreak.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.760
There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.760
I'm a parched landloose.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.760
I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.760
Oh, emptiness inside?

39:48.760 --> 39:52.760
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.760
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.760
It's not a weird sex thing.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.760
Potions, Justine.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.760
Potions.

40:00.760 --> 40:04.760
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

40:04.760 --> 40:11.760
Potions, elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

40:11.760 --> 40:17.760
Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary, a dealer.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.760
Are you trying to get demonetized?

40:20.760 --> 40:21.760
Sorry.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.760
What potions do you have?

40:23.760 --> 40:27.760
Well, this is one of my favorites.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.760
It's called hype.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.760
This will make you come alive.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.760
I'm going to jump right out of your show.

40:34.760 --> 40:39.760
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.760
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.760
You'll finally get things done.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.760
You'll connect with people.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.760
You'll always know just what to say.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.760
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

40:54.760 --> 40:58.760
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
Pain.

41:00.760 --> 41:04.760
Well, I surely have something for that.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.760
It's called void.

41:07.760 --> 41:12.760
One drop of this, and all the pain will melt away.

41:12.760 --> 41:16.760
The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,

41:16.760 --> 41:22.760
the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.760
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket

41:26.760 --> 41:30.760
of serenity and love.

41:30.760 --> 41:35.760
Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.760
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.760
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

41:42.760 --> 41:49.760
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness all alone?

41:49.760 --> 41:53.760
What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
Because it was embarrassing.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.760
Humiliating, honestly. It was difficult to watch.

41:58.760 --> 41:59.760
Shut up.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.760
Is it some kind of masochism?

42:01.760 --> 42:04.760
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.760
Because you're not impressing anyone.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.760
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

42:08.760 --> 42:11.760
You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?

42:11.760 --> 42:13.760
Because that is pathetic.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.760
And it's so unnecessary.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.760
Because you're choosing to feel bad.

42:18.760 --> 42:24.760
When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.760
Pass.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
The cool kids are doing it.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.760
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it because it's not the 90s.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.760
Kids today are vaping Benadryl. Don't you keep up with this?

42:36.760 --> 42:42.760
Okay, I mean, I respect your choice, but I'm not going anywhere.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.760
I will stay right here.

42:45.760 --> 42:50.760
And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes

42:50.760 --> 42:54.760
that your pain is optional.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.760
And I have the antidote right here.

42:57.760 --> 43:05.760
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain and shame and humiliation

43:06.760 --> 43:12.760
and a heartbreak and boredom, loneliness,

43:12.760 --> 43:22.760
despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.760
Look, I'm a smart person, okay?

43:25.760 --> 43:29.760
And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.

43:29.760 --> 43:35.760
Pathetic? Is it pathetic to feel good?

43:35.760 --> 43:39.760
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

43:39.760 --> 43:44.760
And to me, that's pathetic.

43:44.760 --> 43:52.760
Well, the thing about that is...

43:52.760 --> 43:55.760
Okay, just give me the goddamn void.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.760
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.760
I thought I was going to be here all night.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.760
Well, my will is weak, okay? Can I have the potion, please?

44:03.760 --> 44:05.760
All right, well, let's be a little patient.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.760
You should really do this the right way, okay? It's called a harm reduction.

44:09.760 --> 44:17.760
What you're going to do is put one drop and only one drop of pure void into water.

44:17.760 --> 44:22.760
This is important. Do not do too many drops.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.760
What happens if I do too many drops?

44:24.760 --> 44:26.760
Oh, you'll probably die.

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
I'll die?

44:27.760 --> 44:29.760
I told you it was important.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.760
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

44:31.760 --> 44:35.760
Well, it's difficult to say exactly. It depends on a lot of factors.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.760
Seriously?

44:36.760 --> 44:49.760
But it's your first time, so just do one.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.760
So, do I just drink it or...

44:51.760 --> 44:54.760
Of course you drink it. It's a purely fictional magical potion,

44:54.760 --> 44:57.760
utterly disconnected from any real world social issues.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.760
What else would you do with it?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.760
Okay.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.760
Good girl.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.760
I don't feel anything.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.760
Okay, well, give it a minute.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.760
In about 15 seconds, you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.760
Are you ready for that?

45:21.760 --> 45:25.760
Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.760
In my God.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.760
Damn.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.760
There she goes.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.760
Oh, thank God.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.760
Well, don't thank God, thank me.

45:48.760 --> 45:51.760
I have a father taking credit for my work.

46:18.760 --> 46:46.760
Lucy, Lucy, Luciferia, Mother, a Doctor, Mother, Doctor, Doctor, Mother,

46:46.760 --> 46:50.760
Mom, Mother Void, Mother Void.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.760
Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.

46:58.760 --> 47:03.760
Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?

47:03.760 --> 47:07.760
You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.

47:07.760 --> 47:12.760
You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.

47:12.760 --> 47:15.760
Lucy, can I get a drop?

47:15.760 --> 47:20.760
A drop. I thought you didn't want to go down, dark pads.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
Doctor, my pain is at a ten.

47:24.760 --> 47:27.760
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.

47:27.760 --> 47:31.760
I'm a little disappointed, honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.760
But there is no chase with you, no chase at all.

47:34.760 --> 47:41.760
You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.

47:42.760 --> 47:45.760
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.

47:45.760 --> 47:49.760
Please, just give me the void so I can feel the emptiness.

47:50.760 --> 47:54.760
If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.760
But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?

47:57.760 --> 48:02.760
You call me Mommy now, because I own you.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.760
Yes, Mommy dearest.

49:11.760 --> 49:34.760
Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?

49:34.760 --> 49:37.760
Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.760
So you're going to do five drops?

49:39.760 --> 49:43.760
Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.760
So I'm going to do five drops.

49:45.760 --> 49:50.760
Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.760
By all means, continue.

49:52.760 --> 49:56.760
Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.760
Thank you.

50:39.760 --> 51:08.760
That was dumb. That was so dumb.

51:09.760 --> 51:15.760
Shit.

51:20.760 --> 51:26.760
I need to quit. I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.

51:26.760 --> 51:29.760
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

51:29.760 --> 51:33.760
Yes, Mother. I've got to quit. I just...

51:33.760 --> 51:35.760
Good luck.

51:36.760 --> 51:43.760
I'll quit after one more drop, of course.

51:49.760 --> 51:58.760
All right, that's it. Never again. I'm quitting. I quit.

51:59.760 --> 52:09.760
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.760
How hard could that be?

52:29.760 --> 52:39.760
Oh, I can't do this. I can't do this. Shit.

52:53.760 --> 52:56.760
Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy.

52:57.760 --> 53:00.760
Lucy, wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.760
Wake up!

53:26.760 --> 53:30.760
Lucy, wake up.

53:56.760 --> 54:00.760
Lucy, wake up.

54:26.760 --> 54:30.760
Lucy, wake up.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.760
Lucy, wake up.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.760
