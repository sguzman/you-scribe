0	19720	So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.
19720	25960	I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.
25960	27240	We have to dial in.
27240	33760	Hello operator, connect me to hell.
33760	41240	This was the day that Fire Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,
41240	45080	was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.
45080	46160	There was a lot of hype.
46160	49600	Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram.
49600	52200	There was a promo video full of supermodels.
52200	54720	Tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.
54720	60000	One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,
60000	66200	and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.
66200	72200	So, when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure, turned
72200	77400	out to be two slices of pallet American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere
77400	81280	that can only be described as muddy third world shanty town.
81280	87440	I mean, if you weren't on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.
87440	92560	Just learned about Fire Festival, AKA Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and
92560	93720	rich white kids.
93720	96520	Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.
96520	101120	Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fire Festival.
101120	103560	Instagram, entitled rich kids.
103560	105600	Meet Lord of the Flies.
105600	107680	Let them eat salad.
108400	113000	It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.
113000	117040	You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those
117040	119320	sandwiches were garbage.
122320	128200	Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.
128200	129800	Imagine looking like this.
129800	130800	Imagine being perfect.
130800	133040	Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?
133040	135560	Why are you doing this to women?
135560	140920	One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila, your skin is so perfect,
140920	141920	ooh woo.
141920	148320	And Jamila replied, my skin is currently clear because a, privileged people have more access
148320	153960	to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those
153960	154960	with less privilege.
154960	157680	I also get to sleep more because of this.
157680	162000	All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances
162000	163000	easily.
163000	166520	I believe that trans rights are human rights.
166520	169680	See, I exfiliate twice a week.
169680	170680	Oh boy.
170680	172600	Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, barge.
172600	174040	I'll protect you, queen.
174040	176080	Could she be any more annoying?
176080	178920	Someone wondered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.
178920	183200	This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.
183200	187480	Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.
187480	192000	Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.
192000	198800	But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that
198800	204640	account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of this sting out of inequality,
204640	205640	does it?
205640	210400	And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check
210400	215520	your privilege, a suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart since the rich
215520	221240	and famous now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared
221240	222240	to the rabble.
222240	226200	And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to
226200	227200	it.
227200	232240	I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.
232240	233240	Take me mother.
233240	237960	A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height
237960	239800	of the coronavirus pandemic.
239800	243240	40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.
243240	247360	There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when
247360	250280	we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.
250280	255200	After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised
255200	259760	my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were
259760	262200	normal for just a brief moment in time.
262200	266820	I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now.
266820	271920	So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.
271920	275600	Hashtag this is 40, attack me bitch.
275600	280920	But like Jameela, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver and once
280920	283480	again, it has not gone well.
283480	289120	You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us
289120	290120	eat cake.
290120	295160	Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being
295160	298700	evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?
298700	304400	Your tweet made 10 times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag
304400	305400	gross.
305400	307160	Happy birthday, mmm.
307160	311800	I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfucking.
311800	316760	So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about
316760	318360	was not that she had the party.
318360	322640	I mean, wouldn't she escape to a private island if you got that milk money?
322640	329000	The problem was more that she tweeted about it and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,
329000	330680	a little bit yikesy.
330680	335680	But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?
335680	337360	This isn't a good look.
337360	339840	We say bad optics.
339840	341840	Not relatable.
341840	343480	Relatable.
343480	346120	Relatability is not a moral category.
346120	347480	This is public relations.
347480	348480	It's not ethics.
348480	350560	And it definitely isn't socialism.
350560	352520	Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said.
352520	357160	The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.
357160	360400	They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.
360400	362640	This should have stayed in the drafts.
362640	364160	Hashtag tone deaf.
364160	369480	Isn't the issue that when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine.
369480	372240	We didn't get to have birthday parties.
372240	375960	Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.
375960	382920	So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.
382920	387000	Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.
387480	393840	And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury
393840	401920	music festivals or Kim K's birthday party or Jamila Jamil's privileged pores, no one
401920	404520	ever uses the word envy.
404520	409400	It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our
409400	410880	own psychology.
410880	414840	So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.
414840	415840	What is it?
415840	417240	Where does it come from?
417240	419960	And seriously, what is Jamila Jamil's skincare routine?
419960	421440	Drop it in the comments, bestie.
421440	423600	Okay, so what is envy?
423600	428840	Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.
428840	435200	Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have
435200	438120	what we want but cannot get.
438120	441160	It's not simply wanting what another person has.
441160	444080	That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.
444080	449320	Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,
449320	452040	it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.
452040	456080	And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.
456080	458440	It's emulation or admiration.
458440	460720	At worst it's what the Bible calls coveting.
460720	461720	It covets.
461720	464120	Envy is something darker.
464120	468800	It's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what they have.
468800	474200	You might even hate the person you envy and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated
474200	479640	and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.
479640	484480	Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John
484480	485480	Milton.
485480	488160	It's going to be 90 minutes of milf jokes, kids, so strap in.
488160	492040	So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.
492040	498120	For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary
498120	502560	celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.
502560	507760	It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is, beautiful,
507760	509880	wealthy, masculine men.
509880	516000	For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only
516000	521800	want to date chads or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.
521800	525200	Gaskeep gate boss girl light.
525200	529800	So if you're incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's
529800	533600	emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has.
533600	538720	Or, and this is the more popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing
538720	543440	that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever
543440	548160	want you, and therefore happiness isn't possible, you may as well lie down and rot.
548160	554320	This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia
554320	559280	timeline dedicated to tracking them, and the essential motivation for this violence
559280	560920	is envy.
560920	567600	The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.
567600	572520	The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I
572520	574960	want, then no one can.
574960	576960	In the words of a murderer,
576960	582920	The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.
582920	585440	But most incels aren't murderers.
585440	590000	Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.
590000	594040	The philosopher Max Schaller called it a self-poisoning of the mind.
594040	599120	There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.
599120	601040	Because the other sins are fun, right?
601040	603040	Greed, gluttony, lust?
603040	605480	That's what I call a good time.
605480	607280	But envy is misery.
607280	611080	Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.
611080	616320	Air Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives
616320	620480	would be like without rich parents, yes.
620480	621760	Rich refugee crisis.
621760	625880	We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.
625880	626880	Look around you.
626880	631160	We've got the guillotine memes, we've got edgy teens tweeting Eat the Rich.
631160	633000	And none of this is new.
633000	637880	The slogan Eat the Rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,
637880	644680	Jean-Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said, when the people have no more to eat, they
644680	647080	will eat the rich.
647080	648080	And fair enough.
648080	649080	It's a good source of protein.
649080	650520	But take it from me, kids.
650520	653680	Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.
653680	655320	It's hard to do just once.
655320	656760	You develop a taste for it.
656760	658720	It's like they say at NA meetings.
658720	661080	Once you've wore, you just want more.
661080	662920	Also, who counts as the rich?
662920	663920	Am I the rich?
663920	665440	I certainly hope so.
665680	668160	Because I want you to eat.
668160	669160	Stop it.
669160	671360	See, this is why I quit academia.
671360	674360	If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.
674360	676480	And I don't want to behave myself.
676480	677480	I want to be bad.
677480	679960	Do you want to be bad with me?
679960	680960	Let's be bad.
695440	710560	So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality, and that societies
710560	713080	that have more inequality have more envy.
713080	714080	I used to assume that too.
714080	718440	But the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not be true.
718440	720360	Envy is a basic part of human nature.
720360	725960	It exists in all societies and all economic systems, and it begins anytime two or more
725960	728400	people start comparing themselves.
728400	733240	Part two, the desire for mommy's milk.
733240	739200	According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, daddy, the first stage of human development
739200	744940	is the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course
744940	746840	provided by mommy milkies.
746840	748480	Am I doing too much?
748480	750160	I'll turn it down just a little bit.
750200	755360	So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true, he was a bit
755360	760280	of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas, like penis envy.
760280	764200	Maybe there's transgender men who experienced that, but I don't think it's a basic
764200	766240	fact of the female condition.
766240	769440	As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?
769440	770440	Because I take that personally.
770440	773200	I'm giving it a very serious consideration, doctor.
773200	777880	But I feel like even when Freud is wrong, he's often at least onto something.
777880	783360	Like with the Oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?
783360	784360	That would be weird.
784360	786960	It's more that you desire an archetype.
786960	788920	Mother, right?
788920	789920	Mommy.
789920	790920	You guys got it.
790920	791920	Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.
791920	794320	They're the ones who got me started on this milf shit.
794320	797280	I'm a reverse Socrates, I've been corrupted by the young.
797280	800560	My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.
800560	805760	So Freud says that in the first two years of life, libido is primarily focused on mommy's
805760	806760	milk.
806760	810320	It's also in this stage that envy first emerges.
810320	814360	So I was the oldest child in my family and I was less than two years old when my brother
814360	815360	was born.
815360	819280	So I don't remember this because I was one year old, but my family tells me that when
819280	822880	my brother was born, I was just insanely jealous.
822880	827920	Oh, and I guess now's a good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.
827920	833640	Scholars agree that there is a difference and usually they describe the difference in
833640	834920	one of two ways.
834920	837840	The first is that jealousy is defensive.
837840	843320	It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours, whereas envy is offensive.
843320	846680	It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.
846680	851520	And the second difference is that envy is between two people, the envier and the envied,
851520	855480	whereas jealousy typically involves three people as in romantic jealousy, where you
855480	859080	have the subject, the romantic object, and then the rival.
859080	863320	And the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship
863320	868240	with the romantic object, and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry, just substituting
868240	870400	the romantic object for mommy.
870400	873760	Of course, in ordinary English, people are always going to say jealousy when they really
873760	877960	mean envy, probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.
877960	880560	And I think it's pointless to try to fight that.
880560	885040	Like I wouldn't go around correcting people, but just keep in mind that there is a difference.
885040	888320	So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?
888800	893200	Well, I think it's both, because initially you're defensive of your privileged only
893200	895440	child relationship with your parents.
895440	900080	But a new baby often gets more attention, at least in your paranoid toddler brain,
900080	902520	and you might be envious of that.
902520	907160	In a romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival if she has qualities that you wish
907160	908160	you had.
908160	913160	You know, young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might
913160	915320	be getting preferential treatment.
915320	924080	One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is, it's not FAIR, it's not FAIR, tell me
924080	925080	about it, Pampino.
925080	929840	And I've got bad news, life is not getting any more fair than this.
929840	935880	According to the Bible, one of the first events in human history is the story of Caein, Iabel,
935880	936880	Luso Sermanos.
936880	939000	I don't know why I said it in Spanish.
939000	941760	I guess I just thought it would sound cool.
941760	942760	Was I wrong?
942760	943760	Caein.
943760	948840	It sounds so much better than Caein, Caein and Abel, Caein and Abel.
948840	955520	God tells Caein and Abel each to make a sacrifice, and then God prefers Abel's, you know, because
955520	956520	God loves meat.
956520	962920	Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel, in spite towards God the Father, Caein kills
962920	964360	his younger brother.
964360	969960	In my earliest memories of my brother, I already loved him, and I don't remember the envy,
969960	972560	so I guess I wasn't a Caein.
972560	977440	So I must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder.
977440	983920	Freud says that the older siblings' envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence.
983920	988560	Because at first, you selfishly want to be the special, most loved child.
988560	993040	But you see that your parents love your sibling just as much as you, and you're powerless
993040	994480	to do anything about it.
994480	997720	So your ambition to superiority fails.
997720	1002680	And so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as your
1002680	1003680	envy.
1003680	1009280	And the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct, solidarity, this
1009280	1013360	feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings.
1013360	1019480	And as you get older, the herd instinct evolves into feelings about justice, duty, community,
1019480	1020480	and equality.
1020480	1025880	But Freud thought these feelings retain a vestige of repressed envy.
1025880	1032480	If I can't be the favorite, if I can't have special privileges, then no one can.
1032480	1036280	And from these observations, Freud made the generalization.
1036280	1043760	Social justice means that we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do
1043760	1045240	without them as well.
1045240	1051480	Okay, so we don't want other people to have anything we can't have, so we enviously insist
1051480	1056120	on equality as a defense against the greater prosperity of others.
1056120	1059000	Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.
1059000	1063560	Like I think Freud is definitely onto something here, but don't some of our community feelings
1063560	1069520	also come from a place of genuine care for other people?
1069520	1076080	I cared for someone once, brosled.
1076080	1078080	Well we'll come back to that later.
1078080	1083920	Let's put a pin in me for now, a pin in it for now, and Freud, I mean.
1083920	1086920	Let's put a pin in Freud.
1086920	1094120	In a 1966 book titled Envy, A Theory of Social Behavior, the sociologist Helmut Schuch argued
1094120	1098040	that rather than being, that is a very German name, Helmut Schuch, he's putting me in a
1098040	1103280	German mood, sweetie, Hallo Meine Lieben, Heute Gipps ein Neues Video.
1103280	1105720	I just get worse at German every year.
1105720	1110160	Schuch argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality, Envy
1110160	1115680	is a universal across all human societies, including very egalitarian ones.
1115680	1120280	For example, in tribal and village cultures around the world, there's often a concept
1120280	1126320	of black magic or witchcraft, which are thought to be used by Envy as people to bewitch the
1126320	1127320	ones they envy.
1127320	1131400	You're probably familiar with the concept of the evil eye, which originates in ancient
1131400	1134080	Greece or maybe even earlier than that.
1134080	1139640	Researchers all over the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse, cast by the
1139640	1142080	malignant gaze of an envious person.
1142080	1146680	Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious, but I actually think the concept of the evil
1146680	1152160	eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy, and of the social danger that it
1152160	1153160	poses.
1153160	1157320	You've probably seen these amulets around, there's an emoji for them now, which are
1157320	1159440	supposed to protect against the evil eye.
1159800	1164600	It's called a nazar, which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance, similar
1164600	1168880	to the origin of the English word envy, which is the Latin invidia, which just means to
1168880	1169880	look at.
1169880	1174600	So there's an agreement across cultures that envy is related to sight, the malevolent
1174600	1180520	gaze, the evil eye, and these amulets show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied
1180520	1182280	and want to protect themselves.
1182280	1186640	I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel with an episode on the evil eye, and the host
1186640	1193720	explains that for Muslims, it's customary to say, or God has willed it when admiring
1193720	1197400	a person or object, you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.
1197400	1198400	I love that.
1198400	1202440	It's like no envy, like no homo, but no envy, masha la.
1202440	1207000	The top comment on that video says, you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye
1207000	1208000	monster?
1208000	1211120	Well, don't tell others about your ideas, goals, or wishes.
1211120	1215680	Don't be flaunting your accomplishments on social media or posting pictures of your
1215680	1217200	children.
1217200	1218800	That's how you avoid being jinxed.
1218800	1222560	See, this is where Kim Kardashian went wrong with her birthday post.
1222560	1227120	Clearly, no one in the Kardashian Cinematic Universe has ever heard of the evil eye.
1227120	1229120	Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.
1229120	1233240	Why haven't they heard of the evi- oh, okay, nevermind.
1233240	1238080	Every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.
1238080	1240760	This is a particularly American thing.
1240760	1244960	Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.
1244960	1250280	Like there's advertisements here that literally promise, if you buy this exclusive luxury
1250280	1253600	vibrator, you'll be the envy of all your friends.
1253600	1255720	As if it's a good thing to be envied.
1255720	1257360	Oh, but it is not.
1257360	1259960	If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?
1259960	1264040	They seethe over your successes and celebrate your misfortunes.
1264040	1267720	Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.
1267720	1269600	So why would anyone want to be envied?
1269600	1271560	Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.
1271560	1276400	On the one hand, we need to be loved, but then there's this other drive in us, this
1276400	1283120	like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches, which is kind of in conflict with
1283120	1284560	our need to be loved.
1284560	1290400	In a past Gilded Age, there were stories like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard which warned
1290400	1295400	what a sad and lonely thing success can become.
1295400	1301160	In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostrachismos, which is the
1301160	1304360	origin of the English word ostracism.
1304360	1308480	Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble and each person would write
1308480	1314140	the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.
1314140	1318740	And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for 10 years.
1318740	1320240	No questions asked.
1320240	1322520	I love the ancient world.
1322520	1324640	Things were so direct.
1324640	1329820	Now this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant or
1329820	1331240	just annoying.
1331240	1335120	According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, and one anecdote about
1335120	1341920	Aristides known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen
1341920	1346920	not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.
1346920	1351080	When Aristides asked why, the man replied, it was because he was sick of hearing him
1351080	1354120	being called the Just.
1354120	1355120	It's good!
1355120	1356120	It's so good!
1356120	1359160	See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.
1359160	1361960	This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.
1361960	1367200	People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a
1367200	1372200	massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.
1372200	1376440	According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.
1376440	1381080	This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome because the tallest poppies in the garden will
1381080	1382080	be cut.
1382080	1387760	Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.
1387760	1392800	In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position
1392800	1396880	by purchasing several smaller fields, rather than one larger piece of land.
1396880	1399380	For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.
1399380	1403960	He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.
1403960	1408240	Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously
1408240	1413080	wealthy families who move to the city and they dress like gutter punks, like they're
1413080	1415160	trying to pass as poor.
1415160	1420880	But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy in the way many other cultures
1420880	1423000	do, and I don't think that's an accident.
1423000	1427320	We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to
1427320	1430840	our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.
1430840	1434780	But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely
1434780	1439900	still there, only repressed, confined to the realm of dreams and art.
1443100	1448480	In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting
1448480	1453880	the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear
1453880	1454880	of envy.
1454880	1457180	Black magic, Black Swan.
1457180	1462380	At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.
1462380	1467340	By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead
1467340	1469340	ballerina she's replaced.
1469340	1470940	Did you suck his c**t?
1470940	1474180	Not all of us have to.
1474180	1479380	I love Winona Ryder so much, I love Natalie Portman so much, I love Mila Kunis so much,
1479380	1480380	I just like women.
1480380	1482220	Where's my shock wand?
1482220	1483220	Stop it.
1483220	1484220	Stop stanning.
1484220	1490100	But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia as Nina begins hallucinating Black Swan doppelgangers
1490100	1495100	and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.
1495100	1497100	You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.
1497100	1498580	They'll getcha.
1498580	1501500	Did you have some sort of leslie wet dream about me?
1501500	1502500	Stop.
1502500	1506940	You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the
1506940	1513500	disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism
1513500	1516100	and also of dancing the Black Swan.
1516100	1521140	So she imagines that part of herself is an envious rival who's trying to replace her.
1521140	1524860	It's like her mind is split between two impulses.
1524860	1529980	There's her dominant white swan impulse, which we could call the squidward personality.
1529980	1535220	Perfectionistic and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.
1535220	1540460	And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse, which we could call the Spongebob
1540460	1541460	personality.
1541460	1545140	Intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.
1545140	1551260	In Spongebob Squarepants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming
1551260	1552740	from failed ambition.
1552740	1556860	Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.
1556860	1561620	Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of
1561620	1566260	his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.
1566260	1567900	Spongebob is Squidward's social equal.
1567900	1572220	They're literally neighbors, and they both work the same fast food service job for the
1572220	1574540	same exploitative capitalist.
1574540	1580140	But Spongebob is a Mozardian intuitive genius who's able to transform the most mundane
1580140	1586060	activities, blowing bubbles, flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.
1586060	1591900	Squidward intensely envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't
1591900	1594460	admit that envy to himself.
1594460	1600180	So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for
1600180	1602620	Spongebob's childish behavior.
1602620	1607180	What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
1607180	1615740	Though deep down, Squidward really wants what Spongebob has, which we see when he can't
1615740	1619700	help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away all of his possessions for
1619700	1623900	the chewing gum wrapper that in Spongebob's hands was a source of infinite entertainment.
1623900	1629340	A lot of people my age who watched Spongebob as a kid rewatch it now and are horrified
1629340	1632100	to discover that they identify with Squidward.
1632100	1634620	Whereas as children, they identify with Spongebob.
1634620	1642140	Well, you either die a Spongebob or you live long enough to see yourself become the Squidward.
1642140	1646780	And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing
1646780	1650340	drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.
1650340	1655780	I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.
1655780	1656780	Squidwardian?
1656780	1657780	Are we saying that word?
1657780	1660220	Are we really saying that word out loud?
1660220	1661980	To an audience of millions?
1661980	1662980	Okay.
1662980	1668860	It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.
1668860	1671900	Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart.
1671900	1673660	You gotta watch out for that one, kids.
1673660	1677660	If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose
1677660	1681380	a requiem math for your own father, just say no.
1681380	1687020	So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants, we have a diligent those stuffy wannabe envying the
1687020	1689980	effortless playfulness of the spontaneous genius.
1689980	1707700	So Squidward's envy of Spongebob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.
1707700	1712300	Look, if we were to view Spongebob Squarepants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche
1712300	1716420	– stay with me, ladies, I have an angle here – we could say that Squidward represents
1716420	1721620	what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse, while Spongebob represents the Dionysian.
1721620	1726700	Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.
1726700	1730700	The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,
1730700	1737100	order, logic, morality, and the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward
1737100	1741260	intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.
1741300	1748060	Both Spongebob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict, with the Apollonian envying
1748060	1749060	the Dionysian.
1749060	1754380	Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created, because Nietzsche's
1754380	1757700	whole point is that you need a balance of the two drives.
1757700	1763220	In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like Spongebob, because creating good
1763220	1766980	art requires at least some level of discipline and ordering.
1766980	1769420	See, it is all in the technique.
1769420	1772060	Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.
1772060	1773300	Get off the stage!
1773300	1777060	So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.
1777060	1782420	In order to give the perfect performance, Nina has to unify her fragmented personality
1782420	1787980	and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry between her two artistic impulses.
1787980	1790220	And it's perfect.
1795660	1801980	Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers, can you guess it?
1801980	1808180	Is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us, which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and
1808180	1811100	fear of the American middle class.
1811100	1816900	We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house and a boat, along
1816900	1822700	with the Tylers, a slightly better off-white family, whom the Wilsons envy.
1822700	1824300	You saw their new car, right?
1824300	1828180	You had to do it, you just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.
1828180	1833500	One night the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.
1833500	1838980	Red, the only doppelganger who can speak, explains that her family is metaphysically
1838980	1844900	tethered to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions of their lives and a liminal
1844900	1846380	backroom's underworld.
1846380	1850900	Super fucking liminal, I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting, not again.
1850900	1856220	Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.
1856220	1859980	The two were connected, tethered together.
1859980	1867260	When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty, but when the shadow was hungry,
1867260	1871500	she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.
1871500	1875580	You later find out that all over the U.S., oh, U.S. spells us.
1875580	1877940	Hey, that's the title of the movie.
1877940	1878940	Ohhhhh.
1878940	1884900	The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers and to link arms across the
1884900	1890740	country in a dark parody of the real world 1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across
1890740	1891740	America.
1891740	1897940	So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege and
1897940	1898940	fear of envy.
1898940	1901700	It's not a movie about the working class.
1901700	1905300	If it was a movie about the working class, then the working class would be able to speak
1905300	1911420	human languages and would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds and stagger around
1911420	1912700	like zombies.
1912700	1918220	This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.
1918220	1924100	Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.
1924100	1932580	The fear of the envious poor, of revolution, of slave revolt, but us diverges from other
1932580	1938780	home invasion movies by not just being fearful about the underclass, but also guilty.
1938780	1944940	The idea of the tethered underclass represents life as a zero-sum game where every moment
1944940	1949540	of your happiness is bought with someone else's suffering.
1949540	1956420	It's an incredibly guilty fantasy, an internalization of the black magic logic of people who blame
1956420	1959740	their own misfortunes on the people they envy.
1959740	1960900	As Schuch puts it,
1960900	1964900	My neighbor's harvest can only have turned out better than mine because he has somehow
1964900	1968060	succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.
1968060	1973660	So the fear of envy and the guilt of success are repressed in American culture, but they
1973660	1975860	still find expression in movies.
1975860	1979740	Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.
1979740	1984260	Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol, a story about the guilt of the rich if ever
1984260	1985260	there was one.
1985260	1989740	You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts who show him how wretched and sad the lives of
1989740	1995140	his employees are, and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone, and his funeral is
1995140	1999460	only attended by businessmen on the condition that lunch is provided.
1999460	2003100	Dickens was truly the master of scaring the rich straight.
2003100	2009740	So maybe fear of envy can serve a softly regulatory function by motivating charity and generosity
2009740	2010940	in the rich.
2010940	2015500	But in general, I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.
2015500	2022220	Because remember, the basic logic of envy is, if I can't have it, then no one can.
2022220	2026460	Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.
2026460	2031700	It's taking privileges away, not for the material benefit of the underprivileged, but
2031700	2036180	merely for the psychological satisfaction of the envious person.
2036180	2039980	And that's even worse when you consider that envy is subjective.
2039980	2043940	It doesn't necessarily target objective power and privilege.
2043940	2049020	So envy and politics is not by any means relegated to the left.
2049020	2051180	Conservative politics is rimming with envy.
2051180	2055900	Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt, you often hear people say, I had
2055900	2059300	to pay my student loans, so they should too.
2059300	2062140	Debt forgiveness is not fear.
2062140	2067420	The logic here is, since I didn't get my student debt forgiven, no one should.
2067420	2073660	It's intergenerational envy, which is a pretty common thing, usually older generations envying
2073660	2074660	the young.
2074660	2076660	Kids these days have it so easy.
2076660	2082780	When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast and sent text messages on the Pony Express.
2082780	2087580	The feeling is basically, it's not fear that kids these days don't have to suffer
2087580	2089260	like I suffered.
2089260	2095180	Or think about the concept of a welfare queen, which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.
2095180	2101580	Or the way conservatives talk about immigration, it's all this envious suspicion about illegal
2101580	2106340	immigrants sneaking in and getting government handouts without having to pay taxes.
2106340	2110620	I had to work hard for my money, so why should these people get a free ride?
2110620	2115860	Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant is actually like, except in the imagination
2115860	2117740	of people who envy them.
2117740	2123740	Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people, so it's especially sharp when it targets
2123740	2127860	people who are supposed to be beneath you.
2127860	2133220	The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin made what I think is a pretty compelling argument
2133220	2138500	that both antisemitism and misogyny are partly rooted in envy.
2138500	2144020	She quotes a bigoted argument made by the wife-killing protagonist of Tolstoy's story
2144020	2150300	the Kreutzer sonata, who resents that women and Jews find a kind of paradoxical power
2150300	2151860	in their own oppression.
2151860	2156540	Just like the Jews, as they pay us back for their oppression by financial domination,
2156540	2157540	so it is with women.
2157540	2160140	Ah, you want us to be traders only?
2160140	2161140	Alright.
2161140	2163780	As traders we will dominate you, say the Jews.
2163780	2166620	Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?
2166620	2167620	Alright.
2167620	2170260	As objects of sensuality we will enslave you.
2170260	2171260	Dworkin explains,
2171260	2178100	This dominance of men by women is experienced by the men as real, emotionally real, sexually
2178100	2180380	real, psychologically real.
2180380	2183900	It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.
2183900	2186540	The woman appears to control sex.
2186540	2187940	The man needs it.
2187940	2192260	This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.
2192260	2198220	Women control access to what men want, which gives women a kind of indirect power, thus
2198220	2199300	some men envy.
2199300	2202220	They envy the sexual power of women.
2202220	2206820	It doesn't matter to the misogynists that, especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,
2206820	2210500	women objectively have less power in society than men.
2210500	2214900	He envies women because they have what he desires.
2214900	2222140	Likewise it didn't matter to Weimar antisemites that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.
2222140	2228060	Antisemitism is often rooted in an envious obsession with the disproportionate influence
2228060	2230100	and affluence of Jewish people.
2230100	2235660	It is not the absolute differences between men which feed envy, but subjective perception,
2235660	2242860	the optics of envy.
2242860	2249980	Magic mirror on the wall, who's the cuntest of them all?
2249980	2258220	Thou art cunt, my queen, but hold a lovely maid I see.
2258220	2261460	Oh yes, it's me.
2261460	2262460	What?
2262460	2268100	In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning of this whole transition, you know, like a
2268100	2273180	young little girl going through all these things, having a sleepover with the girls.
2273180	2274180	What do we do on a sleepover?
2274180	2278380	Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?
2278380	2282820	Alas, she is more cunter than thee.
2282820	2290740	My pussy-stunting on the gram has come to nothing.
2290740	2296060	The classic 1937 Disney movie Snow White and the Wicked Milf is the story of a quote, vain
2296060	2301540	and wicked queen who obsessively envies the beauty of her own stepdaughter.
2301540	2303500	Are you sure this was for children?
2303500	2307940	Every day the Milf queen asks the mirror who is the fairest one of all and the mirror responds
2307940	2312460	that the queen is the fairest till one day it says the stepdaughter Snow White is the
2312460	2317380	fairest, which sends the queen into an envious fury resulting in a series of bizarre murder
2317380	2318380	attempts.
2318380	2321660	So first of all, can we talk plot holes dang?
2321660	2326940	Are we really supposed to believe that this is more beautiful than this?
2326940	2328740	Uh, dang.
2328740	2330940	Is the Snow White like 12 years old?
2330940	2331940	What's going on, Walt?
2331940	2334140	Why don't you take a seat?
2334140	2336100	Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.
2336100	2338740	It's hard to tell because she's constantly surrounded by manlets.
2338740	2345060	But she's just so boring and the queen is such a baddie.
2345060	2347100	Step on my throat, mother.
2347100	2348100	This is a horny video.
2348100	2350220	Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.
2350220	2352860	I can feel the pulse back in my veins.
2352860	2357340	So despite the injustice done to its lead Milf, Snow White does illustrate some interesting
2357340	2358620	things about envy.
2358620	2362820	Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft as an expression of envy.
2362820	2367420	We have the age difference, intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.
2367420	2372220	It kind of reminds me of those millennial women who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need
2372220	2374140	to rage against Gen Z.
2374140	2378460	Pretty counterproductive since if you're worried about seeming old, complaining about
2378460	2381620	the youths, it's probably not helping your case gorge.
2381620	2385020	You might wonder if there's also jealousy involved with the evil queen.
2385020	2388740	Like is she worried that the king is going to fall in love with his own daughter?
2388740	2390860	Well, I don't think so.
2390860	2392260	Because we never even see the king.
2392260	2395420	The queen doesn't mention him, it's not about the king.
2395420	2397900	So there's no romantic jealousy involved.
2397900	2402140	It's just one woman envying another woman over beauty for its own sake.
2402140	2407260	We stan a Bechdel test passing a movie about women hating each other.
2407260	2411020	Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gaskeep, light boss.
2411020	2415540	In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version, the queen first tries killing Snow White
2415540	2420500	with beauty accessories, poisoning a comb, and lacing her to death with a corset.
2420500	2422260	I wish I could die that way.
2422260	2423260	Shhh.
2423260	2428260	What's really striking is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.
2428260	2433220	This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look, is willing to transform herself with
2433220	2439220	witchcraft into an ugly old hag, just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.
2439220	2443620	And the queen disguising herself as an old hag parallels Satan disguising himself as
2443620	2444620	a serpent.
2444620	2448820	I mean, you could actually argue that the queen is simply a persona of Satan, its paradise
2448820	2452980	lost all over again, which also happens to be the title of my memoir.
2452980	2458260	The queen is incredibly petty, because even according to the, again, wrong and tasteless
2458260	2462460	mirror, she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.
2462460	2468860	How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy still be consumed by envy?
2468860	2472740	Well, basically, because that's how envy works.
2472740	2478580	It's petty, it's subjective, and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,
2478580	2481780	or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.
2481780	2487460	So you can be the second best in the world, and still be obsessively envious of the one
2487460	2490300	person who may barely even be above you.
2490300	2494980	In fact, there's studies showing that Olympic silver medalists are actually less satisfied
2494980	2499500	with their prize than bronze medalists, probably because the bronze medalist is just happy
2499500	2504980	to be on the podium at all, while the silver medalist is so close to first, they can't
2504980	2507140	help but wonder what if.
2507140	2511860	Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth not by comparing ourselves to any absolute
2511860	2515940	standard, but by comparing ourselves to each other, and we're more likely to compare
2515940	2520360	ourselves to the people who are around us than we are to people who are far away.
2520360	2523500	We could call this the proximity effect of envy.
2523500	2528500	We're more likely to envy people who are close to us, or similar to us, especially
2528500	2530260	people we're in competition with.
2530260	2532660	That's why social media is such a nightmare.
2532660	2537420	It's an incubator of envy, because it puts everyone next to everyone else.
2537420	2543180	So we're all being compared, all in competition, and it can destroy your self-esteem, because
2543180	2548660	you're comparing your actual life to these idealized images, and it also turns public
2548660	2554740	figures into lightning rods for envy, because of the numeric visibility of popularity and
2554740	2555740	success.
2556180	2561980	It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect that envy within an oppressed class
2561980	2566060	is often more venomous and obsessive than envy for the oppressor.
2566060	2572340	So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan, you have women envying other women, because
2572340	2575020	women are often in competition with each other.
2575020	2577340	And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.
2577340	2583500	In media, there's constant portrayals of vain and envious women, jealous bitches, fighting
2583500	2586780	over men, over youth, over beauty.
2586780	2589260	It's like drag queen femininity.
2589260	2591180	Death becomes her femininity.
2591180	2594860	En garde, bitch.
2594860	2601140	So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope, but how do I put this delicately?
2601140	2605620	Sometimes reality is misogynistic, like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.
2605620	2608500	The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.
2608500	2613980	In her 1976 essay, Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood, feminist Jo Freeman wrote
2613980	2617180	about her ostracism from within the women's movement.
2617180	2622540	I've been watching for years with increasing dismay as the movement consciously destroys
2622540	2625540	anyone within it who stands out in any way.
2625540	2628860	And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.
2628860	2630340	And who do they attack?
2630340	2634380	Achievement or accomplishment of any kind would seem to be the worst crime.
2634380	2639500	Do anything that every other woman secretly or otherwise feels she could do just as well,
2639500	2640660	and you're in for it.
2640660	2645640	You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist, a ruthless mercenary out to make
2645640	2650220	her fame and fortune over the dead bodies of selfless sisters who have buried their
2650220	2656180	abilities and sacrificed their ambitions for the greater glory of feminism.
2656180	2657420	Freeman speculates.
2657420	2663660	The primary reason there have been so few great women blank is not merely that greatness
2663660	2669460	has been undeveloped or unrecognized, but that women exhibiting potential for achievement
2669460	2672300	are punished by both women and men.
2672300	2677660	The fear of success is quite rational when one knows that the consequence of achievement
2677660	2680100	is hostility and not praise.
2680100	2683940	So at no point in this essay does Jo Freeman use the word envy.
2683940	2689620	But as usual, envy is right below the surface, causing all the trouble.
2689620	2695020	So Freeman is describing how people from marginalized groups whose ambition raises
2695020	2701640	them above the typical limits set by marginalization are often ostracized from their own communities.
2701640	2704820	But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.
2704820	2706100	I have an explanation.
2706100	2707460	The explanation is envy.
2707460	2710660	And women are more likely to envy other women.
2710660	2713380	Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.
2713380	2715580	Oh god, am I really gonna go there?
2715820	2719740	If we did this topic justice, this video would be 9 centuries long.
2719740	2721020	On guard!
2722140	2722940	Bitch!
2722940	2726580	A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women.
2726580	2728020	And there is some truth to that.
2728020	2733180	There definitely was a time in my life when I used to envy cis women for being cis women.
2733180	2737700	But now I kind of just don't even allow myself to have the thought, what if I were a cis
2737700	2738700	woman?
2738700	2743940	So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible, it's unobtainable, I actually
2743940	2746100	envy cis women less.
2746100	2751420	So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women because of the proximity effect
2751420	2758340	and because another trans woman represents an actual possibility of what I, a trans woman,
2758340	2759340	could become.
2759340	2762700	She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.
2762700	2765380	Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.
2765380	2769220	Am I the only one who finds it hard to watch trans creators?
2769220	2773180	Before I realized I was a trans woman, I fucking loved people like ContraPoints, Nick Spears,
2773180	2774500	and other trans creators.
2774500	2778740	But ever since I realized I was trans, I just get this angry, resentful feeling in the pit
2778740	2782180	of my stomach whenever I get recommended any of these videos.
2782180	2786660	I seriously loved ContraPoints, but whenever I try to watch any of her videos, I just want
2786660	2787660	to scream.
2787660	2790580	I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.
2790580	2793300	I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.
2793300	2794860	Am I just a toxic person?
2794860	2798380	Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.
2798380	2800620	At least not any worse than anyone else.
2800620	2803460	It's just that human nature is a toxic person.
2803460	2808580	And that angry, resentful feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you want to scream
2808580	2813540	and feel such a hatred has a name, and the name is Envy.
2813540	2817220	I actually admire the person who wrote this post, because they're doing the best that
2817220	2822900	any of us can do, really, which is noticing the feeling without endorsing the feeling.
2822900	2827820	I wish that more people could feel things without rushing to a rational defense of the
2827820	2828820	feeling.
2828820	2834020	The rationality itself, often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.
2834020	2836540	Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.
2836540	2842420	For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual who complains that, when I transitioned,
2842420	2847940	I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping, but kids these days just waltz on in and walk
2847940	2849220	out with hormones.
2849220	2851460	It's intergenerational envy.
2851460	2852460	Trans edition.
2852460	2856860	It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone, like the student debt-dippy.
2856860	2860020	If I can't have it, no one can.
2860020	2863420	And look, I do have sympathy and admiration for older trans people.
2863420	2869940	Like, being trans in 2021 is already the maximum level of adversity that I can handle.
2869940	2873420	I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.
2873420	2877180	However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.
2877180	2882860	Envy is not sacred rage, and the malignant demands of envious people should be ignored.
2882860	2884460	God, this community.
2884460	2890420	The constant competition, the envy, the cringing, it makes it really hard to get along with
2890420	2891420	other trans people.
2891420	2892420	Oh, speaking of which.
2892420	2893420	Gay tangents, everybody.
2893420	2894420	Gay tangents.
2894420	2900780	Envy presents kind of a unique problem to same-sex attracted people, because of the
2900780	2905100	increased risk of envying the very people you're attracted to.
2905100	2907100	I want to **** the ones I envy.
2907100	2908100	I envy.
2908100	2912180	You know, it's the classic, do I want you, or do I want to be you problem?
2912180	2916980	I've heard feminine queer women say they could never date another femme, because they're
2916980	2919660	worried they would just end up envying her.
2919660	2925380	So dating masculine women solves that problem, because having separate roles, separate aesthetics,
2925380	2930580	separate categories, helps to avert proximity envy between partners.
2930580	2933620	Unfortunately, I am not that smart.
2933620	2935980	Basically, I am attracted to femininity.
2935980	2940580	But I also want to embody a kind of feminine archetype myself.
2940580	2942740	I'm not masculine, and I don't want to be.
2942740	2946180	You know, I used to think I'd only want to date another trans woman, because of the
2946180	2947180	mutual understanding.
2947180	2951540	But I've kind of realized that at this point, it may actually be more psychologically healthy
2951540	2953620	for me to open up to dating cis women.
2953620	2957060	I used to not want to do that, because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.
2957060	2960660	But at this point, honestly, just be a man.
2960660	2961660	Whatever.
2961660	2962660	It's fine.
2962660	2967220	As a drag queen once said, I'm more of a man than you'll ever be, and more of a woman
2967220	2968220	than you'll ever have.
2968220	2969220	Yes, glide.
2969860	2971820	Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?
2971820	2977420	I think at a distance, it's okay to indulge the attraction-emulation ambiguity.
2977420	2982180	But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone, you have to make up your mind.
2982180	2985940	That you desire this woman, and you do not want to be her.
2985940	2988020	Because think about it from the other perspective.
2988020	2993020	What could be less attractive than someone who literally wants to be you?
2993020	2996260	Teacher, make her stop copying me.
2996260	3002340	Because much as I joke every episode about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,
3002340	3004020	you don't want to date that bitch.
3004020	3007260	Imagine trying to date Eve from all about Eve.
3007260	3008260	Pass.
3008260	3009260	Hard pass.
3009260	3013460	So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything, honestly, and you find yourself envying your
3013460	3017700	partner, my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.
3017700	3020420	An enviable woman wanted to be with you.
3020420	3024900	So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.
3024900	3025900	I get it though.
3025900	3026900	It's complicated.
3026900	3031180	You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm what we truly desire, but how do you know
3031180	3032900	what you truly desire?
3032900	3033900	Do I want mommy?
3033900	3036900	Or do I want to be the mommy?
3036900	3037900	Yes.
3037900	3038900	Just yes.
3038900	3043740	Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.
3043740	3045900	The mother half took over completely.
3046900	3054460	Do I look okay?
3054460	3056700	Is my head on straight?
3056700	3061380	So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.
3061380	3066860	And people especially cannot seem to notice when they themselves are feeling envious.
3066860	3071300	Like that person who puzzled over the angry, resentful feeling in the pit of their stomach
3071300	3073540	without being able to name what they were feeling.
3073540	3077460	There's two reasons why people are usually in denial about their own envy.
3077460	3080220	One is guilt, and the other is shame.
3080220	3081220	Shame?
3081220	3087020	Shame, because admitting to yourself that you envy someone implies that you feel inferior
3087020	3088940	to them, which is shameful.
3088940	3090700	It wounds the ego.
3090700	3093700	And guilt, because envy is malicious.
3093700	3099180	If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable about their success and good fortune,
3099180	3101940	and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.
3101940	3104300	That's cruel and antisocial.
3104300	3108900	It goes against most ideas of morality, and it's a thought that's usually not socially
3108900	3110740	acceptable to admit.
3110740	3117420	So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable, and we deal with that by suppressing
3117420	3118980	it from our awareness.
3118980	3124100	But it is still there, and in order to maintain the denial, we have to convince ourselves
3124100	3129940	that this angry, resentful feeling in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.
3129940	3135580	Think about how in SpongeBob, Squidward shows contempt for SpongeBob's childishness, for
3135580	3142500	blowing bubbles, for having fun at work, when in fact, Squidward envies SpongeBob's uninhibited
3142500	3144180	joy and intuitive creativity.
3144180	3149580	But he can't allow himself to have the thought that he envies SpongeBob, because that would
3149580	3156260	mean recognizing the intolerably shameful truth that he feels inferior to SpongeBob.
3156260	3162100	So what he does instead is convince himself that what he really is, is a refined, sophisticated,
3162100	3169940	scoffing at this childish fool.
3169940	3174100	We could call this envy to contempt sublimation.
3174100	3179580	Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term, which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling
3179580	3185540	or socially unacceptable longing into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.
3185540	3191500	So the classic example used by Freud is the transformation of sexual urges, of erotic
3191500	3194140	energy into creative expression.
3194140	3198180	It's like the founder of the No Fap movement, Lady Gaga, once said,
3198180	3202260	I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone, they're going to take my creativity
3202260	3204180	from me through my f***.
3204180	3209860	So according to Freud, the vast majority of erotic longings can never be fulfilled.
3209860	3215860	Tell me about a segment, Ugh, Misery, but there's a positive side to this, supposedly,
3215860	3221740	which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings into a more socially acceptable productivity.
3221740	3227260	So you know, instead of slicking the bean, maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires
3227260	3232060	or for that matter, philosophical treatises about the will to power, but we'll get to
3232060	3233060	you.
3233060	3237220	Freud thought that civilization itself is built at the cost of our instincts, most of
3237220	3240860	which we have to sacrifice in order to live in a society.
3240860	3245860	So like erotic impulses, I think envy can be sublimated, which is what's happening
3245860	3247940	when it becomes contempt.
3247940	3252820	Another example is the blog McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the tasteless architecture
3252820	3255340	of suburban ostentatious trash.
3255340	3261000	I would argue that part of the fun of this blog is the pleasure and relief of looking
3261000	3267060	down at the rich, because looking enviously up at the rich is painful.
3267060	3272620	It makes you feel inferior, and a way to alleviate that pain is to sublimate envy
3272620	3279700	and pretend that you're an aristocratic aesthete scoffing at the vulgar taste of the araviste.
3279700	3283860	These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.
3283860	3286940	Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.
3286940	3291580	I once heard a trans woman say, at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.
3291580	3296020	The subtext is, there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer who lives in LA and
3296020	3299960	has a lot of cosmetic surgery to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.
3299960	3304740	But it costs a lot of money to look like this, and a lot of trans women can't afford surgeries
3304740	3305740	that they want.
3305740	3310700	And one way to cope with frustrated desire is to convince yourself that the thing that's
3310700	3314020	out of reach is not worth having anyway.
3314020	3317580	See also the discourse on Twitter about how passing is transphobic.
3317580	3321860	There's an ancient Greek fable where a fox wants some grapes, but he can't reach the
3321860	3326920	vine, so he walks away bitterly and says, well the grapes are transphobic anyway.
3326920	3331660	The cisgender version of this is maybe the not like other girls meme, which is classic
3331660	3333580	envy to contempt sublimation.
3333580	3337780	The trope is usually that other girls are popular and slutty.
3337780	3340100	They have fake tans and fake nails.
3340100	3343860	They like partying and makeup and stupid music for idiots.
3343860	3345900	But I'm quirky and real.
3345900	3352300	I listen to Pink Floyd and read books and eat lots of pizza late at night, alone and
3352300	3353300	sad.
3353300	3357020	There's usually a subtext of anxiety about inferiority.
3357020	3361300	The other girls being more socially accepted, feminine, and put together.
3361300	3364700	A lot of times the other girls don't even exist, right?
3364700	3367580	They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.
3367580	3372020	Like where are these other girls who've never eaten pizza and enjoy wearing makeup
3372020	3374020	at 9am on a Saturday morning?
3374020	3375860	Are they between the sofa cushions?
3375860	3379620	Did you put them in with the other laundry or the other girls in the room with us right
3379620	3380620	now?
3380620	3385620	So the feeling of inferiority toward the other girls is reframed as a kind of contemptuous
3385620	3390820	hipster superiority, which is really just an ego-defensive persona of resentment.
3390820	3392540	Like Janice in Mean Girls.
3392540	3393900	She's not even really a lesbian.
3393900	3394900	She's Lebanese.
3394900	3396140	Lebanese.
3396140	3397140	Regina got confused.
3397140	3401820	And then she dances with a boy at the end and is readmitted into girlhood.
3401820	3404140	Thank you for that, Tina Fey, that's very helpful.
3404140	3405140	Great.
3405580	3411740	Another way we can reframe feelings of envious inferiority is by transforming them into moral
3411740	3413420	superiority.
3413420	3418380	Moral superiority often being the refuge of people with nothing better to feel superior
3418380	3419380	about.
3419380	3423700	We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy if we convince ourselves that what we're
3423700	3428700	actually experiencing is justified, legitimate hatred.
3428700	3432700	So for example, think of the morality around sexuality.
3432700	3433700	Part 69.
3433700	3434700	Sluts.
3434780	3436460	Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
3436460	3437460	Cancel me?
3437460	3438460	En garde!
3438460	3439460	Bitch.
3439460	3442940	Why does everyone hate sluts so much?
3442940	3445020	Sluts never do nothing wrong to nobody.
3445020	3449140	Open sexual promiscuity is in a way analogous to opulence.
3449140	3454800	You're conspicuously enjoying something that other people want but may not be able to get.
3454800	3459420	Many cultures have norms about modesty, for example, expecting women to cover their hair
3459420	3460540	in public.
3460540	3464060	This is usually explained as prophylaxis against male lust.
3464420	3469820	But I wonder if it also serves to prevent a more generalized envy, which female beauty
3469820	3471980	has a way of attracting.
3471980	3476140	Men often slut-shame because they want to control female sexuality.
3476140	3481660	And by female sexuality, I do mean male sexuality because often what they're really struggling
3481660	3484100	to control is their own desire.
3484100	3489100	But slut-shaming is also done pretty viciously by women to each other.
3489100	3492420	And that's a complicated thing, it's more than just envy.
3492420	3496780	Sometimes it comes from a sense that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men
3496780	3502180	is compromising the collective sex-withholding power of the group, almost like she's crossing
3502180	3503180	a picket line.
3503180	3509140	But there's also sometimes a resentment that a woman who's showing skin is using her body
3509140	3511740	to get unearned attention.
3511740	3513660	And that smells like envy to me.
3513660	3518220	I don't use my body to get attention, so no one should.
3518220	3522820	The repressed feeling is, maybe I'm a little jealous that she's getting all this attention
3522820	3526180	by posting thirst traps, but you don't think that.
3526180	3535180	You think, I am above this, because I am a chaste, I have class, I am a feminist.
3535180	3539940	I would also suggest accusing her of pandering to the male gaze, thus of course the feminist
3539940	3543740	way of calling someone a low-down, a hoe-bag skank.
3543740	3550460	So again we have envy to contempt sublimation, and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.
3550460	3557660	The psychological need to convince ourselves that envy is morality can become so strong
3557660	3561500	that we actually start inventing things to be outraged about.
3561500	3566100	Take for instance the tendency to imagine that the wealthy and powerful are enjoying
3566100	3572660	wild satanic orgies and indulging all the forbidden, salacious pleasures that we ourselves
3572660	3573740	are denied.
3573740	3579980	Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton reclining
3579980	3585140	in a garden of earthly delights, sampling the pleasures of ephebes.
3585140	3588980	Live, laugh, love that fur.
3588980	3593940	Envy is very imaginative when it comes to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.
3593940	3599060	Let's talk about Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.
3599060	3603180	If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette, it's probably that when she heard about
3603180	3607140	a famine where the people had no bread, she infamously responded,
3607140	3610260	Let them eat cake.
3610260	3611640	What an evil bitch.
3611640	3613500	How could she say that?
3613500	3616460	Well, she didn't.
3616460	3618740	She never said it, it's a lie.
3618740	3624020	The phrase let them eat cake, originally let them eat brioche, first appeared in Rousseau's
3624020	3629580	Confessions, written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.
3629580	3633660	Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.
3633660	3635580	Probably no one ever said this.
3635580	3640260	It's kind of like how the most famous photo of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing
3640260	3642900	a stop being poor t-shirt.
3642900	3644500	What an evil bitch.
3644500	3646140	How could she wear that?
3646140	3647940	Well, she didn't.
3647940	3649500	It's photoshopped.
3649500	3652820	The actual shirt said stop being desperate.
3652820	3657180	Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes of its enemies.
3657180	3660140	I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.
3660140	3664380	I mean, what does a Disney villain, if not an opulent homosexual, seem through the eyes
3664380	3665380	of the Envyists?
3665380	3666380	She all like Google.
3666380	3670140	I'm going to try lowering the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here now.
3670140	3672340	Okay, well that's a much lower ISO.
3672340	3674340	What if I get another white over here?
3674340	3675920	That's what this channel is really about.
3675920	3680140	One biological female's quest to create a harmonious color story.
3680140	3685140	In the years leading up to and during the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette was constantly
3685140	3689660	defamed in these sleazy tabloids called Libelle.
3689660	3691820	It's the same route as the English word libel.
3691820	3697240	The often pornographic Libelle depicted the queen as a bisexual demon who was constantly
3697240	3701240	having drunken orgies and sexually manipulating everyone around her.
3701240	3705580	All of which is very interesting, but none of which is true.
3705580	3711220	The historian Robert Darnton called it an avalanche of defamation that has no parallel
3711220	3713480	in the history of vilification.
3713480	3720060	This woman took the blame, the moral blame, for the structural failings of a broken economic
3720060	3726000	system and by the time she was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793, the actual
3726000	3731360	person Marie Antoinette had long ago been overshadowed by the libelous caricature of
3731360	3732360	her.
3732360	3737380	That was maybe one good reason for executing the former queen, which is that the legitimacy
3737380	3743300	of your new republic is a little more secure when you don't have living monarchs hanging
3743300	3744300	around.
3744300	3745780	Someone better tell the English.
3745780	3749980	But the problem with that reasoning is it has nothing to do with whether or not the
3749980	3752500	queen deserved to die.
3752500	3757100	And beheading a recently widowed mother of two in front of a jeering crowd for political
3757100	3761380	expediency might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.
3761400	3766320	So the revolution had to convince themselves that the queen deserved it, which was pretty
3766320	3771080	easy after decades of, again, false and defamatory gossip.
3771080	3777160	In her biography of Marie Antoinette, Antonia Fraser describes how the prison guards separated
3777160	3782760	Marie from her 8-year-old son, who they plied with alcohol and groomed into accusing his
3782760	3785760	own mother of incestuous abuse.
3785760	3791900	To justify killing Marie Antoinette, they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a
3791900	3792900	mother.
3792900	3798260	So she was convicted of what may as well have been crimes against ethics in games journalism
3798260	3803820	and sent to the guillotine where her last words were sorry to the executioner for stepping
3803820	3804820	on his foot.
3804820	3809060	Uh, women stop apologizing challenge.
3809060	3811300	This is what a girl boss winning looks like.
3811300	3815280	So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.
3815280	3818320	Hey, how are you?
3818320	3824040	An innocent MILF was killed that day, and I, for one, won't stand for it.
3824040	3830800	So look, we have a psychological incentive to believe that people whom we envy are immoral
3830800	3836680	monsters, because then we get to label our hatred and violence toward them justice.
3836680	3842720	Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty, and part of the reason for that
3842720	3847280	is that calling cruelty what it is takes the fun out of it.
3847280	3853380	It reminds me of the second best day in the history of Twitter, October 1st, 2020, the
3853380	3855680	day that Trump got COVID.
3855680	3860720	And I'm going to be honest, I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.
3860720	3866520	Well, well, well, if it isn't the leopards eating people's faces party having their
3866520	3877280	faces eaten by leopards, last time I ate cake.
3877280	3880960	Like Dan Savage said, it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.
3880960	3884720	The next day I tweeted, these last 24 hours have been the first time I've genuinely
3884720	3889480	enjoyed Twitter in years, because his website is good for one thing only, reveling in the
3889480	3891560	cruelest of human impulses.
3891560	3896800	And someone responded to that saying, oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?
3896800	3898600	But why was I being a killjoy?
3898600	3901320	The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.
3901320	3907320	Well, for most people, I guess not me, but for normal people, for other girls, cruelty
3907320	3912600	is only pleasurable as long as they can convince themselves it's something other than cruelty,
3912600	3914000	justice served.
3914000	3921100	So again, reason, rationality are often the attempt to publicly communicate, to evangelize
3921100	3928860	our private feelings, and morality, ethics, and justice are often put forward as the respectable
3928860	3934660	public face of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.
3934660	3940500	But is this a corruption of morality, or have we stumbled onto something darker?
3940500	3947500	What if morality itself is simply the expression of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?
3947500	3949780	It's too early for this.
3949900	3952500	I mean, it's literally 7am, where I'm filming.
3952500	3954180	I don't know how this keeps happening to me.
3954180	3958500	My head gets cut off one afternoon, puts me in a philosophical mood.
3958500	3962500	Next morning, I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about the Fila soves.
3964900	3965900	Meow meow.
3965900	3967420	Hello again, kittens.
3967420	3969420	Let's talk about justice, ooh-woo.
3969420	3971660	I look like a Supreme Court justice.
3971660	3972660	So meow.
3972660	3973660	So meow-you-are.
3973660	3977900	It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know, I wasn't being meow-tally.
3977900	3978900	Look.
3978900	3983500	I have been seeing a lot of comments lately along the lines of Natalie used to do serious
3983500	3985260	academic arguments.
3985260	3987140	Now she only cares about makeup.
3987140	3989380	Alright, you little shits.
3989380	3990380	You want book learning?
3990380	3992100	I'm gonna learn you so hard.
3992100	3997100	I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.
3997100	3999100	Friedrich Nietzsche.
3999100	4000100	Friedrich.
4000100	4001100	Wilhelm Nietzsche.
4001100	4004220	Do you mind if I call you Fred?
4004220	4009340	Friedrich was a German philosopher who had a lot to say about envy and morality.
4009340	4012500	But before we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his life because it's
4012500	4014220	just very funny.
4014220	4019980	Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful
4019980	4021580	little Frederick.
4021580	4024060	He was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.
4024060	4030740	Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain, nearly blind incel who probably slept
4030740	4034180	with a prostitute once and got syphilis and died.
4034180	4036220	Life is funny.
4036220	4037900	Sad, but funny.
4037900	4043140	In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil, the editor says, though he prided himself
4043140	4047140	on being comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been very successful in establishing
4047140	4050980	emotionally satisfying relationships with them, which is hardly surprising.
4050980	4055580	I love when the introduction to a book is just a brutal roast of the author.
4055580	4056580	Who wrote this?
4056580	4057580	Rolfe.
4057580	4058580	Peter Horstmann.
4058580	4059580	You're killing it, Rolfe.
4059580	4060580	You're savage.
4060860	4064980	Frederick's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.
4064980	4070580	What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated, highly neurotic man who had to try hard to
4070580	4073580	avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.
4075580	4076580	Oh.
4076580	4080660	He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable, and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping
4080660	4083940	pills using the name Dr. Nietzsche.
4083940	4084940	Dr. Nietzsche.
4084940	4089300	Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once behind a Dairy Queen.
4089300	4093540	Nietzsche was also a failed musician and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's
4093540	4094540	wife.
4094540	4095540	Ugh.
4095540	4097980	The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.
4097980	4098980	You beta-cuck.
4098980	4101940	Why did I do that?
4101940	4105540	Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?
4105540	4107540	I just want to mom this guy, honestly.
4107540	4109540	I don't even care that he's a misogynist.
4109540	4113020	His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.
4113020	4117700	You know, I think it's interesting that a person this pathetic can also be a genius
4117700	4119140	whose name will never die.
4119140	4123820	He's someone who had a lot of reason to be envious and self-pitying, but his philosophy
4123820	4125900	couldn't be more against that.
4125900	4130500	And as a person of pathetic experience myself, that is unironically kind of inspiring to
4130500	4131500	me.
4131500	4132500	So let's go in.
4132500	4137780	In his book on the genealogy of morality, Frederick wants to explain the origin of the
4137780	4139840	concepts of good and evil.
4139840	4143500	Under what conditions did man invent the value judgments good and evil?
4143500	4145900	And what value do they themselves have?
4145900	4148620	Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?
4148620	4150420	Hang on, my food's here.
4150420	4151420	That's right.
4151420	4152420	You're getting a mukbang, sweetie.
4152420	4155540	Did you think I was going to sit at this giant table and not be eating something?
4155540	4158500	This video has been going on more than an hour, so I assume you guys are drunk by now
4158500	4160780	and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.
4160780	4162180	You guys can't even see.
4162180	4166220	Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat all of this while
4166220	4169420	summarizing the entire life and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.
4169420	4172620	Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider this a challenge.
4172620	4176780	So, Frederick argues that good and bad, not good and evil, that's different, we'll
4176780	4183540	get to that, but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values of people with power.
4183540	4188220	So to be good meant to be powerful, strong, beautiful, healthy.
4188220	4192700	And to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.
4192700	4196060	I'm going to eat one like a cat.
4196060	4199260	And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.
4199260	4204260	So in a lot of languages, the word that means morally good or spiritually noble originally
4204260	4209140	meant noble in the sense of aristocratic, the property to class.
4209140	4213700	Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani, that's Sanskrit for noble truths.
4213700	4215660	Arya means noble.
4215660	4221060	And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble, but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the
4221060	4222060	rich.
4222060	4225900	And originally, it was just the name that a culture in northern India gave themselves,
4225900	4226900	the Aryans.
4227340	4229660	I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.
4229660	4235740	This was later misunderstood by Europeans who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.
4235740	4239300	Oops, god damn it.
4239300	4241820	God damn it kids, can we not?
4241820	4246460	Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut, or the English good, to the name
4246460	4247460	of the Goths.
4247460	4252100	No, not those Goths, the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.
4252100	4254860	Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.
4254860	4259500	I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.
4259500	4264620	The German word schlecht, which means bad, is related to schlichcht, which means plain,
4264620	4270180	simple, originally common, low, not aristocratic, not noble.
4270180	4275700	So good and bad were originally the values of warrior aristocrats who were like Homeric
4275700	4278220	heroes celebrating themselves.
4278220	4282020	And Frederick calls their value system master morality.
4282020	4289740	This glorification of combat, feasting, athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty, these things were
4289740	4291220	called good.
4291220	4296020	And their opposites, weakness, impotence, ugliness, were called bad.
4296020	4300420	The ancient nobles worshipped noble gods who acted like them and shared their values.
4300420	4304700	I mean, if I created a personal goddess, I think we all know what animal that would be.
4304700	4307180	Me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.
4307180	4311260	So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars, the god of war.
4311500	4313500	And it was like they were worshipping themselves.
4313500	4316700	They were dumb jocks, worshipping dumb jock gods.
4316700	4317740	Well good for them.
4317740	4320980	But what about the people who got shoved into lockers?
4320980	4325820	Well, Frederick's example, and this is going to create some misunderstandings later, but
4325820	4331500	his example is the Jews, who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.
4331500	4334460	And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.
4334460	4336780	Oh, they did.
4336780	4337780	Multiple times.
4337780	4340900	But for several centuries, the Romans were just too powerful.
4340900	4342140	No one could stop them.
4342140	4347440	So the question is, what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed and who lack the
4347440	4349460	power to overthrow the oppressor?
4349460	4356340	Well, in that case, frustrated vindictiveness builds over time to become this deep bitterness
4356340	4361220	which Nietzsche gave the French name, resentment in English.
4361220	4365780	Oui, et, oui, absolutement, naturalement.
4365780	4366860	I don't speak French.
4366940	4369340	I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.
4369340	4372940	Mont, pas, cartre, et, oui.
4372940	4375300	I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.
4375300	4378700	Because they're always dressed so well and they speak a sexier language than me.
4378700	4379700	Stop it.
4379700	4380700	This is your final warning, comprendezvous.
4380700	4381700	Good wine, though.
4381700	4382700	I'll give them that.
4382700	4385860	So there's a German word, neid, which means envy.
4385860	4389700	So why is Frederick using this French term, raisontement?
4389700	4391060	What's going on, Frederick?
4391060	4392060	Why are you speaking French?
4392060	4393060	Are you nervous?
4393060	4395060	You're trying to impress me?
4395060	4399020	Nietzsche must have said raisontement because he thought it was something different than
4399020	4400020	envy.
4400020	4402940	I think the difference is resentment, and I'm just going to use the English word so
4402940	4404820	I don't sound like an asshole.
4404820	4410620	Resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has, but of a permanent frustration
4410620	4412580	of the desire for revenge.
4412580	4416260	It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.
4416260	4420940	Now revenge itself implies weakness, at least a temporary weakness.
4420940	4427620	We say revenge is best served cold, but actually, revenge is only served cold.
4427620	4432380	If it's served hot, if someone slaps you and you slap them back immediately, that's
4432380	4434220	retaliation, not revenge.
4434220	4437220	You brought this on yourself.
4437220	4441060	Revenge is only a possibility when you can't retaliate immediately.
4441060	4445900	So you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming, but if you're too weak, too
4445900	4450420	impotent to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.
4450420	4454860	So Nietzsche's argument is that a person who's too weak to get material revenge can
4454860	4460140	instead get psychological revenge by creating a new morality.
4460140	4465900	In Frederick's words, the beginning of the slave's revolt in morality occurs when raisontement
4465900	4468980	itself turns creative and gives birth to values.
4468980	4471940	This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?
4471940	4473100	What are you doing, Frederick?
4473100	4479300	So while master morality says that good is power, riches, health, and strength, and bad
4479300	4485460	is the opposite, slave morality, the morality of resentment, says, blessed are the poor,
4485460	4488340	the meek, the sick, the powerless.
4488340	4494220	This is the good of slave morality, and its opposite is not the bad, but a new concept,
4494220	4495220	the evil.
4495220	4496620	And what is evil?
4496620	4504340	Well, everything that master morality says is good, power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.
4510300	4512580	He's talking about Christianity here.
4512580	4514540	He's not talking about Judaism.
4514540	4519180	But Frederick thinks of Christianity as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the
4519180	4522940	Romans, an inversion of the Empire's values.
4522940	4526980	But he also thinks that slave morality is fundamentally dishonest.
4526980	4529060	It's like the fox and the grapes.
4529060	4534140	Not being able to take revenge is called not wanting to take revenge.
4534140	4536740	It might even be called forgiveness.
4536740	4540540	Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.
4540540	4544460	Submission to people you hate is called obedience.
4544460	4547540	Having to wait is called patience.
4547540	4553420	Inability to satisfy sexual desire is called chastity, purity, and so on.
4553420	4559740	And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself as a powerful, noble beast
4559740	4565780	of prey, slave morality is born of saying no to the master and everything he has that
4565780	4566780	you can't.
4566780	4569060	I like to have my belly rubbed.
4569060	4571060	Scratch my back above my tail, please.
4571060	4574540	I'm going to put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm and I'm full.
4574540	4576260	This has not been a successful mukbang.
4576260	4580100	It turns out that it's actually very difficult to do a mukbang while talking.
4580100	4581780	I should have thought this through a little harder.
4581780	4584860	So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge.
4584860	4588220	But that desire for revenge never completely disappears.
4588220	4592740	It's there, for example, in the Christian idea of the Last Judgment.
4592740	4595580	No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.
4595580	4596900	God will do that for us.
4596900	4602220	And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.
4602220	4605060	I find this book thrilling to read, honestly.
4605060	4608780	And I'm not easily thrilled, especially not by philosophers.
4608780	4613100	I think this book in particular gets me because, especially if you were raised Christian, this
4613100	4617500	is so the opposite of everything you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels
4617500	4619740	like dirty.
4619740	4620820	Should I be reading this?
4620820	4621820	Is this allowed?
4622060	4625860	Because even if you're not religious, most of us still agree with a lot of Christian
4625860	4626860	morality.
4626860	4629300	Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.
4629300	4630460	Blessed are the meek.
4630460	4631460	Sure.
4631460	4636420	But then Frederick comes along and he's like, mmm, morality is just a cope for frustrated
4636420	4637420	vindictiveness.
4637420	4639580	And you're like, I need to lie down.
4639580	4641020	Where's my smelling salts?
4652460	4653980	But wait, there's more.
4653980	4655340	This gets even darker.
4655340	4660660	Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia of European history, slave morality has triumphed.
4660660	4666020	St. Paul made Christianity marketable, the Emperor Constantine converted, and by the
4666020	4671620	Middle Ages, even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down not to powerful warrior gods
4671620	4675740	made in their own image, but to a god that was weak.
4675740	4676740	Suffering.
4676740	4677740	Victimized.
4677740	4678740	Oppressed.
4679740	4680740	Mmm.
4680740	4685660	So by the 19th century, slave morality had become the only morality.
4685660	4687660	And it's not just Christianity, either.
4687660	4692340	The secular version of these values became socialism, anarchism.
4692340	4697940	About free thinkers and atheists, Nietzsche has this to say, we loathe the church, not
4697940	4698940	its poison.
4698940	4702220	Apart from the church, we too loathe the poison.
4702220	4704260	Okay, the poison.
4704260	4705660	What is the poison?
4705660	4711220	Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind, and turns humans against our own
4711220	4712900	natural instincts.
4712900	4719620	Not just against aggression, but against sexuality, against ambition, against power, against life
4719620	4720620	itself.
4720620	4722940	And there's two possible outcomes of this.
4722940	4726380	One is that resentment becomes a political movement.
4726380	4728740	The conspiracy of those who suffer.
4728740	4730580	The tyranny of the herd.
4730580	4733100	The revolution that eats itself.
4733100	4735620	Only we are good and just is what they say.
4735620	4740300	As though health, success, strength, pride, and the feeling of power were in themselves
4740300	4745780	depravities for which penance, bitter penance, will one day be exacted, among them we find
4745780	4751140	plenty of vengeance seekers disguised as judges with the word justice continually in their
4751140	4753300	mouth like poisonous spittle.
4753300	4757580	So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob, which I'm sure we're all
4757580	4758660	familiar with.
4758660	4764780	The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward and attacks the individual conscience,
4764780	4768780	introducing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.
4768780	4773460	Because slave morality condemns not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing
4773460	4780180	us, but also the beast of prey within, our own animal instincts, what Christianity calls
4780180	4781740	sin.
4781740	4785660	So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.
4785660	4787020	We hate ourselves.
4787020	4789100	We hate our own nature.
4789100	4790420	We hate life itself.
4790420	4792940	I mean, is he wrong?
4792940	4797820	You see a girl boss winning, I only see the world to power.
4797820	4804020	Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats who've become domesticated housepets
4804020	4808100	at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.
4808100	4811740	That's a very valid Frederick.
4811740	4815020	That's super hecking valid.
4815020	4819100	So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far, but I do have a couple critiques I
4819100	4820100	want to say.
4820100	4826340	One is that Frederick associating slave morality with the Jews is very irresponsible.
4826340	4830740	Even though he didn't intend to be anti-Semitic, and even though he was outspoken against anti-Semitism
4830740	4835300	in his own time, when you keep referring to the Christian values you're critiquing as
4835300	4840700	Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge, some people might get the wrong idea.
4840700	4846060	And some people did Frederick, like your dumbass sister Elizabeth Nietzsche, who became a literal
4846060	4850420	alternative ethno-identitarian god damn it Liz.
4850420	4851900	Kind of goth goals though.
4851900	4854500	Yes, that kind of goth, you're right this time.
4854500	4858100	My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick that genuinely
4858100	4861180	caring about other people is an option.
4861180	4865800	Not because caring about other people is repressing your true selfish nature, which is because
4865800	4869100	caring about other people is part of your nature.
4869100	4870420	And isn't it?
4870420	4873060	Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?
4873060	4878540	I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment accurately describes a very real
4878540	4879540	thing.
4879540	4880800	But it's not the only thing.
4880800	4884460	There is genuine care and love in this world I've been told.
4884460	4885460	I've heard rumors.
4885460	4888820	And I'm even going to go so far as to say hashtag not all Christians.
4888820	4890540	Christ, I'm defending the Christians.
4890540	4892460	What is this channel coming to?
4892460	4898220	There are Christians, maybe not most, but still some, for whom love and forgiveness
4898220	4904660	are genuine experiences and not just some kind of twisted impotent passive-aggressive
4904660	4905660	vengeance.
4905660	4910800	Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation
4910800	4918060	of justice and morality is retribution, envy, or some combination of the two.
4918060	4919900	But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.
4919900	4923660	There's a famous Martin Luther King quote responding to Nietzsche.
4923660	4930380	What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive and
4930380	4934580	that love without power is sentimental and anemic.
4934580	4937300	Power at its best is love.
4937300	4944780	Implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is love correcting everything
4944780	4947700	that stands against love.
4947740	4955100	So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.
4955100	4959700	But there still needs to be some kind of emotional or spiritual force that keeps humanity from
4959700	4961340	tearing itself apart.
4961340	4966500	And maybe something like this Christian idea of love for humanity is the missing piece.
4966500	4971660	Because without something like that, I just see retribution and envy snowballing into
4971660	4973500	human self-destruction.
4973500	4974780	And I hate that for us.
4974780	4976580	It's not very sliving of us.
4976580	4977780	Do you guys know about sliving?
4977780	4980060	Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?
4980060	4984100	She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do, but you know, I try to support smaller
4984100	4985100	creators.
4985100	4989100	Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life into one word.
4989100	4990900	It's the new that's hot.
4990900	4993900	Maybe I'll do a video about love when I'm in a better mood.
4993900	4996980	So for now, well, let's put it this way.
4996980	5001300	God is dead and we have killed him, yeah?
5001300	5002300	Sliving!
5006580	5021100	Okay, I'm moisturized.
5021100	5022100	I'm primed.
5022100	5024180	I've proven my academic credentials.
5024180	5025860	Now it's time to do my makeup.
5025860	5028420	That's right children, I'm going full Bailey-Sarian.
5028420	5030980	I'm going full suspicious.
5030980	5034900	So I guess I should say something about the political implications of all this, since
5034900	5037620	I guess this channel is about politics.
5037620	5040860	Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article to remember what I'm doing with my
5040860	5041860	life.
5041860	5048020	So this morality of resentment, of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge judges
5048020	5050420	that power is evil.
5050420	5052540	I don't use foundation, I just use concealer.
5052540	5055580	I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good
5055580	5056580	at makeup, okay?
5056580	5058300	I have a million subscribers on YouTube.
5058300	5059700	I don't need to be good.
5059700	5063900	There was a New York Times article about young women's attitudes toward political ambition
5063900	5068460	and one of the women who was interviewed said, as a white woman, I know I have unearned
5068460	5069460	privilege.
5069460	5072260	So am I really the best person to be in leadership?
5072260	5073260	Uh, yes.
5073260	5074860	Yes, you are.
5074860	5079580	Because we need leaders like you who are capable of questioning the legitimacy of their own
5079580	5080580	authority.
5080580	5084460	Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck with another blonde beast of prey.
5084460	5088980	And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege, especially as a leader, but let's
5088980	5093660	not be so self-effacing that we have faced ourselves off the face of the earth.
5093660	5097120	This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.
5097120	5102220	If you think power is evil, then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,
5102220	5107140	which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance, since, like MLK said, you have
5107140	5111540	to at least have some power to implement the demands of justice.
5111540	5115740	Remember what incels call taking the black pill, this conviction that the reason you
5115740	5119020	don't have a girlfriend is just that you're genetically undesirable.
5119500	5123660	There's nothing you could do to change it, and I guess women are just too shallow to
5123660	5127980	be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite that festers in your heart.
5127980	5131980	For a lot of black pill incels, it seems like there's only one thing left in life that
5131980	5137940	they enjoy, which is simply the pleasure of complaining, of moaning in pain.
5137940	5143180	It reminds me of a comment from Dostoyevsky's second most horrible protagonist.
5143180	5145260	Even in Toothache, there is enjoyment.
5145260	5149540	In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence but moan, but they are not candid
5149540	5153420	moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point.
5153420	5160540	The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain, and part of the satisfaction of moaning
5160540	5163340	is inflicting your pain on other people.
5163340	5168300	This kind of malignant moaning, it's kind of the opposite of music, because a lot of
5168300	5173740	music, like blues, is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.
5173820	5175340	I mean, that's what blues is all about.
5175340	5178300	My woman don't love me no more, but I know her sister will.
5178300	5179820	You know, optimism.
5179820	5183660	I think a lot of incel discourse is really just malignant moaning.
5183660	5188460	Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem, it's just a contagious
5188460	5189740	expression of misery.
5189740	5193660	A moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.
5193660	5195740	Sexual Marxism, they call it.
5195740	5197740	The redistribution of sex.
5197740	5199740	State-mandated GFs.
5199740	5201740	That's very valid.
5201740	5204300	Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.
5204940	5206300	That's not the point.
5206300	5209660	So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.
5209660	5214700	It's very easy to point and laugh at them, but what's harder is to look in the mirror
5214700	5219500	and notice how these exact same tendencies are rampant in our own communities.
5219500	5224780	So the incel black pill is just one instance of what I call an ideology of resentment.
5224780	5228620	A discourse that outwardly appears, like moral or political critique,
5228620	5232540	but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.
5232540	5236460	The goal of resentment politics is not to improve conditions.
5236460	5243180	In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt for any morally compromised sellouts
5243180	5245820	who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.
5245820	5247340	They don't want victory.
5247340	5248540	They don't want power.
5248540	5251340	They want to endlessly critique power.
5251340	5258460	Because for them, critique is an important psychological defense against feeling impotent.
5258540	5260220	Shaylor described it this way.
5260220	5265260	It is peculiar to Rizantamat criticism that it does not seriously desire that its demands be
5265260	5265900	fulfilled.
5265900	5267500	It does not want to cure the evil.
5267500	5270300	The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.
5270300	5271820	What am I going to do with my eyes?
5271820	5273740	I think a pink kind of look.
5273740	5275260	We've been doing a lot of pink looks.
5275260	5277180	I just I love that hay fever look.
5277180	5281980	As a general rule, the more radical a political community claims to be,
5281980	5285180	the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.
5285260	5290380	Self-styled radicals will tell you, superficial surface reforms do not interest us.
5290380	5293100	The problem must be critiqued at its root.
5293100	5297980	And then the root turns out to be this universal, all-encompassing evil, right?
5297980	5299420	Society itself.
5299420	5300460	The system.
5300460	5301500	The machine.
5301500	5307420	A resentment ideologue always imagines himself to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt
5307420	5310860	against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.
5310860	5312860	Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.
5312860	5314620	It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.
5314620	5315980	It's hard to talk while doing this.
5315980	5320540	And nothing short of total revolution counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.
5320540	5322860	We have to dismantle the entire system.
5323660	5324940	Burn it all down.
5324940	5329740	I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent
5329740	5331820	of Christians awaiting the last judgment.
5331820	5333820	Our kingdom is coming, comrades.
5333820	5337900	Often the appeal of utopian ideology is similar to religion.
5337900	5343340	It's not about health care, higher wages, relief from police violence.
5343340	5347740	Those are actual goals that could be demanded, worked for, and achieved.
5347740	5353340	Utopian ideology instead promises relief from some general malaise.
5354220	5355340	Alienation.
5355340	5360620	And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect that Marx ascribes to religion.
5360620	5365660	But release from the general anguish of human existence is not a political goal.
5365660	5368860	There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries.
5368860	5371420	And so far, zero utopias.
5371500	5375260	Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,
5375260	5378700	are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.
5378700	5381500	When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.
5382700	5386220	And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.
5386220	5391260	And because of the proximity effect, envy may actually increase after the revolution.
5391260	5396860	You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade, a successful citoyon.
5396860	5397260	Oui.
5397260	5400380	A coolock than you ever were of the aristocrats.
5400460	5405660	So envy turns paranoid and imaginative in revolutionary moments.
5405660	5410780	It gets sublimated into morality, and the accusations start flying.
5410780	5413740	That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.
5413740	5415740	That peasant is hoarding grain.
5415740	5418780	So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,
5418780	5420220	the gulags fill up,
5420220	5426620	or an authoritarian strongman takes over just to announce another revolution two decades later.
5426620	5428780	The things people will do to stay relevant.
5428780	5429500	Honestly.
5429500	5430220	And for what?
5430300	5433900	What long-term egalitarian utopia results?
5433900	5436060	Socialism with Chinese characteristics?
5438300	5442380	So look, I do understand that sometimes you just have to do a revolution.
5442380	5447100	And if I'd been there in 1789, I'm sure I'd be storming the best deal myself.
5447100	5449580	But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.
5449580	5454060	Revolution is a bloody nightmare that happens because society is collapsing and people are
5454060	5454700	desperate.
5454700	5459100	At worst, revolution is nothing more than a violent day of retribution.
5459100	5463020	And at best, it lays the groundwork for future incremental progress.
5463020	5467340	But it will never usher in utopia, nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,
5467340	5472620	which, I'm sorry to report, is simply the resting state of an uncedated human mind.
5472620	5475980	Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,
5475980	5480220	that all leftist or all egalitarian politics is born of envy.
5480220	5480540	No.
5481100	5483180	This is a specific subtype.
5483180	5487100	There are plenty of reasons, other than envy or fear of envy,
5487100	5491660	to oppose an economic distribution where some people have billions of dollars while
5491660	5494140	other people are dying because they can't afford insulin.
5494140	5498860	Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources to promote human well-being.
5498860	5503420	And personally, I just don't want to live in a country where people are dying because they
5503420	5504540	can't afford medicine.
5504540	5508860	And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes for that not to happen.
5508860	5512380	So while I'm putting down straw man versions of my argument,
5512380	5516300	I'm also not saying, oh, let's just stop being envious.
5516300	5518060	No. That's impossible.
5518060	5519980	I think envy is like libido.
5519980	5524380	It's a basic force of human nature that's more or less unstoppable.
5524380	5529500	But with the right leadership, I think that envy can potentially be sublimated
5529500	5532620	or redirected into something more constructive.
5532620	5537580	Because raw envy is a very bad basis for egalitarian politics.
5537580	5541260	It often targets the wrong people, like millionaires instead of billionaires.
5541260	5544060	And eventually, it turns the revolution against itself.
5544060	5546060	And you get the circular firing squad.
5546060	5547500	The self-cannibalism.
5547500	5552220	The problem I see on the left today is that without any genuine political outlet,
5552220	5555020	resentment mostly manifests as morality.
5555020	5559820	Morality itself being a way to vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.
5559820	5562540	On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?
5562540	5568300	We're all about structural analysis, the material conditions, systems of power,
5568300	5570620	intersectional identity hierarchies.
5570620	5573820	But if you look at what people actually spend their time doing here,
5573820	5576460	it's all this obsessive moral policing.
5576460	5581020	I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win on any major political stage,
5581020	5582620	we feel disempowered.
5582620	5586780	And so this moral fanaticism is a psychological substitute.
5586780	5591100	Like with Marie Antoinette, it's easier to blame people than systems.
5591100	5594460	Also, structural analysis is very boring,
5594460	5597900	and destroying people with gossip is extremely entertaining.
5597900	5604380	This obsessive moral policing also gets turned inward and becomes leftist guilt.
5604380	5607740	You know, this useless internalized scolding.
5607740	5609100	I think I'm done with my makeup.
5609100	5609980	What do we think?
5609980	5610860	Leave a comment.
5610860	5612940	I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare.
5612940	5615820	Since last time I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hiram.
5615820	5620380	So I am going to spray my face a couple times with this Tatcha skin mist.
5620380	5623900	If that's okay with Hiram, it feels good to finally address this feud.
5623900	5624540	Clear the air.
5624780	5627740	I look a lot better with makeup.
5627740	5629580	I don't want to say that I don't have a natural beauty.
5629580	5633900	It's just that it's very much enhanced by painting a different face on top of my face.
5634460	5638780	But hey, at least this way, I've kind of earned it, you know, because it's my skill.
5638780	5642700	So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist that's been running for years.
5642700	5645100	And I haven't listened in a while, but in the early episodes,
5645100	5648940	they'd bring on these women who would confess their feminist sins.
5648940	5651100	You know, hi, my name is Amber.
5651820	5656140	I'm a feminist, but I enjoy being choked in bed.
5657340	5658540	It's hard being a woman.
5658540	5661900	Not only are you being choked, you also feel guilty about it.
5661900	5665820	The same moral hand wringing happens with body positivity.
5665820	5669260	When you make loving your body into a moral imperative,
5669260	5671340	not only are you still going to hate your body,
5671340	5674620	but now you're also going to feel guilty about hating your body
5674620	5676380	because it makes you a bad feminist.
5676380	5679340	So there was one problem, and now there's two problems.
5679340	5680620	Thanks, morality.
5680620	5682380	That's very helpful.
5682380	5686300	Now, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that a lot of conservatives have made
5686300	5689340	some version of the argument I'm making in this video.
5689340	5693660	For example, Jordan Peterson and Camille Palia have argued
5693660	5697020	that academic postmodernists are motivated by resentment.
5697020	5701820	The argument is that deconstructionist literary theory is a kind of envious
5701820	5706380	vengeance against the beauty and virtuosity of canonical great art.
5706380	5708380	And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.
5708460	5712380	A lot of academics are field artists, but I was even more Moncave than that.
5712380	5715900	I've noticed that working-class non-academic socialists
5715900	5719420	do tend to be more productive and more self-advancing,
5719420	5721500	involved in unionizing or organizing.
5721500	5724380	Whereas, it's usually people who went to college,
5727900	5731660	presumably because they had middle-class ambitions at some point,
5731660	5734060	but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,
5734060	5736700	who become the great critiquers of capital.
5736780	5738620	I mean, I can tell you from experience that,
5738620	5741260	when I was eating Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,
5741260	5743420	that's when I was most likely to say things like,
5743420	5745260	According to Antonio Gramsci,
5745260	5747500	in the logic of late-stage capitalism,
5747500	5750300	the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology
5750300	5753180	manufactures the consent of the civil term.
5753180	5754620	Uh, so point taken.
5754620	5758140	But some conservatives take this argument way too far
5758140	5762380	and try to argue that the entire left is nothing but a coalition of resentment.
5762380	5765180	Like, there's a video on YouTube of the philosophy professor
5765180	5769500	Stephen Hicks doing a version of the post-modernism is resentment argument.
5769500	5772140	And in the comments section, there's a bunch of people saying,
5772140	5777180	this describes Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the Democrats.
5777180	5778060	Does it though?
5778060	5781020	I mean, any political movement is gonna have people in it
5781020	5782860	who suffer from resentment poisoning.
5782860	5785580	But Black Lives Matter, at its core,
5785580	5788460	is about the right not to be murdered by police.
5788460	5790620	The slogan, Black Lives Matter,
5790620	5793820	is an affirmation of the value of Black life.
5793820	5796860	So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.
5796860	5799740	Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,
5799740	5802620	was inspired by Nietzsche to create the slogan,
5802620	5804060	All Power to the People.
5804060	5806780	When we coined the expression, All Power to the People,
5806780	5809180	we had in mind emphasizing the word power.
5809180	5812860	For we recognize that the will to power is the basic drive of man.
5812860	5815500	But it is incorrect to seek power over people.
5815500	5819260	We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power of exploitation
5819260	5821180	and racism for hundreds of years.
5821180	5824060	And the Black community has its will to power also.
5824060	5827020	What we seek, however, is not power over people,
5827020	5830060	but the power of control of our own destiny.
5830060	5833900	That, to me, is a role model for how to do identity politics
5833900	5835580	without centering resentment.
5835580	5839980	It's instead an affirmation of self-determination and self-respect.
5839980	5842780	Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.
5842780	5846140	Whereas if your whole political project is defined in the negative,
5846140	5848940	then you're allowing yourself to be defined by your enemies.
5848940	5852140	I find feminism is prone to this where even, and in fact,
5852140	5854620	especially the most radical feminists,
5854620	5857100	cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness
5857100	5861260	of being the second sex and defining themselves against men.
5861260	5864220	Earlier, I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.
5864220	5866540	She's the most radical of radical feminists.
5866540	5869420	And my first impulse is actually to defend her
5869420	5871660	because she's very widely hated.
5871660	5874780	And most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.
5874780	5876460	Like in that Stephen Hicks video,
5876460	5881340	Hicks summarizes Dworkin as calling all heterosexual males rapists.
5881340	5884700	Literally in the preface to her most famous book,
5884700	5885980	Dworkin says,
5885980	5890140	If one's sexual experience has always, and without exception,
5890140	5893260	been based on dominance, how could one understand
5893260	5896780	that this book does not say that all men are rapists
5896780	5898860	or that all intercourse is rape?
5898860	5901260	Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor
5901260	5902860	and I'm just a makeup vlogger,
5902860	5905100	but my gut feeling on this one is,
5905100	5908700	before criticizing a book, maybe read the book.
5908700	5909580	Just a thought.
5909580	5910620	Get it together, prof.
5910620	5913100	You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.
5913100	5914220	I mean, there's no shame in that.
5914220	5915420	It happens to me all the time.
5915420	5919980	That being said, I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct
5919980	5922380	that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.
5922380	5926540	What Dworkin does say in this book is arguably even more bleak
5926540	5928300	than what is falsely attributed to her.
5928300	5930060	The book is called Intercourse.
5930060	5931740	She wrote a book called Intercourse.
5931740	5933660	Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.
5933740	5934940	I can actually easily imagine that.
5934940	5935500	Never mind.
5935500	5939100	So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.
5939100	5941020	Penetration, to be specific.
5941020	5944860	Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,
5944860	5949180	invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.
5949180	5952620	So it's against the Freudian male castration anxiety
5952620	5957580	interpretation where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.
5957580	5958860	Imagine being afraid of that.
5958860	5960540	Imagine being afraid of that.
5960540	5963180	I'm going to get a face lift someday
5963180	5964300	and I'm going to look like this.
5967020	5967660	I'm perfect.
5968460	5970540	I certainly don't agree with everything she says,
5970540	5973100	but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?
5973100	5974700	Closer than Freud, anyway.
5974700	5978460	Think about what men typically say to women during the act.
5978460	5981100	Do they say, hell, I'm being devoured.
5981820	5982860	Never heard that one.
5982860	5983500	Have you?
5983500	5985340	No, usually it's more along the lines of,
5985980	5987580	You like that, don't you?
5987580	5988380	You little...
5988380	5989100	Et cetera.
5989100	5992780	And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded
5992780	5993660	and enjoy it.
5993660	5997260	And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation
5997260	5998460	because they're taught to.
5998460	6003900	But enjoying it, she'd have to say, doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.
6003900	6006220	So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true
6006220	6007980	and some things that are off the fucking rails.
6007980	6010780	Where she loses me is where she starts getting black-pilled.
6010780	6013740	And this book, this is the feminist black pill.
6013740	6017260	It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.
6017260	6018060	She says,
6018060	6022220	Male dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.
6022220	6026140	This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.
6026700	6031420	Okay, so women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.
6032540	6034220	We can dream, Andrea.
6034220	6035100	We can dream.
6035100	6040780	Like most ideology resentment, this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms
6040780	6043420	that might actually improve the situation of women.
6043420	6048540	Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence filth and objection of it all.
6048540	6052140	I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian
6052140	6054940	but in that second wave political way.
6054940	6056220	Quoting from the foreword,
6056220	6059900	To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.
6059900	6064940	In 30-plus years of knowing her, I've never heard of a single romance with a woman not one.
6064940	6069580	This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250-page book about sex
6069580	6074620	that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.
6074620	6077820	Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women.
6077820	6080940	It's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.
6081020	6085180	You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters, but I don't think that's true.
6085180	6088780	I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.
6088780	6093580	The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and Oedipus the King.
6093580	6097660	It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters because they're stuck with this.
6097660	6100460	And love is closer to hatred than neutrality.
6100460	6102700	So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?
6102700	6105420	What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?
6105420	6108780	Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want because no one ever told them they could.
6109580	6110220	Romance.
6110940	6114140	That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.
6114140	6116460	Joan Didion of course being not like other girls.
6116460	6119660	Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.
6119660	6123020	Despite all efforts to socialize women to one intercourse,
6123020	6125900	women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality
6125900	6128860	that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.
6128860	6130060	That does sound nice.
6130060	6130940	I'm so lonely.
6132060	6134860	I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women though.
6134860	6138700	Like there are definitely women out there who they don't make love.
6138700	6139420	Anastasia.
6139980	6142140	They f*** hard.
6142140	6143340	I'm really sleepy.
6143340	6146540	And this bed right behind me just looks so nice.
6146540	6147980	Get in here right now.
6147980	6150460	Whatever it is go to sleep and then wake up
6150460	6152860	and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.
6152860	6153820	I don't want to do it now.
6153820	6154780	I'll get Pikachu.
6154780	6155980	I don't make this easier.
6155980	6157500	Isn't it better for me to have a friend?
6157500	6159580	Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.
6159580	6160060	Why?
6160060	6161420	Because he's the yellowest.
6161420	6163580	Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.
6163660	6164380	You can't name anything.
6164380	6165340	You can't name anything.
6165340	6169180	So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,
6169180	6170380	then just say that.
6170380	6171740	Is that what you want Pikachu?
6172700	6173740	I bet it is.
6173740	6177180	And Dworkin did get married to a gay man.
6177180	6178940	So I guess she found what she wanted.
6179820	6180300	Lucky.
6183100	6184700	Envying Andrea Dworkin.
6184700	6186620	Is that really what we've sunk to around here?
6186620	6190860	You know I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.
6190860	6194300	I know this isn't very original but I had a bad year.
6194300	6197500	You know I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot.
6197500	6200300	Got my heart comprehensively broken.
6200300	6207340	And then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.
6207340	6209340	You know I stopped saying yes to life.
6209340	6212300	And I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.
6212300	6215100	By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon.
6215100	6219580	One of the greatest appropriate for all ages video games of all time.
6219580	6221820	Look at him go.
6221820	6222940	I'm taking the hair clips out.
6222940	6225900	I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.
6225900	6227500	It's because I'm trans.
6227500	6229100	It's because I'm gay.
6229100	6230620	That's why I'll die alone.
6230620	6232140	You know that's the reason I'm alone.
6232140	6234300	Definitely not because I don't leave the house.
6234300	6238780	See I am not immune to incel tear brain poisoning.
6238780	6244300	And you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.
6244300	6246620	Society did this to me.
6246620	6250380	A transphobic society made me hate myself.
6250380	6253500	Well yeah that's true.
6253500	6258140	But at a certain point you have to take responsibility for your own mind.
6258140	6261660	And decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.
6261660	6265260	Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost the mind is its own place.
6265260	6268060	And in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.
6268060	6269020	Yes squad.
6269020	6272620	So I asked myself what kind of mind do I want to be?
6272620	6275100	Do I want to obsess over what I lack?
6275100	6277980	Concede society's judgment of my inferiority?
6277980	6282380	Become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?
6282380	6286220	Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor?
6286220	6289740	Stop chasing the dragon and say yes to life.
6289740	6294460	The answer of course is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.
6294460	6298940	But we're not gonna do that because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.
6298940	6301900	The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.
6301900	6308940	Also nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.
6308940	6311260	It's beyond a personality flaw.
6311260	6316620	It's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance of happiness you have.
6316620	6322620	So in the short time that you're alive you have to discover that which is noble in yourself.
6322620	6323900	And say yes to it.
6323900	6325580	You know don't say no to getting older.
6326140	6327980	Say yes to being a MILF.
6327980	6328700	Yes.
6328700	6329580	Yes.
6329580	6334380	What I'm really trying to say here is Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.
6334380	6337580	Spongebob says yes to life and so should we.
6337580	6339100	Yes to ourselves.
6339100	6340140	Yes to art.
6340140	6341660	Yes to sensuality.
6341660	6343180	Yes to the world.
6343180	6344060	Yes.
6344060	6345020	Yes.
6345020	6346380	Eh, we.
6347420	6349020	Is this really how we're ending the video?
6350060	6351180	I guess.
6351180	6352860	Okay, bye!
6359580	6371100	Oh so what if my fantasies make no sense?
6371100	6373100	You want to talk about things that don't make sense?
6373100	6374300	Heterosexuality.
6374300	6376300	Let's put that under the microscope.
6376300	6381820	You want me to believe that a straight woman who knows the difference between magenta and mauve
6381820	6385740	is going to date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear.
6385740	6387500	And that's just going to work out fine.
6387580	6390060	You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?
6390940	6391980	I don't think so.
6391980	6393180	Not on my watch.
6393180	6395420	See I think straight men should date each other.
6395420	6398620	They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then **** each other.
6398620	6400860	And then straight women can pair off,
6400860	6403820	decoupage some shit and eat each other out.
6403820	6404860	Isn't that better?
6404860	6405980	Isn't that more rational?
6405980	6410620	I wish I could wiggle these cattiers like I wish I had anatomical control over them.
6410620	6411020	Hello.
6411740	6412940	Yes, Dr. Spiegel.
6413500	6414460	Yes, it's me again.
6415260	6416460	I have a suggestion.
6416460	6417260	What do we even have here?
6417260	6428140	We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.
6428140	6429580	I've never been as much into rolls.
6429580	6430380	I'm a cat, you know.
6430380	6431100	I like fish.
6431100	6433820	You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.
6434460	6436700	It's an affront to my feline nature.
6476460	6495660	Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the winter, I could die.
