0	7600	When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask
7600	9400	yourself questions.
9400	11360	Why is the world bad?
11360	13520	What did all these people die for?
13520	16680	Well, for freedom, I guess.
16680	19080	And like, American values?
19080	21280	But what are those values?
21280	24920	What kind of freedom is it that we have?
24920	29960	The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.
30080	35600	There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want, but
35600	40120	they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels anyway.
40120	41120	Ahhh.
41120	43400	Fucking neoliberalism.
47840	49800	What even goes on in these big buildings?
49800	53400	I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.
53400	56680	Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather?
56680	58680	Drinking human blood?
58680	60800	Licking whipped cream off the interns?
63640	65400	What the hell even is this country?
65400	71320	Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place, Longhorn Steakhouse,
71320	77800	Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, Petsmart, Chipotle, Fridays, Dave and Busters.
77800	80160	I guess it's not so bad.
80160	82600	As long as you kick things up a notch.
82600	90200	Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's.
90200	92640	Of course, I want the fucking lava cakes.
92640	99560	I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.
99560	107760	Oh, goddamn it, it was so good, but I ate so much, I think I'm gonna die.
107760	110560	It's a good capitalism, maybe you do.
110560	118560	A vast part of territory all across the Middle East.
118560	122640	Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot
122640	124160	of people have that feeling.
124160	127880	But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.
127880	132240	The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.
132240	136440	There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that
136440	141760	sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that
141760	145560	they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.
145560	150680	The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes
150680	154960	from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become
154960	159680	adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous
159680	164320	jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist world
164320	167320	of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.
167320	174120	I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.
174120	180120	Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic
180120	181120	homeland.
181120	184760	But till now, I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to
184760	189920	do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing
189920	194240	them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.
194240	198720	And so the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.
198720	203360	Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy
203360	204360	cocks.
204360	209000	Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid IKEA consumers, capitalism did.
209000	213800	So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and
213800	219280	unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking, goddamn,
219280	220280	reptiles.
224240	230800	Chapter 1.
230800	231800	Capitalism and Spirit.
231800	235120	Oh god, I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.
235120	239800	Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on
239800	243160	freedom is just another place to go shopping?
243160	245420	A leftist could easily have said that.
245420	249600	We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension
249600	250600	to it too.
250600	254040	Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human
254040	258280	soul under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer
258280	262560	who appropriates the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment
262560	267040	of inanimate objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of
267040	272160	lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast
272160	275160	increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.
275160	277240	No, I don't want a landline.
277240	279160	No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.
279160	284000	Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives
284000	289280	notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meeting in ancient customs,
289280	291360	racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.
291360	292920	And that shit's not really my scene.
292920	297980	I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism
297980	301800	as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.
301800	303200	And here's why.
303200	304200	Chapter 2.
304200	305200	Alienated labor.
305200	307120	Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.
307120	308960	Let's come up with something new.
308960	310040	Chapter 2.
310040	311040	Shitty jobs.
311040	313080	Why is your job so shitty?
313160	317160	Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center and
317160	320800	you spend your day dealing with whiny and titled white bitches who don't understand
320800	323120	that you're just a lackey without any actual power.
323120	326840	And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout
326840	327840	at each other.
327840	331360	You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really
331360	335120	have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are
335120	336120	a gear.
336120	341280	The CEO makes $36 million a year while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of
341320	345240	the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the
345240	348240	chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.
348240	352040	The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against
352040	355920	your fellow employees for a promotion or even to not be laid off.
355920	359800	And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another
359800	366840	shitty job as a concrete lifter or a mud mule or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook person.
366840	370560	This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your
370560	375320	shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.
375320	380560	And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate
380560	386280	in team building exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not
386280	390080	only do you have a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure
390080	391680	of openly hating your life.
391680	395560	You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining
395560	398960	the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.
398960	402760	These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.
402760	406640	If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.
406640	412040	They'll call you an independent contractor.
412040	414640	You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.
414640	419000	You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the
419000	424480	cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,
424480	425920	paid leave, or pension.
425920	429160	So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?
429160	433080	No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.
433080	434840	Chapter 3, advertising.
434840	438120	Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?
438120	441000	What if each section is named after an episode in The Odyssey?
441000	444760	If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from
444760	451280	all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,
451280	453480	and now you can't get no satisfaction.
453480	457320	Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like
457320	459080	a basic feature of the human condition.
459080	463480	But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to
463480	464480	life under capitalism.
464480	468920	I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered
468920	470840	up with advertisements forâ€¦
470840	472200	Oh.
472200	473200	So many fans.
473200	477640	Contrapoints is a tanky confirmed, a neoliberal tanky.
477640	482400	The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend
482400	485080	nearly $500 billion a year doing.
485080	489240	The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the
489240	494200	fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals
494200	497640	making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.
497640	502600	Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational, for instance,
502600	506560	randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities the product
506560	510880	promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating the product
510880	514840	with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating
514840	519560	the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,
519560	525000	gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely
525000	530040	original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.
530040	531400	Is this rational?
531400	534760	Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?
534760	535760	Of course not!
535760	539880	The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's
539880	542080	to endlessly create new needs.
542080	545720	And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a lot of stamina, which is why it's a good
545720	547720	thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.
547720	553760	Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories
553760	555960	for a sustainable blast in power.
555960	561360	With all natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria
561360	565720	and indifference to pain that I need to get it in.
565760	570640	I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammos, then I take
570640	575400	my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.
575400	578600	Vitalimax, for bottoms!
578600	582880	Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires, which they implant in your
582880	584720	brain through advertising.
584720	588920	Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective
588920	593400	of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.
593400	598000	So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human
598000	602680	happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to
602680	604200	want and then sell it to you.
604200	608000	And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially
608000	611280	egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.
611280	615520	On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,
615520	620040	spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more
620040	624080	than half a million homeless people and 13 million children who have to go to school
624080	625080	hungry.
625080	629960	And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet
629960	635000	squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes and there are apparently Americans who are
635000	638240	willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.
638240	642560	I mean, it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really
642560	646880	worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?
646880	649680	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
649680	653060	If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe.
653060	656280	But shouldn't the economy serve humanity rather than the other way around?
656280	660360	If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,
660360	665480	and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?
665480	673480	No cost to the planet, great! Save our lover, too!
673480	675440	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
675440	677560	Canto IV, message to the rich.
677920	680880	Alright, you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up!
680880	684920	I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.
684920	688440	I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little
688440	691920	significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people
691920	696480	are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.
696480	700720	And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here, recent polling data shows that a majority
700720	706320	of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.
706320	710040	This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of
710040	713920	the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.
713920	717200	What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.
717200	721720	You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this when
721720	724400	there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.
724400	726760	They will eventually try to cut your heads off.
726760	730200	And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix some
730200	733920	shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.
733920	737520	I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to
737520	742000	deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole
742000	746640	thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.
746640	750840	Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.
750840	754960	The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going, something is gonna have to change,
754960	757840	and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.
757840	759240	The choice is up to you.
764920	768920	Well, are you going to answer the phone?
769920	771920	There is no phone.
771920	774920	There is only the side of the oppressed creature.
774920	777920	The heart of a heartless world.
777920	780920	The soul of a soulless condition.
781920	783920	It's best to just try and ignore it.
786920	789920	Episode 5, Message to the Youth
789920	791920	Alright kids, so you're angry.
791920	792920	Well, good.
792920	793920	The world sucks.
793920	795920	There's a lot to be angry about.
795920	798920	What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.
798920	800920	I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.
800920	802920	So, what do we do?
803920	804920	Smash?
804920	806920	Tabby, get in here.
806920	807920	Sit down.
808920	810920	Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.
810920	812920	Harsh words have been exchanged.
812920	815920	But I need young radicals like you in my life.
815920	818920	The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.
818920	820920	So I apologize.
820920	821920	I never meant to hurt you.
821920	823920	Baby, I'm sorry.
823920	825920	I mean, look, I get it.
825920	826920	Smashing is fun.
826920	828920	But we also need to have a real plan.
828920	829920	That's all I'm saying.
829920	830920	So what's the plan?
830920	832920	Revolution.
832920	833920	Okay.
833920	834920	Yeah, revolution.
834920	835920	I mean, you're right.
835920	836920	Donald Trump is president.
836920	837920	Fuck it.
837920	838920	Revolution.
838920	840920	We've gotta get better people in office.
840920	843920	We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?
843920	845920	No, revolution.
845920	846920	Yes, I know revolution.
846920	847920	But what kind of revolution?
847920	852920	Like, project mayhem, gather your muskets ye militia men and water the tree of liberty what?
852920	854920	No, I mean direct action.
854920	856920	Okay, so like a general strike?
856920	858920	No, end capitalism.
865920	868920	Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here because I really don't.
868920	871920	But I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive
871920	873920	than just saying the word revolution.
873920	876920	Like, I'm in support of radical movements.
876920	878920	Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings.
878920	881920	I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,
881920	883920	they shift the Overton window to the left,
883920	885920	and they can have a big cultural impact.
885920	887920	But none of them so far has ended capitalism.
887920	890920	And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power.
890920	893920	And we can change the state through electoral politics.
893920	895920	So why not direct some serious energy toward that?
895920	898920	Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China,
898920	902920	but no elected politician has ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US.
902920	905920	So why do you think that will work?
905920	908920	What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,
908920	912920	finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?
912920	914920	Well, you're not entirely wrong.
914920	918920	But on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were not exactly super great.
918920	923920	And in any case, I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army
923920	926920	marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.
926920	928920	Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion
928920	931920	and getting affordable healthcare and education
931920	934920	and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?
934920	936920	What if the 2020 election is postponed?
936920	939920	Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically.
939920	942920	Why not just be honest about your political stance?
942920	945920	Are you a democratic socialist or would you actually support a revolution?
945920	949920	Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.
949920	951920	Now, for you, counterpoints.
951920	954920	I mean, you're still a heretic in an enemy of the Imperium
954920	957920	and you are a demonetto slaanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.
960920	962920	Well, what exactly are your positions?
962920	964920	Um, well...
964920	966920	Kill everyone now!
966920	968920	Condone first-degree murder!
968920	970920	Advocate cannibalism!
970920	971920	Eat shit!
971920	973920	Filth are my politics?
974920	975920	Eat reptiles?
975920	978920	Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?
978920	980920	Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring
980920	983920	and it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles.
983920	985920	But you sound like a conspiracy theorist.
985920	988920	Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?
988920	991920	Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books.
991920	993920	Have you been the same beset of Horkheimer?
993920	994920	Have you read Horkheimer?
994920	995920	Yes.
995920	996920	Have you read Kropotkin?
996920	997920	Yes.
997920	998920	Have you read Bakunin?
998920	999920	No.
999920	1003920	You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.
1003920	1005920	Have you read Plekhanov?
1005920	1006920	Have you read Goldman?
1006920	1008920	Have you read Zetkin?
1008920	1010920	Have you read Gramsci?
1010920	1011920	Have you read Grindelwald?
1011920	1013920	Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?
1013920	1015920	Have you read Sextus Arcanus?
1015920	1017920	Have you read Slutskinarevsky?
1017920	1018920	Tabby!
1018920	1020920	I have half a PhD in reading tedious Blowhards
1020920	1022920	and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.
1022920	1025920	And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish
1025920	1027920	is a prerequisite for talking to you,
1027920	1030920	then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.
1030920	1031920	I think I'm just gonna go.
1031920	1033920	This isn't really working out.
1033920	1036920	Wait, Tabby.
1036920	1039920	Before you go, let me say one more thing.
1039920	1047920	If you ever change your mind
1047920	1052920	about leaving, leaving me behind
1052920	1054920	Oh, baby, bring it to me.
1054920	1057920	Bring your sweet loving.
1057920	1060920	Bring it on on to me.
1060920	1063920	Yeah, yeah.
1063920	1068920	I know I laugh when you left
1068920	1073920	but now I only, I only hurt myself.
1073920	1076920	Oh, baby, bring it to me.
1076920	1078920	Bring your sweet love.
1078920	1081920	Bring it on on to me.
1081920	1084920	Yeah, yeah.
1084920	1089920	I'll bring you jewelry and money too
1089920	1094920	but that ain't only all I do for you.
1094920	1097920	Oh, baby, bring it to me.
1097920	1100920	Bring your sweet love.
1100920	1103920	Bring it on on to me.
1103920	1106920	Yeah, yeah.
1106920	1111920	I know I'll always be your slave
1111920	1116920	until I'm buried, buried in my grave.
1116920	1119920	Tabby, bring it to me.
1119920	1121920	Bring your sweet love.
1121920	1124920	Bring it on on to me.
1124920	1127920	Yeah, yeah.
1127920	1132920	Yeah, yeah.
1132920	1134920	Bring it on home, catgirl.
1134920	1136920	Unsubscribed.
1143920	1145920	It's fucking 2018, man.
