00:00.000 --> 00:20.460
Hello, boys!

00:20.460 --> 00:24.460
I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what

00:24.460 --> 00:25.460
that means.

00:25.460 --> 00:30.060
I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom

00:30.060 --> 00:33.900
to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.

00:33.900 --> 00:40.260
Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant

00:40.260 --> 00:45.660
paladin of the Fourth Reich, but to this priestess of Blasphemes, he'll always be the Golden

00:45.660 --> 00:46.660
One.

00:46.660 --> 00:54.620
A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.940
Oh my god, look at his butt.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.540
Oh my god.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.820
Daddy, can I have some meat?

01:03.820 --> 01:06.220
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

01:06.220 --> 01:08.220
Oh, daddy.

01:08.220 --> 01:11.700
You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.

01:11.700 --> 01:16.420
I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chased since I started my transition.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.220
So, in a sense, I'm a virgin.

01:19.220 --> 01:22.660
And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about

01:22.660 --> 01:24.660
a little thing called purity.

01:24.660 --> 01:29.020
So now that my decade of gender-dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming

01:29.020 --> 01:32.820
to a close, I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.

01:32.820 --> 01:37.460
But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water

01:37.460 --> 01:39.340
and pure absinthe.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.340
It's time.

01:40.340 --> 01:41.340
I'm ready.

01:41.340 --> 01:42.340
I'm ready.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.340
I'm ready.

01:43.340 --> 01:44.340
I'm ready.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.340
I'm ready.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.340
I'm ready.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.340
I'm ready.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.340
I'm ready.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.340
I'm ready.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.340
I'm ready.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.340
I'm ready.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.340
I'm ready.

01:52.340 --> 01:53.340
I'm ready.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.340
I'm ready.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.340
I'm ready.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.340
I'm ready.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.340
I'm ready.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.340
I'm ready.

01:58.340 --> 01:59.340
I'm ready.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.340
I'm ready.

02:00.340 --> 02:01.340
I'm ready.

02:01.340 --> 02:02.340
I'm ready.

02:02.340 --> 02:03.340
I'm ready.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.340
I'm ready.

02:04.340 --> 02:05.340
I'm ready.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.340
I'm ready.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.340
I'm ready.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.340
I'm ready.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.340
I'm ready.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.860
I'm ready.

02:12.660 --> 02:13.660
What?

02:13.660 --> 02:15.740
Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?

02:15.740 --> 02:16.740
It is, isn't it?

02:16.740 --> 02:17.740
Wellâ€¦

02:17.740 --> 02:19.260
They're shiny and I want them.

02:19.260 --> 02:21.340
It's not my fault black people have good ideas.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.760
What am I supposed to do.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.840
Not steal them?

02:26.220 --> 02:27.260
I'll pop it out.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.600
Alright thou resplendent champion of the north.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.300
Hit me with your finest wisdom.

02:31.300 --> 02:37.560
I'm going to take some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.920
There's always a nice thing to do.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.520
Well, at least we agree on something.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.080
Aha!

02:45.080 --> 02:48.800
Autogynophilic narcissist exposed.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.960
Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms

02:50.960 --> 02:52.080
like your whole thing?

02:52.080 --> 02:56.000
Misogynistic mental illness confirmed.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.400
Abigail, what is your damage?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.560
Are you okay?

02:59.560 --> 03:00.600
How's your mom doing?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.000
Is everything all right?

03:02.000 --> 03:17.720
You want to get in the tub?

03:17.720 --> 03:18.720
Yeah.

03:18.720 --> 03:24.960
So you're a lost baby girl, and you're a game sweet prince.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.320
He has an Instagram, and it is delectable.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.480
Meets back on the menu, boys.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.840
He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.800
What ho, you jaunty lads.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.160
My captain.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
My king.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
Yes!

03:39.160 --> 03:47.760
If the golden one didn't exist, I would have to invent him.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
I need him.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.600
And maybe you need me too, Lars.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.720
I'm the moon to your sun, the, uh, the broom hilda to your Siegfried.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.160
As you become more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky femme.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.640
But you know, I'm noticing that even though you're straight, you don't seem super interested

04:02.640 --> 04:05.280
in the bodies of the women in your life.

04:05.280 --> 04:10.000
And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
me.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.480
I'm not like the other girls.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.800
I've got the T's and the D's.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.920
On second thought, leave Kranz women alone.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.000
I don't want that blood on my hands.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.120
Well, this is no longer a relaxing bath.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.600
And that's why we never bathe with fascists.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.600
I blocked my T, I popped my E, let's talk about degeneracy.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.760
What are people talking about when they call something or someone degenerate?

05:02.760 --> 05:06.840
Well, let's take a look at some examples from my YouTube comments section and see if

05:06.840 --> 05:09.320
we can figure it out from context.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.840
Transgender communist degenerate.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.560
Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.880
Degen tranny, lal.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.600
Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.840
Or at least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.180
Well, what's up with that?

05:22.180 --> 05:23.500
This is degeneracy.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.520
You ought to be slung from a tree.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.880
He likes to rhyme.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.200
You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
The end.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.960
Aww, these people are trying so hard to upset me.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.800
They've only got one card in the deck though, alas.

05:37.800 --> 05:42.840
Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,

05:42.840 --> 05:47.360
like a burly Nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired

05:47.360 --> 05:48.960
with a loathing of queerness.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.080
Now it's not always just about queerness.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.640
In fact, fascists and social conservatives use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term

05:55.640 --> 06:01.360
to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists, people with disabilities, basically

06:01.360 --> 06:03.620
anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.920
But where does the word degeneracy come from?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.960
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

06:08.960 --> 06:16.920
The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix d, which means away from, and the Latin word

06:16.920 --> 06:19.320
genus, which means race or kind.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.980
So to be degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already

06:23.980 --> 06:26.800
sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.

06:26.800 --> 06:31.960
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

06:31.960 --> 06:36.520
protoevolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

06:36.520 --> 06:41.880
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,

06:41.880 --> 06:46.240
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.320
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

06:50.320 --> 06:52.040
The exact same dingbats, yes.

06:52.040 --> 06:57.160
And one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artur de Gabenau, one of the intellectual

06:57.160 --> 06:58.960
grandfathers of Nazism.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.360
Gabenau wrote a book called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed

07:03.360 --> 07:07.720
the idea of the Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos,

07:07.720 --> 07:11.440
and gave the word degenerate its modern fashy definition.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.440
M'lord?

07:13.240 --> 07:18.680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

07:18.680 --> 07:24.880
intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,

07:24.880 --> 07:30.200
continual adulterations have gradually affected the quality of the blood.

07:30.200 --> 07:36.400
In fact, the man of a decadent time, the degenerate man, a properly so-called, is a different

07:36.400 --> 07:41.120
being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages.

07:41.120 --> 07:46.000
I think I am right in concluding that the human race, in all its branches, has a secret

07:46.000 --> 07:49.360
repulsion from the crossing of blood.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.720
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

07:55.720 --> 07:58.360
closely related to degeneracy.

07:58.360 --> 08:03.200
Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies a fall from a previous

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
date of grace.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.560
By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence were everywhere in the European cultural

08:08.560 --> 08:09.560
imagination.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.520
During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning

08:13.520 --> 08:18.320
Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
means free thought.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.520
That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.040
Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,

08:32.040 --> 08:35.240
accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.760
And around the same time, a bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word

08:38.760 --> 08:41.400
decadence as the title of their movement.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.920
Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence, it was 4chan writ large.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.520
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then?

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
Not at all.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.680
The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive goes

08:55.680 --> 09:00.160
back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

09:00.160 --> 09:03.480
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline.

09:03.480 --> 09:08.120
And one of the hypotheses was that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence

09:08.120 --> 09:12.160
left the Romans vulnerable to butch visigoths and vandals.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.600
Is there any truth to that?

09:13.600 --> 09:17.520
No, it's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives.

09:17.520 --> 09:23.160
The decadent emperors Nero, Caligula, and Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.440
The empire didn't collapse until the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least

09:26.440 --> 09:30.040
two hundred years between the decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was

09:30.040 --> 09:31.040
thoroughly Christian.

09:31.040 --> 09:36.080
And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.040
Well, hail Caligula.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.380
But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient civilizations collapsing

09:42.380 --> 09:43.880
because of the queers.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.800
Here's feminist Camille Paglia on how the transgenders destroy civilizations.

09:48.800 --> 09:56.960
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
to unravel.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
Hang on a second, I'm gonna need to shift up a gear for this.

10:02.200 --> 10:08.200
Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.200
You can see it happening.

10:09.200 --> 10:17.200
All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome, nude young men

10:17.200 --> 10:21.760
athletes that used to be very robust in the arcade period suddenly began to seem like

10:21.760 --> 10:23.760
wet noodles toward the end.

10:23.760 --> 10:29.760
People who live in such times, they feel that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.760
And homosexuality, heterosexuality, somewhat anything goes, and so on.

10:33.760 --> 10:39.760
But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer

10:39.760 --> 10:40.760
believes in itself.

10:40.760 --> 10:49.760
And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity

10:49.760 --> 10:54.760
on the edges, whether they're the vandals or the huns, or whether they're the barbarians

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
of ISIS.

10:55.760 --> 11:00.760
You see them, you know, starting to mass on the outside of the culture.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
And that's what we have right now.

11:01.760 --> 11:07.760
There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the

11:07.760 --> 11:13.760
transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there, okay?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.760
And so, I mean, that's why I'm concerned.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.760
I feel it's ominous.

11:18.760 --> 11:27.760
I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.760
Riley J. Dennis.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.760
Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

11:38.760 --> 11:42.760
So the idea is that our infatuation with a feminine decadence means we're going to be

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
destroyed by real men.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.760
You know, like ISIS.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.760
This doesn't deserve a response.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.760
We're moving on.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.760
Where does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?

11:51.760 --> 11:52.760
Oh god.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.760
Do we really have to do this?

11:55.760 --> 11:59.760
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich...

11:59.760 --> 12:01.760
Who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.760
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.760
Dionysian in the street, in the...

12:08.760 --> 12:10.760
Shhhh.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.760
Go to sleep.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.760
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,

12:15.760 --> 12:19.760
is decadent in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,

12:19.760 --> 12:22.760
we have all these hang-ups about guilt and sin in the afterlife.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.760
And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick

12:26.760 --> 12:31.760
and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.760
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.760
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea

12:39.760 --> 12:44.760
of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.

12:44.760 --> 12:50.760
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like, fucking Christian morality, man,

12:50.760 --> 12:54.760
and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party,

12:54.760 --> 12:57.760
especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.760
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,

13:07.760 --> 13:12.760
European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.

13:12.760 --> 13:19.760
Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of national socialism.

13:19.760 --> 13:26.760
Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.

13:26.760 --> 13:33.760
Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.760
And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.

13:38.760 --> 13:43.760
So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from foppington to fascism.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.760
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.

13:45.760 --> 13:52.760
One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.760
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.760
And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

14:00.760 --> 14:09.760
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married,

14:09.760 --> 14:18.760
not having kids, having kids that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using birth control, having abortions.

14:30.760 --> 14:35.760
Cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.760
Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

14:39.760 --> 14:42.760
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

14:45.760 --> 14:52.760
There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be responsible and I hate it.

14:52.760 --> 14:58.760
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about driving, okay?

14:58.760 --> 15:01.760
Drink lots of water and pace yourself.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.760
There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

15:05.760 --> 15:13.760
Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.

15:13.760 --> 15:18.760
So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.760
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good, where were we?

15:25.760 --> 15:42.760
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms, antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

15:42.760 --> 15:58.760
Hi there, I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.

15:59.760 --> 16:16.760
What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax, and I am just going to slowly start to drip in hot candle wax.

16:17.760 --> 16:31.760
So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.760
And individual fascists differ on what those things are.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.760
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people can't raise children.

16:40.760 --> 16:50.760
Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.760
And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.

16:54.760 --> 17:00.760
So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.

17:00.760 --> 17:07.760
Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century the social conservative position is not very cool.

17:07.760 --> 17:14.760
So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
What they have a problem with essentially is queerness.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.760
Now, what is queerness?

17:19.760 --> 17:26.760
Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most generic sense queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.760
So either your gender is all fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.

17:30.760 --> 17:36.760
But unlike the words homosexual or transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion.

17:36.760 --> 17:42.760
Often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

17:42.760 --> 17:47.760
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,

17:47.760 --> 17:53.760
but only if you shut up about it conform to straight society and try to act as normal as possible.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.760
What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness because think of the children.

17:57.760 --> 18:05.760
We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters, polyamorists, sing it with me.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.760
These are my favorite degenerate things.

18:09.760 --> 18:15.760
To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.760
So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,

18:20.760 --> 18:23.760
which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.760
At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.

18:28.760 --> 18:34.760
In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.

18:34.760 --> 18:40.760
While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper from 1976

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
that claims,

18:54.760 --> 19:00.760
which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.760
Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.760
Jeez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?

19:08.760 --> 19:14.760
We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

19:14.760 --> 19:19.760
Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?

19:19.760 --> 19:46.760
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

19:46.760 --> 19:48.760
Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.

19:48.760 --> 19:53.760
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.760
And you know, that's probably for the best.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.760
Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.

19:58.760 --> 20:03.760
All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.760
My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.

20:06.760 --> 20:11.760
In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you worry about that.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
And that's the difference between me and the fascists.

20:13.760 --> 20:17.760
I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.760
And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.760
Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.760
The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.760
So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,

20:33.760 --> 20:38.760
which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy,

20:38.760 --> 20:44.760
well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs.

20:44.760 --> 20:49.760
So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.760
Go make white babies.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.760
But I really must insist, upon my right and the right of all degenerates,

20:54.760 --> 21:00.760
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.760
Rock and roll.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.760
Rock and roll.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.760
Rock on, gold dust woman.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.760
Take your silver spoon.

21:12.760 --> 21:20.760
Take your grave.

21:20.760 --> 21:24.760
I wake up in the morning.

21:24.760 --> 21:35.760
See your sunrise, love is to go down.

21:35.760 --> 21:43.760
Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.760
They cry out.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.760
Well, did she make you cry?

21:50.760 --> 21:54.760
Make you break it down and shatter your illusions of love?

21:54.760 --> 21:57.760
Well, tell me, is it over now?

21:57.760 --> 22:07.760
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.760
Rock on, ancient queen.

22:10.760 --> 22:18.760
Follow those who'd fail in your shadow.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
That was a jacket.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.760
Rulers make bad lovers.

22:24.760 --> 22:30.760
You better put your king in dumb mouth for sale.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.760
One more time.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.760
Oh, did she make you cry?

22:35.760 --> 22:39.760
Make you break down and shatter your illusions of love?

22:39.760 --> 22:42.760
Well, tell me, is it over now?

22:42.760 --> 22:54.760
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.760
Rock and roll.
