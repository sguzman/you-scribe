00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.960
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.240
We have to dial in.

00:27.240 --> 00:33.760
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

00:33.760 --> 00:41.240
This was the day that Fire Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

00:41.240 --> 00:45.080
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.160
There was a lot of hype.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.600
Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.200
There was a promo video full of supermodels.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.720
Tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.000
One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,

01:00.000 --> 01:06.200
and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

01:06.200 --> 01:12.200
So, when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure, turned

01:12.200 --> 01:17.400
out to be two slices of pallet American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

01:17.400 --> 01:21.280
that can only be described as muddy third world shanty town.

01:21.280 --> 01:27.440
I mean, if you weren't on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.560
Just learned about Fire Festival, AKA Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and

01:32.560 --> 01:33.720
rich white kids.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.520
Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.

01:36.520 --> 01:41.120
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fire Festival.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.560
Instagram, entitled rich kids.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.600
Meet Lord of the Flies.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.680
Let them eat salad.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.000
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.040
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those

01:57.040 --> 01:59.320
sandwiches were garbage.

02:02.320 --> 02:08.200
Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.800
Imagine looking like this.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
Imagine being perfect.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.040
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.560
Why are you doing this to women?

02:15.560 --> 02:20.920
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila, your skin is so perfect,

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
ooh woo.

02:21.920 --> 02:28.320
And Jamila replied, my skin is currently clear because a, privileged people have more access

02:28.320 --> 02:33.960
to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
with less privilege.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.680
I also get to sleep more because of this.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.000
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
easily.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.520
I believe that trans rights are human rights.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.680
See, I exfiliate twice a week.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Oh boy.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.600
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, barge.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.040
I'll protect you, queen.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.080
Could she be any more annoying?

02:56.080 --> 02:58.920
Someone wondered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.480
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

03:07.480 --> 03:12.000
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.800
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

03:18.800 --> 03:24.640
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of this sting out of inequality,

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
does it?

03:25.640 --> 03:30.400
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

03:30.400 --> 03:35.520
your privilege, a suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart since the rich

03:35.520 --> 03:41.240
and famous now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
to the rabble.

03:42.240 --> 03:46.200
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
it.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.240
I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
Take me mother.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

03:57.960 --> 03:59.800
of the coronavirus pandemic.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.240
40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.360
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

04:07.360 --> 04:10.280
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

04:10.280 --> 04:15.200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

04:15.200 --> 04:19.760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

04:19.760 --> 04:22.200
normal for just a brief moment in time.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.820
I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now.

04:26.820 --> 04:31.920
So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.600
Hashtag this is 40, attack me bitch.

04:35.600 --> 04:40.920
But like Jameela, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver and once

04:40.920 --> 04:43.480
again, it has not gone well.

04:43.480 --> 04:49.120
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us

04:49.120 --> 04:50.120
eat cake.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.160
Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being

04:55.160 --> 04:58.700
evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?

04:58.700 --> 05:04.400
Your tweet made 10 times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
gross.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.160
Happy birthday, mmm.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.800
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfucking.

05:11.800 --> 05:16.760
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

05:16.760 --> 05:18.360
was not that she had the party.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.640
I mean, wouldn't she escape to a private island if you got that milk money?

05:22.640 --> 05:29.000
The problem was more that she tweeted about it and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.680
a little bit yikesy.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.680
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

05:35.680 --> 05:37.360
This isn't a good look.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.840
We say bad optics.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
Not relatable.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.480
Relatable.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.120
Relatability is not a moral category.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.480
This is public relations.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
It's not ethics.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.560
And it definitely isn't socialism.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.520
Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.160
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.400
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.640
This should have stayed in the drafts.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.160
Hashtag tone deaf.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.480
Isn't the issue that when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.240
We didn't get to have birthday parties.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.960
Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.

06:15.960 --> 06:22.920
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.

06:22.920 --> 06:27.000
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

06:27.480 --> 06:33.840
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

06:33.840 --> 06:41.920
music festivals or Kim K's birthday party or Jamila Jamil's privileged pores, no one

06:41.920 --> 06:44.520
ever uses the word envy.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.400
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

06:49.400 --> 06:50.880
own psychology.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.840
So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
What is it?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.240
Where does it come from?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.960
And seriously, what is Jamila Jamil's skincare routine?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.440
Drop it in the comments, bestie.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.600
Okay, so what is envy?

07:03.600 --> 07:08.840
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.200
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

07:15.200 --> 07:18.120
what we want but cannot get.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.160
It's not simply wanting what another person has.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.080
That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.320
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

07:29.320 --> 07:32.040
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.080
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.440
It's emulation or admiration.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.720
At worst it's what the Bible calls coveting.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.720
It covets.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.120
Envy is something darker.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.800
It's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what they have.

07:48.800 --> 07:54.200
You might even hate the person you envy and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated

07:54.200 --> 07:59.640
and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.480
Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John

08:04.480 --> 08:05.480
Milton.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.160
It's going to be 90 minutes of milf jokes, kids, so strap in.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.040
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

08:12.040 --> 08:18.120
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

08:18.120 --> 08:22.560
celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

08:22.560 --> 08:27.760
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is, beautiful,

08:27.760 --> 08:29.880
wealthy, masculine men.

08:29.880 --> 08:36.000
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

08:36.000 --> 08:41.800
want to date chads or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.200
Gaskeep gate boss girl light.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.800
So if you're incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's

08:49.800 --> 08:53.600
emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.720
Or, and this is the more popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing

08:58.720 --> 09:03.440
that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever

09:03.440 --> 09:08.160
want you, and therefore happiness isn't possible, you may as well lie down and rot.

09:08.160 --> 09:14.320
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia

09:14.320 --> 09:19.280
timeline dedicated to tracking them, and the essential motivation for this violence

09:19.280 --> 09:20.920
is envy.

09:20.920 --> 09:27.600
The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.520
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I

09:32.520 --> 09:34.960
want, then no one can.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
In the words of a murderer,

09:36.960 --> 09:42.920
The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.440
But most incels aren't murderers.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.000
Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.040
The philosopher Max Schaller called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

09:54.040 --> 09:59.120
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.040
Because the other sins are fun, right?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
Greed, gluttony, lust?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.480
That's what I call a good time.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.280
But envy is misery.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.080
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

10:11.080 --> 10:16.320
Air Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives

10:16.320 --> 10:20.480
would be like without rich parents, yes.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.760
Rich refugee crisis.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.880
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
Look around you.

10:26.880 --> 10:31.160
We've got the guillotine memes, we've got edgy teens tweeting Eat the Rich.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.000
And none of this is new.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.880
The slogan Eat the Rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

10:37.880 --> 10:44.680
Jean-Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said, when the people have no more to eat, they

10:44.680 --> 10:47.080
will eat the rich.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
And fair enough.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.080
It's a good source of protein.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.520
But take it from me, kids.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.680
Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.320
It's hard to do just once.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.760
You develop a taste for it.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.720
It's like they say at NA meetings.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.080
Once you've wore, you just want more.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.920
Also, who counts as the rich?

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
Am I the rich?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.440
I certainly hope so.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.160
Because I want you to eat.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
Stop it.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.360
See, this is why I quit academia.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.360
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.480
And I don't want to behave myself.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
I want to be bad.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.960
Do you want to be bad with me?

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
Let's be bad.

11:35.440 --> 11:50.560
So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality, and that societies

11:50.560 --> 11:53.080
that have more inequality have more envy.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.080
I used to assume that too.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.440
But the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not be true.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.360
Envy is a basic part of human nature.

12:00.360 --> 12:05.960
It exists in all societies and all economic systems, and it begins anytime two or more

12:05.960 --> 12:08.400
people start comparing themselves.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.240
Part two, the desire for mommy's milk.

12:13.240 --> 12:19.200
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, daddy, the first stage of human development

12:19.200 --> 12:24.940
is the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course

12:24.940 --> 12:26.840
provided by mommy milkies.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.480
Am I doing too much?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.160
I'll turn it down just a little bit.

12:30.200 --> 12:35.360
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true, he was a bit

12:35.360 --> 12:40.280
of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas, like penis envy.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.200
Maybe there's transgender men who experienced that, but I don't think it's a basic

12:44.200 --> 12:46.240
fact of the female condition.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.440
As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

12:49.440 --> 12:50.440
Because I take that personally.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.200
I'm giving it a very serious consideration, doctor.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.880
But I feel like even when Freud is wrong, he's often at least onto something.

12:57.880 --> 13:03.360
Like with the Oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
That would be weird.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.960
It's more that you desire an archetype.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.920
Mother, right?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.920
Mommy.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.920
You guys got it.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.320
They're the ones who got me started on this milf shit.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.280
I'm a reverse Socrates, I've been corrupted by the young.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.560
My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.

13:20.560 --> 13:25.760
So Freud says that in the first two years of life, libido is primarily focused on mommy's

13:25.760 --> 13:26.760
milk.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.320
It's also in this stage that envy first emerges.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.360
So I was the oldest child in my family and I was less than two years old when my brother

13:34.360 --> 13:35.360
was born.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.280
So I don't remember this because I was one year old, but my family tells me that when

13:39.280 --> 13:42.880
my brother was born, I was just insanely jealous.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.920
Oh, and I guess now's a good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.

13:47.920 --> 13:53.640
Scholars agree that there is a difference and usually they describe the difference in

13:53.640 --> 13:54.920
one of two ways.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.840
The first is that jealousy is defensive.

13:57.840 --> 14:03.320
It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours, whereas envy is offensive.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.680
It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

14:06.680 --> 14:11.520
And the second difference is that envy is between two people, the envier and the envied,

14:11.520 --> 14:15.480
whereas jealousy typically involves three people as in romantic jealousy, where you

14:15.480 --> 14:19.080
have the subject, the romantic object, and then the rival.

14:19.080 --> 14:23.320
And the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship

14:23.320 --> 14:28.240
with the romantic object, and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry, just substituting

14:28.240 --> 14:30.400
the romantic object for mommy.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.760
Of course, in ordinary English, people are always going to say jealousy when they really

14:33.760 --> 14:37.960
mean envy, probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.560
And I think it's pointless to try to fight that.

14:40.560 --> 14:45.040
Like I wouldn't go around correcting people, but just keep in mind that there is a difference.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.320
So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?

14:48.800 --> 14:53.200
Well, I think it's both, because initially you're defensive of your privileged only

14:53.200 --> 14:55.440
child relationship with your parents.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.080
But a new baby often gets more attention, at least in your paranoid toddler brain,

15:00.080 --> 15:02.520
and you might be envious of that.

15:02.520 --> 15:07.160
In a romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival if she has qualities that you wish

15:07.160 --> 15:08.160
you had.

15:08.160 --> 15:13.160
You know, young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might

15:13.160 --> 15:15.320
be getting preferential treatment.

15:15.320 --> 15:24.080
One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is, it's not FAIR, it's not FAIR, tell me

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
about it, Pampino.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.840
And I've got bad news, life is not getting any more fair than this.

15:29.840 --> 15:35.880
According to the Bible, one of the first events in human history is the story of Caein, Iabel,

15:35.880 --> 15:36.880
Luso Sermanos.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.000
I don't know why I said it in Spanish.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.760
I guess I just thought it would sound cool.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
Was I wrong?

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
Caein.

15:43.760 --> 15:48.840
It sounds so much better than Caein, Caein and Abel, Caein and Abel.

15:48.840 --> 15:55.520
God tells Caein and Abel each to make a sacrifice, and then God prefers Abel's, you know, because

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
God loves meat.

15:56.520 --> 16:02.920
Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel, in spite towards God the Father, Caein kills

16:02.920 --> 16:04.360
his younger brother.

16:04.360 --> 16:09.960
In my earliest memories of my brother, I already loved him, and I don't remember the envy,

16:09.960 --> 16:12.560
so I guess I wasn't a Caein.

16:12.560 --> 16:17.440
So I must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder.

16:17.440 --> 16:23.920
Freud says that the older siblings' envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence.

16:23.920 --> 16:28.560
Because at first, you selfishly want to be the special, most loved child.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.040
But you see that your parents love your sibling just as much as you, and you're powerless

16:33.040 --> 16:34.480
to do anything about it.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.720
So your ambition to superiority fails.

16:37.720 --> 16:42.680
And so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as your

16:42.680 --> 16:43.680
envy.

16:43.680 --> 16:49.280
And the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct, solidarity, this

16:49.280 --> 16:53.360
feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.480
And as you get older, the herd instinct evolves into feelings about justice, duty, community,

16:59.480 --> 17:00.480
and equality.

17:00.480 --> 17:05.880
But Freud thought these feelings retain a vestige of repressed envy.

17:05.880 --> 17:12.480
If I can't be the favorite, if I can't have special privileges, then no one can.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.280
And from these observations, Freud made the generalization.

17:16.280 --> 17:23.760
Social justice means that we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do

17:23.760 --> 17:25.240
without them as well.

17:25.240 --> 17:31.480
Okay, so we don't want other people to have anything we can't have, so we enviously insist

17:31.480 --> 17:36.120
on equality as a defense against the greater prosperity of others.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.000
Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.560
Like I think Freud is definitely onto something here, but don't some of our community feelings

17:43.560 --> 17:49.520
also come from a place of genuine care for other people?

17:49.520 --> 17:56.080
I cared for someone once, brosled.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.080
Well we'll come back to that later.

17:58.080 --> 18:03.920
Let's put a pin in me for now, a pin in it for now, and Freud, I mean.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.920
Let's put a pin in Freud.

18:06.920 --> 18:14.120
In a 1966 book titled Envy, A Theory of Social Behavior, the sociologist Helmut Schuch argued

18:14.120 --> 18:18.040
that rather than being, that is a very German name, Helmut Schuch, he's putting me in a

18:18.040 --> 18:23.280
German mood, sweetie, Hallo Meine Lieben, Heute Gipps ein Neues Video.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.720
I just get worse at German every year.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.160
Schuch argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality, Envy

18:30.160 --> 18:35.680
is a universal across all human societies, including very egalitarian ones.

18:35.680 --> 18:40.280
For example, in tribal and village cultures around the world, there's often a concept

18:40.280 --> 18:46.320
of black magic or witchcraft, which are thought to be used by Envy as people to bewitch the

18:46.320 --> 18:47.320
ones they envy.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.400
You're probably familiar with the concept of the evil eye, which originates in ancient

18:51.400 --> 18:54.080
Greece or maybe even earlier than that.

18:54.080 --> 18:59.640
Researchers all over the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse, cast by the

18:59.640 --> 19:02.080
malignant gaze of an envious person.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.680
Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious, but I actually think the concept of the evil

19:06.680 --> 19:12.160
eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy, and of the social danger that it

19:12.160 --> 19:13.160
poses.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.320
You've probably seen these amulets around, there's an emoji for them now, which are

19:17.320 --> 19:19.440
supposed to protect against the evil eye.

19:19.800 --> 19:24.600
It's called a nazar, which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance, similar

19:24.600 --> 19:28.880
to the origin of the English word envy, which is the Latin invidia, which just means to

19:28.880 --> 19:29.880
look at.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.600
So there's an agreement across cultures that envy is related to sight, the malevolent

19:34.600 --> 19:40.520
gaze, the evil eye, and these amulets show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied

19:40.520 --> 19:42.280
and want to protect themselves.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.640
I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel with an episode on the evil eye, and the host

19:46.640 --> 19:53.720
explains that for Muslims, it's customary to say, or God has willed it when admiring

19:53.720 --> 19:57.400
a person or object, you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.400
I love that.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.440
It's like no envy, like no homo, but no envy, masha la.

20:02.440 --> 20:07.000
The top comment on that video says, you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
monster?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.120
Well, don't tell others about your ideas, goals, or wishes.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.680
Don't be flaunting your accomplishments on social media or posting pictures of your

20:15.680 --> 20:17.200
children.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.800
That's how you avoid being jinxed.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.560
See, this is where Kim Kardashian went wrong with her birthday post.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.120
Clearly, no one in the Kardashian Cinematic Universe has ever heard of the evil eye.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.120
Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.240
Why haven't they heard of the evi- oh, okay, nevermind.

20:33.240 --> 20:38.080
Every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.760
This is a particularly American thing.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.960
Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.

20:44.960 --> 20:50.280
Like there's advertisements here that literally promise, if you buy this exclusive luxury

20:50.280 --> 20:53.600
vibrator, you'll be the envy of all your friends.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.720
As if it's a good thing to be envied.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.360
Oh, but it is not.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.960
If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?

20:59.960 --> 21:04.040
They seethe over your successes and celebrate your misfortunes.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.720
Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.600
So why would anyone want to be envied?

21:09.600 --> 21:11.560
Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.

21:11.560 --> 21:16.400
On the one hand, we need to be loved, but then there's this other drive in us, this

21:16.400 --> 21:23.120
like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches, which is kind of in conflict with

21:23.120 --> 21:24.560
our need to be loved.

21:24.560 --> 21:30.400
In a past Gilded Age, there were stories like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard which warned

21:30.400 --> 21:35.400
what a sad and lonely thing success can become.

21:35.400 --> 21:41.160
In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostrachismos, which is the

21:41.160 --> 21:44.360
origin of the English word ostracism.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.480
Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble and each person would write

21:48.480 --> 21:54.140
the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

21:54.140 --> 21:58.740
And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for 10 years.

21:58.740 --> 22:00.240
No questions asked.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.520
I love the ancient world.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.640
Things were so direct.

22:04.640 --> 22:09.820
Now this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant or

22:09.820 --> 22:11.240
just annoying.

22:11.240 --> 22:15.120
According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, and one anecdote about

22:15.120 --> 22:21.920
Aristides known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen

22:21.920 --> 22:26.920
not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.

22:26.920 --> 22:31.080
When Aristides asked why, the man replied, it was because he was sick of hearing him

22:31.080 --> 22:34.120
being called the Just.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.120
It's good!

22:35.120 --> 22:36.120
It's so good!

22:36.120 --> 22:39.160
See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.960
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

22:41.960 --> 22:47.200
People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a

22:47.200 --> 22:52.200
massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.440
According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

22:56.440 --> 23:01.080
This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome because the tallest poppies in the garden will

23:01.080 --> 23:02.080
be cut.

23:02.080 --> 23:07.760
Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

23:07.760 --> 23:12.800
In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position

23:12.800 --> 23:16.880
by purchasing several smaller fields, rather than one larger piece of land.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.380
For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.

23:19.380 --> 23:23.960
He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.

23:23.960 --> 23:28.240
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously

23:28.240 --> 23:33.080
wealthy families who move to the city and they dress like gutter punks, like they're

23:33.080 --> 23:35.160
trying to pass as poor.

23:35.160 --> 23:40.880
But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy in the way many other cultures

23:40.880 --> 23:43.000
do, and I don't think that's an accident.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.320
We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to

23:47.320 --> 23:50.840
our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

23:50.840 --> 23:54.780
But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely

23:54.780 --> 23:59.900
still there, only repressed, confined to the realm of dreams and art.

24:03.100 --> 24:08.480
In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting

24:08.480 --> 24:13.880
the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear

24:13.880 --> 24:14.880
of envy.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.180
Black magic, Black Swan.

24:17.180 --> 24:22.380
At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.

24:22.380 --> 24:27.340
By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead

24:27.340 --> 24:29.340
ballerina she's replaced.

24:29.340 --> 24:30.940
Did you suck his c**t?

24:30.940 --> 24:34.180
Not all of us have to.

24:34.180 --> 24:39.380
I love Winona Ryder so much, I love Natalie Portman so much, I love Mila Kunis so much,

24:39.380 --> 24:40.380
I just like women.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.220
Where's my shock wand?

24:42.220 --> 24:43.220
Stop it.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.220
Stop stanning.

24:44.220 --> 24:50.100
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia as Nina begins hallucinating Black Swan doppelgangers

24:50.100 --> 24:55.100
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.100
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.580
They'll getcha.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.500
Did you have some sort of leslie wet dream about me?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
Stop.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.940
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the

25:06.940 --> 25:13.500
disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism

25:13.500 --> 25:16.100
and also of dancing the Black Swan.

25:16.100 --> 25:21.140
So she imagines that part of herself is an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

25:21.140 --> 25:24.860
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

25:24.860 --> 25:29.980
There's her dominant white swan impulse, which we could call the squidward personality.

25:29.980 --> 25:35.220
Perfectionistic and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.

25:35.220 --> 25:40.460
And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse, which we could call the Spongebob

25:40.460 --> 25:41.460
personality.

25:41.460 --> 25:45.140
Intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.

25:45.140 --> 25:51.260
In Spongebob Squarepants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming

25:51.260 --> 25:52.740
from failed ambition.

25:52.740 --> 25:56.860
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

25:56.860 --> 26:01.620
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of

26:01.620 --> 26:06.260
his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.900
Spongebob is Squidward's social equal.

26:07.900 --> 26:12.220
They're literally neighbors, and they both work the same fast food service job for the

26:12.220 --> 26:14.540
same exploitative capitalist.

26:14.540 --> 26:20.140
But Spongebob is a Mozardian intuitive genius who's able to transform the most mundane

26:20.140 --> 26:26.060
activities, blowing bubbles, flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

26:26.060 --> 26:31.900
Squidward intensely envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't

26:31.900 --> 26:34.460
admit that envy to himself.

26:34.460 --> 26:40.180
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for

26:40.180 --> 26:42.620
Spongebob's childish behavior.

26:42.620 --> 26:47.180
What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.

26:47.180 --> 26:55.740
Though deep down, Squidward really wants what Spongebob has, which we see when he can't

26:55.740 --> 26:59.700
help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away all of his possessions for

26:59.700 --> 27:03.900
the chewing gum wrapper that in Spongebob's hands was a source of infinite entertainment.

27:03.900 --> 27:09.340
A lot of people my age who watched Spongebob as a kid rewatch it now and are horrified

27:09.340 --> 27:12.100
to discover that they identify with Squidward.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.620
Whereas as children, they identify with Spongebob.

27:14.620 --> 27:22.140
Well, you either die a Spongebob or you live long enough to see yourself become the Squidward.

27:22.140 --> 27:26.780
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing

27:26.780 --> 27:30.340
drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.

27:30.340 --> 27:35.780
I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

27:35.780 --> 27:36.780
Squidwardian?

27:36.780 --> 27:37.780
Are we saying that word?

27:37.780 --> 27:40.220
Are we really saying that word out loud?

27:40.220 --> 27:41.980
To an audience of millions?

27:41.980 --> 27:42.980
Okay.

27:42.980 --> 27:48.860
It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.900
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.660
You gotta watch out for that one, kids.

27:53.660 --> 27:57.660
If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose

27:57.660 --> 28:01.380
a requiem math for your own father, just say no.

28:01.380 --> 28:07.020
So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants, we have a diligent those stuffy wannabe envying the

28:07.020 --> 28:09.980
effortless playfulness of the spontaneous genius.

28:09.980 --> 28:27.700
So Squidward's envy of Spongebob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

28:27.700 --> 28:32.300
Look, if we were to view Spongebob Squarepants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche

28:32.300 --> 28:36.420
– stay with me, ladies, I have an angle here – we could say that Squidward represents

28:36.420 --> 28:41.620
what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse, while Spongebob represents the Dionysian.

28:41.620 --> 28:46.700
Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

28:46.700 --> 28:50.700
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,

28:50.700 --> 28:57.100
order, logic, morality, and the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward

28:57.100 --> 29:01.260
intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.

29:01.300 --> 29:08.060
Both Spongebob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict, with the Apollonian envying

29:08.060 --> 29:09.060
the Dionysian.

29:09.060 --> 29:14.380
Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created, because Nietzsche's

29:14.380 --> 29:17.700
whole point is that you need a balance of the two drives.

29:17.700 --> 29:23.220
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like Spongebob, because creating good

29:23.220 --> 29:26.980
art requires at least some level of discipline and ordering.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.420
See, it is all in the technique.

29:29.420 --> 29:32.060
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.300
Get off the stage!

29:33.300 --> 29:37.060
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

29:37.060 --> 29:42.420
In order to give the perfect performance, Nina has to unify her fragmented personality

29:42.420 --> 29:47.980
and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry between her two artistic impulses.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.220
And it's perfect.

29:55.660 --> 30:01.980
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers, can you guess it?

30:01.980 --> 30:08.180
Is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us, which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and

30:08.180 --> 30:11.100
fear of the American middle class.

30:11.100 --> 30:16.900
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house and a boat, along

30:16.900 --> 30:22.700
with the Tylers, a slightly better off-white family, whom the Wilsons envy.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.300
You saw their new car, right?

30:24.300 --> 30:28.180
You had to do it, you just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.

30:28.180 --> 30:33.500
One night the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

30:33.500 --> 30:38.980
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak, explains that her family is metaphysically

30:38.980 --> 30:44.900
tethered to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions of their lives and a liminal

30:44.900 --> 30:46.380
backroom's underworld.

30:46.380 --> 30:50.900
Super fucking liminal, I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting, not again.

30:50.900 --> 30:56.220
Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.980
The two were connected, tethered together.

30:59.980 --> 31:07.260
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty, but when the shadow was hungry,

31:07.260 --> 31:11.500
she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

31:11.500 --> 31:15.580
You later find out that all over the U.S., oh, U.S. spells us.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.940
Hey, that's the title of the movie.

31:17.940 --> 31:18.940
Ohhhhh.

31:18.940 --> 31:24.900
The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers and to link arms across the

31:24.900 --> 31:30.740
country in a dark parody of the real world 1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across

31:30.740 --> 31:31.740
America.

31:31.740 --> 31:37.940
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege and

31:37.940 --> 31:38.940
fear of envy.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.700
It's not a movie about the working class.

31:41.700 --> 31:45.300
If it was a movie about the working class, then the working class would be able to speak

31:45.300 --> 31:51.420
human languages and would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds and stagger around

31:51.420 --> 31:52.700
like zombies.

31:52.700 --> 31:58.220
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.

31:58.220 --> 32:04.100
Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

32:04.100 --> 32:12.580
The fear of the envious poor, of revolution, of slave revolt, but us diverges from other

32:12.580 --> 32:18.780
home invasion movies by not just being fearful about the underclass, but also guilty.

32:18.780 --> 32:24.940
The idea of the tethered underclass represents life as a zero-sum game where every moment

32:24.940 --> 32:29.540
of your happiness is bought with someone else's suffering.

32:29.540 --> 32:36.420
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy, an internalization of the black magic logic of people who blame

32:36.420 --> 32:39.740
their own misfortunes on the people they envy.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.900
As Schuch puts it,

32:40.900 --> 32:44.900
My neighbor's harvest can only have turned out better than mine because he has somehow

32:44.900 --> 32:48.060
succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.

32:48.060 --> 32:53.660
So the fear of envy and the guilt of success are repressed in American culture, but they

32:53.660 --> 32:55.860
still find expression in movies.

32:55.860 --> 32:59.740
Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.

32:59.740 --> 33:04.260
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol, a story about the guilt of the rich if ever

33:04.260 --> 33:05.260
there was one.

33:05.260 --> 33:09.740
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts who show him how wretched and sad the lives of

33:09.740 --> 33:15.140
his employees are, and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone, and his funeral is

33:15.140 --> 33:19.460
only attended by businessmen on the condition that lunch is provided.

33:19.460 --> 33:23.100
Dickens was truly the master of scaring the rich straight.

33:23.100 --> 33:29.740
So maybe fear of envy can serve a softly regulatory function by motivating charity and generosity

33:29.740 --> 33:30.940
in the rich.

33:30.940 --> 33:35.500
But in general, I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.

33:35.500 --> 33:42.220
Because remember, the basic logic of envy is, if I can't have it, then no one can.

33:42.220 --> 33:46.460
Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.

33:46.460 --> 33:51.700
It's taking privileges away, not for the material benefit of the underprivileged, but

33:51.700 --> 33:56.180
merely for the psychological satisfaction of the envious person.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.980
And that's even worse when you consider that envy is subjective.

33:59.980 --> 34:03.940
It doesn't necessarily target objective power and privilege.

34:03.940 --> 34:09.020
So envy and politics is not by any means relegated to the left.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.180
Conservative politics is rimming with envy.

34:11.180 --> 34:15.900
Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt, you often hear people say, I had

34:15.900 --> 34:19.300
to pay my student loans, so they should too.

34:19.300 --> 34:22.140
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

34:22.140 --> 34:27.420
The logic here is, since I didn't get my student debt forgiven, no one should.

34:27.420 --> 34:33.660
It's intergenerational envy, which is a pretty common thing, usually older generations envying

34:33.660 --> 34:34.660
the young.

34:34.660 --> 34:36.660
Kids these days have it so easy.

34:36.660 --> 34:42.780
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast and sent text messages on the Pony Express.

34:42.780 --> 34:47.580
The feeling is basically, it's not fear that kids these days don't have to suffer

34:47.580 --> 34:49.260
like I suffered.

34:49.260 --> 34:55.180
Or think about the concept of a welfare queen, which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

34:55.180 --> 35:01.580
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration, it's all this envious suspicion about illegal

35:01.580 --> 35:06.340
immigrants sneaking in and getting government handouts without having to pay taxes.

35:06.340 --> 35:10.620
I had to work hard for my money, so why should these people get a free ride?

35:10.620 --> 35:15.860
Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant is actually like, except in the imagination

35:15.860 --> 35:17.740
of people who envy them.

35:17.740 --> 35:23.740
Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people, so it's especially sharp when it targets

35:23.740 --> 35:27.860
people who are supposed to be beneath you.

35:27.860 --> 35:33.220
The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin made what I think is a pretty compelling argument

35:33.220 --> 35:38.500
that both antisemitism and misogyny are partly rooted in envy.

35:38.500 --> 35:44.020
She quotes a bigoted argument made by the wife-killing protagonist of Tolstoy's story

35:44.020 --> 35:50.300
the Kreutzer sonata, who resents that women and Jews find a kind of paradoxical power

35:50.300 --> 35:51.860
in their own oppression.

35:51.860 --> 35:56.540
Just like the Jews, as they pay us back for their oppression by financial domination,

35:56.540 --> 35:57.540
so it is with women.

35:57.540 --> 36:00.140
Ah, you want us to be traders only?

36:00.140 --> 36:01.140
Alright.

36:01.140 --> 36:03.780
As traders we will dominate you, say the Jews.

36:03.780 --> 36:06.620
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

36:06.620 --> 36:07.620
Alright.

36:07.620 --> 36:10.260
As objects of sensuality we will enslave you.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.260
Dworkin explains,

36:11.260 --> 36:18.100
This dominance of men by women is experienced by the men as real, emotionally real, sexually

36:18.100 --> 36:20.380
real, psychologically real.

36:20.380 --> 36:23.900
It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.540
The woman appears to control sex.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.940
The man needs it.

36:27.940 --> 36:32.260
This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.

36:32.260 --> 36:38.220
Women control access to what men want, which gives women a kind of indirect power, thus

36:38.220 --> 36:39.300
some men envy.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.220
They envy the sexual power of women.

36:42.220 --> 36:46.820
It doesn't matter to the misogynists that, especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,

36:46.820 --> 36:50.500
women objectively have less power in society than men.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.900
He envies women because they have what he desires.

36:54.900 --> 37:02.140
Likewise it didn't matter to Weimar antisemites that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

37:02.140 --> 37:08.060
Antisemitism is often rooted in an envious obsession with the disproportionate influence

37:08.060 --> 37:10.100
and affluence of Jewish people.

37:10.100 --> 37:15.660
It is not the absolute differences between men which feed envy, but subjective perception,

37:15.660 --> 37:22.860
the optics of envy.

37:22.860 --> 37:29.980
Magic mirror on the wall, who's the cuntest of them all?

37:29.980 --> 37:38.220
Thou art cunt, my queen, but hold a lovely maid I see.

37:38.220 --> 37:41.460
Oh yes, it's me.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.460
What?

37:42.460 --> 37:48.100
In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning of this whole transition, you know, like a

37:48.100 --> 37:53.180
young little girl going through all these things, having a sleepover with the girls.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.180
What do we do on a sleepover?

37:54.180 --> 37:58.380
Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?

37:58.380 --> 38:02.820
Alas, she is more cunter than thee.

38:02.820 --> 38:10.740
My pussy-stunting on the gram has come to nothing.

38:10.740 --> 38:16.060
The classic 1937 Disney movie Snow White and the Wicked Milf is the story of a quote, vain

38:16.060 --> 38:21.540
and wicked queen who obsessively envies the beauty of her own stepdaughter.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.500
Are you sure this was for children?

38:23.500 --> 38:27.940
Every day the Milf queen asks the mirror who is the fairest one of all and the mirror responds

38:27.940 --> 38:32.460
that the queen is the fairest till one day it says the stepdaughter Snow White is the

38:32.460 --> 38:37.380
fairest, which sends the queen into an envious fury resulting in a series of bizarre murder

38:37.380 --> 38:38.380
attempts.

38:38.380 --> 38:41.660
So first of all, can we talk plot holes dang?

38:41.660 --> 38:46.940
Are we really supposed to believe that this is more beautiful than this?

38:46.940 --> 38:48.740
Uh, dang.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.940
Is the Snow White like 12 years old?

38:50.940 --> 38:51.940
What's going on, Walt?

38:51.940 --> 38:54.140
Why don't you take a seat?

38:54.140 --> 38:56.100
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.740
It's hard to tell because she's constantly surrounded by manlets.

38:58.740 --> 39:05.060
But she's just so boring and the queen is such a baddie.

39:05.060 --> 39:07.100
Step on my throat, mother.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.100
This is a horny video.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.220
Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.

39:10.220 --> 39:12.860
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

39:12.860 --> 39:17.340
So despite the injustice done to its lead Milf, Snow White does illustrate some interesting

39:17.340 --> 39:18.620
things about envy.

39:18.620 --> 39:22.820
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft as an expression of envy.

39:22.820 --> 39:27.420
We have the age difference, intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.

39:27.420 --> 39:32.220
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

39:32.220 --> 39:34.140
to rage against Gen Z.

39:34.140 --> 39:38.460
Pretty counterproductive since if you're worried about seeming old, complaining about

39:38.460 --> 39:41.620
the youths, it's probably not helping your case gorge.

39:41.620 --> 39:45.020
You might wonder if there's also jealousy involved with the evil queen.

39:45.020 --> 39:48.740
Like is she worried that the king is going to fall in love with his own daughter?

39:48.740 --> 39:50.860
Well, I don't think so.

39:50.860 --> 39:52.260
Because we never even see the king.

39:52.260 --> 39:55.420
The queen doesn't mention him, it's not about the king.

39:55.420 --> 39:57.900
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

39:57.900 --> 40:02.140
It's just one woman envying another woman over beauty for its own sake.

40:02.140 --> 40:07.260
We stan a Bechdel test passing a movie about women hating each other.

40:07.260 --> 40:11.020
Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gaskeep, light boss.

40:11.020 --> 40:15.540
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version, the queen first tries killing Snow White

40:15.540 --> 40:20.500
with beauty accessories, poisoning a comb, and lacing her to death with a corset.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.260
I wish I could die that way.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.260
Shhh.

40:23.260 --> 40:28.260
What's really striking is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.

40:28.260 --> 40:33.220
This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look, is willing to transform herself with

40:33.220 --> 40:39.220
witchcraft into an ugly old hag, just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.

40:39.220 --> 40:43.620
And the queen disguising herself as an old hag parallels Satan disguising himself as

40:43.620 --> 40:44.620
a serpent.

40:44.620 --> 40:48.820
I mean, you could actually argue that the queen is simply a persona of Satan, its paradise

40:48.820 --> 40:52.980
lost all over again, which also happens to be the title of my memoir.

40:52.980 --> 40:58.260
The queen is incredibly petty, because even according to the, again, wrong and tasteless

40:58.260 --> 41:02.460
mirror, she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.

41:02.460 --> 41:08.860
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy still be consumed by envy?

41:08.860 --> 41:12.740
Well, basically, because that's how envy works.

41:12.740 --> 41:18.580
It's petty, it's subjective, and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,

41:18.580 --> 41:21.780
or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.

41:21.780 --> 41:27.460
So you can be the second best in the world, and still be obsessively envious of the one

41:27.460 --> 41:30.300
person who may barely even be above you.

41:30.300 --> 41:34.980
In fact, there's studies showing that Olympic silver medalists are actually less satisfied

41:34.980 --> 41:39.500
with their prize than bronze medalists, probably because the bronze medalist is just happy

41:39.500 --> 41:44.980
to be on the podium at all, while the silver medalist is so close to first, they can't

41:44.980 --> 41:47.140
help but wonder what if.

41:47.140 --> 41:51.860
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth not by comparing ourselves to any absolute

41:51.860 --> 41:55.940
standard, but by comparing ourselves to each other, and we're more likely to compare

41:55.940 --> 42:00.360
ourselves to the people who are around us than we are to people who are far away.

42:00.360 --> 42:03.500
We could call this the proximity effect of envy.

42:03.500 --> 42:08.500
We're more likely to envy people who are close to us, or similar to us, especially

42:08.500 --> 42:10.260
people we're in competition with.

42:10.260 --> 42:12.660
That's why social media is such a nightmare.

42:12.660 --> 42:17.420
It's an incubator of envy, because it puts everyone next to everyone else.

42:17.420 --> 42:23.180
So we're all being compared, all in competition, and it can destroy your self-esteem, because

42:23.180 --> 42:28.660
you're comparing your actual life to these idealized images, and it also turns public

42:28.660 --> 42:34.740
figures into lightning rods for envy, because of the numeric visibility of popularity and

42:34.740 --> 42:35.740
success.

42:36.180 --> 42:41.980
It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect that envy within an oppressed class

42:41.980 --> 42:46.060
is often more venomous and obsessive than envy for the oppressor.

42:46.060 --> 42:52.340
So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan, you have women envying other women, because

42:52.340 --> 42:55.020
women are often in competition with each other.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.340
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

42:57.340 --> 43:03.500
In media, there's constant portrayals of vain and envious women, jealous bitches, fighting

43:03.500 --> 43:06.780
over men, over youth, over beauty.

43:06.780 --> 43:09.260
It's like drag queen femininity.

43:09.260 --> 43:11.180
Death becomes her femininity.

43:11.180 --> 43:14.860
En garde, bitch.

43:14.860 --> 43:21.140
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope, but how do I put this delicately?

43:21.140 --> 43:25.620
Sometimes reality is misogynistic, like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.

43:25.620 --> 43:28.500
The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.

43:28.500 --> 43:33.980
In her 1976 essay, Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood, feminist Jo Freeman wrote

43:33.980 --> 43:37.180
about her ostracism from within the women's movement.

43:37.180 --> 43:42.540
I've been watching for years with increasing dismay as the movement consciously destroys

43:42.540 --> 43:45.540
anyone within it who stands out in any way.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.860
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.340
And who do they attack?

43:50.340 --> 43:54.380
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind would seem to be the worst crime.

43:54.380 --> 43:59.500
Do anything that every other woman secretly or otherwise feels she could do just as well,

43:59.500 --> 44:00.660
and you're in for it.

44:00.660 --> 44:05.640
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist, a ruthless mercenary out to make

44:05.640 --> 44:10.220
her fame and fortune over the dead bodies of selfless sisters who have buried their

44:10.220 --> 44:16.180
abilities and sacrificed their ambitions for the greater glory of feminism.

44:16.180 --> 44:17.420
Freeman speculates.

44:17.420 --> 44:23.660
The primary reason there have been so few great women blank is not merely that greatness

44:23.660 --> 44:29.460
has been undeveloped or unrecognized, but that women exhibiting potential for achievement

44:29.460 --> 44:32.300
are punished by both women and men.

44:32.300 --> 44:37.660
The fear of success is quite rational when one knows that the consequence of achievement

44:37.660 --> 44:40.100
is hostility and not praise.

44:40.100 --> 44:43.940
So at no point in this essay does Jo Freeman use the word envy.

44:43.940 --> 44:49.620
But as usual, envy is right below the surface, causing all the trouble.

44:49.620 --> 44:55.020
So Freeman is describing how people from marginalized groups whose ambition raises

44:55.020 --> 45:01.640
them above the typical limits set by marginalization are often ostracized from their own communities.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.820
But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.100
I have an explanation.

45:06.100 --> 45:07.460
The explanation is envy.

45:07.460 --> 45:10.660
And women are more likely to envy other women.

45:10.660 --> 45:13.380
Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.

45:13.380 --> 45:15.580
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

45:15.820 --> 45:19.740
If we did this topic justice, this video would be 9 centuries long.

45:19.740 --> 45:21.020
On guard!

45:22.140 --> 45:22.940
Bitch!

45:22.940 --> 45:26.580
A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women.

45:26.580 --> 45:28.020
And there is some truth to that.

45:28.020 --> 45:33.180
There definitely was a time in my life when I used to envy cis women for being cis women.

45:33.180 --> 45:37.700
But now I kind of just don't even allow myself to have the thought, what if I were a cis

45:37.700 --> 45:38.700
woman?

45:38.700 --> 45:43.940
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible, it's unobtainable, I actually

45:43.940 --> 45:46.100
envy cis women less.

45:46.100 --> 45:51.420
So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women because of the proximity effect

45:51.420 --> 45:58.340
and because another trans woman represents an actual possibility of what I, a trans woman,

45:58.340 --> 45:59.340
could become.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.700
She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.

46:02.700 --> 46:05.380
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

46:05.380 --> 46:09.220
Am I the only one who finds it hard to watch trans creators?

46:09.220 --> 46:13.180
Before I realized I was a trans woman, I fucking loved people like ContraPoints, Nick Spears,

46:13.180 --> 46:14.500
and other trans creators.

46:14.500 --> 46:18.740
But ever since I realized I was trans, I just get this angry, resentful feeling in the pit

46:18.740 --> 46:22.180
of my stomach whenever I get recommended any of these videos.

46:22.180 --> 46:26.660
I seriously loved ContraPoints, but whenever I try to watch any of her videos, I just want

46:26.660 --> 46:27.660
to scream.

46:27.660 --> 46:30.580
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

46:30.580 --> 46:33.300
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.860
Am I just a toxic person?

46:34.860 --> 46:38.380
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.620
At least not any worse than anyone else.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.460
It's just that human nature is a toxic person.

46:43.460 --> 46:48.580
And that angry, resentful feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you want to scream

46:48.580 --> 46:53.540
and feel such a hatred has a name, and the name is Envy.

46:53.540 --> 46:57.220
I actually admire the person who wrote this post, because they're doing the best that

46:57.220 --> 47:02.900
any of us can do, really, which is noticing the feeling without endorsing the feeling.

47:02.900 --> 47:07.820
I wish that more people could feel things without rushing to a rational defense of the

47:07.820 --> 47:08.820
feeling.

47:08.820 --> 47:14.020
The rationality itself, often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.540
Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.

47:16.540 --> 47:22.420
For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual who complains that, when I transitioned,

47:22.420 --> 47:27.940
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping, but kids these days just waltz on in and walk

47:27.940 --> 47:29.220
out with hormones.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.460
It's intergenerational envy.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.460
Trans edition.

47:32.460 --> 47:36.860
It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone, like the student debt-dippy.

47:36.860 --> 47:40.020
If I can't have it, no one can.

47:40.020 --> 47:43.420
And look, I do have sympathy and admiration for older trans people.

47:43.420 --> 47:49.940
Like, being trans in 2021 is already the maximum level of adversity that I can handle.

47:49.940 --> 47:53.420
I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.

47:53.420 --> 47:57.180
However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.

47:57.180 --> 48:02.860
Envy is not sacred rage, and the malignant demands of envious people should be ignored.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.460
God, this community.

48:04.460 --> 48:10.420
The constant competition, the envy, the cringing, it makes it really hard to get along with

48:10.420 --> 48:11.420
other trans people.

48:11.420 --> 48:12.420
Oh, speaking of which.

48:12.420 --> 48:13.420
Gay tangents, everybody.

48:13.420 --> 48:14.420
Gay tangents.

48:14.420 --> 48:20.780
Envy presents kind of a unique problem to same-sex attracted people, because of the

48:20.780 --> 48:25.100
increased risk of envying the very people you're attracted to.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.100
I want to **** the ones I envy.

48:27.100 --> 48:28.100
I envy.

48:28.100 --> 48:32.180
You know, it's the classic, do I want you, or do I want to be you problem?

48:32.180 --> 48:36.980
I've heard feminine queer women say they could never date another femme, because they're

48:36.980 --> 48:39.660
worried they would just end up envying her.

48:39.660 --> 48:45.380
So dating masculine women solves that problem, because having separate roles, separate aesthetics,

48:45.380 --> 48:50.580
separate categories, helps to avert proximity envy between partners.

48:50.580 --> 48:53.620
Unfortunately, I am not that smart.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.980
Basically, I am attracted to femininity.

48:55.980 --> 49:00.580
But I also want to embody a kind of feminine archetype myself.

49:00.580 --> 49:02.740
I'm not masculine, and I don't want to be.

49:02.740 --> 49:06.180
You know, I used to think I'd only want to date another trans woman, because of the

49:06.180 --> 49:07.180
mutual understanding.

49:07.180 --> 49:11.540
But I've kind of realized that at this point, it may actually be more psychologically healthy

49:11.540 --> 49:13.620
for me to open up to dating cis women.

49:13.620 --> 49:17.060
I used to not want to do that, because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.

49:17.060 --> 49:20.660
But at this point, honestly, just be a man.

49:20.660 --> 49:21.660
Whatever.

49:21.660 --> 49:22.660
It's fine.

49:22.660 --> 49:27.220
As a drag queen once said, I'm more of a man than you'll ever be, and more of a woman

49:27.220 --> 49:28.220
than you'll ever have.

49:28.220 --> 49:29.220
Yes, glide.

49:29.860 --> 49:31.820
Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?

49:31.820 --> 49:37.420
I think at a distance, it's okay to indulge the attraction-emulation ambiguity.

49:37.420 --> 49:42.180
But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone, you have to make up your mind.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.940
That you desire this woman, and you do not want to be her.

49:45.940 --> 49:48.020
Because think about it from the other perspective.

49:48.020 --> 49:53.020
What could be less attractive than someone who literally wants to be you?

49:53.020 --> 49:56.260
Teacher, make her stop copying me.

49:56.260 --> 50:02.340
Because much as I joke every episode about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,

50:02.340 --> 50:04.020
you don't want to date that bitch.

50:04.020 --> 50:07.260
Imagine trying to date Eve from all about Eve.

50:07.260 --> 50:08.260
Pass.

50:08.260 --> 50:09.260
Hard pass.

50:09.260 --> 50:13.460
So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything, honestly, and you find yourself envying your

50:13.460 --> 50:17.700
partner, my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.420
An enviable woman wanted to be with you.

50:20.420 --> 50:24.900
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.900
I get it though.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.900
It's complicated.

50:26.900 --> 50:31.180
You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm what we truly desire, but how do you know

50:31.180 --> 50:32.900
what you truly desire?

50:32.900 --> 50:33.900
Do I want mommy?

50:33.900 --> 50:36.900
Or do I want to be the mommy?

50:36.900 --> 50:37.900
Yes.

50:37.900 --> 50:38.900
Just yes.

50:38.900 --> 50:43.740
Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

50:43.740 --> 50:45.900
The mother half took over completely.

50:46.900 --> 50:54.460
Do I look okay?

50:54.460 --> 50:56.700
Is my head on straight?

50:56.700 --> 51:01.380
So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.

51:01.380 --> 51:06.860
And people especially cannot seem to notice when they themselves are feeling envious.

51:06.860 --> 51:11.300
Like that person who puzzled over the angry, resentful feeling in the pit of their stomach

51:11.300 --> 51:13.540
without being able to name what they were feeling.

51:13.540 --> 51:17.460
There's two reasons why people are usually in denial about their own envy.

51:17.460 --> 51:20.220
One is guilt, and the other is shame.

51:20.220 --> 51:21.220
Shame?

51:21.220 --> 51:27.020
Shame, because admitting to yourself that you envy someone implies that you feel inferior

51:27.020 --> 51:28.940
to them, which is shameful.

51:28.940 --> 51:30.700
It wounds the ego.

51:30.700 --> 51:33.700
And guilt, because envy is malicious.

51:33.700 --> 51:39.180
If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable about their success and good fortune,

51:39.180 --> 51:41.940
and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.

51:41.940 --> 51:44.300
That's cruel and antisocial.

51:44.300 --> 51:48.900
It goes against most ideas of morality, and it's a thought that's usually not socially

51:48.900 --> 51:50.740
acceptable to admit.

51:50.740 --> 51:57.420
So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable, and we deal with that by suppressing

51:57.420 --> 51:58.980
it from our awareness.

51:58.980 --> 52:04.100
But it is still there, and in order to maintain the denial, we have to convince ourselves

52:04.100 --> 52:09.940
that this angry, resentful feeling in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.

52:09.940 --> 52:15.580
Think about how in SpongeBob, Squidward shows contempt for SpongeBob's childishness, for

52:15.580 --> 52:22.500
blowing bubbles, for having fun at work, when in fact, Squidward envies SpongeBob's uninhibited

52:22.500 --> 52:24.180
joy and intuitive creativity.

52:24.180 --> 52:29.580
But he can't allow himself to have the thought that he envies SpongeBob, because that would

52:29.580 --> 52:36.260
mean recognizing the intolerably shameful truth that he feels inferior to SpongeBob.

52:36.260 --> 52:42.100
So what he does instead is convince himself that what he really is, is a refined, sophisticated,

52:42.100 --> 52:49.940
scoffing at this childish fool.

52:49.940 --> 52:54.100
We could call this envy to contempt sublimation.

52:54.100 --> 52:59.580
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term, which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling

52:59.580 --> 53:05.540
or socially unacceptable longing into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

53:05.540 --> 53:11.500
So the classic example used by Freud is the transformation of sexual urges, of erotic

53:11.500 --> 53:14.140
energy into creative expression.

53:14.140 --> 53:18.180
It's like the founder of the No Fap movement, Lady Gaga, once said,

53:18.180 --> 53:22.260
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone, they're going to take my creativity

53:22.260 --> 53:24.180
from me through my f***.

53:24.180 --> 53:29.860
So according to Freud, the vast majority of erotic longings can never be fulfilled.

53:29.860 --> 53:35.860
Tell me about a segment, Ugh, Misery, but there's a positive side to this, supposedly,

53:35.860 --> 53:41.740
which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings into a more socially acceptable productivity.

53:41.740 --> 53:47.260
So you know, instead of slicking the bean, maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires

53:47.260 --> 53:52.060
or for that matter, philosophical treatises about the will to power, but we'll get to

53:52.060 --> 53:53.060
you.

53:53.060 --> 53:57.220
Freud thought that civilization itself is built at the cost of our instincts, most of

53:57.220 --> 54:00.860
which we have to sacrifice in order to live in a society.

54:00.860 --> 54:05.860
So like erotic impulses, I think envy can be sublimated, which is what's happening

54:05.860 --> 54:07.940
when it becomes contempt.

54:07.940 --> 54:12.820
Another example is the blog McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the tasteless architecture

54:12.820 --> 54:15.340
of suburban ostentatious trash.

54:15.340 --> 54:21.000
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog is the pleasure and relief of looking

54:21.000 --> 54:27.060
down at the rich, because looking enviously up at the rich is painful.

54:27.060 --> 54:32.620
It makes you feel inferior, and a way to alleviate that pain is to sublimate envy

54:32.620 --> 54:39.700
and pretend that you're an aristocratic aesthete scoffing at the vulgar taste of the araviste.

54:39.700 --> 54:43.860
These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.

54:43.860 --> 54:46.940
Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.

54:46.940 --> 54:51.580
I once heard a trans woman say, at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.

54:51.580 --> 54:56.020
The subtext is, there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer who lives in LA and

54:56.020 --> 54:59.960
has a lot of cosmetic surgery to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

54:59.960 --> 55:04.740
But it costs a lot of money to look like this, and a lot of trans women can't afford surgeries

55:04.740 --> 55:05.740
that they want.

55:05.740 --> 55:10.700
And one way to cope with frustrated desire is to convince yourself that the thing that's

55:10.700 --> 55:14.020
out of reach is not worth having anyway.

55:14.020 --> 55:17.580
See also the discourse on Twitter about how passing is transphobic.

55:17.580 --> 55:21.860
There's an ancient Greek fable where a fox wants some grapes, but he can't reach the

55:21.860 --> 55:26.920
vine, so he walks away bitterly and says, well the grapes are transphobic anyway.

55:26.920 --> 55:31.660
The cisgender version of this is maybe the not like other girls meme, which is classic

55:31.660 --> 55:33.580
envy to contempt sublimation.

55:33.580 --> 55:37.780
The trope is usually that other girls are popular and slutty.

55:37.780 --> 55:40.100
They have fake tans and fake nails.

55:40.100 --> 55:43.860
They like partying and makeup and stupid music for idiots.

55:43.860 --> 55:45.900
But I'm quirky and real.

55:45.900 --> 55:52.300
I listen to Pink Floyd and read books and eat lots of pizza late at night, alone and

55:52.300 --> 55:53.300
sad.

55:53.300 --> 55:57.020
There's usually a subtext of anxiety about inferiority.

55:57.020 --> 56:01.300
The other girls being more socially accepted, feminine, and put together.

56:01.300 --> 56:04.700
A lot of times the other girls don't even exist, right?

56:04.700 --> 56:07.580
They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.

56:07.580 --> 56:12.020
Like where are these other girls who've never eaten pizza and enjoy wearing makeup

56:12.020 --> 56:14.020
at 9am on a Saturday morning?

56:14.020 --> 56:15.860
Are they between the sofa cushions?

56:15.860 --> 56:19.620
Did you put them in with the other laundry or the other girls in the room with us right

56:19.620 --> 56:20.620
now?

56:20.620 --> 56:25.620
So the feeling of inferiority toward the other girls is reframed as a kind of contemptuous

56:25.620 --> 56:30.820
hipster superiority, which is really just an ego-defensive persona of resentment.

56:30.820 --> 56:32.540
Like Janice in Mean Girls.

56:32.540 --> 56:33.900
She's not even really a lesbian.

56:33.900 --> 56:34.900
She's Lebanese.

56:34.900 --> 56:36.140
Lebanese.

56:36.140 --> 56:37.140
Regina got confused.

56:37.140 --> 56:41.820
And then she dances with a boy at the end and is readmitted into girlhood.

56:41.820 --> 56:44.140
Thank you for that, Tina Fey, that's very helpful.

56:44.140 --> 56:45.140
Great.

56:45.580 --> 56:51.740
Another way we can reframe feelings of envious inferiority is by transforming them into moral

56:51.740 --> 56:53.420
superiority.

56:53.420 --> 56:58.380
Moral superiority often being the refuge of people with nothing better to feel superior

56:58.380 --> 56:59.380
about.

56:59.380 --> 57:03.700
We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy if we convince ourselves that what we're

57:03.700 --> 57:08.700
actually experiencing is justified, legitimate hatred.

57:08.700 --> 57:12.700
So for example, think of the morality around sexuality.

57:12.700 --> 57:13.700
Part 69.

57:13.700 --> 57:14.700
Sluts.

57:14.780 --> 57:16.460
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

57:16.460 --> 57:17.460
Cancel me?

57:17.460 --> 57:18.460
En garde!

57:18.460 --> 57:19.460
Bitch.

57:19.460 --> 57:22.940
Why does everyone hate sluts so much?

57:22.940 --> 57:25.020
Sluts never do nothing wrong to nobody.

57:25.020 --> 57:29.140
Open sexual promiscuity is in a way analogous to opulence.

57:29.140 --> 57:34.800
You're conspicuously enjoying something that other people want but may not be able to get.

57:34.800 --> 57:39.420
Many cultures have norms about modesty, for example, expecting women to cover their hair

57:39.420 --> 57:40.540
in public.

57:40.540 --> 57:44.060
This is usually explained as prophylaxis against male lust.

57:44.420 --> 57:49.820
But I wonder if it also serves to prevent a more generalized envy, which female beauty

57:49.820 --> 57:51.980
has a way of attracting.

57:51.980 --> 57:56.140
Men often slut-shame because they want to control female sexuality.

57:56.140 --> 58:01.660
And by female sexuality, I do mean male sexuality because often what they're really struggling

58:01.660 --> 58:04.100
to control is their own desire.

58:04.100 --> 58:09.100
But slut-shaming is also done pretty viciously by women to each other.

58:09.100 --> 58:12.420
And that's a complicated thing, it's more than just envy.

58:12.420 --> 58:16.780
Sometimes it comes from a sense that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men

58:16.780 --> 58:22.180
is compromising the collective sex-withholding power of the group, almost like she's crossing

58:22.180 --> 58:23.180
a picket line.

58:23.180 --> 58:29.140
But there's also sometimes a resentment that a woman who's showing skin is using her body

58:29.140 --> 58:31.740
to get unearned attention.

58:31.740 --> 58:33.660
And that smells like envy to me.

58:33.660 --> 58:38.220
I don't use my body to get attention, so no one should.

58:38.220 --> 58:42.820
The repressed feeling is, maybe I'm a little jealous that she's getting all this attention

58:42.820 --> 58:46.180
by posting thirst traps, but you don't think that.

58:46.180 --> 58:55.180
You think, I am above this, because I am a chaste, I have class, I am a feminist.

58:55.180 --> 58:59.940
I would also suggest accusing her of pandering to the male gaze, thus of course the feminist

58:59.940 --> 59:03.740
way of calling someone a low-down, a hoe-bag skank.

59:03.740 --> 59:10.460
So again we have envy to contempt sublimation, and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.

59:10.460 --> 59:17.660
The psychological need to convince ourselves that envy is morality can become so strong

59:17.660 --> 59:21.500
that we actually start inventing things to be outraged about.

59:21.500 --> 59:26.100
Take for instance the tendency to imagine that the wealthy and powerful are enjoying

59:26.100 --> 59:32.660
wild satanic orgies and indulging all the forbidden, salacious pleasures that we ourselves

59:32.660 --> 59:33.740
are denied.

59:33.740 --> 59:39.980
Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton reclining

59:39.980 --> 59:45.140
in a garden of earthly delights, sampling the pleasures of ephebes.

59:45.140 --> 59:48.980
Live, laugh, love that fur.

59:48.980 --> 59:53.940
Envy is very imaginative when it comes to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

59:53.940 --> 59:59.060
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.

59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.180
If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette, it's probably that when she heard about

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.140
a famine where the people had no bread, she infamously responded,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.260
Let them eat cake.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.640
What an evil bitch.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.500
How could she say that?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.460
Well, she didn't.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.740
She never said it, it's a lie.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:24.020
The phrase let them eat cake, originally let them eat brioche, first appeared in Rousseau's

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.580
Confessions, written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.660
Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.580
Probably no one ever said this.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.260
It's kind of like how the most famous photo of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.900
a stop being poor t-shirt.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.500
What an evil bitch.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.140
How could she wear that?

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.940
Well, she didn't.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.500
It's photoshopped.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.820
The actual shirt said stop being desperate.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.180
Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes of its enemies.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.140
I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:04.380
I mean, what does a Disney villain, if not an opulent homosexual, seem through the eyes

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.380
of the Envyists?

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.380
She all like Google.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.140
I'm going to try lowering the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here now.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.340
Okay, well that's a much lower ISO.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.340
What if I get another white over here?

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.920
That's what this channel is really about.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.140
One biological female's quest to create a harmonious color story.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:25.140
In the years leading up to and during the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette was constantly

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.660
defamed in these sleazy tabloids called Libelle.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.820
It's the same route as the English word libel.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.240
The often pornographic Libelle depicted the queen as a bisexual demon who was constantly

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.240
having drunken orgies and sexually manipulating everyone around her.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.580
All of which is very interesting, but none of which is true.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:51.220
The historian Robert Darnton called it an avalanche of defamation that has no parallel

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.480
in the history of vilification.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:02:00.060
This woman took the blame, the moral blame, for the structural failings of a broken economic

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:06.000
system and by the time she was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793, the actual

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.360
person Marie Antoinette had long ago been overshadowed by the libelous caricature of

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360
her.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.380
That was maybe one good reason for executing the former queen, which is that the legitimacy

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:23.300
of your new republic is a little more secure when you don't have living monarchs hanging

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.300
around.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.780
Someone better tell the English.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.980
But the problem with that reasoning is it has nothing to do with whether or not the

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.500
queen deserved to die.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.100
And beheading a recently widowed mother of two in front of a jeering crowd for political

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:41.380
expediency might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.320
So the revolution had to convince themselves that the queen deserved it, which was pretty

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.080
easy after decades of, again, false and defamatory gossip.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.160
In her biography of Marie Antoinette, Antonia Fraser describes how the prison guards separated

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.760
Marie from her 8-year-old son, who they plied with alcohol and groomed into accusing his

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.760
own mother of incestuous abuse.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.900
To justify killing Marie Antoinette, they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.900
mother.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:18.260
So she was convicted of what may as well have been crimes against ethics in games journalism

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.820
and sent to the guillotine where her last words were sorry to the executioner for stepping

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.820
on his foot.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:29.060
Uh, women stop apologizing challenge.

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.300
This is what a girl boss winning looks like.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.280
So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.320
Hey, how are you?

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.040
An innocent MILF was killed that day, and I, for one, won't stand for it.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.800
So look, we have a psychological incentive to believe that people whom we envy are immoral

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.680
monsters, because then we get to label our hatred and violence toward them justice.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.720
Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty, and part of the reason for that

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.280
is that calling cruelty what it is takes the fun out of it.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.380
It reminds me of the second best day in the history of Twitter, October 1st, 2020, the

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.680
day that Trump got COVID.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.720
And I'm going to be honest, I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.520
Well, well, well, if it isn't the leopards eating people's faces party having their

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:37.280
faces eaten by leopards, last time I ate cake.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.960
Like Dan Savage said, it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.720
The next day I tweeted, these last 24 hours have been the first time I've genuinely

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.480
enjoyed Twitter in years, because his website is good for one thing only, reveling in the

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.560
cruelest of human impulses.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.800
And someone responded to that saying, oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.600
But why was I being a killjoy?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.320
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:07.320
Well, for most people, I guess not me, but for normal people, for other girls, cruelty

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:12.600
is only pleasurable as long as they can convince themselves it's something other than cruelty,

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.000
justice served.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.100
So again, reason, rationality are often the attempt to publicly communicate, to evangelize

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:28.860
our private feelings, and morality, ethics, and justice are often put forward as the respectable

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:34.660
public face of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:40.500
But is this a corruption of morality, or have we stumbled onto something darker?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:47.500
What if morality itself is simply the expression of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.780
It's too early for this.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.500
I mean, it's literally 7am, where I'm filming.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.180
I don't know how this keeps happening to me.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.500
My head gets cut off one afternoon, puts me in a philosophical mood.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.500
Next morning, I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about the Fila soves.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.900
Meow meow.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.420
Hello again, kittens.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.420
Let's talk about justice, ooh-woo.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.660
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660
So meow.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660
So meow-you-are.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:17.900
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know, I wasn't being meow-tally.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.900
Look.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.500
I have been seeing a lot of comments lately along the lines of Natalie used to do serious

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.260
academic arguments.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.140
Now she only cares about makeup.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.380
Alright, you little shits.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.380
You want book learning?

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.100
I'm gonna learn you so hard.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:37.100
I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.100
Friedrich Nietzsche.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.100
Friedrich.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.100
Wilhelm Nietzsche.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.220
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:49.340
Friedrich was a German philosopher who had a lot to say about envy and morality.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.500
But before we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his life because it's

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.220
just very funny.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:59.980
Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.580
little Frederick.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.060
He was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:10.740
Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain, nearly blind incel who probably slept

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.180
with a prostitute once and got syphilis and died.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.220
Life is funny.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.900
Sad, but funny.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:23.140
In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil, the editor says, though he prided himself

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.140
on being comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been very successful in establishing

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.980
emotionally satisfying relationships with them, which is hardly surprising.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.580
I love when the introduction to a book is just a brutal roast of the author.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580
Who wrote this?

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.580
Rolfe.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.580
Peter Horstmann.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.580
You're killing it, Rolfe.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.580
You're savage.

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:44.980
Frederick's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:50.580
What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated, highly neurotic man who had to try hard to

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.580
avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.580
Oh.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:00.660
He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable, and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.940
pills using the name Dr. Nietzsche.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.940
Dr. Nietzsche.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.300
Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once behind a Dairy Queen.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.540
Nietzsche was also a failed musician and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.540
wife.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.540
Ugh.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.980
The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.980
You beta-cuck.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.940
Why did I do that?

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.540
Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.540
I just want to mom this guy, honestly.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.020
His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.700
You know, I think it's interesting that a person this pathetic can also be a genius

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.140
whose name will never die.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.820
He's someone who had a lot of reason to be envious and self-pitying, but his philosophy

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.900
couldn't be more against that.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:50.500
And as a person of pathetic experience myself, that is unironically kind of inspiring to

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.500
me.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.500
So let's go in.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.780
In his book on the genealogy of morality, Frederick wants to explain the origin of the

01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.840
concepts of good and evil.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.500
Under what conditions did man invent the value judgments good and evil?

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.900
And what value do they themselves have?

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.620
Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.420
Hang on, my food's here.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420
That's right.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420
You're getting a mukbang, sweetie.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.540
Did you think I was going to sit at this giant table and not be eating something?

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.500
This video has been going on more than an hour, so I assume you guys are drunk by now

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.780
and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.180
You guys can't even see.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.220
Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat all of this while

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.420
summarizing the entire life and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.620
Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider this a challenge.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:36.780
So, Frederick argues that good and bad, not good and evil, that's different, we'll

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:43.540
get to that, but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values of people with power.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.220
So to be good meant to be powerful, strong, beautiful, healthy.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:52.700
And to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.060
I'm going to eat one like a cat.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.260
And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:04.260
So in a lot of languages, the word that means morally good or spiritually noble originally

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:09.140
meant noble in the sense of aristocratic, the property to class.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.700
Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani, that's Sanskrit for noble truths.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.660
Arya means noble.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:21.060
And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble, but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060
rich.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.900
And originally, it was just the name that a culture in northern India gave themselves,

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.900
the Aryans.

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.660
I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:35.740
This was later misunderstood by Europeans who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:39.300
Oops, god damn it.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.820
God damn it kids, can we not?

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.460
Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut, or the English good, to the name

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.460
of the Goths.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:52.100
No, not those Goths, the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.860
Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.500
I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:04.620
The German word schlecht, which means bad, is related to schlichcht, which means plain,

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:10.180
simple, originally common, low, not aristocratic, not noble.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:15.700
So good and bad were originally the values of warrior aristocrats who were like Homeric

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.220
heroes celebrating themselves.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.020
And Frederick calls their value system master morality.

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:29.740
This glorification of combat, feasting, athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty, these things were

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.220
called good.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:36.020
And their opposites, weakness, impotence, ugliness, were called bad.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.420
The ancient nobles worshipped noble gods who acted like them and shared their values.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.700
I mean, if I created a personal goddess, I think we all know what animal that would be.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.180
Me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.260
So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars, the god of war.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
And it was like they were worshipping themselves.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.700
They were dumb jocks, worshipping dumb jock gods.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:57.740
Well good for them.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.980
But what about the people who got shoved into lockers?

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:05.820
Well, Frederick's example, and this is going to create some misunderstandings later, but

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:11.500
his example is the Jews, who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.460
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.780
Oh, they did.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.780
Multiple times.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.900
But for several centuries, the Romans were just too powerful.

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.140
No one could stop them.

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:27.440
So the question is, what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed and who lack the

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.460
power to overthrow the oppressor?

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:36.340
Well, in that case, frustrated vindictiveness builds over time to become this deep bitterness

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.220
which Nietzsche gave the French name, resentment in English.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:45.780
Oui, et, oui, absolutement, naturalement.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.860
I don't speak French.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.340
I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.940
Mont, pas, cartre, et, oui.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.300
I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.700
Because they're always dressed so well and they speak a sexier language than me.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700
Stop it.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700
This is your final warning, comprendezvous.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.700
Good wine, though.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.700
I'll give them that.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.860
So there's a German word, neid, which means envy.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:09.700
So why is Frederick using this French term, raisontement?

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.060
What's going on, Frederick?

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.060
Why are you speaking French?

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.060
Are you nervous?

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.060
You're trying to impress me?

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.020
Nietzsche must have said raisontement because he thought it was something different than

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.020
envy.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.940
I think the difference is resentment, and I'm just going to use the English word so

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.820
I don't sound like an asshole.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:30.620
Resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has, but of a permanent frustration

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.580
of the desire for revenge.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.260
It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:40.940
Now revenge itself implies weakness, at least a temporary weakness.

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:47.620
We say revenge is best served cold, but actually, revenge is only served cold.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:52.380
If it's served hot, if someone slaps you and you slap them back immediately, that's

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.220
retaliation, not revenge.

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.220
You brought this on yourself.

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:01.060
Revenge is only a possibility when you can't retaliate immediately.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.900
So you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming, but if you're too weak, too

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.420
impotent to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:14.860
So Nietzsche's argument is that a person who's too weak to get material revenge can

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:20.140
instead get psychological revenge by creating a new morality.

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.900
In Frederick's words, the beginning of the slave's revolt in morality occurs when raisontement

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.980
itself turns creative and gives birth to values.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.940
This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.100
What are you doing, Frederick?

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:39.300
So while master morality says that good is power, riches, health, and strength, and bad

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:45.460
is the opposite, slave morality, the morality of resentment, says, blessed are the poor,

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.340
the meek, the sick, the powerless.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:54.220
This is the good of slave morality, and its opposite is not the bad, but a new concept,

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.220
the evil.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.620
And what is evil?

01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:04.340
Well, everything that master morality says is good, power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.580
He's talking about Christianity here.

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.540
He's not talking about Judaism.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:19.180
But Frederick thinks of Christianity as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.940
Romans, an inversion of the Empire's values.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.980
But he also thinks that slave morality is fundamentally dishonest.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.060
It's like the fox and the grapes.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:34.140
Not being able to take revenge is called not wanting to take revenge.

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.740
It might even be called forgiveness.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.540
Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:44.460
Submission to people you hate is called obedience.

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.540
Having to wait is called patience.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:53.420
Inability to satisfy sexual desire is called chastity, purity, and so on.

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:59.740
And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself as a powerful, noble beast

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:05.780
of prey, slave morality is born of saying no to the master and everything he has that

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780
you can't.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.060
I like to have my belly rubbed.

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.060
Scratch my back above my tail, please.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:14.540
I'm going to put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm and I'm full.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.260
This has not been a successful mukbang.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:20.100
It turns out that it's actually very difficult to do a mukbang while talking.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.780
I should have thought this through a little harder.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.860
So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.220
But that desire for revenge never completely disappears.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:32.740
It's there, for example, in the Christian idea of the Last Judgment.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.580
No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.900
God will do that for us.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:42.220
And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.060
I find this book thrilling to read, honestly.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.780
And I'm not easily thrilled, especially not by philosophers.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.100
I think this book in particular gets me because, especially if you were raised Christian, this

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.500
is so the opposite of everything you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.740
like dirty.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.820
Should I be reading this?

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:01.820
Is this allowed?

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.860
Because even if you're not religious, most of us still agree with a lot of Christian

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.860
morality.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.300
Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.460
Blessed are the meek.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.460
Sure.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:16.420
But then Frederick comes along and he's like, mmm, morality is just a cope for frustrated

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.420
vindictiveness.

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.580
And you're like, I need to lie down.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.020
Where's my smelling salts?

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.980
But wait, there's more.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.340
This gets even darker.

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:40.660
Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia of European history, slave morality has triumphed.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:46.020
St. Paul made Christianity marketable, the Emperor Constantine converted, and by the

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.620
Middle Ages, even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down not to powerful warrior gods

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.740
made in their own image, but to a god that was weak.

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.740
Suffering.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.740
Victimized.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.740
Oppressed.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.740
Mmm.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:05.660
So by the 19th century, slave morality had become the only morality.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.660
And it's not just Christianity, either.

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:12.340
The secular version of these values became socialism, anarchism.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:17.940
About free thinkers and atheists, Nietzsche has this to say, we loathe the church, not

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940
its poison.

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.220
Apart from the church, we too loathe the poison.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.260
Okay, the poison.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.660
What is the poison?

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:31.220
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind, and turns humans against our own

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.900
natural instincts.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:39.620
Not just against aggression, but against sexuality, against ambition, against power, against life

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.620
itself.

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.940
And there's two possible outcomes of this.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.380
One is that resentment becomes a political movement.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.740
The conspiracy of those who suffer.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.580
The tyranny of the herd.

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.100
The revolution that eats itself.

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.620
Only we are good and just is what they say.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:00.300
As though health, success, strength, pride, and the feeling of power were in themselves

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:05.780
depravities for which penance, bitter penance, will one day be exacted, among them we find

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:11.140
plenty of vengeance seekers disguised as judges with the word justice continually in their

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.300
mouth like poisonous spittle.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.580
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob, which I'm sure we're all

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.660
familiar with.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:24.780
The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward and attacks the individual conscience,

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.780
introducing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.460
Because slave morality condemns not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:40.180
us, but also the beast of prey within, our own animal instincts, what Christianity calls

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.740
sin.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:45.660
So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.020
We hate ourselves.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.100
We hate our own nature.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.420
We hate life itself.

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.940
I mean, is he wrong?

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:57.820
You see a girl boss winning, I only see the world to power.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:04.020
Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats who've become domesticated housepets

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.100
at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.740
That's a very valid Frederick.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.020
That's super hecking valid.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:19.100
So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far, but I do have a couple critiques I

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.100
want to say.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:26.340
One is that Frederick associating slave morality with the Jews is very irresponsible.

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:30.740
Even though he didn't intend to be anti-Semitic, and even though he was outspoken against anti-Semitism

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:35.300
in his own time, when you keep referring to the Christian values you're critiquing as

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:40.700
Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge, some people might get the wrong idea.

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:46.060
And some people did Frederick, like your dumbass sister Elizabeth Nietzsche, who became a literal

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:50.420
alternative ethno-identitarian god damn it Liz.

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.900
Kind of goth goals though.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.500
Yes, that kind of goth, you're right this time.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.100
My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick that genuinely

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.180
caring about other people is an option.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:05.800
Not because caring about other people is repressing your true selfish nature, which is because

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.100
caring about other people is part of your nature.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.420
And isn't it?

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.060
Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:18.540
I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment accurately describes a very real

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.540
thing.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.800
But it's not the only thing.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.460
There is genuine care and love in this world I've been told.

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:25.460
I've heard rumors.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.820
And I'm even going to go so far as to say hashtag not all Christians.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.540
Christ, I'm defending the Christians.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.460
What is this channel coming to?

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:38.220
There are Christians, maybe not most, but still some, for whom love and forgiveness

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:44.660
are genuine experiences and not just some kind of twisted impotent passive-aggressive

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.660
vengeance.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:50.800
Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:58.060
of justice and morality is retribution, envy, or some combination of the two.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.900
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:03.660
There's a famous Martin Luther King quote responding to Nietzsche.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:10.380
What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive and

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:14.580
that love without power is sentimental and anemic.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.300
Power at its best is love.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:24.780
Implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is love correcting everything

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.700
that stands against love.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:35.100
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:39.700
But there still needs to be some kind of emotional or spiritual force that keeps humanity from

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.340
tearing itself apart.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:46.500
And maybe something like this Christian idea of love for humanity is the missing piece.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.660
Because without something like that, I just see retribution and envy snowballing into

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.500
human self-destruction.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.780
And I hate that for us.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.580
It's not very sliving of us.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.780
Do you guys know about sliving?

01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.060
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:04.100
She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do, but you know, I try to support smaller

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:05.100
creators.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:09.100
Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life into one word.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.900
It's the new that's hot.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.900
Maybe I'll do a video about love when I'm in a better mood.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.980
So for now, well, let's put it this way.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.300
God is dead and we have killed him, yeah?

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.300
Sliving!

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:41.100
Okay, I'm moisturized.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.100
I'm primed.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.180
I've proven my academic credentials.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.860
Now it's time to do my makeup.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.420
That's right children, I'm going full Bailey-Sarian.

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.980
I'm going full suspicious.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.900
So I guess I should say something about the political implications of all this, since

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.620
I guess this channel is about politics.

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.860
Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article to remember what I'm doing with my

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.860
life.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:08.020
So this morality of resentment, of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge judges

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.420
that power is evil.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.540
I don't use foundation, I just use concealer.

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:15.580
I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.580
at makeup, okay?

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.300
I have a million subscribers on YouTube.

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.700
I don't need to be good.

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.900
There was a New York Times article about young women's attitudes toward political ambition

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.460
and one of the women who was interviewed said, as a white woman, I know I have unearned

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:29.460
privilege.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.260
So am I really the best person to be in leadership?

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.260
Uh, yes.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.860
Yes, you are.

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:39.580
Because we need leaders like you who are capable of questioning the legitimacy of their own

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.580
authority.

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.460
Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck with another blonde beast of prey.

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:48.980
And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege, especially as a leader, but let's

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:53.660
not be so self-effacing that we have faced ourselves off the face of the earth.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:57.120
This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.220
If you think power is evil, then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.140
which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance, since, like MLK said, you have

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.540
to at least have some power to implement the demands of justice.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:15.740
Remember what incels call taking the black pill, this conviction that the reason you

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:19.020
don't have a girlfriend is just that you're genetically undesirable.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:23.660
There's nothing you could do to change it, and I guess women are just too shallow to

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:27.980
be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite that festers in your heart.

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.980
For a lot of black pill incels, it seems like there's only one thing left in life that

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:37.940
they enjoy, which is simply the pleasure of complaining, of moaning in pain.

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:43.180
It reminds me of a comment from Dostoyevsky's second most horrible protagonist.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.260
Even in Toothache, there is enjoyment.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:49.540
In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence but moan, but they are not candid

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.420
moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point.

01:25:53.420 --> 01:26:00.540
The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain, and part of the satisfaction of moaning

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.340
is inflicting your pain on other people.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.300
This kind of malignant moaning, it's kind of the opposite of music, because a lot of

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:13.740
music, like blues, is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.340
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.300
My woman don't love me no more, but I know her sister will.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.820
You know, optimism.

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:23.660
I think a lot of incel discourse is really just malignant moaning.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:28.460
Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem, it's just a contagious

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.740
expression of misery.

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:33.660
A moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.740
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740
The redistribution of sex.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.740
State-mandated GFs.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.740
That's very valid.

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:44.300
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.300
That's not the point.

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.660
So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.

01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.700
It's very easy to point and laugh at them, but what's harder is to look in the mirror

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:59.500
and notice how these exact same tendencies are rampant in our own communities.

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:04.780
So the incel black pill is just one instance of what I call an ideology of resentment.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.620
A discourse that outwardly appears, like moral or political critique,

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:12.540
but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:16.460
The goal of resentment politics is not to improve conditions.

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:23.180
In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt for any morally compromised sellouts

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.820
who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.340
They don't want victory.

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.540
They don't want power.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.340
They want to endlessly critique power.

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:38.460
Because for them, critique is an important psychological defense against feeling impotent.

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.220
Shaylor described it this way.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:45.260
It is peculiar to Rizantamat criticism that it does not seriously desire that its demands be

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:45.900
fulfilled.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.500
It does not want to cure the evil.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.300
The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.820
What am I going to do with my eyes?

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.740
I think a pink kind of look.

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.260
We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:57.180
I just I love that hay fever look.

01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:01.980
As a general rule, the more radical a political community claims to be,

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:05.180
the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:10.380
Self-styled radicals will tell you, superficial surface reforms do not interest us.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.100
The problem must be critiqued at its root.

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.980
And then the root turns out to be this universal, all-encompassing evil, right?

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.420
Society itself.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.460
The system.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.500
The machine.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:27.420
A resentment ideologue always imagines himself to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.860
against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.860
Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.

01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.620
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:35.980
It's hard to talk while doing this.

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:40.540
And nothing short of total revolution counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.860
We have to dismantle the entire system.

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:44.940
Burn it all down.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:49.740
I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.820
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.820
Our kingdom is coming, comrades.

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:57.900
Often the appeal of utopian ideology is similar to religion.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:03.340
It's not about health care, higher wages, relief from police violence.

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:07.740
Those are actual goals that could be demanded, worked for, and achieved.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:13.340
Utopian ideology instead promises relief from some general malaise.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.340
Alienation.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:20.620
And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect that Marx ascribes to religion.

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:25.660
But release from the general anguish of human existence is not a political goal.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.860
There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries.

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.420
And so far, zero utopias.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.260
Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.700
are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.500
When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:46.220
And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:51.260
And because of the proximity effect, envy may actually increase after the revolution.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:56.860
You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade, a successful citoyon.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:57.260
Oui.

01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:00.380
A coolock than you ever were of the aristocrats.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:05.660
So envy turns paranoid and imaginative in revolutionary moments.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.780
It gets sublimated into morality, and the accusations start flying.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.740
That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.740
That peasant is hoarding grain.

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.780
So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.220
the gulags fill up,

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:26.620
or an authoritarian strongman takes over just to announce another revolution two decades later.

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.780
The things people will do to stay relevant.

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:29.500
Honestly.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.220
And for what?

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.900
What long-term egalitarian utopia results?

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.060
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:42.380
So look, I do understand that sometimes you just have to do a revolution.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:47.100
And if I'd been there in 1789, I'm sure I'd be storming the best deal myself.

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.580
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:54.060
Revolution is a bloody nightmare that happens because society is collapsing and people are

01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:54.700
desperate.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:59.100
At worst, revolution is nothing more than a violent day of retribution.

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.020
And at best, it lays the groundwork for future incremental progress.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:07.340
But it will never usher in utopia, nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:12.620
which, I'm sorry to report, is simply the resting state of an uncedated human mind.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:15.980
Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:20.220
that all leftist or all egalitarian politics is born of envy.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:20.540
No.

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.180
This is a specific subtype.

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:27.100
There are plenty of reasons, other than envy or fear of envy,

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:31.660
to oppose an economic distribution where some people have billions of dollars while

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.140
other people are dying because they can't afford insulin.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:38.860
Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources to promote human well-being.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:43.420
And personally, I just don't want to live in a country where people are dying because they

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:44.540
can't afford medicine.

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:48.860
And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes for that not to happen.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.380
So while I'm putting down straw man versions of my argument,

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.300
I'm also not saying, oh, let's just stop being envious.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.060
No. That's impossible.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.980
I think envy is like libido.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.380
It's a basic force of human nature that's more or less unstoppable.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:09.500
But with the right leadership, I think that envy can potentially be sublimated

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.620
or redirected into something more constructive.

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:17.580
Because raw envy is a very bad basis for egalitarian politics.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:21.260
It often targets the wrong people, like millionaires instead of billionaires.

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.060
And eventually, it turns the revolution against itself.

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.060
And you get the circular firing squad.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.500
The self-cannibalism.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:32.220
The problem I see on the left today is that without any genuine political outlet,

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.020
resentment mostly manifests as morality.

01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.820
Morality itself being a way to vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.540
On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:48.300
We're all about structural analysis, the material conditions, systems of power,

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.620
intersectional identity hierarchies.

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.820
But if you look at what people actually spend their time doing here,

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.460
it's all this obsessive moral policing.

01:32:56.460 --> 01:33:01.020
I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win on any major political stage,

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.620
we feel disempowered.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:06.780
And so this moral fanaticism is a psychological substitute.

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:11.100
Like with Marie Antoinette, it's easier to blame people than systems.

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.460
Also, structural analysis is very boring,

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:17.900
and destroying people with gossip is extremely entertaining.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:24.380
This obsessive moral policing also gets turned inward and becomes leftist guilt.

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:27.740
You know, this useless internalized scolding.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.100
I think I'm done with my makeup.

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:29.980
What do we think?

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:30.860
Leave a comment.

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.940
I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.820
Since last time I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hiram.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.380
So I am going to spray my face a couple times with this Tatcha skin mist.

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.900
If that's okay with Hiram, it feels good to finally address this feud.

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:44.540
Clear the air.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.740
I look a lot better with makeup.

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.580
I don't want to say that I don't have a natural beauty.

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:53.900
It's just that it's very much enhanced by painting a different face on top of my face.

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.780
But hey, at least this way, I've kind of earned it, you know, because it's my skill.

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.700
So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist that's been running for years.

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.100
And I haven't listened in a while, but in the early episodes,

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.940
they'd bring on these women who would confess their feminist sins.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:11.100
You know, hi, my name is Amber.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:16.140
I'm a feminist, but I enjoy being choked in bed.

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:18.540
It's hard being a woman.

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.900
Not only are you being choked, you also feel guilty about it.

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.820
The same moral hand wringing happens with body positivity.

01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:29.260
When you make loving your body into a moral imperative,

01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:31.340
not only are you still going to hate your body,

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.620
but now you're also going to feel guilty about hating your body

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.380
because it makes you a bad feminist.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:39.340
So there was one problem, and now there's two problems.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.620
Thanks, morality.

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.380
That's very helpful.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:46.300
Now, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that a lot of conservatives have made

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.340
some version of the argument I'm making in this video.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:53.660
For example, Jordan Peterson and Camille Palia have argued

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:57.020
that academic postmodernists are motivated by resentment.

01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:01.820
The argument is that deconstructionist literary theory is a kind of envious

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.380
vengeance against the beauty and virtuosity of canonical great art.

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.380
And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:12.380
A lot of academics are field artists, but I was even more Moncave than that.

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.900
I've noticed that working-class non-academic socialists

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:19.420
do tend to be more productive and more self-advancing,

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.500
involved in unionizing or organizing.

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.380
Whereas, it's usually people who went to college,

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.660
presumably because they had middle-class ambitions at some point,

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:34.060
but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.700
who become the great critiquers of capital.

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.620
I mean, I can tell you from experience that,

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.260
when I was eating Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:43.420
that's when I was most likely to say things like,

01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:45.260
According to Antonio Gramsci,

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.500
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.300
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.180
manufactures the consent of the civil term.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.620
Uh, so point taken.

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:58.140
But some conservatives take this argument way too far

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:02.380
and try to argue that the entire left is nothing but a coalition of resentment.

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.180
Like, there's a video on YouTube of the philosophy professor

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:09.500
Stephen Hicks doing a version of the post-modernism is resentment argument.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:12.140
And in the comments section, there's a bunch of people saying,

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:17.180
this describes Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the Democrats.

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.060
Does it though?

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:21.020
I mean, any political movement is gonna have people in it

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.860
who suffer from resentment poisoning.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.580
But Black Lives Matter, at its core,

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.460
is about the right not to be murdered by police.

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.620
The slogan, Black Lives Matter,

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.820
is an affirmation of the value of Black life.

01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.860
So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.740
Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.620
was inspired by Nietzsche to create the slogan,

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.060
All Power to the People.

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.780
When we coined the expression, All Power to the People,

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:49.180
we had in mind emphasizing the word power.

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:52.860
For we recognize that the will to power is the basic drive of man.

01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:55.500
But it is incorrect to seek power over people.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.260
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power of exploitation

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.180
and racism for hundreds of years.

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:04.060
And the Black community has its will to power also.

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:07.020
What we seek, however, is not power over people,

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.060
but the power of control of our own destiny.

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:13.900
That, to me, is a role model for how to do identity politics

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.580
without centering resentment.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:19.980
It's instead an affirmation of self-determination and self-respect.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.780
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.

01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:26.140
Whereas if your whole political project is defined in the negative,

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.940
then you're allowing yourself to be defined by your enemies.

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.140
I find feminism is prone to this where even, and in fact,

01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.620
especially the most radical feminists,

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.100
cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.260
of being the second sex and defining themselves against men.

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:44.220
Earlier, I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.540
She's the most radical of radical feminists.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.420
And my first impulse is actually to defend her

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.660
because she's very widely hated.

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.780
And most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.

01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.460
Like in that Stephen Hicks video,

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:01.340
Hicks summarizes Dworkin as calling all heterosexual males rapists.

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:04.700
Literally in the preface to her most famous book,

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:05.980
Dworkin says,

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:10.140
If one's sexual experience has always, and without exception,

01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:13.260
been based on dominance, how could one understand

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:16.780
that this book does not say that all men are rapists

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.860
or that all intercourse is rape?

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.260
Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.860
and I'm just a makeup vlogger,

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.100
but my gut feeling on this one is,

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.700
before criticizing a book, maybe read the book.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:29.580
Just a thought.

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.620
Get it together, prof.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.100
You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.220
I mean, there's no shame in that.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.420
It happens to me all the time.

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.980
That being said, I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.380
that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.540
What Dworkin does say in this book is arguably even more bleak

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.300
than what is falsely attributed to her.

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.060
The book is called Intercourse.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.740
She wrote a book called Intercourse.

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.660
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:54.940
I can actually easily imagine that.

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:55.500
Never mind.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:59.100
So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.020
Penetration, to be specific.

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.860
Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,

01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:09.180
invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:12.620
So it's against the Freudian male castration anxiety

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:17.580
interpretation where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.860
Imagine being afraid of that.

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:20.540
Imagine being afraid of that.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:23.180
I'm going to get a face lift someday

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.300
and I'm going to look like this.

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:27.660
I'm perfect.

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.540
I certainly don't agree with everything she says,

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.100
but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.700
Closer than Freud, anyway.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:38.460
Think about what men typically say to women during the act.

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.100
Do they say, hell, I'm being devoured.

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.860
Never heard that one.

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.500
Have you?

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.340
No, usually it's more along the lines of,

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:47.580
You like that, don't you?

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.380
You little...

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.100
Et cetera.

01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:52.780
And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.660
and enjoy it.

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:57.260
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation

01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:58.460
because they're taught to.

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:03.900
But enjoying it, she'd have to say, doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:06.220
So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:07.980
and some things that are off the fucking rails.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:10.780
Where she loses me is where she starts getting black-pilled.

01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:13.740
And this book, this is the feminist black pill.

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.260
It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.060
She says,

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:22.220
Male dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:26.140
This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:31.420
Okay, so women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.220
We can dream, Andrea.

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.100
We can dream.

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:40.780
Like most ideology resentment, this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms

01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:43.420
that might actually improve the situation of women.

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:48.540
Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence filth and objection of it all.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.140
I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:54.940
but in that second wave political way.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.220
Quoting from the foreword,

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.900
To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:04.940
In 30-plus years of knowing her, I've never heard of a single romance with a woman not one.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.580
This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250-page book about sex

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:14.620
that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.820
Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:20.940
It's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:25.180
You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters, but I don't think that's true.

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:28.780
I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.

01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:33.580
The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and Oedipus the King.

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:37.660
It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters because they're stuck with this.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:40.460
And love is closer to hatred than neutrality.

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.700
So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.420
What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:48.780
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want because no one ever told them they could.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.220
Romance.

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.140
That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.

01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.460
Joan Didion of course being not like other girls.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.660
Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:03.020
Despite all efforts to socialize women to one intercourse,

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.900
women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.860
that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.060
That does sound nice.

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:10.940
I'm so lonely.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.860
I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women though.

01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:18.700
Like there are definitely women out there who they don't make love.

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.420
Anastasia.

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.140
They f*** hard.

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.340
I'm really sleepy.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:26.540
And this bed right behind me just looks so nice.

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.980
Get in here right now.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:30.460
Whatever it is go to sleep and then wake up

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.860
and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:33.820
I don't want to do it now.

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:34.780
I'll get Pikachu.

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:35.980
I don't make this easier.

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.500
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.580
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:40.060
Why?

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.420
Because he's the yellowest.

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:43.580
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.380
You can't name anything.

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:45.340
You can't name anything.

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:49.180
So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,

01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.380
then just say that.

01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:51.740
Is that what you want Pikachu?

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.740
I bet it is.

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:57.180
And Dworkin did get married to a gay man.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.940
So I guess she found what she wanted.

01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:00.300
Lucky.

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.700
Envying Andrea Dworkin.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.620
Is that really what we've sunk to around here?

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.860
You know I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.

01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:14.300
I know this isn't very original but I had a bad year.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.500
You know I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.300
Got my heart comprehensively broken.

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:27.340
And then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:29.340
You know I stopped saying yes to life.

01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:32.300
And I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:35.100
By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon.

01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.580
One of the greatest appropriate for all ages video games of all time.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.820
Look at him go.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:42.940
I'm taking the hair clips out.

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.900
I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.500
It's because I'm trans.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.100
It's because I'm gay.

01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:50.620
That's why I'll die alone.

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.140
You know that's the reason I'm alone.

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.300
Definitely not because I don't leave the house.

01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:58.780
See I am not immune to incel tear brain poisoning.

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:04.300
And you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:06.620
Society did this to me.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.380
A transphobic society made me hate myself.

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.500
Well yeah that's true.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:18.140
But at a certain point you have to take responsibility for your own mind.

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.660
And decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:25.260
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost the mind is its own place.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.060
And in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.020
Yes squad.

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:32.620
So I asked myself what kind of mind do I want to be?

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:35.100
Do I want to obsess over what I lack?

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.980
Concede society's judgment of my inferiority?

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:42.380
Become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?

01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:46.220
Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor?

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:49.740
Stop chasing the dragon and say yes to life.

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.460
The answer of course is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:58.940
But we're not gonna do that because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.900
The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:08.940
Also nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.260
It's beyond a personality flaw.

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:16.620
It's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance of happiness you have.

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:22.620
So in the short time that you're alive you have to discover that which is noble in yourself.

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:23.900
And say yes to it.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.580
You know don't say no to getting older.

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:27.980
Say yes to being a MILF.

01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.700
Yes.

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:29.580
Yes.

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:34.380
What I'm really trying to say here is Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.

01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:37.580
Spongebob says yes to life and so should we.

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:39.100
Yes to ourselves.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.140
Yes to art.

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:41.660
Yes to sensuality.

01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.180
Yes to the world.

01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:44.060
Yes.

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.020
Yes.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:46.380
Eh, we.

01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.020
Is this really how we're ending the video?

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:51.180
I guess.

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.860
Okay, bye!

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:11.100
Oh so what if my fantasies make no sense?

01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:13.100
You want to talk about things that don't make sense?

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.300
Heterosexuality.

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.300
Let's put that under the microscope.

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:21.820
You want me to believe that a straight woman who knows the difference between magenta and mauve

01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:25.740
is going to date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear.

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.500
And that's just going to work out fine.

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:30.060
You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?

01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:31.980
I don't think so.

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.180
Not on my watch.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.420
See I think straight men should date each other.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:38.620
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then **** each other.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.860
And then straight women can pair off,

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.820
decoupage some shit and eat each other out.

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:44.860
Isn't that better?

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.980
Isn't that more rational?

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:50.620
I wish I could wiggle these cattiers like I wish I had anatomical control over them.

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:51.020
Hello.

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:52.940
Yes, Dr. Spiegel.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.460
Yes, it's me again.

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.460
I have a suggestion.

01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.260
What do we even have here?

01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:08.140
We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.

01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:09.580
I've never been as much into rolls.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:10.380
I'm a cat, you know.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.100
I like fish.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.820
