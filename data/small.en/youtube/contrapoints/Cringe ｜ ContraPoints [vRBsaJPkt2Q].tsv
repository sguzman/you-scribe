0	5000	Hello again, the gays.
5000	7000	Welcome to my garden party fantasy.
7000	10000	Straight people you're of course welcome to tag along to
10000	12000	provided you're emotionally damaged.
12000	14000	Hi. Hey, how are you?
14000	16000	Cringe. Let's talk about it.
16000	19000	The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.
19000	22000	It just pops into my head all the time.
22000	25000	Like, when I randomly remembered that month back in 2013
25000	28000	when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kezha songs
28000	30000	were rewritten in iambic pentameter.
30000	33000	Why? What audience was that for?
33000	36000	Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?
36000	38000	Cringe. Mega cringe.
38000	40000	I think I say this word like 50 times a day.
40000	43000	Cringe, cringe, cringe. And I'm not the only one.
43000	46000	Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe
46000	49000	has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016
49000	51000	and remaining pretty constant ever since.
51000	54000	And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe
54000	57000	as at an all-time high the month I'm making this video.
57000	59000	So what is cringe?
59000	61000	Well, let's start with some examples.
61000	63000	There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,
63000	66000	What Things Really Make You Cringe?
66000	68000	And here's some of the most upvoted responses.
68000	71000	The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to
71000	74000	and everyone at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
74000	76000	Recordings of my own voice.
76000	79000	When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend,
79000	81000	he just goes to another school thing.
81000	84000	Early teen me. So many cringe stuff I did.
84000	86000	I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.
86000	88000	This happened about two years ago.
88000	91000	I ordered some pizza hot online, and when it was delivered,
91000	93000	the lady handed me the pizza boxes.
93000	96000	I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.
96000	97000	I said, oh.
97000	99000	And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip,
99000	102000	and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.
102000	105000	She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.
105000	107000	I said, oh.
107000	110000	And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.
110000	111000	Then I said, you too.
111000	113000	And then I closed the door and killed myself.
113000	116000	All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl
116000	119000	says in her book Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.
119000	122000	According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe
122000	124000	are when we're yanked out of our own perspective
124000	128000	and we can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.
128000	130000	She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,
130000	133000	who in the 60s did a study of the Byami tribe in New Guinea
133000	136000	where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images
136000	139000	of themselves for the first time and described the results.
139000	142000	They were paralyzed after their first startled response
142000	144000	covering their mouths and ducking their heads.
144000	147000	They stood transfixed, staring at their images,
147000	149000	only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.
149000	152000	So basically, they cringed at themselves.
152000	154000	Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.
154000	157000	Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice
157000	159000	when they hear a recording for the first time.
159000	162000	I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head.
162000	165000	So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh God,
165000	167000	that's how other people hear me all the time.
167000	171000	And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself
171000	173000	and the way you appear to other people.
173000	174000	That's when you cringe.
174000	176000	The feeling Dahl describes as,
176000	179000	the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment,
179000	182000	an unpleasant kind of self-recognition
182000	185000	where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.
185000	187000	It's a forced moment of self-awareness,
187000	190000	and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing fact
190000	193000	that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.
193000	195000	When you're talking too loud at a wedding
195000	198000	and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,
198000	200000	you suddenly realize how you look to them.
200000	204000	Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
204000	207000	But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.
207000	212000	Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe.
212000	215000	There's no law of state or even of etiquette
215000	218000	that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak at a wedding.
218000	221000	It's something you have to intuit based on context.
221000	223000	How loud are other people speaking?
223000	226000	Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?
226000	229000	According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here,
229000	231000	the function of awkwardness is that
231000	236000	it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.
236000	241000	Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward.
241000	246000	It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.
246000	251000	And memories of your cringy moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.
251000	253000	Ten years later you'll be trying to fall asleep,
253000	256000	and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you
256000	258000	of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding.
258000	262000	You know, this stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you
262000	264000	and you'll cringe all over again.
264000	267000	That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful.
267000	269000	Because you look back and you realize,
269000	274000	damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.
274000	279000	Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?
279000	283000	Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self cringe.
283000	286000	But usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,
286000	289000	we're talking about cringing at other people.
289000	291000	Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,
291000	293000	cringepix and cringetopia,
293000	296000	host videos and images of people behaving in cringy ways.
296000	299000	For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis,
299000	301000	grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,
301000	306000	and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people.
306000	308000	Who let the dogs out?
308000	309000	Ugh.
309000	312000	Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.
312000	316000	It makes me want to crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension.
316000	319000	I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.
319000	324000	For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like that
324000	326000	because I just can't stand it.
326000	328000	In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,
328000	332000	which, sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.
332000	337000	So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?
337000	342000	Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,
342000	344000	or secondhand embarrassment.
344000	346000	Basically, it's a form of empathy.
346000	350000	When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,
350000	352000	just as if if you watched someone fall down the stairs,
352000	355000	you might wince empathetically with their pain.
355000	358000	But there's a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,
358000	360000	or at least a complication,
360000	362000	which is that in the purest examples of cringe,
362000	366000	the person doing the cringy thing isn't feeling embarrassed.
366000	368000	In fact, often they're super confident,
368000	373000	and it's actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.
373000	377000	Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself
377000	379000	as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,
379000	382000	or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy
382000	385000	when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.
385000	390000	So in the internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.
390000	392000	Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,
392000	394000	and I do feel embarrassed for her,
394000	398000	but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.
398000	401000	You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell,
401000	403000	and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.
403000	405000	Nothing about this is cringe.
405000	407000	Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.
407000	409000	Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,
409000	412000	but I don't cringe at her.
412000	416000	Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them.
416000	419000	When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her
419000	422000	in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.
422000	424000	My feelings mirror what she's feeling,
424000	426000	but when I'm cringing at someone,
426000	429000	I'm feeling something very different to what they're feeling.
429000	432000	I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here
432000	436000	because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.
436000	439000	Another example is Bad American Idol auditions,
439000	441000	which are quintessential cringe content.
441000	443000	People try out for American Idol
443000	445000	because they think they're good enough singers
445000	447000	to compete in a national competition,
447000	450000	so they're effectively revealing their own delusions
450000	452000	when they show up and sing like this.
452000	455000	Is this the real life?
455000	459000	Oh, is this just fantasy?
459000	462000	It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.
462000	464000	Most of us are bad singers, right?
464000	466000	When people sing happy birthday at a party,
466000	469000	usually they're singing in three different keys at no particular tempo.
469000	472000	But that's not cringe because the point of singing happy birthday
472000	474000	is not to sound amazing.
474000	476000	Bad American Idol auditions are cringe
476000	479000	because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.
479000	481000	Do you as good as, in your opinion,
481000	483000	the lead singer from Queen?
483000	487000	It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury
487000	490000	when, in fact, you sound like a wounded street dog.
490000	495000	I admit that watching Red,
495000	498000	I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.
498000	501000	I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do.
501000	503000	And because he's so cocky
503000	506000	and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,
506000	510000	there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.
510000	512000	There's almost a sense of karma,
512000	514000	a sense that because of his tragic hubris,
514000	518000	he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.
518000	522000	And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response
522000	525000	and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have
525000	528000	about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.
528000	531000	Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Misha,
531000	535000	who's there with her mom and they both seem like such sweethearts.
535000	537000	I do believe in her talent.
537000	538000	That's very much.
538000	541000	And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,
541000	543000	but I'm rooting for her.
543000	545000	And when she embarrasses herself,
545000	549000	I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.
549000	554000	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
554000	555000	Yikes.
555000	557000	My differing reactions to Red and Misha
557000	559000	track a distinction that Doll makes
559000	563000	between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.
563000	566000	Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification
566000	568000	with the person you're cringing at.
568000	571000	Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves in the cringe-worthy moment,
571000	574000	you still feel the embarrassment they would feel
574000	577000	or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware
577000	579000	of how other people were perceiving them.
579000	581000	Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,
581000	585000	involves an emotional distancing from the person you're cringing at.
585000	587000	Just like with compassionate cringe,
587000	590000	you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,
590000	593000	but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,
593000	596000	you feel annoyance and disgust at them
596000	598000	and maybe even a little schadenfreude.
598000	601000	So these are actually two very different emotional responses,
601000	604000	vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.
604000	606000	We call both feelings cringe,
606000	608000	not because they're similar feelings,
608000	611000	but because they're responses to the same type of situation,
611000	613000	people lacking self-awareness,
613000	615000	embarrassing themselves without realizing it.
615000	618000	Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,
619000	621000	like pretty unpleasant feelings.
621000	625000	So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel this way?
625000	628000	Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?
628000	633000	Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube?
633000	636000	Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?
636000	638000	Well, I think the answer to that question depends
638000	642000	on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.
642000	645000	When I read that Ask Reddit thread where all the people share their cringe stories,
645000	647000	I cringe compassionately.
647000	650000	That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.
650000	655000	And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them.
655000	657000	I recognize myself in them,
657000	662000	and I'm reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.
662000	666000	I'm not the only one who cringes out my past or videos of myself.
666000	668000	I'm not the only one who sometimes says,
668000	670000	you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.
670000	673000	When we collectively laugh at these situations,
673000	676000	we're bonding over our shared human frailty.
676000	679000	We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.
679000	682000	That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,
682000	687000	only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.
687000	690000	That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,
690000	693000	as beautiful and talented and badass,
693000	696000	only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves.
696000	702000	And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses.
702000	704000	It makes us feel less alone.
704000	707000	Now this is all of course assuming that we're cringing compassionately.
707000	713000	But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet does not encourage compassion.
713000	719000	And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.
719000	721000	This is the 21st century, right?
721000	724000	Pillaries and freak shows and public floggings.
724000	728000	These are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right?
728000	733000	Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people.
733000	734000	Right?
736000	738000	We've got maniacs.
738000	740000	We've got whackadoos.
740000	743000	We've got skitsos, fatties, and spurs.
743000	746000	Come see sexual deviants on display.
746000	747000	That's right, folks.
747000	750000	We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.
750000	752000	Come see the panty sniffer.
752000	755000	He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.
755000	757000	Come see the skeleton girl.
757000	759000	She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.
759000	763000	That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.
763000	765000	And I'll be your master of ceremonies.
765000	769000	Half man, half woman, all freak.
770000	773000	Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.
773000	776000	Welcome to the dark side of cringe.
776000	779000	Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.
779000	784000	And by that I mean there's whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing.
784000	791000	And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.
791000	794000	I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,
794000	800000	which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation, or SJW Cringe Compilation.
800000	801000	Remember those?
801000	803000	This is ancient history by YouTube standards,
803000	809000	but in 2016 the word cringe was most associated with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.
809000	812000	His video has followed the format of a cringe reaction video,
812000	815000	which means he would play someone else's content,
815000	818000	then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.
818000	820000	No makeup with some sweatpants.
820000	823000	Oh my god, it's so fucking bad.
823000	825000	He looks like he's gender fluid.
825000	827000	He looks like a fucking lesbian.
827000	831000	This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,
831000	836000	and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos.
836000	838000	What even is this thing?
838000	840000	It must be one of the 76 genders.
840000	843000	I didn't realize retarded was a gender.
843000	846000	Sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history.
846000	850000	Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.
850000	854000	The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity
854000	858000	by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.
858000	861000	No, this is an invitation to contempt.
861000	865000	Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.
865000	868000	You'd expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists
868000	870000	behaving in cringy ways.
870000	871000	But it isn't.
871000	874000	It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.
874000	877000	This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.
877000	878000	Is this cringe?
878000	880000	What is cringe about it?
880000	884000	Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt
884000	887000	for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.
887000	891000	But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,
891000	893000	so we don't know anything about her mental state.
893000	897000	And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.
897000	900000	If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel,
900000	904000	or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,
904000	906000	okay, maybe that would be cringe.
906000	908000	But that's not what's going on in this clip.
908000	911000	She's just existing in water.
911000	914000	What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?
914000	919000	Presumably something along the lines of, ew, fat people, gross.
919000	921000	It's literally just disgust, right?
921000	925000	Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.
925000	928000	Here's another cringe compilation, this one titled,
928000	930000	Gender-Fluid Non-Binary Cringe.
930000	935000	And we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their gender-fluid identity.
935000	943000	Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because, you know, like, gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.
943000	945000	Yeah, apparently not.
945000	949000	And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,
949000	954000	it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.
954000	958000	But despite that self-awareness, we're being invited to cringe.
958000	965000	Because, I guess being gender-fluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.
965000	968000	Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.
968000	971000	This is not real cringe, I want to say.
971000	976000	Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.
976000	980000	But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread
980000	983000	that there's really no point in objecting to it.
983000	987000	If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,
987000	994000	you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.
994000	998000	These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.
998000	1002000	They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.
1002000	1008000	I'd like to share with you a list that I put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe.
1008000	1017000	Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not like other girls girls,
1017000	1023000	fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, maggots, trans people, non-binary people,
1023000	1031000	transtrenders, queer afab ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.
1031000	1037000	Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common, and a handful of themes do jump out.
1037000	1040000	Eviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.
1040000	1044000	A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.
1044000	1047000	The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.
1047000	1050000	Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies.
1050000	1051000	Low social status.
1051000	1054000	It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.
1054000	1059000	If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.
1059000	1061000	It includes me three or four times.
1061000	1066000	I'm of course a fedora tipping queer afab ukulele playing TikTok teen.
1066000	1072000	Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe and try to be like, compassionate or whatever?
1072000	1073000	Fuck no.
1073000	1076000	The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.
1076000	1080000	Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.
1080000	1084000	Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,
1084000	1088000	and I want to explore what the rewards might be.
1088000	1091000	Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics,
1091000	1094000	where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.
1095000	1098000	At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,
1098000	1102000	you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,
1102000	1105000	a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event
1105000	1108000	and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.
1108000	1110000	It's part of patriarchy.
1110000	1112000	Part of patriarchy.
1112000	1113000	I don't know if you're noticing a theme.
1113000	1114000	Patriarchy.
1114000	1116000	I'm reading fuckface.
1116000	1117000	Mr. Entitled.
1117000	1118000	Mr. Ego.
1118000	1119000	Patriarchy fuckface.
1119000	1123000	She's one of these people who generates meme-able phrases at an amazing rate.
1123000	1125000	I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,
1125000	1128000	but I have unconventional tastes in Estasia.
1128000	1131000	Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,
1131000	1135000	reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.
1135000	1138000	Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,
1138000	1140000	the mascot of feminism,
1140000	1143000	a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,
1143000	1148000	which is highly dishonest considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.
1148000	1151000	She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.
1151000	1153000	But because of this amusing 12-minute video,
1153000	1157000	it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman
1157000	1161000	who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.
1161000	1164000	I call this strategy mascotization,
1164000	1167000	the construction of a strawman nemesis.
1167000	1170000	What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person
1170000	1174000	and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.
1174000	1176000	It's very simple, but very effective.
1176000	1178000	And it's best paired with memification.
1178000	1181000	That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,
1181000	1186000	you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.
1186000	1188000	Then, through mascotization,
1188000	1192000	you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.
1192000	1196000	Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester...
1196000	1198000	You're fucking a white male!
1198000	1200000	...memified as AIDS and Skrillex,
1200000	1201000	and this protester...
1201000	1203000	Take the hatred of the devil!
1203000	1205000	Take the hatred of the devil!
1205000	1207000	...who was memified as Trigley Puff.
1207000	1211000	The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta new male cuckoldry
1211000	1215000	and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.
1215000	1219000	I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,
1219000	1223000	about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.
1223000	1225000	Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,
1225000	1229000	as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb tier casual,
1229000	1232000	throwing up a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.
1232000	1235000	But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,
1235000	1238000	this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,
1238000	1242000	threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss.
1242000	1247000	Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective,
1247000	1250000	though it comes at the risk of backfiring
1250000	1253000	by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,
1253000	1255000	a little too badass.
1255000	1258000	But the subtler's strategy of symbolizing your political enemies,
1258000	1262000	not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,
1262000	1266000	works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way.
1266000	1271000	Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.
1271000	1273000	And if someone has been made a laughingstock,
1273000	1277000	it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing
1277000	1280000	than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.
1280000	1283000	To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.
1283000	1286000	And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,
1286000	1290000	I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content
1290000	1295000	is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.
1295000	1299000	When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,
1299000	1301000	laughing at someone and ridiculing them,
1301000	1304000	we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.
1304000	1308000	Don't act like that or people will laugh at you.
1308000	1312000	This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.
1312000	1316000	It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.
1316000	1319000	You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,
1319000	1321000	at the whipping post.
1321000	1324000	You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables
1324000	1326000	and it sends a powerful message.
1326000	1328000	Don't do whatever that guy did.
1328000	1331000	I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact
1331000	1336000	that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.
1336000	1339000	There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.
1339000	1343000	But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.
1343000	1346000	There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriend's nudes.
1346000	1350000	There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone
1350000	1352000	for alleged breaches of wokeness.
1352000	1354000	Public humiliation is a powerful force,
1354000	1358000	and it's usually, uh, it's not a good force.
1358000	1360000	But there are some rare exceptions.
1360000	1362000	Back in the Gamergate era,
1362000	1365000	Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,
1365000	1367000	slut-shaming on a massive online scale,
1367000	1371000	YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.
1371000	1374000	As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks
1374000	1377000	and there was a network of besieged feminists of loggers
1377000	1379000	who were constantly mobbed and harassed.
1379000	1383000	What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere
1383000	1387000	from the pro-Gamergate days to the left tube world of today
1387000	1392000	was a handful of videos uploaded by then obscure YouTuber Harry Brewess
1392000	1396000	in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Orini.
1396000	1398000	Come on, Davis, we have to...
1398000	1400000	No, stop lecturing me about ethics. We have to get it out of here.
1400000	1403000	And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?
1403000	1407000	In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women
1407000	1409000	while posing in front of a toy skull
1409000	1412000	and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.
1414000	1417000	Men of the West, women in our culture,
1417000	1421000	have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.
1421000	1424000	And so in discussing sluts versus whores,
1424000	1430000	I would start with the premise that all women are whores.
1433000	1437000	.
1437000	1440000	Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views
1440000	1444000	and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience
1444000	1447000	who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.
1447000	1452000	Why did these videos work with this audience where so many others didn't?
1452000	1456000	Well, I think it's because Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis
1456000	1459000	for being problematic or misogynistic.
1459000	1462000	Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact
1462000	1465000	that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.
1465000	1469000	And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.
1469000	1473000	He had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw
1473000	1476000	through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day,
1476000	1479000	profoundly dark philosopher by night.
1479000	1482000	We exist in a world with feminized legislation.
1482000	1485000	I've spoken to men and boys who have told me
1485000	1489000	that Harry's videos inspired the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.
1489000	1492000	Not just because they cringed at Davis Arini,
1492000	1497000	but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves,
1497000	1499000	and they cringed at that too.
1499000	1504000	Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person induces self-cringe,
1504000	1507000	which can motivate you to change your behavior,
1507000	1510000	your beliefs, or even your own self-concept.
1510000	1513000	And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance
1513000	1516000	of a recognizable stock character on the internet,
1516000	1518000	namely the fedora temper.
1518000	1523000	Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity,
1523000	1526000	but who's basically just a pasty nerd who can't relate to women.
1526000	1529000	Davis was such an extreme version of this,
1529000	1532000	and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently
1532000	1537000	that I would classify him as what the internet calls a lol cow.
1537000	1539000	Lol cow is old 4chan lingo.
1539000	1543000	It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior
1543000	1545000	can be milked for lols.
1545000	1549000	And milking in this context can mean simply watching a lol cow's behavior
1549000	1551000	and laughing at them,
1551000	1554000	or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them,
1554000	1557000	or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them
1557000	1560000	to get a response that you find entertaining.
1560000	1562000	I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,
1562000	1564000	or my old videos about the Golden One,
1564000	1568000	as lol cow milking content with a political angle.
1568000	1570000	It was essentially an argument from ridicule,
1570000	1572000	an argument from cringe,
1572000	1574000	with the aim of convincing people,
1574000	1576000	I'll embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,
1576000	1579000	but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,
1579000	1583000	I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,
1583000	1585000	and I wanted people to laugh.
1585000	1589000	There doesn't need to be a political agenda behind milking lol cows.
1589000	1591000	In fact, usually there isn't.
1591000	1593000	The purest example of a lol cow I can think of
1593000	1596000	is actually someone from way before the internet,
1596000	1598000	namely Florence Foster Jenkins.
1598000	1602000	Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,
1602000	1606000	was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City
1606000	1608000	during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,
1608000	1610000	due to her being such a terrible singer
1610000	1612000	that people went to her concerts,
1612000	1614000	essentially for the lols.
1614000	1617000	She was described as the world's worst opera singer.
1617000	1619000	No one, before or since,
1619000	1621000	has succeeded in liberating themselves
1621000	1625000	quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.
1625000	1628000	Behold this fucking camp queen.
1628000	1630000	Oh, we have no choice but to stand.
1630000	1632000	Here's a clip of one of the few recordings she made.
1632000	1638000	Cringe.
1638000	1640000	She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,
1640000	1643000	the William Mahone of her age.
1643000	1646000	Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence
1646000	1649000	until 1944, when she was 76 years old
1649000	1652000	and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert
1652000	1654000	to which newspaper critics showed up.
1654000	1656000	The next morning, The New York Sun reported,
1656000	1658000	Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking
1658000	1660000	in a semblance of pitch,
1660000	1663000	but the further a note was from its proper elevation,
1663000	1666000	the more the audience laughed and applauded,
1666000	1669000	and five days later, she had a heart attack and died.
1669000	1671000	I find something very touching about this story.
1671000	1673000	I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone
1673000	1675000	if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,
1675000	1678000	but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.
1678000	1682000	It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell.
1682000	1685000	At least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand.
1685000	1688000	I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a locale.
1688000	1690000	Like, yes, this is hilarious,
1690000	1692000	but on the other hand,
1692000	1694000	does not a locale bleed?
1694000	1697000	On some level, we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,
1697000	1699000	but on the other hand,
1699000	1702000	other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.
1702000	1705000	There's a good bug about this called the Joy of Pain,
1705000	1707000	Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,
1707000	1709000	by Richard Smith.
1709000	1711000	Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take
1711000	1712000	in other people's misery,
1712000	1714000	and Smith argues that we experience it
1714000	1718000	because psychologically, we gain something when other people lose.
1718000	1721000	We're constantly evaluating our own worth
1721000	1723000	by comparing ourselves to other people.
1723000	1726000	So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,
1726000	1728000	a pleasant feeling of superiority,
1728000	1731000	from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,
1731000	1734000	especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.
1734000	1736000	Maybe I'm not perfect,
1736000	1738000	but at least I'm not this locale.
1738000	1742000	And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us,
1742000	1745000	whom we envy, get brought down a peg.
1745000	1748000	James Charles' cancelled party,
1748000	1749000	LOLOL.
1749000	1752000	I think Schadenfreude basically accounts
1752000	1757000	for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.
1757000	1758000	Smith uses the word,
1758000	1761000	Humillitainment, for this type of media,
1761000	1765000	like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment.
1765000	1768000	YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,
1768000	1771000	or some kind of carnival side show.
1771000	1773000	I mean, take a look around you.
1773000	1775000	We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,
1775000	1777000	at the time I'm making this video,
1777000	1780000	remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder
1780000	1784000	and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.
1784000	1785000	We have Wings of Redemption,
1785000	1788000	a bad-tempered gamer who, for a long time,
1788000	1791000	was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression
1791000	1793000	to streaming video games all day
1793000	1796000	to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.
1796000	1797000	We have Onision,
1797000	1801000	a habitual alleged abuser of women and teenage girls,
1801000	1802000	who, earlier this year,
1802000	1806000	essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube
1806000	1809000	after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser.
1809000	1812000	I love kombucha!
1815000	1818000	Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists
1818000	1820000	access to video equipment?
1820000	1823000	What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?
1823000	1826000	And the viewers are no better than the performers.
1826000	1829000	Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.
1829000	1831000	Oh, you people love nothing more
1831000	1834000	than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs
1834000	1837000	completely lose our minds live on camera.
1837000	1838000	Is this what you want, huh?
1838000	1843000	Is this what you want to try to melt down?
1843000	1844000	You know, as a creator,
1844000	1847000	you have to be aware that you're a circus performer,
1847000	1850000	and the crowd may, in fact, be more entertained
1850000	1853000	if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.
1853000	1856000	Online media today is full of Lady Florenses,
1856000	1859000	anti-celebrities with anti-fans.
1859000	1861000	Now, to be clear,
1861000	1863000	I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
1863000	1865000	with indulging now and then
1865000	1866000	in a little bit of light contempt.
1866000	1870000	Cringing at Davis Orini or Bad American Idol auditions
1870000	1871000	seems pretty harmless,
1871000	1873000	but it can be taken too far.
1873000	1876000	And there's no better case study of taking it too far
1876000	1881000	than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.
1881000	1882000	If you don't know what's coming,
1882000	1884000	you might want to strap in Gorge,
1884000	1886000	because this is coconuts.
1886000	1887000	It's bananas.
1887000	1889000	It's a full fruit salad.
1889000	1892000	God, how do I even begin to explain this?
1892000	1895000	Well, Christine Weston Chandler,
1895000	1898000	more commonly known on the internet as Chris Chan,
1898000	1903000	is the victim of what is quite possibly
1903000	1906000	the longest-running and most obsessive
1906000	1908000	internet trolling saga of all time.
1908000	1911000	She's the lol cow of lol cows.
1911000	1912000	Hello, everybody.
1912000	1913000	It's just Christine Chandler
1913000	1915000	coming to you live from home once again.
1915000	1917000	Chandler is an autistic trans woman,
1917000	1920000	and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,
1920000	1922000	which I pause to explain,
1922000	1924000	because I don't think I've ever seen anyone
1924000	1926000	actually take her transition seriously.
1926000	1928000	Most people seem to regard it as
1928000	1930000	simply another absurd symptom
1930000	1932000	of her hilarious mental condition.
1932000	1933000	In fact, a bunch of trans people
1933000	1935000	will probably get real salty with me
1935000	1938000	for making trans people look bad
1938000	1940000	by including Chris Chan in our,
1940000	1944000	oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.
1944000	1945000	Oh, please.
1945000	1948000	Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity sweaty.
1948000	1951000	This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.
1951000	1954000	God, how did Trannies get so snobbish?
1954000	1957000	Look, is Chris Chan really trans?
1957000	1960000	I don't know, and I don't care.
1960000	1962000	If Chris Chan wants to be a woman,
1963000	1965000	I for one support her journey.
1965000	1966000	But it doesn't matter.
1966000	1969000	The relevant thing about Chris Chan is not Chris Chan.
1969000	1972000	It's the fact that for the last 13 years,
1972000	1974000	nearly every aspect of her life
1974000	1977000	has been obsessively archived online
1977000	1981000	by thousands of years known as Christorians.
1981000	1983000	Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom
1983000	1987000	several internet centuries ago back in 2007
1987000	1990000	when 4chan took notice of her comic book series,
1990000	1993000	Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid
1993000	1995000	of Sonic and Pikachu.
1995000	1997000	The comic is set in quick fill,
1997000	2000000	CWC being Chris Chan's initials.
2000000	2002000	The protagonist is a self-insert
2002000	2004000	who references Chandler's real life quote,
2004000	2008000	love quest to find a quote boyfriend free girl,
2008000	2010000	which apparently involved posting bizarre
2010000	2014000	attraction signs around her community college.
2014000	2015000	For this story to make sense,
2015000	2017000	you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified
2017000	2020000	and presented as male until 2015.
2020000	2023000	So these trolls saw her as like
2023000	2026000	the ultimate autistic incel man-child.
2026000	2028000	Just to give you a feel for this person,
2028000	2031000	here's Christine in 2018 holding up
2031000	2033000	the iconic pre-transition portrait.
2033000	2035000	Note the Sonichu medallions.
2035000	2036000	Here's the bedroom she lived in,
2036000	2038000	and here she is in recent years
2038000	2041000	giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.
2041000	2043000	Pegasister snapped.
2043000	2045000	Basically she's the entire cringe-topia sub-reddit
2045000	2047000	condensed into a single person.
2047000	2050000	So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit
2050000	2051000	because of course they did.
2051000	2053000	And they began tormenting her
2053000	2055000	by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,
2055000	2058000	posting candid photos of her, et cetera.
2058000	2060000	Chandler reacted to the trolls,
2060000	2062000	which of course encouraged some more,
2062000	2064000	and the harassment escalated and escalated.
2064000	2066000	They hacked her accounts
2066000	2068000	or tricked her into giving out passwords.
2068000	2070000	They posted all her emails online.
2070000	2072000	They showed up in person and photographed her house.
2072000	2074000	They called her parents,
2074000	2078000	posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,
2078000	2080000	in order to extract as much information
2080000	2081000	about her as possible.
2081000	2084000	And of course they contacted Chandler herself,
2084000	2086000	which was very rewarding for trolls
2086000	2088000	because she has no filter
2088000	2090000	and was very naive and trusting.
2090000	2092000	So she was very willing to divulge,
2092000	2094000	or easily manipulated into divulging,
2094000	2096000	mortifying information about herself.
2096000	2100000	Sexual, psychological, scatological.
2100000	2103000	There's not really any limits or boundaries to this.
2103000	2105000	For all the information they gathered,
2105000	2108000	the trolls created a wiki called The Quickie,
2108000	2112000	devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris Chan data.
2112000	2115000	It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,
2115000	2117000	entire articles about all numbers
2117000	2119000	of her immediate and extended family,
2119000	2122000	pages of psychiatric records she was tricked
2122000	2125000	in descending them, and that's only the beginning.
2125000	2128000	In their more grandiose moods,
2128000	2130000	the Christorians have speculated
2130000	2133000	that Chris Chan is the most documented life
2133000	2135000	in all human history,
2135000	2139000	comparing their social experiment to the Truman Show.
2139000	2141000	It's a level of obsession
2141000	2144000	that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture.
2144000	2148000	It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.
2150000	2153000	Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,
2153000	2157000	or on one occasion sex workers, to the Chandler household.
2157000	2160000	Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates
2160000	2163000	with Chris Chan, of course secretly wearing wires
2163000	2165000	to record their conversations.
2165000	2168000	Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends
2168000	2172000	so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.
2172000	2176000	These things must be archived, don't you understand?
2176000	2178000	Chris Chan must be documented.
2178000	2181000	The absolute low point came when some trolls
2181000	2186000	encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl
2186000	2189000	and to have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.
2189000	2192000	In other words, they groomed a child
2192000	2194000	to deceive an autistic person
2194000	2198000	into performing sex acts for their entertainment.
2198000	2200000	Now, to contemporary Christorians,
2200000	2204000	this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life
2204000	2205000	is frowned upon.
2205000	2207000	Not so much because it's immoral,
2207000	2210000	so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,
2210000	2212000	a bit attention-seeking.
2212000	2215000	No, to the sophisticated Christorian,
2216000	2218000	the real pleasure in all this
2218000	2221000	is supposed to lie and quietly spectating,
2221000	2224000	savoring the fine notes of cringe.
2224000	2227000	Now, I take it I don't even need to comment
2227000	2229000	on the morality of all this.
2229000	2232000	The real question to me is why?
2232000	2236000	Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession
2236000	2238000	with Christine Chandler?
2238000	2240000	And yes, it is an obsession.
2240000	2242000	Just to give you a sense of a single individual's
2242000	2244000	personal investment in this,
2244000	2246000	the YouTuber Gino Samuel,
2246000	2249000	one of very few Christorians with the audacity
2249000	2250000	to show his face,
2250000	2253000	has been working for more than two years
2253000	2257000	to produce an eventual 100 episode documentary series
2257000	2260000	about the life of Chris Chan.
2260000	2263000	Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,
2263000	2265000	and each episode is around 40 minutes long,
2265000	2269000	meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video
2269000	2273000	about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.
2273000	2275000	I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.
2275000	2278000	I'll call it morbid cringe,
2278000	2280000	defined as an obsessive and addictive,
2280000	2284000	contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.
2284000	2287000	Why does morbid cringe happen?
2287000	2289000	Well, I've spent some time pouring over
2289000	2291000	Christorians' conversations with each other,
2291000	2294000	and I've even interrogated a couple of them,
2294000	2296000	and this is what I've found.
2296000	2297000	The first thing they'll tell you
2297000	2300000	is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,
2300000	2302000	that Christine's strange life and mind
2302000	2305000	simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.
2305000	2307000	And I'm sure that's true.
2307000	2310000	But a lot of things are funny and entertaining
2310000	2312000	and morbidly interesting.
2312000	2315000	Why fixate on this particular person?
2315000	2317000	Well, for a lot of them,
2317000	2320000	it's a reassurance that there's someone out there
2320000	2322000	worse than them.
2322000	2324000	Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,
2324000	2327000	but at least this defenseless punching bag
2327000	2329000	called Chris Chan is here for them
2329000	2331000	to assert their superiority over.
2331000	2333000	It's pretty much common knowledge
2333000	2335000	that a lot of Christorians,
2335000	2337000	including some of the most vocal haters,
2337000	2339000	are autistic themselves.
2339000	2343000	And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris Chan
2343000	2346000	is that she's giving autistics a bad name.
2346000	2348000	In recent years, there's also been
2348000	2351000	a small contingent of transgender trolls
2351000	2353000	who are likewise prone to say,
2353000	2356000	he's not a real transgender like me
2356000	2359000	and he's making us all look bad.
2360000	2364000	Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris Chan,
2364000	2367000	you guys look amazing.
2367000	2371000	It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this
2371000	2374000	about why trolling Chandler is justified,
2374000	2376000	righteous even,
2376000	2379000	because at the end of the day,
2379000	2381000	trolls are people too.
2381000	2385000	And a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this,
2385000	2387000	which they suppress by insisting
2387000	2390000	that Chris Chan is a horrible person
2390000	2392000	who deserves to be tormented.
2392000	2396000	But trolls who protest too much about the evils of Chris Chan
2396000	2401000	and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this
2401000	2404000	are known in the community as A-logs.
2404000	2406000	A-log is the name of a troll
2406000	2409000	who attracted the ire of other trolls
2409000	2412000	by ranting about Chris Chan's crimes,
2412000	2414000	comparing her to Hitler,
2414000	2418000	and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.
2418000	2419000	Among the trolls,
2419000	2423000	this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them
2423000	2427000	because they want to feel like they're just cruelly
2427000	2430000	and casually toying with this person.
2430000	2433000	You know, just for laughs,
2433000	2435000	not a big deal.
2435000	2438000	This is all perfectly healthy
2438000	2441000	and normal and fine.
2441000	2443000	It's fine.
2444000	2447000	But A-log gave the lie to that illusion
2447000	2450000	because it was obvious that his Chris Chan obsession
2450000	2455000	wasn't healthy or normal or fine.
2455000	2457000	So the other trolls turned on A-log
2457000	2459000	and they made him into Chris Chan 2.0
2459000	2461000	and they uncovered his autism
2461000	2463000	and his furry porn collection
2463000	2466000	and his cringey erotic fanfiction.
2466000	2469000	So why would someone as similar to Chris Chan as A-log
2469000	2471000	obsessively hate on her?
2471000	2473000	Well, there's two explanations.
2473000	2476000	One is troll shielding.
2476000	2479000	That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris Chan
2479000	2481000	and spearheaded the trolling efforts
2481000	2485000	in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.
2485000	2488000	The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob
2488000	2491000	by waving your pitchfork the hardest.
2491000	2494000	Obviously, this did not work.
2494000	2500000	The other explanation is that A-log saw himself reflected in Chris Chan
2500000	2506000	and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her.
2506000	2510000	A-log hated Chris Chan because he saw part of himself in her.
2510000	2513000	And the other trolls hated A-log
2513000	2516000	because they saw part of themselves in him.
2516000	2517000	To quote Margaret Plus,
2517000	2520000	who covered this story for New York Magazine a few years ago,
2520000	2523000	I think it might be A-logs all the way down.
2523000	2526000	People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris Chan
2526000	2530000	because to them she's a symbol of something they hate about themselves,
2530000	2532000	something they're ashamed of.
2532000	2534000	Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum
2534000	2537000	or being a socially awkward recluse.
2537000	2539000	Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents
2539000	2543000	or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons
2543000	2546000	or embarrassing sexual proclivities
2546000	2548000	or all of the above.
2548000	2550000	This is how scapegoating works, right?
2550000	2553000	You repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame
2553000	2556000	and insecurity and self-loathing,
2556000	2559000	and you displace them onto someone else,
2559000	2562000	usually someone you can feel superior to.
2562000	2565000	Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat
2565000	2568000	transforming your painful shame and self-loathing
2568000	2572000	into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.
2572000	2574000	It's pretty safe to assume
2574000	2577000	that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls
2577000	2581000	are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris Chan.
2581000	2585000	So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris Chan
2585000	2588000	is a way of processing the shame and anxiety
2588000	2590000	of social rejection and exclusion.
2590000	2593000	And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,
2593000	2596000	who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,
2596000	2601000	contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity.
2601000	2605000	Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people
2605000	2608000	and find a way to make this all about me.
2611000	2614000	...
2614000	2617000	...
2617000	2638000	...
2638000	2640000	...
2640000	2642000	Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?
2642000	2646000	Would you like to meet my boyfriend's boyfriend?
2646000	2649000	That's right, honey. I'm giving you fujoshi realness.
2649000	2651000	He's going to stay right here as a grim reminder
2651000	2653000	of the things that you have seen.
2653000	2656000	Actually, I identify as a trap. It's very that.
2656000	2659000	I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.
2659000	2661000	Cringe is failed seriousness.
2661000	2664000	In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am
2664000	2666000	of being a transgender lesbian.
2666000	2667000	Cringe. Shame.
2667000	2670000	At the end of that video, I talk about how I sense that my shame
2670000	2673000	is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel
2673000	2675000	for a lot of other trans lesbians,
2675000	2678000	particularly those of the heck and stripey sock
2678000	2680000	nya nya catgirl variety.
2680000	2684000	But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,
2684000	2688000	guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.
2688000	2691000	I want to return to that thought and kind of psychoanalyze myself
2691000	2695000	as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession.
2695000	2700000	So, catgirl trans girls are...
2700000	2702000	Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.
2702000	2705000	They're trans women, usually attracted to women,
2705000	2708000	who express their identity online
2708000	2713000	through cloying, neotenous otaku memory.
2713000	2716000	And my conscious reason for cringing at them
2716000	2719000	is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls
2719000	2722000	as a kind of visual baby talk,
2722000	2725000	an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity
2725000	2729000	and womanhood that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.
2729000	2733000	So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.
2733000	2736000	Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.
2736000	2738000	Fuck your dreams.
2738000	2741000	Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked with a discussion
2741000	2744000	of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct.
2744000	2747000	So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.
2747000	2750000	Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.
2750000	2753000	Listen to the contempt beneath my words.
2753000	2756000	Because even if everything I'm saying is true,
2756000	2759000	catgirls are being cringe online.
2759000	2762000	Is a situation so inconsequential
2762000	2766000	that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much?
2766000	2769000	So why do I have this cringe fixation?
2769000	2772000	Well, according to the A-Log theory of morbid cringing,
2772000	2775000	we form obsessive and addictive contempt
2775000	2778000	for people who have traits in common with us,
2778000	2780000	people who make us uncomfortable
2780000	2783000	because we see something of ourselves in them.
2783000	2786000	So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?
2786000	2789000	Well, we're both trans women.
2789000	2792000	We're both attracted to women.
2792000	2797000	I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?
2797000	2799000	I like good anime that has, you know,
2799000	2802000	mature three-dimensional female characters.
2802000	2804000	Look, I'm a real transgender, okay? I'm not like you.
2804000	2806000	It's also not lost on me that this is like
2806000	2810000	the seventh time on this channel I've dressed as a catgirl
2810000	2812000	to make fun of them.
2815000	2816000	I have posted cringe.
2816000	2818000	You should all be laughing at me right now.
2818000	2820000	Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.
2820000	2822000	So I do think there's some truth to the idea
2822000	2824000	that I'm A-Log-ing these catgirls.
2824000	2827000	I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.
2827000	2830000	Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe
2830000	2833000	at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,
2833000	2835000	because of how these catgirls are acting.
2835000	2837000	So let's make another distinction between
2837000	2839000	in-group cringe and out-group cringe.
2839000	2841000	In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone
2841000	2843000	who belongs to the same group identity as you.
2843000	2846000	For example, your family, your romantic partnership,
2846000	2848000	your ethnicity, or your country,
2848000	2850000	particularly if they're embarrassing themselves
2850000	2852000	in front of outsiders to the group.
2852000	2855000	Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets
2855000	2858000	if her mom does something cringy in front of her friends.
2858000	2860000	Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get
2860000	2863000	when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump
2863000	2865000	being our president.
2865000	2866000	Or think about these phrases.
2866000	2868000	She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.
2868000	2870000	They're making trans people look bad.
2870000	2873000	He's giving autistics a bad name.
2873000	2876000	When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,
2876000	2878000	we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment.
2878000	2882000	We feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior
2882000	2884000	makes us look bad too.
2884000	2887000	So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,
2887000	2890000	because you're cringing at your membership
2890000	2892000	in an embarrassing group.
2892000	2895000	Nothing has ever triggered this kind of in-group embarrassment
2895000	2898000	more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year,
2898000	2901000	in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum
2901000	2904000	over being misgendered in a GameStop.
2904000	2906000	You're making my fucking money back.
2906000	2908000	Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.
2908000	2910000	Excuse me, it's ma'am.
2910000	2912000	It is ma'am.
2912000	2915000	This video is excruciating for me to watch.
2915000	2917000	Motherfucker, take it outside.
2917000	2918000	If you want to call me, sir, again,
2918000	2920000	I will show you a fucking sir.
2920000	2923000	Motherfucker.
2923000	2928000	The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people
2928000	2930000	into seeing you as a woman.
2930000	2932000	Ooh!
2932000	2933000	Ooh!
2933000	2935000	Now, Twitter's going to come for me over this
2935000	2937000	and say, Natalie hates trans women, you don't pass.
2937000	2940000	But passing is really not what this is about.
2940000	2945000	It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior
2945000	2948000	from a trans woman, accompanied by, apparently,
2948000	2951000	a total delusion about how she's presenting.
2951000	2953000	Well, I'm going to ask you for the fifth time
2953000	2956000	to stop calling me a man, because quite clearly, I am not.
2956000	2958000	It's really not that clear, Gorge.
2958000	2961000	And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?
2961000	2965000	The incongruity between her thinking that she's serving women
2965000	2968000	while bellowing like a drill sergeant.
2968000	2970000	By the way, what I'm doing right now,
2970000	2972000	this is cringe reaction content.
2972000	2974000	I don't really do that on this channel,
2974000	2976000	but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.
2976000	2979000	And it feels good, like, intoxicatingly good.
2979000	2981000	I can see how you could get addicted to this.
2981000	2985000	I'm imagining myself right now, surrounded by cis people,
2985000	2987000	and I am leading the righteous mob
2987000	2992000	as we point and laugh at some delusional, manly dump truck.
2992000	2997000	I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender.
2997000	2999000	Father, find the bruise of me.
2999000	3002000	Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.
3002000	3004000	Jot that down in my progress notes, please, Doctor.
3004000	3006000	Okay, so why does this feel so good?
3006000	3008000	Well, let me talk you through my feelings.
3008000	3010000	When I watched that GameStop video,
3010000	3012000	for the first few seconds,
3012000	3014000	I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.
3014000	3015000	I can even relate,
3015000	3017000	because in the first couple months of my transition,
3017000	3019000	there was an occasion
3019000	3022000	where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction
3022000	3026000	where the guy at the desk was calling me Sir the entire time.
3026000	3028000	And there's something very humiliating
3028000	3030000	about trying to present female,
3030000	3032000	like wearing a dress and makeup,
3032000	3034000	and yet being called Sir.
3034000	3037000	It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept
3037000	3039000	and the way other people are seeing you.
3039000	3041000	And the memory of it is painful to me,
3041000	3044000	but what I cling to is that,
3044000	3046000	while I may have looked like a man,
3046000	3048000	at least I didn't act like a man.
3048000	3051000	I didn't threaten to take anyone outside
3051000	3053000	and show them a Sir.
3053000	3056000	In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.
3056000	3058000	So as the GameStop video progresses,
3058000	3060000	my sympathy runs out fast.
3060000	3062000	And instead of compassionate cringe,
3062000	3064000	I feel group embarrassment for trans women,
3064000	3065000	including myself.
3065000	3069000	And I feel contempt toward this individual
3069000	3070000	for making us all look bad.
3070000	3075000	I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.
3075000	3077000	What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?
3077000	3079000	I don't look and sound like that, do I?
3079000	3081000	I feel like I have to do a sanity check.
3081000	3083000	I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,
3083000	3086000	listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.
3086000	3089000	And that fear motivates me to distance myself
3089000	3091000	from that person in the video.
3091000	3092000	I don't feel compassion for her,
3092000	3094000	because that would mean putting myself
3094000	3096000	in her size 16 shoes.
3096000	3097000	And I don't want to do that,
3097000	3099000	because I'm horrified and repulsed
3099000	3102000	by the thought that I'm like her in some way.
3102000	3103000	So I want to push away,
3103000	3106000	and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.
3106000	3108000	And if I express that contempt
3108000	3110000	by publicly shaming and condemning her,
3110000	3113000	then I'm also socially distancing myself.
3113000	3115000	Accidental COVID jokes.
3115000	3118000	Oops, I guess it's contagious.
3119000	3121000	I think many people who are stigmatized
3121000	3125000	or who have been humiliated long for the experience
3125000	3128000	of being a normal surrounded by fellow normals
3128000	3131000	judging and humiliating a freak.
3131000	3133000	And if you take a look around trans YouTube,
3133000	3136000	a lot of the biggest creators in the platform
3136000	3138000	have channels basically devoted
3138000	3142000	to exactly this type of cringe reaction humilitainment.
3142000	3144000	The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy
3144000	3146000	who's best known for what are essentially
3146000	3147000	cringe reaction videos.
3147000	3151000	Mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.
3151000	3153000	That is, people who claim to be trans
3153000	3156000	but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.
3156000	3159000	He's especially bothered by girly, afab,
3159000	3161000	trans and non-binary teenagers
3161000	3163000	or by anyone who blurs the line
3163000	3166000	between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.
3166000	3168000	Sometimes he'll do a long form reaction
3168000	3170000	to a specific person who grinds his gears.
3170000	3173000	So this person is an asexual,
3173000	3177000	non-binary, transgender, lesbian,
3177000	3181000	who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.
3181000	3185000	According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.
3185000	3187000	In other times, he'll basically just laugh
3187000	3190000	at cringy trans TikTok teens.
3190000	3194000	No, no, I'm turning off the video.
3194000	3195000	I can't watch this.
3195000	3198000	He has a couple justifications for making these videos.
3198000	3200000	One is that he's actually helping the people
3200000	3202000	he's cringing at because of a trend or transitions
3202000	3205000	then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.
3205000	3208000	But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people
3208000	3211000	really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?
3211000	3213000	His other justification is that trans-trenders
3213000	3216000	are giving real trans people a bad name.
3216000	3218000	They're the reason people are transphobic.
3218000	3220000	This is why they hate us.
3220000	3222000	It's because of the trenders.
3222000	3225000	Wow, I love that idea of a true scum furry.
3225000	3227000	Isn't that just wonderful?
3227000	3229000	A true scum furry.
3229000	3231000	But it's not though.
3231000	3234000	I mean, transphobia existed long before there were people
3234000	3237000	you could plausibly describe as trans-trenders.
3237000	3239000	So trans-trenders aren't the reason society
3239000	3241000	hates trans people, Calvin.
3241000	3243000	They're the reason you hate trans people, right?
3243000	3244000	Or at least the trans community.
3244000	3246000	And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting
3246000	3248000	that feeling onto society at large and you're saying,
3248000	3251000	oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.
3251000	3254000	And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.
3254000	3257000	Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,
3257000	3260000	it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes.
3260000	3264000	Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes.
3264000	3268000	But now they're used by trans people trying to distance themselves,
3268000	3271000	trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people in the community
3271000	3273000	under the label of trans-trenders.
3273000	3276000	And Calvin, there may be some truth to what you're saying
3276000	3279000	about their being confused teenagers who think they're trans when they're not.
3279000	3280000	I mean, I wouldn't know.
3280000	3282000	I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life
3282000	3283000	and I don't hang out with teenagers.
3283000	3285000	But even if it is true, Calvin,
3285000	3288000	your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.
3288000	3292000	Like you return to this topic to cringe again and again
3292000	3294000	and again and again and again and again.
3294000	3296000	It's like you're picking at a wound.
3296000	3298000	It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.
3298000	3302000	And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.
3302000	3304000	This could be me projecting, of course,
3304000	3308000	but I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparkle gender afabs
3308000	3313000	is similar to the way I feel about otaku, transbian, cat girls.
3313000	3315000	And it might be worth considering that
3315000	3318000	I don't cringe at the sparkle genders the way you do.
3318000	3323000	I mean, I'm with you on wondering what a he-they-seer, gender-flux, lesbian, demi-boy is.
3323000	3327000	But unlike you, Calvin, I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession
3327000	3329000	with feminine afab trans people.
3329000	3332000	They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care.
3332000	3336000	I may not always understand it, but I support their journey.
3336000	3340000	I guess it doesn't bother me because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me
3340000	3341000	because of how they behave.
3341000	3343000	I don't feel in-group cringe.
3343000	3344000	Now, it's a different story.
3344000	3346000	If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit,
3346000	3348000	and I see a comment like,
3348000	3350000	pre-transition trans lesbian here,
3350000	3352000	I wish I had titties.
3352000	3354000	Girl dick, nya nya.
3354000	3355000	Get the fuck out of here, Lily.
3355000	3358000	You're giving real trans lesbians a bad name.
3358000	3359000	This is why they hate us.
3359000	3362000	See, now I have strong feelings.
3362000	3364000	Now I'm in-group cringing.
3364000	3368000	And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct to some extent.
3368000	3371000	Like, I don't think a general lesbian community
3371000	3374000	is the appropriate forum for a trans woman
3374000	3376000	who's effectively still living as a man
3376000	3379000	to take the mic and whine about wanting titties
3379000	3382000	or rhapsodize about girl dick.
3382000	3385000	But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this
3385000	3389000	because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.
3389000	3391000	And honestly, my own self-loathing.
3391000	3395000	Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps
3395000	3399000	because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women.
3399000	3400000	That's where my head is at.
3400000	3405000	So where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity?
3405000	3408000	You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe about an identity,
3408000	3412000	trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point
3412000	3415000	of insecurity and embarrassment and shame.
3415000	3419000	So Calvin, maybe, and again I could just be projecting,
3419000	3423000	but maybe that's kind of like how you feel about these trenders.
3423000	3426000	When you make these videos condemning them as not really trans,
3426000	3429000	aren't you essentially exiling them from the in-group
3429000	3432000	so you no longer feel the pain of in-group cringe?
3432000	3435000	Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,
3435000	3440000	what you're really trying to destroy is the trender within.
3441000	3443000	And again, I could be full of shit here.
3443000	3448000	At the end of the day, this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.
3448000	3450000	So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.
3450000	3454000	But still, I guess I invite you to consider
3454000	3457000	whether producing trans-trender human attainment
3457000	3459000	is actually helping anything,
3459000	3462000	or whether it's really just an addictive way
3462000	3465000	to scratch some kind of emotional itch.
3465000	3467000	All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.
3467000	3469000	Who's next?
3469000	3472000	Oh, how about Vanessa?
3472000	3473000	We meet again, Gorge.
3473000	3477000	And once again, I'm wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hair piece.
3477000	3482000	Vanessa is a trans woman who is the second most popular political trans YouTuber.
3482000	3486000	At least that's what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her
3486000	3488000	and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it.
3488000	3492000	But since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.
3492000	3493000	Good for her.
3493000	3496000	Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel
3496000	3498000	back when SJW Cringe was fashionable.
3498000	3501000	She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,
3501000	3502000	but the most consistent theme was
3502000	3507000	trans-trenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.
3507000	3508000	They're making us look bad.
3508000	3510000	This is why people hate us.
3510000	3514000	So what we can now recognize as a standard in-group cringe fixation.
3514000	3522000	But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.
3522000	3525000	And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her
3525000	3528000	where she made a point of misgendering Riley
3528000	3531000	and dismissing her as a fake transgender
3531000	3536000	who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.
3536000	3538000	You know, if you went on estrogen,
3538000	3540000	your sex drive wouldn't be so high
3540000	3543000	and you wouldn't be guilt tripping people and having sex with you.
3543000	3544000	Just saying.
3544000	3550000	But then Riley made a video revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year
3550000	3553000	and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.
3553000	3556000	This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video
3556000	3560000	where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition,
3560000	3565000	but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video
3565000	3568000	and opened up about having experienced herself,
3568000	3570000	the cruelty she directed at Riley.
3570000	3574000	And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online.
3574000	3578000	There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it
3578000	3582000	of people trying to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that
3582000	3585000	or, you know, digging up my old pictures.
3585000	3587000	And so the thought that this entire time
3587000	3591000	I've done that exact same thing to someone else
3591000	3593000	and pushed that off on someone else
3593000	3595000	fucks with me.
3595000	3597000	And I'm fucking sorry.
3597000	3601000	Vanessa actually managed for one fleeting moment
3601000	3605000	to make a connection between her own past, her and drama
3605000	3607000	and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,
3607000	3610000	which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event
3610000	3614000	on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths
3614000	3617000	who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child
3617000	3622000	and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery like a glutton
3622000	3626000	gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.
3626000	3629000	You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that
3629000	3634000	I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy.
3634000	3637000	However, this lesson would not last.
3637000	3643000	Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe,
3643000	3648000	making a video with big red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019.
3648000	3652000	I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance.
3652000	3655000	But once again, I underestimated Vanessa.
3655000	3660000	In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success
3660000	3662000	when she released a video titled,
3662000	3666000	Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.
3666000	3670000	In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,
3670000	3676000	or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman called Jessica Yaniv.
3676000	3679000	Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?
3679000	3682000	Well, as far as I can tell,
3682000	3686000	everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.
3686000	3689000	Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal
3689000	3694000	to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls
3694000	3697000	after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way.
3697000	3703000	She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.
3703000	3709000	And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unshaperoned children.
3709000	3715000	Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality
3715000	3718000	to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.
3718000	3723000	And my read on Yaniv, by the way, is not that she's a cunning manipulator,
3723000	3728000	but that this is someone who is mentally not playing with a full deck.
3728000	3733000	After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv
3733000	3737000	rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,
3737000	3742000	exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.
3742000	3747000	And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.
3747000	3750000	At least now she's finally picking on someone who deserves it.
3750000	3754000	But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.
3754000	3757000	One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story
3757000	3761000	and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures
3761000	3764000	as an indictment of trans activists,
3764000	3771000	who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators.
3771000	3777000	And I'm willing to admit there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.
3777000	3782000	Like some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts
3782000	3787000	that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small
3787000	3792000	but real subset of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.
3792000	3798000	But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it's urgent breaking news.
3798000	3804000	Like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.
3804000	3808000	But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?
3808000	3813000	There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year.
3813000	3818000	The literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself.
3818000	3822000	Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?
3822000	3827000	I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans identified predator, a tip,
3827000	3833000	we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.
3833000	3836000	Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.
3836000	3839000	And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.
3839000	3843000	Like initially the LGBT website, Pink News,
3843000	3846000	straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,
3846000	3850000	which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics.
3850000	3858000	But I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender crowd is really the best optics for us either.
3858000	3861000	Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?
3861000	3866000	Is it simply because she cares deeply about the well-being of children
3866000	3872000	and she thought making a video exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?
3872000	3876000	I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,
3876000	3880000	but it's still a YouTube video and you have to ask,
3880000	3884000	is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?
3884000	3889000	Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?
3889000	3892000	Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,
3892000	3900000	Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.
3900000	3902000	This got two million views.
3902000	3907000	Is this what you do with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?
3907000	3913000	You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel?
3913000	3915000	What's to debate?
3915000	3918000	I don't need to be scared of my own house that I'm going to get fucking attacked.
3919000	3922000	Which is illegal in Canada, just saying.
3922000	3926000	But do you think that was like cute?
3926000	3928000	Was that a moment for you?
3928000	3935000	Then of course you sell t-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate.
3935000	3937000	I mean, that makes sense.
3937000	3941000	If you're going to catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.
3941000	3945000	And of course you gotta follow the pedophile's makeup tutorial.
3945000	3947000	You know.
3947000	3949000	For the children.
3949000	3953000	Now, I hate to be overly critical, but when I look at this,
3953000	3960000	I don't see a high-minded activist working to protect children in trans people's image.
3960000	3969000	I see a tabloid entertainer who's discovered a way to monetize milking lulz from a mentally defective pervert.
3969000	3973000	And I have to say Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,
3973000	3976000	I'm very entertained by all of this.
3976000	3979000	Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?
3979000	3981000	That's genius.
3981000	3983000	I wish I'd thought of that.
3983000	3985000	But just be honest.
3985000	3987000	This isn't activism.
3987000	3989000	This isn't justice.
3989000	3991000	It's a lol cow cult.
3991000	3994000	It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show.
3994000	3996000	And I love that for her.
3996000	3998000	I love that for her.
3998000	4005000	But Blair, I can't help but notice you're still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit.
4005000	4007000	Attention everyone.
4007000	4010000	There is a bad transgender in our midst.
4010000	4015000	The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.
4015000	4023000	It's very important that we all gather around to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender.
4023000	4025000	And Blair, I'll give you this.
4025000	4027000	You are getting better at choosing your targets.
4027000	4031000	The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture,
4031000	4035000	and Jessica Yaniv is good casting for the part.
4035000	4038000	She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,
4038000	4040000	and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.
4040000	4043000	But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously
4043000	4049000	as anything more than a smarter version of the same in-group cringe-humillatainment you've always made.
4049000	4055000	And by the way, you may want to check in on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.
4055000	4061000	Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called Trans Stupid.
4061000	4065000	Hi everyone, and welcome to another edition of Trans Stupid,
4065000	4072000	the show where I take a look at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news because stupidity is intersectional.
4072000	4080000	Transgender, more like trans retarded, more like trans gay.
4080000	4083000	Trans gay? I love that.
4084000	4086000	I just realized I'm literally trans gay.
4086000	4092000	Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism,
4092000	4097000	which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation.
4097000	4103000	But in practice, well, let's just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary
4103000	4106000	about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.
4106000	4109000	There is a bad transgender in our midst.
4109000	4113000	The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.
4113000	4115000	I'm getting pretty tired of this.
4115000	4119000	And here's her transition advice to trans women just beginning their journey.
4119000	4125000	You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.
4125000	4127000	Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.
4127000	4130000	Like, look at this seal. Isn't this seal adorable?
4130000	4132000	You're so cute.
4132000	4136000	But the truth is, you're probably not looking like this seal right now, are you?
4136000	4143000	You're probably more like this big bull seal barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,
4143000	4146000	this is a woman's body.
4146000	4150000	Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.
4150000	4153000	In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.
4153000	4158000	Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her.
4158000	4162000	She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,
4162000	4165000	which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.
4165000	4169000	Would I be wrong to say I'm getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?
4169000	4173000	In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and wrongdoings,
4173000	4181000	but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.
4181000	4187000	The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone who you can smell just by looking at a picture of them.
4187000	4193000	I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv.
4194000	4198000	I do not support her journey. As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit.
4198000	4201000	And maybe she does. I wouldn't be surprised.
4201000	4208000	No, my point is that part of the catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content
4208000	4214000	comes from contrasting themselves as good, presentable, real trans people
4214000	4219000	with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.
4219000	4224000	A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.
4224000	4229000	On one half, Vanessa looking fish, looking cunt.
4234000	4237000	Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.
4237000	4244000	And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.
4245000	4250000	And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.
4250000	4253000	I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.
4253000	4259000	Look, I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven't heard of it, called inner beauty.
4259000	4263000	That's right, sweetie. My pancreas, unclockable.
4265000	4270000	Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon.
4271000	4278000	Okay, straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune and the titanic tranner of Canada.
4278000	4282000	A particular titanic tranner of Canada, the titanic tranner of Canada.
4282000	4288000	Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender that I associate with 4chan.
4288000	4291000	Or I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.
4293000	4296000	As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness.
4297000	4301000	Well, I'm guessing that must be another important part of stopping a predator, right?
4301000	4310000	It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love, in a way, is needed.
4310000	4314000	Because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned.
4314000	4317000	And Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.
4317000	4324000	Like, I looked bad. Like, I was overweight. I had no poor taste in clothes.
4324000	4328000	Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.
4349000	4353000	Rose, are you okay? No, you're not okay.
4353000	4359000	None of us are okay. No trans woman, remotely in the public eye, is in any way okay.
4359000	4362000	And look, I don't want to take this psychoanalysis too far.
4362000	4366000	Because I don't know from watching YouTube videos what's going on in someone's head.
4366000	4369000	But I can try to make intelligent inferences.
4369000	4375000	And I think it's pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv.
4375000	4382000	I think, well, one of the biggest characters in the whole fucking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv.
4383000	4394000	Rose? Gorge? Jessica Yaniv is not one of the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.
4394000	4396000	This is not a world historical figure.
4396000	4402000	At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver, B.C.
4402000	4407000	The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator
4407000	4411000	and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.
4411000	4414000	She is not one of the most important characters in the world.
4414000	4419000	But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the most important characters in your brain.
4419000	4424000	This is distorted thinking. It's like A-Log comparing Chris Chan to Hitler.
4424000	4428000	You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you've lost perspective.
4428000	4434000	And I'm sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons why you're devoting so much attention to this.
4434000	4438000	And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm sure that's a factor too.
4438000	4442000	But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one.
4442000	4448000	And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet is more difficult than most people can imagine.
4448000	4454000	And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives.
4454000	4461000	And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies and turfs have said about us
4462000	4470000	and to repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.
4470000	4473000	Oh, it feels good to be the turf for once.
4473000	4476000	It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.
4476000	4482000	Because when you point the finger at someone else, you're also pointing away from yourself.
4482000	4489000	And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default.
4489000	4494000	So there's safety in being the one who spearheads the think of the children type moral crusade.
4494000	4506000	And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and stigma we all feel.
4506000	4511000	Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us, but that's just not true.
4511000	4515000	It's a simple answer to a complicated problem. It's scapegoating.
4515000	4526000	When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.
4526000	4530000	It's basically a blood sacrifice. It's not rational.
4530000	4534000	It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.
4534000	4537000	It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.
4537000	4551000	And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed.
4551000	4559000	But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you're just going to find a new scapegoat to take her place.
4559000	4561000	And the shame cycle continues.
4561000	4565000	The humiliation and bullying we've experienced is internalized as shame.
4565000	4571000	When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt.
4571000	4576000	And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle.
4576000	4586000	So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shame dumps, new lolcows, and you can end up like one of the people who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years.
4586000	4588000	But that will never really heal us.
4588000	4590000	God, how do I get out of this video?
4590000	4594000	I'm trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some sort of cat girl degenerate.
4594000	4595000	Cringe.
4595000	4597000	Shame I machined.
4597000	4599000	Don't look at me.
4599000	4603000	You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.
4603000	4606000	Thank you. Yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.
4606000	4609000	All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.
4609000	4614000	The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt.
4614000	4618000	You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.
4618000	4621000	When you're embarrassed for someone else, we call that vicarious embarrassment.
4621000	4628000	And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I've argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe.
4628000	4635000	Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn't embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we're cringing at them.
4635000	4644000	Now if someone who's part of your in-group is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the in-group that includes you, you feel in-group cringe,
4644000	4648000	which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe.
4649000	4656000	And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they're traits you have contempt for in yourself,
4656000	4661000	can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lol cow,
4661000	4669000	that addiction to contempt you is gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.
4669000	4674000	Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.
4674000	4680000	And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose.
4680000	4684000	It helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do.
4684000	4688000	And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories can be cathartic.
4688000	4692000	It can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone.
4692000	4695000	I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy.
4695000	4700000	It shows yourself aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think.
4700000	4706000	You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves, and let's just say they're not my kind of people.
4706000	4711000	They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves, regardless of how they're actually coming across.
4711000	4716000	But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I've overcompensated.
4716000	4720000	And I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people.
4720000	4727000	It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself, and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.
4727000	4734000	And when I take a look around the internet, like I've done in this video, I find that I'm not alone in this situation.
4734000	4737000	And it's not cute. So how do we cringe less?
4737000	4742000	Well, the cliche solution is self-love, which our culture plays a lot of value on.
4742000	4744000	Self-love and self-esteem.
4744000	4747000	You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.
4747000	4752000	I'm a bad bitch. I look like a supermodel. I'm a genius.
4752000	4757000	We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way, but it doesn't work because it's not realistic.
4757000	4760000	You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.
4760000	4767000	And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls the self-esteem tower of terror.
4767000	4771000	You go from self-love to self-hate, but self-hate is also a distortion.
4771000	4774000	Recently, I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview.
4774000	4776000	Yeah, I know, cringe.
4776000	4778000	And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.
4778000	4781000	There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.
4782000	4784000	How dare you notice that?
4784000	4786000	I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
4786000	4793000	But it's true. Time spent cringing at yourself is still time spent obsessing over yourself.
4793000	4799000	And it's hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature.
4799000	4803000	But we can still learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us.
4803000	4804000	I mean, I've heard rumors.
4804000	4813000	In that book we started with, Cringeworthy, Melissa Doll advocates not self-love or self-hate, but what she calls self-indifference.
4813000	4821000	She says, self-indifference is the relief of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.
4821000	4826000	So yeah, I was pretty cringy in the past, and I'm still pretty cringy now.
4826000	4830000	But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringy too.
4830000	4833000	And the world's probably going to burn down in 50 years anyway.
4833000	4840000	So I don't know if I would call this good news, but if it's any consolation, nothing matters.
4840000	4848000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4848000	4854000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4854000	4862000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4884000	4890000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4914000	4920000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4944000	4950000	Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
4974000	4980000	Nothing matters.
