0	16720	Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush
16720	22720	aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson
22720	30160	is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile,
30800	34320	and I will not stop until I reach the gates of hell.
37120	44240	You know what, America? Things have not gone well. We're having a hard time. We are. Between the
44240	50400	plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of
50480	56960	fascism, the criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease
56960	62160	that has killed 200,000 people and counting, of course there's going to be some trumpet in
62160	69840	the comments saying, it's not that big a deal. Calm down. People die all the time.
69840	71280	Funny, that's not what she said about.
72880	78640	Godly. We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness. And unfortunately,
78640	85360	Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job. I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being
85360	89840	more vocal about it when I had the chance. So this time, I'm going to say something,
89840	95760	because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden
95760	100160	is the single most important thing any American can do right now. So allow me to make my case,
100160	106080	Gorge. By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're
106080	113200	firing off hot takes as we speak. Typical T-Thot normie radlib endorses the electoral farce.
113200	118160	Is this your leftist queen of YouTube? Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain
118160	124720	about cancel culture than revolt against the neoliberal status quo. Tabby-chan, tabby-chan.
124720	129200	You know what, Tabitha? For once, I'm actually going to take the bait. So this will be a
129200	135680	conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain. I'm making this video
135680	142720	because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so disillusioned with the system that they
142720	147520	intend not to vote in this election. And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but
147520	152720	that's fine. Maybe I can whenever the Russian bot vote. So I really do understand the perspective
152720	157840	that Biden is not worth voting for, because that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.
157840	162720	But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.
162720	166640	Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children. There's probably asbestos in that tile,
166640	171680	because America's so great even the floor is made of poison. Okay, Tabby-chan, give me your worst.
171680	177280	I want free health care, student debt cancelled, and worker ownership of the means of production.
177280	181520	Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change
181520	187200	things. We'll listen, Tabby-chan. None of us want to vote for Joe Biden. I don't want to vote for Joe
187200	193040	Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom. But sometimes, a situation gets so toxic and so
193040	198400	dangerous, well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty. And in this election, I consider a
198400	205280	vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump. You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily
205280	211360	the same as supporting the politician. I don't think anyone should stan Joe Biden. I'm not asking
211440	217520	you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans. Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.
217520	224800	The president has a big stick. To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the
224800	230480	likely consequences of each candidate winning. It's not hero worship. It's not choosing a person
230480	237600	to have a beer with. It's strategy. Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump. The Dems are just
237600	242720	Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility. Well, I agree
242720	248320	that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's no difference
248320	252800	between them and the Republicans. I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real
252800	258240	difference between Trump and Hillary, but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would
258240	263200	not have done. Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion of an addict, withdrawing
263200	267520	from the Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting
267520	271840	to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the
271840	276160	integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling white
276160	281680	nationalist militias very fine people, and telling them to stand by, aspiring to be an autocratic
281680	286080	dictator, and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in the name
286080	291360	of delusional macho bostering. So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make
291360	296640	a real difference if they're in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're, you know,
296720	306560	a woman or LGBTQ or, you know, a human who lives on the planet Earth. So Biden will give us rainbow
306560	311280	capitalism in streets named after Black Lives Matter, but he'll do nothing to bring about
311280	317360	systemic change. Well, Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that. I fully expect
317360	322160	to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for. So you sit
322240	326720	here vote shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?
326720	332880	You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote. Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan. Look,
332880	337120	I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade. Why is it that when you tell people on
337120	342000	the left to vote, they think you're saying quit your job, abandon your family, retreat from society,
342000	347120	and fall into a deep slumber from which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib
347120	352000	before fleeing into the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch
352000	358240	temple awaiting the return of bales above? Voting doesn't take that long. At most, it takes one day.
358240	362800	You can vote and do other things also. I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman
362800	369360	with the we'd be a brunch sign. And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI-style
369360	374320	armchair with a pair of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now. Could you be any
374320	379760	bougier? Don't call me bougie. I'm beyond bougie. When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie,
379760	386400	I scoff at them openly. I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my
386400	391680	fiefdom. You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine. Why should I
391680	396560	listen to what you say? Oh, you shouldn't. I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly. But also,
396560	401120	I am a degenerate class traitor and, in my opinion, influencers should be the first against the wall.
401120	405520	Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with. You at least have to admire
405520	410320	that about us libs. We have a remarkable willingness to have played conversations with
410320	414720	people who are trying to kill us. Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan,
414720	422880	but what is your plan, Tabitha? Uh, protest? Unionize? Mutual aid? Strikes? So I totally agree.
422880	428160	Those are all good things to do. I've gone to protests myself this year. I've given to a mutual
428160	431920	aid group. You know, you're right that voting won't fix all their problems, and it's good to
431920	436320	get involved in local things like that. But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?
436320	440720	And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus. So, in addition to whatever else
440720	446640	you're doing, vote. Why participate in the charade of a farcical election? America is
446640	454240	not democratic. It's a rigged two-party corporatocracy. Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot
454240	459840	wrong with our elections. Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering,
459840	465840	voter suppression, DC being disenfranchised. All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't
465840	471600	think that in this moment, leftists boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.
471600	477280	Okay, by voting as for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit. Ew. Okay, yeah, it's true
477280	481840	that voting is not cool. It's boring. It's incrementalist. It doesn't make you feel like
481840	485920	you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents. But, you know, you could always vote in
485920	490640	secret and then maintain your radical image around your friends. Isn't being involved in
490640	496640	politics inherently not cool? Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things,
496640	501680	people who place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool. I feel
501680	506960	like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing. It's
506960	512400	showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all the bullshit,
512400	518240	the corrupt system, the electoral farce. But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting
518240	522960	and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.
522960	527680	And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing
527680	531680	are no different from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.
531680	536320	Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.
536320	540880	Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses? This ends in violence
540880	546160	either way, so he may as well smash. Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.
546160	552400	But if there's a decisive Biden victory and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare scenario,
552400	557280	then I think the military will force Trump to leave. Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are
557280	562240	tough. The president is a fascist. I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising
562240	567440	than it's ever been in my life. But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies. And for a
567440	573840	lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting democracy itself,
574560	579440	that would legitimize smashing. So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.
579440	584400	But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world. The whole system is broken,
584400	589520	and voting won't change that. We don't need a democrat. We need to end capitalism.
590480	598480	Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order. When you say end capitalism,
598480	604400	you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us
604400	609360	that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending. Like before capitalism,
609360	616240	there was feudalism, and feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population
616240	623440	and production. Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism. So won't capitalism
623440	628560	end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it? I don't think that's the kind of thing that
628560	634080	can be accomplished by a small group of activists. And I say small group because I'm sorry to break
634080	639360	it to you, but the vast majority of Americans are not communists. I think a lot of internet leftists
639360	645040	have a vastly overinflated sense of how big and important they are. I fall prey to it myself.
645040	650560	Like I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary, in part because when I looked at my
650560	656160	timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream
656160	662400	deaths. But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and very
662400	667680	unrepresentative sample of the population. You have to remember that only 22 percent of Americans
667680	673600	use Twitter at all. Most users rarely tweet, and 80 percent of tweets come from 10 percent of users.
673600	679760	So 80 percent of tweets come from 2 percent of Americans. And it's not a representative 2 percent.
679760	683920	According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population,
683920	687680	and that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,
687680	693920	more educated, and higher income. And far left hammer and sickle Twitter is an even smaller,
693920	699520	even more unrepresentative sample within a sample. We're talking about less than 0.1 percent of
699520	704880	Americans. And that less than 0.1 percent does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific
704880	709440	tweeters, and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform. Which is why
709440	714400	there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture is produced by a
714400	719600	relatively tiny group of people. So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater
719600	725120	to this retrograde soft conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.
725200	732000	Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign, and I enraged people's dogs by knocking
732000	736720	on their doors and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls. And I really recommend
736720	741360	that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though it is the worst thing in
741360	745200	the world and I hated it so much. You know, you do have to listen to a lot of,
745200	750240	I don't want Barack Hussein, Obama, redistributing my wealth.
750800	755440	Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping
755440	760320	business, but whatever. Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of what your fellow
760320	765760	Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,
765760	770640	you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist.
770640	776160	You know, most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves
776240	780960	and their families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking
780960	785760	points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is on about Antifa
785760	790880	so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.
790880	796320	And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,
796320	803360	in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa and Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.
804000	811440	It's Ryan and his transgender furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,
811440	816960	or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.
816960	822160	You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to do that,
822160	826720	because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with them.
826720	832800	You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,
832800	837760	what's Indigenous Peoples Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the
837760	842240	height of praxis? And who probably watch ContraPoints? How embarrassing. You know,
842240	846640	you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.
847280	853600	How very bourgeois. But revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.
854560	860320	Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the U.S.
860320	869360	government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid.
870800	875360	I mean, I guess I admire the ambition. Just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.
875360	879120	Are you counting on the U.S. military and police taking the side of the communists,
879120	884560	or is your plan to overpower them? Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,
884560	888960	I don't think that much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution.
888960	893520	So there will have to be a war. You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After
893520	900240	the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923. But you are going to need to
900240	904560	raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?
904560	910560	So how's that going, Talitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?
911520	915360	Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,
915360	918400	when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,
918400	922640	they actually mean it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,
922640	928000	the three percenters, the boogaloo boys, their stockpiling weapons, and training to use them.
928000	932480	They have ex-military men in their ranks, and connections to white supremacists within the
932480	936960	police and the military. Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,
937680	943920	it strikes me as ideation, not intent. You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between
943920	948880	two kinds of suicidal thinking. So there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how
948880	953200	you're going to do it. And then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.
953200	957920	And then there's ideation, which is, you know, you're not actually going to do it, but you just
957920	963440	have that inner monologue that's constantly saying, I just want to die. There's no more joy
963440	968640	for me left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all. And
969360	974400	then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,
975520	982480	not again, doctor. Not again. So right wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,
982480	988320	whereas left wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a
988320	995120	kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics. Well, you can't plan a revolution.
995120	1001520	Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice. Yeah, so a riot is the
1001520	1006960	language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it? What is the point of speaking through a
1006960	1013520	riot or a protest or a strike? Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the
1013520	1018720	point not just to speak, but to be heard? Heard by Holmes? Who are you trying to persuade? The
1018720	1024080	glob glob govicle lab? No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.
1024160	1029280	So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen. This year, the US has seen one
1029280	1034480	of the biggest protest movements in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment,
1034480	1039360	we have a president promising to double down on law and order on military police suppression,
1039360	1044480	a president who told a room full of cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.
1044480	1049360	And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown
1049360	1057520	in. Rough. I said, please don't be too nice. And let's be clear, both Biden and cop Mola have an
1057520	1062160	ugly record when it comes to crime and policing. For most of his career, Biden has called for more
1062160	1066320	policing, which is the opposite of what we need right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby John.
1066320	1072080	But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse about policing and criminal justice. And Biden
1072080	1077600	has responded by beginning to shift his position. This year's democratic platform includes things
1077600	1082720	like stricter use of force standards, banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,
1082720	1088320	creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,
1088320	1093600	investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough? No, it's not good enough.
1093600	1098640	But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are at least willing to listen to
1098640	1104400	protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961, he didn't want to propose a civil rights
1104400	1110080	bill because that would have been super unpopular with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened
1110080	1115200	and there were protests and uprisings all over the South in the march on Washington that summer.
1115200	1123040	And Kennedy listened. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality
1123040	1130000	that no city or state or legislative body can fruitively choose to ignore them. He was moved
1130000	1136560	by the protests and he responded by introducing what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what
1136560	1141920	if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963? What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump
1141920	1148480	had been president? We might not have gotten a civil rights act. So it does matter who's president.
1148480	1154960	It actually matters a lot. And please, Tabby-Chan, do not let a fascist win to own the libs.
1155760	1163120	God damn it. All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state. And yeah,
1163120	1168000	I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump is going to throw when
1168000	1173920	an entire nation rejects him. And I'm letting that motivate me. In some states, you can still
1173920	1180240	register. So register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in person, go to vote.org and
1180240	1186080	find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there. Make sure your phone's
1186080	1192400	charged and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends. If you're like me, you need to
1192400	1199200	set an alarm so you don't forget and then just try not to get inconsolably high until after you've
1199200	1204240	placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year of hell. And I, for one, think
1204240	1210080	that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives
1210080	1215520	this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out.
1234240	1238640	He is the enemy of the world.

1308520	1318520	It does not let you eat the judgment of the Lord.
1318520	1329520	It shows you all the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.
1329520	1335520	For I know the thoughts that I think are distressing the Lord.

1391520	1409520	I know the thoughts that I think are the dreams of your school friend, and things you may know better than the part of me today.
1409520	1411520	Don't worry, I'll stay still.
1411520	1417520	Till today, I will stop the change, and don't you want to do justice?
1417520	1419520	From the time...
