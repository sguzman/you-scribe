0	12720	Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital
12720	19920	messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there
19920	25840	are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and alone
25840	31680	I came upon them, and the glory of my posts taught about me, and I delivered unto them
31680	33680	a vision.
43200	49280	Freedom, freedom, fuck in freedom, which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life
49280	54480	or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jack-boo. As a centrist, I am
54480	60560	undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it. Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host
60560	65760	of The Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.
65760	72000	How dangerous are they? Muslims, can we stop them? Tonight we return once again to the dangerous
72000	77920	transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half and halfs and in-betweens.
77920	84080	I mean look at this, they're transing 13 year olds now, what's next? Babies with breast implants?
84080	90800	It makes me want to throw up. I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.
90800	96320	Cut the music. Tonight my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and
96320	102640	conservative opinion haver, and my second guest, well what the hell are you? You're transgender,
102640	108960	you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal? Well Jackie Jackson,
108960	117040	my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society forcing me into tiny little boxes. Okay, but are
117040	123520	you a man or a woman? Just tell me. Well why does it matter? Why do you have to know? Maybe you
123520	129520	should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories.
129520	137120	Jackie Jackson. Well can I at least ask your name or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?
137120	145120	My name is Baltimore. Baltimore what? Baltimore Maryland. I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore
145120	152640	Maryland? It is among my names. Tiffany, what do you make of this? Look Jackie, I'm gonna be
152640	158480	completely real with you. I am a transsexual, that means I have a very specific mental disorder
158480	163360	called gender dysphoria. I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance
163360	168800	in the womb. This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones
168800	173840	and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function. It is not a fashion statement,
173840	179040	it is not a trend, it is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed. It is a very difficult
179040	188880	condition to live with. I'm dying inside. Okay, so you're both transsexuals then. Now I am a
188880	195760	transsexual. That is not a transsexual. That is a trans-trender. Trans-trender? Well what is that?
195760	201200	Is that a gender? No, it's not a gender. A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here
201200	206640	who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender
206640	212960	and complaining about misgendering for oppression points. Actually, it's they. What? I use they
212960	219120	them pronouns. They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see. Why do you say that,
219120	226880	Tiffany Tumbles? Have I complained about oppression so far? It seems to me that it is you who has been
226880	235040	complaining about your dysphoria. Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?
235040	240880	No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed. I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.
240880	249840	It's in my brain. I was diagnosed. It's a fact. It's real. My pain is real. And my pain isn't real?
250720	256240	It's interesting that you think that. Well, what pain are you talking about? People making fun of
256240	260320	you because you dress like a circus act? Interesting that you mentioned the circus,
260320	267360	Tiffany Tumbles. Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the
267360	273920	circus? You're not confined anywhere. You choose to dress like that. And why do you choose to dress
273920	280400	the way you dress? Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman. Hello. And I'm non-binary,
280400	288720	so I dress non-conforming. Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?
288720	293760	Well, it's a free country. If you want to be a glitter of your gender fuck, then go ahead.
293760	298480	But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a
298480	305200	bunch of trendy freaks. But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society? Do you think you can
305200	313040	purchase acceptance through conformity? Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles. That is
313040	319600	simply adding another cell to the prison. It's not about conforming. It's about me having an actual
319600	326080	medical condition. You do not have a female brain. You have a fashion disaster. Oh, do they?
326800	332320	Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles. When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he
333040	340560	take a look at your brain then? What? Of course not. But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?
340560	347520	Well, no. Where are you going with this? I mean, if you've never seen your brain and the doctor
347600	353280	who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it, then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
354000	357360	how do you know that you have a female brain?
362160	367760	Well, shit, that's a good point. No, it isn't. Look, there's scientific studies. Can you explain
367760	374960	to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain? Are they different colors?
374960	379200	I'm not an expert, but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.
379200	387360	I see, but your doctor never looked at your brain. So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?
387360	393280	Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it. And you told him what exactly?
394080	399680	That I experienced gender dysphoria. So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,
399680	406480	and therefore your identity, is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain, but
407600	408400	because of your...
412000	417120	feelings? Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter. You backed me into a corner.
417120	424080	Sure. It's because of my feelings. My feelings of gender dysphoria. So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
424800	432800	why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid, but mine, according to you, are not?
434240	440560	This burgeoning brick. You guys, let's think about this. If I have never seen my brain,
442400	447920	how do I know I even have a brain? Well, you probably don't, girl. Look, Baltimore, I'm sure
447920	453360	you have lots of feelings about your gender. And if you feel cloud gender, or demi nebula,
453360	460400	or astroglide, or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind, then you do you, girl. Or not
460400	467920	girl. Whatever the fuck you are. But I want to make one thing very clear. I am nothing like you,
467920	474000	okay? My gender is not unicorns and glitter. My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis that
474000	481040	I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. No, not even you. My? I'm really getting under your skin,
481040	487280	aren't I? No. Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are. You're getting under my skin because it
487280	491440	really rattles my dysphoria that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender
491440	498800	community when in fact you're just making a mockery of my pain. Your pain? You're in a lot of pain,
498800	505920	aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles? Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.
505920	511520	And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles. I pity you because you don't think you're real
511520	518720	until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad. And I can't imagine what it must be like
518720	525680	to have so little confidence in your own reality. Okay, well, don't patronize me. I'm just trying to
525680	532160	understand, Tiffany Tumbles, why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating
532160	538640	your body. Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory? Now, you don't have to hate yourself
538640	543200	or hate your body, but you do have to have dysphoria. And if you tell people otherwise,
543200	549360	you're just misleading them. I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles. Would
549440	555680	you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness? Actually, I would strongly prefer if
555680	560480	you would stay away from any of my rifts. Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect
560480	566880	Tiffany against the ravages of inner strife and close her and your loving arms and cleanse her of
566880	573680	all condemnation and internalized transphobia. I entreat you, oh great mother, bathe Tiffany in
573680	580800	her peace, acceptance and self care and rid her of her toxic cisnormative truce gone ways. Amen.
580800	585520	Are we done here? I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.
585520	590640	Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver on to you? Because I'm grossed out by
590640	597280	you. That's why. Okay, then. Well, namaste, bitch. Look, why don't we all take a step back
597280	605040	and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform and let them know how much we appreciate
605040	610960	their service. God, I love the troops. Thinking about the troops makes me wet. It makes me come.
611680	621120	Semper Fi, boys. What? I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.
621120	627520	Tiffany, your transsexualism. I have to say I don't love it, but you do seem to at least be
627520	633360	aware that you have some kind of mental disorder. So I'll give you that. Whereas Baltimore,
634000	639760	you're what? Making some kind of statement? If my existence is a statement, I think that says more
639760	644400	about society than it says about me. Jackie, what you have to understand is there have been
644400	650240	transsexuals around for a long time. I have talked to 80 year old transsexuals and they agree with
650320	657120	me that all this genderqueer bullshit, it's just a trend. It's a fact. But is it? For thousands of
657120	662720	years, there have been third gender groups across human cultures. There's the Hijra of India,
662720	668560	the two-spirit people among Native Americans. Whereas binary transsexualism is a medical
668560	675040	construct of the 20th century. Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until
675040	684240	2013, meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis. So perhaps it is
684240	695600	you, Tiffany Tumbles, and not I who is following a trend. Wow, that just blew my mind. Well,
695600	701440	tables are turned, bitch. Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a
701440	710960	trans trender? He's not Native American, though. They. They. You know, it's kind of hard not to
710960	715760	call you he when you have a fucking beard. If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,
715760	720400	then you wouldn't be comfortable with that. Your honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.
720400	727440	Okay. Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they, but what it isn't is two-spirit. Look,
727520	732560	the SJWs don't even agree with this. They think it's racist. White people have two genders. Pick
732560	738160	one and sit down, dude. Yeah, that's a good point. Two genders, two genders, attack helicopter.
738160	743440	It's ma'am. Okay. Well, now you're just. Two genders, only two genders. My gender's Baltimore.
743440	749360	I think there's 76 genders because I don't think it's for you. You're just saying that you're me
749360	755200	and talking in a whiny voice. That is not an argument. The toxic truce gum bullies are gay
755200	760320	eating my gender. I don't have to, you know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal
760320	767520	with in life is assholes. It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it. Let's be ourselves.
767520	774800	Let's totally be ourselves. All right. That's enough of this. You know, as a biological female,
774800	780800	I honestly don't understand any of this. Okay. That was a hard T. Now does my husband sometimes wear
780800	786160	panties around the house and ask me to call him mommy's little slut? Well, sure. But that is a
786160	792720	matter between her and the Lord. It's best not to think about it too much. Anyway, uh, Tiffany,
792720	798560	my brain has an easier time processing youth and whatever is going on over here. So congratulations.
798560	805760	You're the winner. That was some excellent free speech. Okay. Great. So in conclusion,
805840	811760	trans trenders are real and probably dangerous. Make sure to protect your children. As for how
811760	817040	many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.
817600	822000	All right. That's our show. This has been the freedom report where the debate never stops.
823360	829120	Except when the show is over. The girl can't help it. She's a Libra.
829120	841280	Behold the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected. They gave their cheek to them
841280	847920	that mocked their beard and did not their face from shame. But lo, Tiffany, the person who tricks
847920	854320	the trendier than thou is shady queen. Give next of all her friend Justine and sought her counsel
854320	877760	thus. God, damn it, Justine. I just can't with these trenders anymore. I simply cannot. You
877760	883760	know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door. Okay. Seems a little formal.
885120	892160	Ugh. You look great, hun. Cute. Justine, you look like absolute shit. What happened? Did the cat
892160	897520	girl finally beat you up? No, I just, look, I slept in my makeup. Okay. Leave me alone. I've
897520	903600	been having a difficult time. Are we serving a little depression moment? Jesus. Well, don't leave
903600	908960	me out. I saw you on the freedom report today. Okay, girl, can we talk about Ladybeard Baltimore,
908960	915360	Maryland? Oh, add that one to the crazy hall of fame. Really? You're happy with the way that went?
915360	919680	You feel good about that? You feel good about yourself right now? Well, why wouldn't I?
920240	928080	Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world than a tran
928080	934080	who thinks she's better than other trans. It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.
934080	937600	You seem to think that you're queen of the world because you're hanging on to societal
937600	943360	acceptance by two fingers instead of one. Well, you're not, bitch. You're just an insecure,
943360	948400	frightened little queer who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread
948400	953200	other people down. And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.
953200	957520	Your eyelash is coming unglued.
960720	966720	My life is coming unglued. Look, it's not like I'm coming out to trannies who just can't afford
966720	971280	to transition. I don't have the social support. It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he
971280	977840	can to pass and people just treat him like a freak for no reason. They. It's they. Are we really
977840	985680	saying they now in private? Yes, we are. So get used to it. My name is Justine. I think
985680	991680	misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings. I always forget that you're like
991680	996480	actually an SGW. I always forget that you're actually an asshole. Why do I even hang out with
996480	1001040	you? Oh, because you hate yourself and you have to believe there's hope for me because if there's
1001040	1005280	hope for me, there might be hope for you. Wow, you're developing self-consciousness. Where'd
1005280	1013120	you learn that trick? Gigi, Tiffany. Have you ever been bullied? Oh, let's see. Let me think.
1014080	1018800	Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day. But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the
1018800	1023760	victim. No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully. I think you grew up getting bullied for
1023760	1029600	being a sissy till you started passing as a woman. And then you got a little taste of normal. And now
1029600	1034640	you want to be the one who bashes the queers. Bash them? If anything, I'm the one defending
1034640	1039360	trans people from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders. You said on air
1039360	1045120	that Baltimore grosses you out. Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here
1045120	1049920	have nothing to do with your own self-loathing? How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is
1049920	1056080	nothing like me? Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse. Oh, it's not bigotry. Look,
1056080	1061920	I shouldn't have said grossed out. I'll give you that. But he does. They do make me uncomfortable.
1061920	1068400	And why do you think that is? I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.
1069280	1072720	Makes me want to down a bottle of hormones. Make sure I never look like that. Bitch,
1072720	1077280	secondhand dysphoria. What is that? You know, when you look at a tranny and you just clock
1077280	1083760	everything and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria? Yeah, I do know what you're talking
1083760	1087760	about. And I'll tell you why it happens. When you're early in your transition and you're doing
1087760	1092640	everything you can to pass, you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little
1092640	1099040	thing that makes you clockable. Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people
1099040	1105280	and you project your dysphoria onto them. I buy that. Yeah. Well, that is absolutely not a valid
1105280	1111120	reason to please other trans people's presentation. Secondhand dysphoria is not valid. The fact that
1111120	1117040	you project your dysphoria onto other people is your problem and your problem alone. And you need
1117040	1122320	to deal with that issue in private, girl, not on a fucking talk show. Yeah, you're probably right
1122320	1129280	about that, but it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid. Tiffany, let's be
1129280	1134400	pragmatic about this. Suppose everything you're saying is true. Suppose the only real trans people
1134400	1138800	are dysphoric, binary transgender people, transsexuals. Every time you say the word
1138800	1144160	transsexual, I feel like it's 1978. Are you 80 years old? I guess you could say I'm not the
1144160	1149760	trendiest person. Haha. Look, suppose you're right and everyone who doesn't meet your definition
1149760	1155440	of a transsexual is some kind of confused trend follower. Even if that were true, and to be clear,
1155440	1160480	it isn't, what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid because virtually
1160480	1164720	every trans person goes through a period of being confused about their gender and of having
1164720	1169920	nonconforming expression. And you're going around enforcing a stigma against that. Didn't you ever
1169920	1175360	have doubts about your gender? Weren't you ever androgynous? Oh yeah, I mean, I was never a sad
1175360	1182000	burgeoning, but I had my little cringe here being a non-binary SJW. Uh-huh. And one of the great
1182000	1187200	things about non-binary identities is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist,
1187200	1191680	even when neither gender really fits them, whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple
1191680	1196560	months. Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated for being a trenderer during
1196560	1202640	your exploration year might not have been the most helpful thing? Not really. I have dysphoria,
1202640	1207520	so if anyone called me a trenderer, I'd eventually prove them wrong. That's all I'm saying. If you're
1207520	1213120	not a trenderer, then transition. Prove me wrong. The stigma you perpetuate against gender confusion
1213120	1219040	and experimentation keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition. It alienates baby
1219040	1224720	trans from the community that should be welcoming them instead of publicly humiliating them. And when
1224720	1230480	you appoint yourself the public decider of whomst is really trans, the torquemata of the trender
1230480	1236000	inquisition, you're terrorizing a lot of people who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.
1236000	1242880	Okay. But then how do we decide which t***ies are valid? We don't. This is where I'm losing you,
1242880	1248400	because trendstrenders are absolutely a thing. Like, undeniably. I've talked to people who've
1248400	1253920	literally told me they used to be trendstrenders. So, some people question their gender but end up
1253920	1258480	deciding they're not really trans. There is nothing wrong with that. And those people still
1258480	1262800	aren't being helped by public shaming. Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place if
1262800	1267520	SJW's weren't going around telling people they don't need dysphoria to be trans. You know, it's
1267520	1272000	one thing if teenage girls want to dye their hair pink and call themselves demi-boys for most of
1272000	1277280	sophomore year. But some of these kids are actually going to medically transition. And soon, we're going
1277280	1281760	to have an epidemic of detransitioners on our hands. And there's going to be TERFs publishing,
1281760	1287280	I told you so, op-eds in every major newspaper. Now, maybe you think that's worth it just to make
1287280	1293600	sure no one ever feels invalidated for any reason. But I think that's highly irresponsible. Look,
1293600	1298000	if you're so worried about people feeling pressured to medically transition, then what you
1298000	1302960	should be doing is working to make the trans community as inclusive and welcoming as possible
1302960	1307920	to gender non-conforming people and non-binary people and people who are questioning and trans
1307920	1313280	people who don't medically transition. But instead, you're doing the exact opposite. You're telling
1313280	1318080	everyone that medical transition is the only way to be valid. And if anything is pressuring people
1318080	1325120	to medically transition, it's that. Justine, I think you're a good person. Maybe too good. And
1325120	1329760	that's why you're trying to have compassion for everyone. But at some point, you have to protect
1329760	1335120	yourself. We live in a world of Jackie Jackson's who don't understand trans people and don't think
1335200	1340560	we're real. So we need to have an explanation of what it is to be trans that's based on facts and
1340560	1346160	not feelings. And the most factual explanation is transmedicalism, which is the idea that
1346160	1351360	transsexualism is a diagnosable mental disorder called gender dysphoria. There's science to back
1351360	1356960	this up. It's accepted by medical professionals, and it clearly explains why we are valid,
1356960	1362480	unlike Rachel Dolezal and snowflake gender teenagers and people who identify as cats.
1362480	1368240	Okay, I see the appeal, but I don't think transmedicalism is as validating as you think it is.
1368240	1373600	Why not? I'll put it bluntly. Why does having gender dysphoria make you a woman? Because gender
1373600	1379120	dysphoria means I have a female brain. No, it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you, but the science
1379120	1384640	does not say what you think it says. There may be neurological causes of gender dysphoria. But at the
1384640	1390480	end of the day, all dysphoria is is discomfort in a male body or a male social role or however you
1390480	1399120	want to put it. And wanting to be a woman is not the same thing as being a woman, not by any means.
1399120	1402800	Girl, where are you going with this? What is this? Are you becoming a turf? No, I just don't think
1402800	1408160	your theory actually validates our womanhood. Well, if you're right, that's a real problem,
1408160	1413280	because we need to have reason and science and logic and facts on our side so that we can
1413280	1420720	explain to society that we are valid and that we are real. Otherwise, bad things. Well, maybe
1420720	1426240	there's a better theory. Well, okay, Socrates, let's hear it then. The way I see it, gender is
1426240	1433520	either psychological or biological or social. Now, my friend Tabby, the cat girl, she thinks it's all
1433520	1438720	psychological, that it's just identity, that whatever you think about your own gender is true.
1438720	1443680	And that makes me really uncomfortable because then what's the difference between identifying
1443680	1449840	as a woman and identifying as a Norwegian forest cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself seems
1449840	1453120	not to have much of a grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to tell you about
1453120	1457760	transtrenders this entire time. Just let me finish. If gender is strictly biological,
1457760	1462400	then that's game over for trans people unless you make some kind of wrong brain and the wrong body
1462400	1467280	argument. But I told you I'm not buying that. So that leaves gender as a social construct.
1467280	1472160	Are you gonna try to make me read Judith Butler again? I'll summarize it. Gender is a series of
1472160	1477120	gestures. It's called performativity. It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak. It's the
1477120	1482560	way you act. It's the way you relate to other people. Through transitioning, we habituate to
1482560	1488480	the gestures of womanhood and socially that makes us women regardless of biology or psychology,
1488480	1496160	checkmate transphobes. Okay, the problem with that is that it's both too exclusionary
1496160	1501360	and too inclusive. It excludes a lot of trans people who can't transition for circumstantial
1501360	1507440	reasons, but whose dysphoria is very real. And it includes every transtrender, drag queen,
1507440	1513680	fetishist, and two-bit cross-dressing comedian in a dino wig. Uh, well, do you really believe
1513680	1520960	that a man who plays a woman on stage becomes just as much of a woman as you and me? Yes? Bitch,
1520960	1527040	no you don't. Yeah, you're right. I'm full of shit. I know you are because you're an SJW,
1527040	1531280	and SJWs hate performativity theory almost as much as they hate me. Well, they only hate it
1531280	1535760	because they don't understand it. They think it invalidates non-binary identities, but in fact,
1535760	1540800	it's the most rational way to explain non-binary identities. How can you perform a non-binary
1540800	1546480	identity? Simple. You learn the rules so you can break them. Wearing a beard and a dress communicates
1546480	1552080	ambiguity. Even the gesture of declaring, I am neither a man or a woman, is a speech act that
1552080	1556880	removes the speaker from the semantics of- Girl, shut up. This is too much philosophizing. I can't
1556880	1561120	stand it anymore. Why don't you tell me what's really going on with you? Why do you look like
1561120	1565200	you've been in a k-hole for a week? Why are you suddenly so obsessed with white knighting for
1565200	1572000	non-binary people? Because I am non-binary. No, you're not. What are you talking about?
1572560	1579120	I just feel like since I started transitioning, I've been trying so hard to fit in and to perform
1579120	1585920	my gender and to pass and to just be normal. But I can't do it anymore. I just cannot make it work.
1586480	1591600	I feel like an actor. I feel like a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions of this new gender
1591600	1596880	role that's supposed to liberate me, but that's somehow just as empty as the old one. Because
1596880	1602080	I'm just not normal Tiffany. I am a freak and I'm always going to be a freak. Justine,
1602080	1608560	you're not non-binary. You're gay and everyone can see this except you. Oh, come on. I'm not,
1609680	1618160	I'm not gay. Justine was extremely gay. Protests though the lady may, there simply is no stopping
1618160	1634320	a gayness. I love girls. I hate girls. Okay. So I'm a little bit gay, right? And you don't know
1634320	1638640	how to reconcile your attraction to women with your desire to reform your gender. That's why
1638640	1644000	you feel this dissonance. Yeah. I guess that's basically it. Well, it really shouldn't be that
1644000	1650880	hard girl. You already came out as a woman. Just blurt it out. Say hello world. My name is Justine
1650880	1658720	and I fuck pussy. That's a very cis normative way to say it. Hello world. My name is Justine and
1659280	1665680	I fuck pussy. Oh, I feel like a man when I say it. Yeah. Well, you should probably buy a pickup
1665680	1671200	truck then get some of those mud flaps on the back with the little sexy ladies on them. And
1671200	1676160	you may as well change your name back to Justin. Okay. Well, that's just uncalled for. Girl,
1676160	1681280	I don't know what to say except I told you so. Sexuality is just like gender identity. It is
1681280	1686320	not a performance. It's not a trend. It's not a choice. It's just part of who you are. And
1686320	1693600	there's nothing you can do to change it. I guess you're right. I guess my theory sucks. It sucks
1693600	1698800	so fucking hard. But the good news is you can unclench your asshole now and do whatever you
1698800	1703600	want because you're still a woman, whether you're performing a stereotype or not. So run free,
1703600	1711120	Justine. Go top a cis woman. Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized flannel. Do whatever you want.
1711120	1716400	Wow. Yeah. I guess, I guess that is pretty liberating. Yeah. Thank God for transmedicalism,
1716400	1722400	right? Oh, except not because you just destroyed transmedicalism with facts and logic. So we have
1722400	1727520	no theory. We have no theory, Justine. What do we do now? How do we prove we're valid? Well,
1727520	1731680	just do what every trans woman has done since the beginning of time. Go out and
1731680	1737600	fuck the most brutally heterosexual man you can find and be validated and come. Oh, honey,
1737600	1742480	I have and I will, but that's not going to convince anyone but me. It's not a proof.
1742480	1747760	It's not a theory. Well, maybe we don't need a theory. Maybe we don't need to prove anything.
1748480	1753840	Bad things, Justine. Bad things. Well, do we have a theory about why people are gay?
1753840	1758960	No, they just are. The only reason we even feel like we need a theory about trans people
1758960	1764480	is that society is so unaccepting of us that it's constantly demanding we justify our own reality.
1764480	1768960	Okay. So what am I supposed to tell Jackie Jackson then? What am I supposed to tell the
1768960	1775680	TERFs? That I'm a woman because reasons? No, not even because reasons. Just because you are.
1775680	1780720	So it's what? A leap of faith? Oh, great. I'm sure that's going to convince all the rational
1780720	1787760	skeptics. Justine, it makes us sound completely delusional. Well, Tiffany, delusion is what
1787760	1792320	separates us from the animals. Who do you think built the pyramids and the cathedrals? Clearly
1792320	1796320	not people with a perfectly rational worldview. But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one
1796320	1801120	who thinks being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't describe it as the height of sanity,
1801120	1805520	but I would prefer to think that my whole life and identity is based on something I can rationally
1805520	1811120	explain. Well, what are we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the single most obnoxious thing about men that
1811120	1816960	they think they have to wrap up the entire world in a little rational box? Maybe the most important
1816960	1822720	things in life can't be logically proved. Can you logically prove that you love your own children?
1822720	1829840	No. And the attempt to prove it is as degrading as it is futile. Maybe gender identity is one of
1829840	1836560	those things. Okay. But then how do I prove I'm more valid than Baltimore, Maryland and the star
1836560	1842160	genders and the cat people? Well, maybe we should stop getting so caught up in proving our validity
1842160	1847360	to ourselves that we end up being horribly cruel to other people. What if we just accept all the
1847360	1852560	freaks of the world? At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as important to have logical proofs
1852560	1856160	as it is to be empathetic and open-minded and compassionate.
1858320	1873040	Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya.
1873040	1878400	I have something to tell you. Here it comes. I love you.
1878400	1887200	Okay. Well, I'm going to get going now. I have an important date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries
1887200	1894320	and reading YouTube comments by myself. So I'd really better go do that. But good luck with
1894320	1905760	your new life as a male lesbian who fucks cats. Are you upset? Just go. I'm sorry.
1909360	1914640	Oh, I hate this bitch, but God, she's a yum yum.
1920400	1925920	Harken children, in this vision, you have witnessed world fools on the screen.
1925920	1935120	Fools who did all of themselves. But I, your goddess mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.
1935120	1944400	For I am truth. I am light. I am in capitalism. And everything I tweet is woke. Most importantly,
1944400	1953280	I love myself. I love myself so much. It makes me wet. It makes me cum. Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.
1953280	1955840	Like, comment, and subscribe. Amen.
