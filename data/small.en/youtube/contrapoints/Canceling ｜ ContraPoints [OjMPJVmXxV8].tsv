0	20640	Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help! Alright, I'm gonna
20640	41080	apply the lesbian solution. Okay. Let's get started. I love my king. This is not really
41080	46880	the most feminine moment for me, not really my 2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my
46880	53680	giant man hands. All right. No one thinks I'm cute. Let's get started. Okay. Look, this video
53680	59800	is about canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call it out culture. And I know
59800	65280	you kids know all about this, but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow
65280	71760	boomers. So listen up oldies. In the lingo of these young avocado guzzling smartphone addicts
71760	78720	who killed Applebee's canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent members
78720	84000	of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word
84000	91120	canceling started out on black Twitter, where a few years ago, people, well, mostly women would
91120	95880	tweet cancel R Kelly and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante strategy
95880	101280	for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been immune to any
101280	106320	consequences for their actions. For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media
106320	112000	shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power who couldn't be held accountable any other way.
112000	117120	The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none and bring
117120	122800	justice to prominent abusers. It's in a way the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer
122800	128720	of justice, the people's avenger, but also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment
128720	135440	spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a reign of terror
135440	139840	situation on our hands gorge. Now there's a version of this conversation that's already been
139840	144400	had to death and it goes like this. On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly
144400	148960	bitch about how cancel culture is out of control. You can't joke about anything anymore without
148960	153440	these millennial jockels trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive
153440	158560	think piece authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture. It's just that powerful
158560	162480	people are finally being held accountable for their actions and they can't fucking handle it.
162480	167120	So they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now, unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints
167120	172960	is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.
172960	177200	He didn't know I was transgender. Story time, emotional, not clickbait. Let's start with an
177200	182640	example. The most high profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles. And
182640	188240	again, I know you kids remember this, but I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders.
188240	195760	Put the kettle on Karen. So James Charles is a 20 year old beauty guru, which means boomers.
195760	202400	Look, there's these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup. It's worth
202400	207120	checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer. I certainly can't. It's
207120	213680	pretty bomb. It's lit. It's, uh, it's groovy. It's fab. It's far out, man. It's a gas. I fully dig it.
213680	218320	Free love. Give peace of chance. Nixon's a fascist. So back in May of this year, James's
218320	227280	colleague and mother figure, fellow YouTube beauty guru, Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40 minute video
227280	235280	accusing James of endorsing a different brand of hair vitamins than the brand that she, wait,
235280	240800	that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins. An enthralling plot line, I know.
240800	245680	And this was huge. This was covered in the New York Times. And while Tati was added almost as
245680	254560	an afterthought to the hair vitamin dispute, she also accused James of being a sexual predator.
254560	260800	Now I actually went back and checked Tati's original deleted video and she actually never
260800	265520	uses the phrase sexual predator. It's funny. I remember her calling him that because that
265520	271600	became the story on Twitter. But what she actually said was James had to try to trick
271600	277520	straight men into thinking they're gay. Oh my God, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking
277520	284400	he's gay yet again, which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator. But see,
284400	290320	this is what cancel culture does. It takes one story and transforms it into a significantly
290320	295280	different story. You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read
295520	302400	Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they're gay,
302400	310160	but cancel culture transforms that story into the headline James Charles is a sexual predator.
310160	315280	Interesting. Now I want to make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James
315280	321200	Charles. I'm not a James Charles stan. I'm a biological female in my thirties. Close to death
321200	327760	I know. Please leave a comment before I die. That said, I do think the statement James Charles is a
327760	333600	sexual predator is a stretch to say the least, at least based on the information I have in December
333600	338960	2019. So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens. Cancel culture trope one,
338960	343200	and you should be writing this down in class because this will be on the test. Cancel culture
343200	348640	trope one, presumption of guilt. There's a traditional understanding of justice according
348640	354640	to which before you condemn or punish a person, you hear the accuser's side of the story and the
354640	360560	accused side of the story. You allow both sides to present evidence and only after everyone involved
360560	366560	has had a chance to make their case, do you pass sentence and punish the convict? Oh, punish me,
366560	372000	King. I'm drinking this as punishment enough. Am I uncancelled yet, please? Now in the United States
372000	379280	of we legally have the presumption of innocence, but canceling does not abide by the law. Cancelling
379280	385440	is a form of vigilante mob justice and a lot of times an accusation is proof enough. Now that's
385440	391600	basically the point of the progressive slogan believe victims. It's a norm that was put into
391600	397040	place in progressive spaces because out in the world at large people generally don't believe
397040	402880	victims, but I think it's pretty obvious how believe victims is a norm that's easy to abuse.
402880	410320	Was Tati really James's victim? No, she's not some powerless woman abused by a prominent man in her
410320	416560	industry. She's on top of the industry and she wasn't victimized by James at all. I see this case
416560	421920	more as she weaponized cancel culture against a business rival. Anyway, before James had even had
421920	427920	a chance to respond to Tati's accusation, the story had already gone from Tati Westbrook accuses
427920	434080	James Charles of trying to trick straight men to James Charles tried to trick straight men. And
434080	440320	from there it was generalized into James Charles is toxic and manipulative, which brings us to
440320	448160	cancel culture trope two, abstraction. Abstraction replaces the specific concrete details of a claim
448160	453520	with a more generic statement. In the transition from Tati Westbrook accused James Charles of
453520	459520	trying to trick straight men to James Charles is toxic and manipulative. We've lost not only the
459520	465680	sense of this being an unverified accusation, but we've also lost all the specific details.
465680	470880	James Charles is toxic and manipulative is an incredibly vague statement and may as well be
470880	475920	James Charles is bad. But even without the presumption of guilt, if someone tells me
475920	480720	James Charles is accused of toxic and manipulative behavior, I'm going to think, oh,
480720	485520	that sounds pretty bad. And I'm going to start speculating about the specifics and whatever my
485520	490800	imagination comes up with is likely going to be worse than whatever he's actually accused of.
490800	496720	Also, the specific accusation that he tried to trick straight men into thinking they're gay
496720	502720	is self-evidently kind of questionable. How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?
502720	509040	If you find out, let me know. It's bad. I'm bad. I'm super bad. This is not a problem that straight
509040	514160	men usually seem to have. At the very least, it requires further explanation. It's the kind of
514160	518320	story that sounds like it has more than one side. So I'm immediately going to feel a little bit
518320	525200	skeptical of the accusation. And I'm also going to side-eye Tati Westbrook because this accusation
525200	531840	is setting off my homophobia detection alarm. Leave the gays alone. But I'm not going to have
531840	536800	an opportunity to pick up on the potential homophobia and be skeptical of it if all I've
536800	542880	heard about the situation is James Charles' toxic and manipulative. And I also want to point out a
542880	548080	linguistic shift that's happening here. When the claim was James Charles tried to trick straight
548080	554400	men, the verbs in the sentence were try and trick. So what we're criticizing here is James' behavior.
554400	560080	We're criticizing things he did, allegedly, trying to trick straight men. But once the claim morphs
560080	567040	into James Charles' is toxic and manipulative, the verb in the sentence is is to be. So these
567040	572000	adjectives are characteristics of James. And it's now not his actions we're criticizing, but his
572000	579040	personality, his toxicity, his manipulativeness. This is what I'll call cancel culture trope three,
579040	584560	essentialism. Essentialism is when we go from criticizing a person's actions to criticizing
584560	589920	the person themselves. We're not just saying they did bad things. We're saying they're a bad
589920	595440	person. And that's what takes us from James Charles tried to trick straight men to James
595440	602240	Charles is a sexual predator. So here we're targeting James himself, not just his actions,
602240	609680	but the type of person he is a sexual predator. And we've also really escalated the accusation,
609680	614240	because I don't know about you guys. But when I hear the phrase sexual predator, the image that
614240	621280	comes to mind is a rapist or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss, not a teenage twink hung
621280	625520	up on wanting to date straight guys. I mean, not that a person like that couldn't be a sexual
625520	632240	predator. But I really don't think that he's a sexual predator is a fair summary of the accusation.
632240	636720	So this seems to me like a pretty nasty and dishonest twisting of the story. And it happened
636720	642320	instantaneously on Twitter. It totally dominated the conversation in a community of millions of
642320	648240	people for weeks. In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers. And who knows what effect
648240	654640	it had on his personal life? Not that anyone seems to care. In fact, most people seems to be enjoying
654640	661440	his downfall. He was a teenage millionaire, a young, beautiful superstar, easy to envy, easy to resent,
661440	666800	hard to relate to hard to sympathize with. What was the point of canceling James Charles? Did we
666800	671520	want to teach him a lesson? Did we want him to learn from his mistakes and grow as a person?
672560	676000	Imagine actually wanting someone to learn. Imagine actually caring.
676000	682160	My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer was not sincerely outraged and hurt by their sincere
682160	687200	belief that James Charles was a sexual predator. In other words, this was not a case of triggered
687200	693520	SJWs. This was a controversy manufactured from the top by a handful of seemingly vindictive
693520	698480	and envious people. I honestly think that most of the James Charles as a sexual predator crowd
699200	705600	just wanted to bring him down a peg. Cancel culture trope four, pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.
705600	711040	If you look at the world we live in, would you say that people are usually motivated by a sense
711040	718160	of moral integrity and intellectual rigor? No, maybe not. Let's be real, America. We are a
718160	724480	bunch of morally impotent meatbags constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust. For
724480	731200	Tati calling out James, this was really, it was about the hair of vitamins, right? I think Sis
731200	737280	was super salty that this millionaire kid who she had supported and helped had betrayed her by
737280	743200	endorsing a rival brand. And accusing him of trying to trick straight men was just a twist of
743200	749840	the knife. But moralism or intellectualism provide a phony pretext for the call out. You can pretend
749840	754720	you just want an apology. You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen who wants the person to
754720	759440	improve. You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism when what you're really doing is
759440	764880	attacking a person's career and reputation out of spite, envy, revenge. I mean, it could be any
764880	771440	motivation. Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged, spoiled little brat and it was fun to wipe the
771440	777600	smile off his smug face at least for a few weeks. It's schadenfreude, right? This kind of petty
777600	782720	sadism. Maybe not the internet's proudest moment, but not the most shameful either. And it's not to
782720	788080	say that everyone canceling James Charles was insincere, but there's a world of difference
788080	794880	between cancel R. Kelly and cancel James Charles. And I'm interested to know how these two things
794880	799760	came to look the same. When James was being cancelled, I remember being kind of transfixed
799760	806560	by the sight of his life and career falling from the sky, full tailspin, black smokes spewing out,
806560	810240	and a lot of my YouTube friends were like, lol, did you see James Charles is cancelled?
811680	817680	But I looked up at James and I said, oh god, that's gonna be me someday.
817680	821280	Stay strong, sister. Don't let the bastards get you down.
823920	828400	Let's switch over to white cloth. These are cute. These are fun. A little more of a feminine moment
828400	833840	for me. They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic. I'm not even wearing makeup.
833840	841520	I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy. Keep drinking people. We're gonna make
841520	845440	it through this together. So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology when I was looking into the
845440	852000	James Charles canceling. And I found a bunch of tweets referencing earlier James Charles scandals.
852000	856720	Y'all forgiving James Charles. He's still a transphobe. Y'all are acting like just because
856720	862880	James Charles has receipts. He's no longer a racist transphobe like James Charles is racist,
862880	868800	ableist, transphobic, and a sexual predator. A white woman. Y'all are being too harsh on him
868800	874400	and he's uncancelled. So according to Twitter, James Charles is not only a sexual predator,
874400	881600	he's also a racist and a transphobe. That sounds pretty serious. Let's investigate.
881600	886400	We'll start with the transphobia allocation. Kakaros of the jury, exhibit A.
886400	889760	So you're not even full gay. I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I felt were
889760	893840	really, really beautiful. There's also been like trans guys in the past too that I was like really,
893840	899600	really into for a moment in time. And I oop. As I say on Twitter, yikes. This ain't a cheap,
899600	905920	friendly reminder that this isn't a good look. Maybe don't be transphobic. Disappointing.
905920	912480	So James did fuck up here. The problem is he's suggesting that being attracted to trans men
912480	918720	makes him less gay, which implies that trans men aren't really men, which is at odds with the way
918720	923760	trans men understand themselves. So this does deserve criticism. No doubt, no doubt. However,
924320	931040	what I see when I look at this clip of James is not a dyed in the wool transphobic bigot.
931040	938320	I see a very young person who's still working on understanding his own sexuality and is trying to
938320	944000	figure out where his attraction to trans men fits into that. And it seems to me that the proportionate
944000	951280	response to that situation is for someone to take James aside and explain to him, look, here's why
951280	956480	what you said is hurtful to trans men. And here are some tips on how to avoid saying that kind of
956480	962880	thing in the future. You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred. Not understanding someone
962880	968160	is not the same as wanting them dead. Of course, there are committed bigots who it's just a waste
968160	973360	of time to engage with. But sometimes just talking to someone with a little patience and
973360	978480	understanding is all it takes. But that's not what cancel culture does. Oh, no, we have to
978480	985840	immediately escalate every situation to the highest possible level of conflict. So by abstraction,
985840	992320	we get James Charles made transphobic comments. And by essentialism, we get James Charles is
992320	998080	a transphobe. We don't give him a chance to reflect. We don't give him an opportunity to learn.
998080	1003280	We go straight to branding him a bigot. Nonetheless, that same week,
1003280	1008560	James posted an apology to his Insta story saying, regardless of whatever my intentions were,
1008560	1014000	that came across as me saying, I'm not fully gay because I have been with a trans man. And that is
1014000	1019280	absolutely, first of all, not true. Like that doesn't make me not fully gay. But that stereotype
1019280	1025440	and implication is really, really dangerous. And I'm very, very sorry. If you are a trans man,
1025440	1030320	you are a man. If you're a trans girl, you are a woman. You are valid in your identity.
1030880	1035120	Could you ask for a better apology? Like he not only apologizes for what he said,
1035120	1041200	but he also demonstrates a clear understanding of why it was wrong. So does that mean people
1041200	1048080	stopped calling him a transphobe? Of course not. Cancel culture, trope five, no forgiveness.
1048080	1053600	Cancellors will often dismiss an apology as insincere, no matter how convincingly written
1053680	1060240	or delivered. And of course, an insincere apology is further proof of what a Machiavellian psychopath
1060240	1066240	you really are. Now, sometimes a good apology will calm things down for a while. But the next time
1066240	1072000	there's a scandal, the original accusation will be raised again, as if you never apologized. And
1072000	1077840	that's what happened to James during the Tati scandal when Twitter decided he was a transphobic
1077840	1083520	sexual predator. And that's to say nothing of this racism I've been hearing about. Here are
1083520	1089920	the receipts. Exhibit B. In February 2017, when James was much less famous than he is now,
1089920	1094480	he tweeted, I can't believe we're going to Africa today. OMG, what if we get Ebola?
1094480	1100640	James, we're fine. We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year. Okay. Well, that's a little
1100640	1106160	insensitive maybe, but it's not really something an influencer should tweet. And fear of disease
1106160	1113040	associated with Africa. I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area as certain
1113040	1120400	racist tropes. But clearly, this was intended as a joke about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli,
1120400	1127200	right? And anyway, he did apologize saying, as a white cis male, I recognize my privilege and would
1127200	1132960	never want to take that for granted. But I fucked up. I feel awful for posting what I said. I
1133040	1137680	understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant. And James hasn't made a habit of making
1137680	1144880	jokes like that ever since. So is this one tweet from two years ago that he apologized for on its
1144880	1151840	own enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist? Well, according to cancel culture,
1151840	1157440	absolutely. Abstraction takes us from two years ago, James Charles made a joke that referenced
1157440	1163760	his fear of getting Ebola in Africa to James Charles made a racist joke. And then essentialism
1163760	1179280	takes us to James Charles is a racist. Look, I want to pause to say I really do believe in social
1179280	1186080	justice, at least as much as trash like me believes in anything. And believe me, I am well aware that
1186080	1192720	jokes, irony, and even complaints about cancel culture are often used by bigots to cloak their
1192720	1198800	real agenda. The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video about how far right racists use
1198800	1204880	jokes and memes and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs and make them
1204880	1210800	more palatable to a wider audience. So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern for
1210800	1218000	anti-racism and anti-transphobia, as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture is often
1218000	1224080	just a conservative red herring used to shut down any and all complaints about racism or transphobia.
1224080	1230880	But I've also become very disillusioned with the way these accusations are thrown around so
1230880	1236400	frivolously on social media. By the way, they're used to escalate conflict instead of promote
1236400	1243040	understanding. And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized to destroy people who have made
1243040	1249360	mistakes, but who really don't deserve to be destroyed. Now, maybe you're thinking destroyed,
1249360	1254320	what do you mean destroyed? James is a 20 year old millionaire on his way to owning his own makeup
1254320	1261440	empire and you are completely correct. If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar, then being
1261440	1267040	canceled most likely does not destroy you. The cancelers blend into the general backdrop of
1267040	1273200	haters and they can set you back a few million subscribers and a lot of emotional turmoil,
1273200	1278960	but in the long run, they can't really touch your success. But here's the thing, what if you're not
1278960	1284720	James Charles? What if you're a small creator? What if you can't afford public relations help?
1284720	1289280	What if you belong to a marginalized community and you rely on that community for support?
1289280	1292240	Well, in that case, it's a whole different story.
1294880	1297840	Let's Irish up this coffee.
1302320	1304720	Shaken not stirred spilled all over my pussy.
1307840	1312240	That's good. Booze and coffee is a good combination. I'm feeling amped right now. I'm
1312240	1316880	feeling a hype. So this is the part in the video where I should admit that I'm not just a casual
1316880	1322320	observer here. At the time I'm making this video, sweaty, I'm super canceled. You know, I try to
1322320	1326320	make videos that are both informative and entertaining. So in this video, the information
1326320	1331360	is you get to learn about cancel culture and the entertainment is you get to watch a worm try to
1331360	1336560	wriggle off a hook. Let's get started. Forgive me father for I have sent a How are you? God,
1336560	1340720	I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber who would resort to making videos about my own drama, but
1341840	1346800	things have gotten to a point. I feel like I cannot continue this channel until I spill some tea.
1346960	1351360	So let's get started. Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene. I've never
1351360	1355680	talked about this on my channel before. So this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me. But
1355680	1361280	I am in fact, a transgender woman, which may come as a big shock to many of you since I'm 100%
1361280	1368640	real fash. I get comments all the time from like very solemn people like guys, I'm pretty sure
1368640	1372960	this is a dude. Great work, detective. You're cracked to the case. You're doing very good,
1372960	1378880	sweetie. Very, very good. But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,
1379440	1384720	I am a prime target for cancellation and I have been canceled many, many times. And we're going
1384720	1388160	to talk about some of the things I've been canceled for and some of the things I've been criticized
1388160	1392800	for and the difference between criticism and canceling because yes, there is a difference.
1392800	1396560	As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes because despite how I look,
1396640	1404000	I am not a literal goddess and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due. However,
1404800	1410400	where I believe that criticism of me is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize because here
1410400	1415360	at ContraPoints Industries, we are not in the business of serving bullshit. So the reason
1415360	1422320	for my current cancellation is, in summary, that in my last video Opulence, I cast transsexual
1422320	1427280	porn star Buck Angel in the role of John Waters. And yes, it's a much better story than the hair
1427280	1432400	vitamin debacle. So notify the drama channels. Put in a good word for me because, sweetie,
1432400	1436560	I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. So basically I'm canceled for collaborating with Buck
1436560	1442960	Angel and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel is a horrible person. And so my collaboration with
1442960	1449760	Buck Angel is evidence that I too am a horrible person. Cancel culture trope six, the transitive
1449760	1454960	property of cancellation. Cancellation is infectious. If you associate with a canceled
1454960	1460400	person, the cancellation rubs off. It's like gonorrhea, except doxycycline won't save you
1460400	1465520	this time, sweetie. Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all, on whether Buck Angel is,
1465520	1473200	in fact, a horrible person. So who is Buck Angel? Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.
1473200	1477280	He grew up in a world where there was not anything like the visibility and access to information about
1477280	1481280	transition we have today and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system in place
1481280	1486160	for people who wanted to transition. In fact, Buck was the first female to male patient his doctor
1486160	1490640	had ever treated. In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer, his gimmick
1490640	1495360	at the time being the man with a pussy. But he also became an activist. He wanted to create more
1495360	1499280	positive trans representation within the porn world. And from there, he became a more general
1499280	1503840	educator and advocate for trans people. I first heard about him in the early 2010s when I was
1504400	1508960	doing some googling about some little gender issues I was having myself, although I ended up
1508960	1513200	deciding to remain a female. And Buck was one of the first female to male people I'd ever heard
1513200	1517040	about. And he made an impact on me in part because you take one look at him and you think, honey,
1517040	1523280	that's a man, but he was born a woman. You can do that. So it's not like he inspired me to
1523280	1527920	transition or anything. It's just, it was one of many moments along my whole entire gender journey.
1527920	1532640	So I had positive feelings about Trampot, that's what he calls himself, from back then. And then a
1532640	1537600	few months ago, when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised over another time I was
1537600	1543200	being canceled by trans Twitter, we'll get to that one later, I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.
1543200	1548480	Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain. It is okay that you lash out at me. You do this because
1548480	1553280	I am you and you are reflecting yourself hate to me. I am strong and will be here for you forever
1553280	1558640	and no matter what. This is my intention as a human being to help others love Buck Angel.
1558640	1563360	And then the caption, suffering. That is why the trans community lashes out at each other.
1563360	1568400	I am very aware of the hate towards me by some in the community. They hate on me and others because
1568400	1573440	they are hurt. And those were exactly the words I needed to hear at that moment. So I commented a
1573440	1578960	heart and then Buck DMed me and he said, I love you. And I was like, Sempai noticed me. And so
1578960	1584320	I said, I love you back. Then when I was working on Opulence, I needed a voice actor to do a line
1584320	1588960	from John Waters book. And it was my co-director Theron who suggested, don't you think Buck Angel
1588960	1592720	sounds kind of like John Waters? And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta. Let's see if he
1592720	1598160	wants to do it. And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel as John Waters in the video credits,
1598160	1605520	like a trans icon playing a gay icon in my head. It was just so, well, iconic. So I got in touch
1605520	1609920	with Buck about the line and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it. So here it is. The 10 second
1609920	1615760	voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life. One must remember there is such a thing as good,
1615760	1622000	bad taste and bad, bad taste. To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.
1622960	1628000	That's it, children. That's why mommy's canceled. Now I was aware at the time that trans Twitter
1628000	1633760	hated Buck Angel, but my thinking was, well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity and
1633760	1638400	they certainly hate me. So I wasn't going to let that stop me. Little did I know,
1638400	1642960	quite how vicious things were about to get. Now, so far, I've been telling this story from my
1642960	1647440	point of view, but I do want to give a fair and balanced account. So I want to pause and
1647440	1652640	contextualize why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much they're willing to cancel anyone
1652640	1657200	who even associates with him. Basically, it all goes back to this old debate in the trans community
1657200	1663280	known today and Tumblr lingo as true scum versus trans trenders. So true scum are trans people who
1663280	1668960	distinguish between true trans people and fake trans people who they call trenders or two cutes.
1668960	1673840	Usually true scum think that what it is to be trans is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,
1673840	1677840	to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery, and to socially
1677840	1682720	reassimilate into your target binary gender. So male or female. Anyone who's not that,
1682720	1687600	according to true scum, must either be a confused teenager, someone just trying to get attention,
1687600	1693040	someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans in a word, a trender. So that's
1693040	1697680	a vige of transness that usually excludes non-binary people as well as people who don't
1697680	1701920	want to medically transition for whatever reason. And for that reason, this view is sometimes also
1701920	1706480	called trans medicalism. True scum obviously being the derogatory term for these people.
1706480	1711520	So true scum are very hated by a lot of trans people because their viewpoint is that not all
1711520	1716960	trans identities are valid and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be true scum. So the next
1716960	1723520	question to ask is, is this true? Is Buck Angel in fact true scum? Now my honest answer to that
1723520	1728480	question is, I don't know. He's certainly said some things that sound like things true scum say,
1728480	1733440	I'll give you that. A point he likes to make a lot is that he's transsexual, not transgender.
1733440	1738320	And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as transsexual implies that you want to
1738320	1744080	pursue medical transition. So hormones and surgery and transgender doesn't imply that. And people
1744080	1748880	associate this I'm transsexual not transgender thing with true scum because true scum often
1748880	1754240	call themselves transsexuals and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual isn't really trans. And
1754240	1758400	often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders, especially certain trans
1758400	1767520	medicalist YouTubers like Vanessa LeBlanc and Too Cute Smasher 9000. Too Cute Smasher 9000.
1767520	1776160	Roast me back Calvin I dare you. But I think it's important to keep in mind that the term
1776160	1781760	true scum is a product of the 2014 tumblr wars and trying to apply it to trans people of an older
1781760	1786960	generation can sometimes be misleading. Like when Buck Angel transitioned the word transsexual
1786960	1791760	was just the word for his identity and he still identifies that way. So when younger trans people
1791760	1796240	tell him it's wrong to use the word transsexual he feels like these ungrateful millennials are
1796240	1800720	invalidating his identity and I do understand where he's coming from with that. But I also
1800720	1805520	understand why a lot of non binary people are skeptical about Buck. Like he says again and again
1805520	1810560	I'm transsexual not transgender like don't mix me up with those people and that eagerness to
1810560	1816000	separate himself from transgender people it comes across as hostility. Like I don't think he's ever
1816000	1821120	actually said that non binary people aren't valid but I personally don't like that he seems like he
1821120	1826080	wants to distance himself from them. And that's my disagreement with Buck it's not that he invalidates
1826080	1830960	non-binary identities because I don't really see him doing that. And if he was doing that I would
1830960	1834720	have seen it because for the last two months a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me
1834720	1839840	problematic Buck Angel tweets. But as someone who cares a lot about non-binary people and who
1839840	1844880	loves the non-binary people in my life it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.
1844880	1849360	And I hope he listens to this criticism because I think it would be cool if he got better about
1849360	1854000	this. Of course Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people and I
1854000	1857760	agree it's important that we can make those distinctions and talk about the differences
1857760	1863040	when they're relevant. But I also think that as a community trans people benefit from unity not
1863040	1867280	division. Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people they're not
1867280	1871920	going to care if you're transsexual transgender non-binary or gender non-conforming they're going
1871920	1876080	to discriminate against you regardless. So we're all in this together and there's a lot of
1876080	1881040	disagreements among us and we often don't get along so well but politically I think we should
1881040	1885840	work together as much as possible instead of splitting into little factions because we share
1885840	1890560	most of the same interests. And I think the best way to do that is to build bridges instead of
1890560	1894640	burning them and that's why I'm willing to work with people like Buck Angel who I have some
1894640	1899920	disagreements with. It creates a connection you know and having that connection can lead to
1899920	1904320	communication and build understanding. Also I need all the connections I can get Gorg I am
1904320	1910480	very lonely. It's not a joke it's true. Now I get that some people have views that are so
1910480	1915200	harmful that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous. But in any case I didn't even give
1915200	1920560	Buck a platform to share his opinions I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator. A bunch
1920560	1924800	of people on my subreddit were like why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines? Well
1924800	1929280	first of all I don't actually know John but I just have a feeling he would write me off as some kind
1929280	1935520	of trashy millennial SJW. Like why is Buck Angel cancelled but John Waters isn't? Well because
1935520	1939760	trans twitter does not know who John Waters is and let's try to keep it that way. I actually
1939760	1944320	mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John and he told me that he and John have actually
1944320	1952240	watched Buck Angel's porn together so plot twist. Okay so trans twitter won't forgive me unless I
1952240	1957040	condemn Buck Angel as true scum and apologize for ever working with him. But I'm not going to do
1957040	1961760	that because I don't think it would be the right thing to do and doing it just to get myself
1961760	1967120	uncancelled would be cowardly. I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree with Buck's divisive
1967120	1971680	rhetoric about transsexual versus transgender. I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender
1971680	1975520	umbrella instead of trying to distance himself from the rest. And I'm happy to hear at the
1975520	1979520	perspective of non-binary people who don't trust him because I totally get where they're coming
1979520	1985520	from and I think that's valid. But I also respect the decades of good activism Buck Angel has done
1985520	1990400	for trans people and I am grateful to him for that. And in light of that I'm willing to give
1990400	1995600	him the benefit of the doubt about where his heart is and express my criticism in a more measured way
1995600	2001200	than just attacking who he is as a person. But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible
2001200	2007280	person because this is the strategy they've chosen to establish that I am a horrible person.
2007280	2011200	And if the true scum allegation isn't strong enough to prove it, oh they have other pieces
2011200	2016800	of evidence to fall back on to hold up their conclusion. For example, here's a tweet claiming,
2016800	2021600	Natalie is trying so fucking hard to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did
2021600	2027040	was write a few iffy tweets and that's just so fucking far from the truth. Dude launched a
2027040	2032640	targeted tabloid harassment campaign outing a trans woman against her will with a specific intent
2032640	2037280	of causing her physical, emotional, and professional harm. The shorter way of saying that is that he
2037280	2043280	wanted to make her suffer and she very well could have been killed. Yikes. This ain't it chief.
2043280	2048480	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look. Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.
2048480	2053840	Disappointing. It sounds pretty serious. Let's investigate. Here's what I've managed to piece
2053840	2059440	together. Scene 1. The year is 2003. Los Angeles, where the movie world, the porn world, and the
2059440	2066000	BDSM scene come together in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal, and transsexualism. La La Land. Dramatas
2066000	2072880	Persanay. Buck Angel, transsexual porn star. Ilse Strix, dominatrix, then wife of Buck Angel.
2072880	2078000	Lana Wieczowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix, at the time not yet out as a
2078000	2084080	transgender woman. The synopsis is that Ilse Strix and Buck Angel's marriage ended after Ilse had an
2084080	2088960	affair with Lana Wieczowski, who was not yet out as trans. So Buck was understandably upset about
2088960	2094160	the affair and in what seems like a petty act of revenge told a series of magazines that this
2094160	2100400	celebrity director Wieczowski was a cross-dresser who had stolen his wife, which I guess was the
2100400	2106560	information he had at the time. So is that outing a trans woman against her will? Well in retrospect
2106560	2111120	it seems like it, though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time. But to really
2111120	2115120	get to the bottom of this, we have to do some digging. We have to trawl through the dirty
2115120	2119760	details of trans people's personal histories, which I've noticed is one of the internet's favorite
2119760	2127200	activities. So I actually went on eBay and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991 January 2006
2127200	2135600	and I'm finally able to reveal that the seller cancelled the order. God damn it.
2135600	2140800	But I was finally able to track down and translate a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article
2140800	2148240	from the Wayback Machine and I'm finally able to expose the truth. Stop. Freeze exactly where you
2148240	2153280	are. Take a look at yourself and what all of us have been doing for the last 30 seconds. Who does
2153280	2159120	this behavior remind you of? If your answer is social justice advocates fighting for trans equality,
2159120	2163280	you are incorrect. If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people,
2164000	2170960	I am very suspicious of anyone whose online behavior prompts me to dig through articles
2170960	2176080	full of dead names and sorted scandals involving trans people from almost two decades ago. This is
2176080	2181360	very similar to techniques used against trans people by internet fascists. So I'm pretty
2181360	2185680	suspicious of anyone pushing this kind of investigation. How can you tell the difference
2185680	2191040	between a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar and a Nazi pretending to be a trans
2191040	2197520	anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar? Well, you can't. Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,
2197520	2203120	whether it's on 4chan or Twitter. So unless Buck Angel, Ilse Strix, or Lana Wachowski gets in touch
2203120	2209200	with me and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason they want me to publicly dig up their 17
2209200	2215600	year old divorce drama, this is none of my fucking business. And it's none of yours either. So shut
2215600	2226080	up and go back to Keeley Farms where you belong. Let's Irish up this tea.
2230320	2237600	Doesn't work as well with tea. So, setting aside any tabloid drama that may have happened during
2237600	2245520	the Bush administration, I'm saying this in a cuntiest way and they deserve it. They fucking
2245520	2252400	deserve the cuntiness. I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom. I'm a lady.
2252400	2258080	She's a woman. The main argument against me usually references a collage of Buck Angel's
2258080	2263600	problematic tweets. And this is supposed to be definitive evidence that he is a horrible person
2263600	2269280	and therefore that I am a horrible person for collaborating with him. Well, here's the thing
2269280	2275360	though. A collage of problematic tweets does not define a person. And I'm very used to being
2275360	2281360	defined that way myself so I know how unfair it can be. Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,
2281360	2286080	a lot of people on Twitter were already calling me truscum. That's been going on a year and a half
2286080	2290960	now. And anytime my name comes up on Twitter, a bunch of people respond saying Natalie is truscum,
2291040	2295520	Natalie is a trans medicalist, Natalie hates non-binary people, and you should really think
2295520	2300640	what kind of message you're sending to your trans and non-binary followers by platforming her. And
2300640	2306400	if the person defends me or argues back in any way, they say, I can't believe you're ignoring
2306400	2311360	the valid concerns of marginalized people. You know, they're weaponizing their marginalized
2311360	2317280	status as trans people to isolate and attack another trans person. And sometimes this stuff
2317280	2322080	gets to my head too. I start asking myself, wait, am I a trans medicalist? Do I really
2322080	2328480	believe all these awful things they say I believe? But the answer is no, I just don't. These things
2328480	2334720	they're saying about me are 100% not true. You know, believe marginalized people is a norm that
2334720	2340560	is encouraged in leftist spaces for good reason, much like believe victims or believe women. And
2340560	2346160	these norms were established to counterbalance the mainstream tendency, which is not to listen
2346240	2352240	to marginalized people or to victims or to women. But any norm can be abused. And the blunt fact of
2352240	2359120	the matter is sometimes marginalized people are wrong. Sometimes people calling themselves victims
2359120	2365600	are obscuring a more complicated situation. And it's even happened once or twice that a woman
2366160	2373920	has lied. And the accusation that I'm truscum is simply false. I mean, first of all, I don't even
2374000	2378560	think of my own transgenderism as a medical disorder, much less everyone else's. I have,
2378560	2385040	of course, collaborated with Dr. Spiegel at all, but I will not have my artistry reduced to mere
2385040	2395920	medicine. Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people is just no, no, no. My thinking
2395920	2400560	about trans identity has always been informed by non-binary people. I used to identify as
2400560	2405440	non-binary myself before I medically transitioned. And some of the closest people to me in my life
2405440	2412400	today are non-binary trans people, some of whom are also transsexuals incidentally. It's complicated.
2412400	2416720	I've also made at least five videos on this channel arguing for the validity of non-binary
2416720	2422400	gender identities going back more than three years. So that's five out of around 50 videos or
2422400	2427600	10% of the content I've made on this channel is about non-binary identity. A few months ago,
2427600	2432480	I even made a 30-minute video called Transtrenders, which uses character dialogue to show what I
2432480	2437040	think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism. But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter
2437040	2442160	saying that I'm truscum who hates non-binary people. And their main piece of evidence for that
2442160	2447920	is a collage of my problematic tweets. So let's take a look at that. Here's the three tweets that
2447920	2452880	I usually see scrapbooked together as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people. This is the
2452880	2457520	first one from September 2018. Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread so you can't
2457520	2462080	even see what I'm talking about. I'm sure this is not the experience of many Enbies. Envy means
2462080	2467520	non-binary people. I leave it to them to articulate what Envy existence looks like in a binary world.
2467520	2473360	I do not and I cannot speak for them. But surely an account, god I used to write like such a nerd,
2473360	2479040	but surely an account that begins and ends with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2479040	2484640	is pretty weak. Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread that that tweet has been clipped out of,
2484640	2489360	I was defending myself from accusations that my most recent video at the time,
2489360	2495520	The Aesthetic, was anti-non-binary. In that video, there's a character named Justine who defends a
2495520	2500160	version of the performativity theory of gender. And basically I made this video to express some
2500160	2505040	angst I was feeling about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye. This was a very
2505040	2509600	one year on hormones moment for me. And I've already moved on in my thinking. At that time,
2509600	2514960	I was very, um, my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times or else I'm not really a
2514960	2519680	woman. My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men who resemble my father.
2521680	2525680	And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows that most of us go through a stage like
2525680	2531680	this at some point. And some YouTubers never get out of it. But personally, I mean these days,
2531680	2536240	it doesn't matter what I wear. It's when I dream their Lily's dreams.
2538640	2543040	Dragging the Danish girl. Well, fuck the Danish. I could never abide that sort of person. We all
2543040	2546480	know what I'm talking about. You can tell the whiskey is getting to me because I'm
2547600	2552720	being bigoted against the Danish. These things come out, you know, you get honest, you get real
2553440	2557920	when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system. Did I just fucking put lipstick outside
2557920	2564400	the fucking lip liner? This is all Lily's fault. Lily Alba. Fuck her dreams. Uh, the point is when
2564400	2568720	I was making the aesthetic, I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people. And people will say that
2568720	2575360	the fact that not every video I make references non-binary people is itself and be phobic. As I've
2575360	2583200	said about one in 10 of my videos is about non-binary identity, but not all of them are. And I feel
2583200	2588720	entitled to make some videos that are just about trans women. But still, some people on Twitter
2588720	2595520	were saying that the character Justine is a transmedicalist. And because she maybe wins the
2595520	2602560	fictional debate in the video, I, Natalie Wynn, am therefore a transmedicalist. Here's the thing,
2602560	2607920	though. The performativity theory of gender, the one that Justine defends in that video, is
2608800	2615120	conceptually as far away from transmedicalism as it is possible to be. Transmedicalism says that
2615120	2620240	trans identity is biological, it's neurological, it's hormonal, it's diagnosable and treatable.
2620240	2626800	Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture, it's expression, it's performance, it's a
2626800	2634240	social phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomenon. Performativity
2634240	2639120	makes no reference to gender dysphoria or to any kind of medical concept at all. So whereas
2639120	2645680	transmedicalism is a kind of bio-essentialism, performativity is a kind of social constructionism.
2645680	2652320	So these are exact opposite theories of gender. Are you following along, class? I'm not ready to
2652320	2657920	drink Jameson tea until I die. But some trans people felt invalidated by things Justine says
2657920	2664000	in that video. And transmedicalism is another thing that makes them feel invalidated. So they
2664000	2669920	decided that Justine is a transmedicalist and therefore that I am a transmedicalist. And this
2669920	2676720	is literally just bad media comprehension. Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video
2676720	2681680	that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult. And so much of the negative response
2681680	2687440	to that video is just pure emotion. I always hear, I don't care what you intended, trans people were
2687440	2693040	hurt by that video. You hurt trans people. But here's the thing, just because you were hurt by
2693040	2698480	content I made doesn't mean that the content is bad or that I'm victimizing you in some way.
2698480	2704320	I'll give an example. I did a stream a couple years ago with a BDSM and kink activist. We're
2704320	2711040	talking about various kinks and we got to DDLG, which is Daddy Don Little Girl. Basically when
2711040	2716880	consenting adults roleplay age difference and the power dynamic that comes with that. And me and
2716880	2722880	this kink activists were just casually discussing what DDLG is, what it isn't, when I noticed
2722880	2727200	someone in the chat was starting to totally freak out. They were typing in all caps like,
2727200	2732880	my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me. Why are you defending my abuser? I can't believe you'd
2732880	2738240	betray me like this. Please stop taking my abuser's side. Please stop. I'm begging you. This was
2738240	2743440	actually really fucking upsetting to me because this person was clearly in a lot of pain. They
2743440	2748480	were having a panic attack because they were having a trauma trigger reaction to this
2748480	2753280	conversation. And I kept telling them to leave the stream and take care of themselves, but they
2753280	2759200	wouldn't do it. So I had to block them and then later get in touch and make sure they were okay.
2759200	2765600	Now, was their pain very real? Yes. Was it triggered by the content I was streaming?
2766240	2773120	Yes. But does that mean I did anything wrong? No. Is it wrong to talk about kink and contacts
2773120	2778800	where it's clear you're going to be talking about kink? No. But when you produce content
2778800	2783440	online that's going to be viewed by thousands or millions of people, there's always some people
2783440	2788640	out there who are going to be hurt by it. So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made
2788640	2795600	is somehow immoral, I think you need more of an argument than just people were hurt. All right,
2795600	2800720	back to the tweet. To this day, people quote tweet the sentence, but surely an account that begins
2800720	2804960	and ends with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one is pretty weak. And they claim
2804960	2810160	this is evidence that I'm true scum or that I think people have to prove their identity somehow,
2810160	2815840	which is not at all what I was saying in that thread. What I was saying is if you're trying to
2815840	2821920	persuade a skeptic that trans identity is valid, simply saying I'm not a man because I don't
2821920	2827440	identify as one isn't a very good argument, which it isn't. I mean, no one has ever been persuaded
2827440	2832800	by that so far as I'm aware. That said, I do now disagree with the mindset I had when I tweeted
2832800	2838320	this. Back then, I still delusionally believed that it was possible to rationally explain why
2838320	2843600	trans identity is valid. And I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument than this is how I
2843600	2848480	identify you have to believe me no further questions. But I no longer believe there can't
2848480	2852800	be any rational justification of gender identity, which is another reason I'm not a trans
2852800	2858160	medicalist. Trans medicalism tries to be a rational theory about why trans identity is valid,
2858160	2862880	and I don't think it succeeds as that. I don't think anything does. My current opinion about
2862880	2869520	this is that I'm not a man because I don't identify as one is as good or rather as bad an argument as
2869520	2876240	any. You know, some things in life just can't be rationally explained. Like love. Why do you love
2876240	2881520	the person you love? Well, because you love them. You could write a poem about it or some gay shit
2881520	2889040	like that, but you can't give any actual arguments. And why am I a woman? Because I'm a woman. That's
2889040	2894160	it. I mean, I can describe my experiences and my feelings to you to help you understand better,
2894160	2899920	but I can't logically prove anything. And I'm super fucking sorry if you can't handle that
2899920	2905520	mankind was set adrift in an absurd world that must be super fucking hard for you. Tell me all
2905520	2911920	about it. Next, please. Okay, again, we're mid thread with missing context, but the tweet says,
2911920	2916800	whereas I've met 20 year olds in full on boy mode who are like, hi, I'm a trans woman. She,
2916800	2923600	her pronouns. So I guess by including this tweet in the ContraPoints is problematic collage,
2923600	2929200	people are implying that I don't think it's valid for someone who presents male to identify as a
2929200	2934560	woman and request she, her pronouns. Well, that's not true. I was surprised when I first experienced
2934560	2940800	this, but I think it's valid. Next. Okay. Mid thread, no context once again, but now you go
2940800	2946000	into these leftist discord slash Facebook groups and like 20 to 30% identify as some flavor of
2946000	2952000	trans. Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals. That seems to be the future. Okay.
2952000	2958000	Well, it's true that many leftist discord servers are like this, but reading this back, I don't like
2958000	2963760	the way the phrase conventional binary transsexuals is hitting my ear. I can see how it could imply
2963840	2969360	that non-binary identities are somehow new fangled, which isn't true. There's been non-binary
2969360	2974480	people for longer than there's been medical transsexuals. In fact, so we'll call this a
2974480	2980240	bad tweet. I apologize for tweeting it and I apologize to any non-binary people who felt
2980240	2987120	trivialized by it. Okay. This is the big one. This tweet got its own article in the fucking guardian.
2987120	2990800	You know, I really wish people would pay less attention to the tweets. I spent 30 seconds
2990800	2996160	writing and a little more attention to the videos that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making.
2996960	3001200	Anyway, let's look at the tweet. This is the most scrutinized paragraph I've ever written.
3001200	3006720	And it's so mediocre. This has happened to me before in hyper woke spaces. Like it's me and a
3006720	3011360	bunch of cis women, and we all have to go in a circle saying she, her, because I'm there.
3011360	3015920	There's this paradox where I can go to a sports bar in North Carolina and be miss mammed all night.
3015920	3020960	No question, but in self-consciously trans inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns
3020960	3026000	and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves every time they say you guys. I guess it's good
3026000	3030720	for people who use they them only and want only gender neutral language, but it comes at the minor
3030720	3037120	expense of semi passable trans is like me. And that's super fucking hard for us. So people
3037120	3043920	interpreted this tweet as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns, which I'm literally
3043920	3048960	just not. Like I've actually been the person who initiates the pronoun circle many times.
3048960	3055440	The backstory of this tweet is basically that I once got triggered in a situation where I was
3055440	3060960	with a bunch of cis women and we all had to go around saying our pronouns and like a typical
3060960	3067280	triggered train, I tiptoed over to Twitter to tip tap, type it out. But here's the thing,
3067280	3071920	by the end of this thread, I had already talked myself away from the initial frustration I was
3071920	3077360	expressing. If you know my videos in my voice, then you know me saying it comes at the minor
3077360	3086160	expense of semi passable trans is in that super fucking hard for us is sarcastic. It's a minor
3086160	3093360	expense. It's not actually very hard for us. Gorge. It's fine. But people on Twitter don't
3093360	3101760	watch my videos and they don't get sarcasm. So people flipped out over this. I was getting drag
3101920	3108720	and I made the poor decision to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting, which 100% of
3108720	3115200	the time is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid. So me and my dumb brain did another
3115200	3119440	short thread trying to clarify what I was saying and defending my right to talk about my own
3119440	3126080	experiences. That didn't make things any better. So in a state of anger and frustration, I tweeted
3126080	3131520	out yet another thread. And this time I said some truly stupid things, including the now
3131520	3139040	infamous line. I sometimes feel like the last of the old school transsexuals. I honestly don't
3139040	3144480	know what the fuck I was even trying to say. I don't feel like the last of the old school
3144480	3151120	transsexuals. I don't even know what that means. I guess I basically meant that offline, I don't
3151120	3156720	have any radical aspirations. You know, I want to be inconspicuous. I want to blend in. And that's
3156720	3162080	what I meant by old school. You know, I want people to assume my pronouns. You know, it's funny because
3162080	3167600	it is very different from the way I am online where I'm totally shameless and open. I'm like
3167600	3175280	sexual confession, everybody sexual confession. I have abnormal urges. It's 1am. My neighbors can
3175280	3181360	definitely hear that. They know I have abnormal urges now. They already knew that. But offline,
3181360	3188960	I'm an inconspicuous pussy, like a total coward. So this was a rage thread. And I apologize for
3188960	3200640	tweeting it. Let's go back to Bug Angel. I'm kind of a conscientious objector to the practice of
3200640	3205680	condemning someone based on a collage of their worst tweets taken out of context. But I definitely
3205680	3210800	do have anxiety about this. Like, I think I'm doing the right thing by not condemning Buck as
3210800	3217200	true scum and evil, but I mean, I could be wrong. What if I am basically sacrificing myself for the
3217200	3222720	sake of a person who really is as bad as Twitter says? Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet fuck non-binary
3222720	3229520	people and then I'll have fucked up. This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me. But I do
3229600	3236400	believe that by refusing to participate in the anti-Buck Angel pylon, I am erring on the morally
3236400	3241440	safer side of things. Because even if he is a little true scummy, excommunicating him from the
3241440	3246560	trans community is still probably not the best approach to take. In my experience, when people
3246560	3252320	accept binary but not non-binary trans people, it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation
3252320	3257440	to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance. And I'll give you a couple examples.
3257440	3263280	The first time I was ever cancelled, like totally trashed on Twitter, was back in 2017,
3263280	3268000	when I had not yet medically transitioned, and at the time, I identified as non-binary.
3268000	3274720	And at VidCon 2017, I met up with a YouTuber named June, who had made some videos where she
3274720	3281120	basically mocked the idea of non-binary people. And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June,
3281120	3285520	and some other people, but let's keep them out of it. And people on Twitter totally dragged me
3285520	3289280	for being a peak liberal bootlicker who's best friends with transphobic abusers.
3290800	3296400	Christ. Fucking people, man. It's so fucking frustrating. And you know, I'm not gonna
3296400	3300000	claim I changed June's mind because I don't know what her thought process was,
3300000	3305600	but I did talk to her about non-binary identity, and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.
3305600	3307520	And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.
3307520	3312720	Aaaah!
3312720	3318880	Example two. A couple months later, I did a live stream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber
3318880	3327120	named, um, what was her name? Sharon? Sharon? Was it Sharon? I guess she's just not a very
3327120	3332320	memorable person. Anyway, she had made some videos saying that non-binary identities aren't real,
3332320	3336720	but I gave her a chance, and she surprised me by being super compassionate and thoughtful.
3336800	3340960	By the end of that stream, she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity. So again,
3340960	3345360	the point is not that I'm some kind of persuasive genius. If I was a persuasive genius, maybe I
3345360	3351040	could talk myself out of being canceled. The point is that sometimes, people who seem ignorant or
3351040	3356640	hateful just need to be given a non-judgmental space to learn and grow and think. And to just
3356640	3361440	condemn them as hopeless bigots actually prevents that growth from happening. And Sharon, despite
3361440	3366320	her, you know, totally forgettable personality, turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.
3366320	3370640	Like later on, she actually made an apology video to non-binary people, and I became good
3370640	3374880	friends with her, and we worked together on most of the videos I've made this year. You know,
3374880	3378960	until she ruined my life by recommending a cancelled John Waters impersonator. I guess
3378960	3384000	the moral is never talk to people you disagree with. It will only lead to pain.
3384000	3398240	I do think there's something off with my hormone dose. Like, I'm crying three times a day. Oh,
3398240	3402640	and I can't come unless there's vibrators in at least three of my holes. It happens like once a
3402640	3407040	month, there has to be a full moon. I honestly only still bother because it numbs the pain for
3407040	3411920	a few moments. What I'm trying to say is I really do believe in conversation, which means hearing
3411920	3415840	out multiple perspectives. I don't want my audience to get all their information about trans
3415840	3420880	people from me, and I think it's important to listen to criticism. So I encourage my audience
3420880	3425920	to go watch some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel. For
3425920	3432320	example, go check out non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me, and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's
3432320	3438960	video about Buck Angel. I think YouTube, as a platform, is better at producing criticism
3438960	3444080	rather than canceling. And I think that's because, at least in the vlog format,
3444080	3449760	making a video forces you to confront the fact that you're a human being with a face and a name
3449760	3454400	who can be held accountable for the things that you say. But people on Twitter, it's a different
3454400	3458720	story, and I think it's time we take a look at what canceling really is. I've given you enough
3458720	3463680	context now for you to understand what I'm about to show you, which is what I saw on my timeline
3463680	3469360	every day for nearly a month. All these tweets are from the aftermath of my uploading Opulence
3469360	3474480	two months ago, when the Buck Angel scandal first broke. And someone better hold my hand now,
3474480	3482400	because this gets ugly. Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints after her bigging up and
3482400	3487280	collaborating with notable turf favorite and true scum Buck Angel, you're no friend to gender
3487280	3493280	non-conforming, non-passing, and non-binary trans people. Fuck her, and fuck her fucking rift.
3493280	3498720	I am absolutely furious right now. Weird how I'm 30 and trans and manage not to be a true scum,
3498720	3503120	maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly. Or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat fucking
3503120	3507920	tapo who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth. Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,
3507920	3514000	I just want to say fuck ContraPoints, her sycophantic stance, and all her bread tube chums who close
3514000	3518480	ranks to protect her after she throws the rest of the trans community under the bus for profit.
3518480	3523040	Natalie Wynn is a fucking grifter. ContraPoints videos are now just style over substance,
3523040	3527840	so that explains why she took the turf ideology so well. ContraPoints working with true scum now
3527840	3532880	definitively proves that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints just hates enbies,
3532880	3537440	and are also true scum. Legit gonna start on following peeps that continue to follow ContraPoints
3537440	3542480	at this point. Do know my wording of pretty much everyone. I know there are some that were probably
3542480	3548080	blindsided by this somehow. So long as you know that ContraPoints is true scum, you're safe
3548080	3553440	and cool. Eat shit, Natalie. For someone who used to identify as genderqueer, we expected more from
3553440	3558880	you, but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass, it's hard to consider others. ContraPoints,
3558880	3563920	more like disappoints. That's a good one. If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.
3563920	3570640	Fuck fuck, angel. Fuck ContraPoints. Fuck any real transsexual. Fuck your grift. Here's what
3570640	3576720	hashtag ContraPoints stands don't understand. If Natalie refuses to accept that she has an apology
3576800	3582400	to make and continues profiting from it, it will become our responsibility to work on deplatforming
3582400	3588240	her just like every other racist, sexist, bigoted content creator. No one has actually suggested or
3588240	3592880	attempted to actually cancel her, but the longer this goes on without an apology and commitment to
3592880	3598160	do better, the stronger the case becomes for actively working to deplatform her. So in other
3598160	3605040	words, no one has suggested we cancel her, but we should cancel her. Great. Can everyone finally
3605040	3610480	agree that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can? Here I am, sweetie. ContraPoints
3610480	3616480	collaborating with Angel Buck. Angel Buck. Thanks for letting us all know that you had no idea who
3616480	3622160	he even was until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about. ContraPoints collaborating with
3622160	3628240	Angel Buck, a trans medicalist who once outed a trans person to try and destroy them and supporting
3628240	3634000	him because he looks and sounds like a proper man, isn't a small itty bitty tipsy topsy fucking
3634000	3639200	mistake. This is a huge deal. ContraPoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.
3640400	3645520	We have a Hitler comparison. Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today. And y'all would
3645520	3651440	be like, oh, well, she's just a little flawed, you know, fuck off. Can Natalie Wynn stop being
3651440	3656560	a coward and commit to being a trans med? It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.
3656560	3661680	Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat who refuses to take accountability. Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn
3661680	3667680	does not support non-binary people. Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person. My God. Every cis and
3667680	3673360	not non-binary person who thought Natalie Wynn wasn't trans med now owes me and every non-binary
3673360	3679120	person $50. Joe Biden has a better position on the validity of non-binary gender than ContraPoints.
3679120	3684960	My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks a lot and I don't like her. I hate ContraPoints so
3684960	3692720	goddamn much. It's unbelievable. ContraPoints be like, it's a very good impression of me. You're
3692720	3698240	doing very good, sweetie. You're doing very, very good. Buck Angel is a turf apologizer, boot looker,
3698240	3704320	and true scum. Any association with him must be seen as hostile to the trans community as a whole,
3704320	3710800	let alone denial of non-binary existence. That's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand?
3710880	3718880	And here we fucking are, dude. Buck fucking Angel on ContraPoints. Eat my entire ass.
3721200	3728560	What? This is Natalie. Natalie is a trans medicalist. This is Natalie's friend Lindsay. Lindsay is a
3728560	3734800	left-tuber. Natalie and Lindsay are still friends because Natalie and Lindsay are both cowards.
3735360	3740480	Left-tuber is a grip. Oh, and they made me the man. The shade. Issues that arose with
3741520	3745840	being in Contra's new video. Her video on turfs make no sense now. Her video on trans
3745840	3750960	trenders make no sense now. You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel totally
3750960	3755600	contradicts the videos I spent hundreds of hours making, do you think maybe your interpretation
3755600	3761200	could be wrong? Apparently not. Her apology is completely void, sends a message that she hates
3761200	3766000	non-binary people. She is reckless with her content. Positive said arose from Buck Angel
3766000	3772240	being in Contra's new video. She, uh, has four hundred thousand dollars this month from Patreon.
3773440	3779840	Four hundred thousand. This number is completely made up. Like, it is exponentially wrong. Four
3779840	3785120	hundred thousand dollars. Four hundred thousand dollars a month. Hot take. ContraPoints is the
3785120	3790160	leftist PewDiePie. Personally, I like to characterize her as the Blair White Wolf and
3790160	3795840	leftist sheep's clothing. Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit who still has not
3795840	3801600	apologized for platforming Truscum and is actively taking their side. Anyway, if you still support
3801600	3807600	ContraPoints, get the hell away from me. Pee pee poo poo. I'm ContraPoints and I can't stop being
3807600	3815840	a trans medicalist and shitting myself in public. Valid criticisms of marginalized people. Fuck
3815840	3822640	ContraPoints. Fuck Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints
3822640	3828560	is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Truscum. ContraPoints is a Trus- You know, when you repeat the same
3828560	3833200	fucking sentence over and over again, it doesn't- you don't even repeat the same sentence over and
3833200	3839120	over again. It actually doesn't get more persuasive. In fact, it might get less persuasive
3839120	3845120	because true things usually only have to be said once. If you still support ContraPoints,
3845120	3850080	unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again. In conclusion,
3850080	3853360	fuck Natalie Wynn and fuck everything she has to say.
3864000	3870160	Okay, let's get started. So, that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.
3870160	3877040	And all of this, let me remind you, is over a 10 second voiceover clip in a 48 minute video
3877040	3883840	about a completely unrelated topic. Like, how do you work? How do you create when a decision so
3883840	3889200	trivial can become the main event for weeks of your life? And the tweets are just the beginning.
3889200	3893360	After that, there's the Reddit threads and the YouTube comments and the Facebook discourse and
3893360	3899040	the Medium posts and the Newsweek article. Opulence is a video me and Theron spent hundreds
3899040	3904560	of hours carefully piecing together. I think it's my best video. And to have the response to it
3904560	3910640	completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.
3910640	3915120	And it's left me with much less energy to create new things. But here's the thing,
3915120	3920160	people on Twitter saying mean things about me is not the worst of it, not even close.
3920160	3926240	Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist
3926240	3932720	content on a notoriously right wing platform. Sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things about
3932720	3937920	myself online. Most of you probably can't even begin to imagine how used to it I am.
3937920	3941920	And the way you psychologically survive in that situation is you block the people in
3941920	3947440	platforms who are harassing you and you pay it no mind. But there's some things you can't block.
3947440	3952640	And a big one is you can't block people from going after your friends and colleagues. And that is
3952640	3958080	exactly what people did to me at the height of the Buck Angel incident. Lindsay Ellis,
3958080	3963760	Ollie from PhilosophyTube, and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets demanding that they
3963760	3970480	publicly disown me, a person they've all been friends with for years or else. In response to
3970480	3975840	demands that she apologize, Lindsay released a statement where she said, I was not involved in
3975840	3981200	opulence. My name was mentioned in it, but I did not participate in the production. Therefore,
3981200	3987760	with regards to calls for me to apologize, I have to ask, apologize for what? There is only
3987760	3993680	one logical answer. Apologize for being friends with Natalie. And here's a response to her
3993680	3998800	statement. I don't need to consider you my fucking friend to disagree with beliefs you knowingly
3998800	4003680	solicit or allow on your platform. Same with Contra. It just means you're willing to allow
4003680	4009840	awful ideas to fester for the sake of financial gain, which is fine, but it makes you a piece of
4009920	4014320	shit. And here's a comment at Hbomberguy. I doubt that you were going to read this,
4014320	4018800	but can you please just tell us your thoughts on that whole situation so we could at least know
4018800	4025680	that you were on our side? We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all and cause BreadTube to go
4025680	4031520	into his schism as a result of this. Thank you. Nice YouTube channel you have, fair friend.
4031520	4038800	Would be a shame if someone canceled it. I'm so fucking sinister. Ollie of PhilosophyTube
4038800	4043600	released his own statement affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding,
4043600	4048400	Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxed, had my private life speculated on,
4048400	4052960	and my loved ones insulted. In recognizing the feelings of those who kindly raised their
4052960	4057680	concerns in a polite way, I do not wish to legitimize the great many people who use their
4057680	4063280	hurt as a cover for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior. And here are some responses to Ollie.
4063280	4067920	As a non-binary fan of yours, I'm disappointed in this non-apology.
4067920	4073600	Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for? Ever having associated with
4073600	4078480	me? Things we are going to criticize Ollie PhilosophyTube for. Being a sniveling,
4078480	4083040	hypocritical piece of shit, refusing to listen to trans people, actively,
4083040	4086960	openly, and repeatedly mocking the trans people he refuses to listen to.
4086960	4090320	Thanks for the apology. Now stop and door some contra points.
4090320	4096560	Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing is demanding that cis people publicly
4096560	4102640	condemn a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person. Does that strike
4102640	4108000	anyone else as wildly inappropriate? Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who is never publicly
4108000	4112960	associated with me, got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Ollie, you know,
4112960	4117520	after he made the post discussing being doxed and threatened. And just for that,
4117520	4123120	she gets put on the anime list. I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list of people that have stood
4123120	4128400	by contra points as she's continued to be a bigoted piece of shit. To which Mia responds,
4128400	4133760	stood by contra points, Jesus Christ. No matter what I do, people call me out and I'm not even
4133760	4138880	related to the video and I don't even know Natalie. The chain of guilt by association is so
4138880	4145680	long and twisted, I can barely even follow it. So they're going after Mia, who tweeted a heart at
4145680	4153040	Ollie, who failed to condemn me for my voiceover casting of Buck Angel, who was retweeted,
4153040	4158160	by a turf. We're only missing a couple degrees of separation before every living person on the
4158160	4163440	planet Earth is cancelled over the Buck Angel situation. And several colleagues of mine,
4163440	4168960	by the way, Lindsay Harry Ollie, they all took a financial hit over this. They've all lost some
4168960	4175760	Patreon support. One of Lindsay's former supporters even demanded a $38 lifetime refund saying,
4175760	4181440	Dear Lindsay, I'm sorry for being pushy, but I really am going to be needing a refund.
4181440	4186160	I gave money to your operation under the pretense that you wouldn't do anything morally
4186160	4191600	objectionable and supporting contra points and blaming us for taking issue with that is,
4191600	4197280	in my opinion, amoral. Please respond. I hope she's sent it to them in pennies.
4197280	4202720	So look, I'm very grateful to my colleagues for sticking by me through all this, but I'm also
4202720	4208640	aware that I'm becoming a burden to anyone who associates with me. I have no collaborators in
4208640	4214400	this video. I'm working on this totally alone because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right
4214400	4219760	now and I don't want to contaminate anyone else. During the height of this most recent canceling,
4219760	4225280	a creator I admire DMed me to let me know. I cut the shout out to you in my last video because I
4225280	4230320	was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors who are getting genuinely scary, but I wouldn't
4230320	4237280	want you to think I was disavowing you regardless of how many people are asking me to. Jesus Christ.
4237280	4242800	The situation here is that any cis person who defends me or even associates with me in any way
4242800	4248240	will be labeled a transphobe. Any binary trans person who associates with me will be branded an
4248240	4253440	enbyphobe. And any non-binary people who associate with me will be ostracized from their own
4253440	4259680	community. So in the internet I find myself increasingly alone. I'm isolated by the harassment.
4259680	4265520	And that is ultimately the point, to exile me from my community, from any community. And it's
4265520	4270480	all because I refuse to participate in doing exactly that to bug Angel. My experiences have
4270480	4276080	made me so disillusioned with the idea that social media callouts can lead to any kind of justice
4276080	4280960	that have essentially sworn off participating in them. There's a fairly prominent figure in
4280960	4287520	leftist politics who I could absolutely hashtag me to, but I'm never going to do it because I have
4287520	4293360	no faith left in the process of callout vigilante justice. And I'm not saying I'm totally against
4293440	4298800	me toing people, because I think in some cases it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.
4298800	4304720	But in my case, I feel like I just know too much about the dark side of social media shaming to
4304720	4309120	ever want to participate in it again. You know, I feel like the story would end up being taken out
4309120	4314640	of my control, warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways. It would end up just haunting
4314640	4321280	both me and the person I'd be accusing, which in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves.
4321280	4326080	So I'm just not willing to take that risk, except maybe in some very extreme situation,
4326080	4332160	which this just isn't. It's not worth it. And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep demanding
4332160	4338800	I condemn bug Angel to save myself from cancellation, no. I'm just not going to do that.
4338800	4344320	I'm a conscientious objector. I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this. Take me away, boys.
4344320	4356640	Ugh. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's bread tube videos.
4357200	4363680	Part eight and a half. The philosophy of being fucked in the ass. Ugh. I have done this to
4363680	4371920	YouTube and I'm sorry. So look, canceling is not criticism. It is not holding someone accountable.
4371920	4376640	It is an attack on a human being. In this video, I use the word canceling
4376640	4381840	more or less synonymously with what feminist Joe Freeman, author of the Bitch Manifesto,
4381840	4387200	calls trashing. And I've linked her essay, Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood,
4387200	4393520	and the description. It was originally published in Ms. Magazine in 1976, but it is a perfect
4393520	4399600	description of what goes on on trans Twitter today. It is not disagreement. It is not conflict. It is
4399600	4404960	not opposition. These are perfectly ordinary phenomena, which, when engaged in mutually,
4404960	4410640	honestly, and not excessively, are necessary to keep an organism or organization healthy and active.
4411280	4416080	Trashing is a particularly vicious form of character assassination which amounts to
4416080	4421440	psychological rape. It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive. It is occasionally
4421440	4426720	disguised by the rhetoric of honest conflict, or covered up by denying that any disapproval
4426720	4432640	exists at all, but it is not done to expose disagreements or resolve differences. It is done
4432640	4438160	to disparage and destroy. Whatever methods are used, trashing involves a violation of one's
4438160	4444160	integrity, a declaration of one's worthlessness, and an impugning of one's motives. In effect,
4444160	4450960	what is attacked is not one's actions or one's ideas, but one's self. And that's what
4450960	4456480	distinguishes trashing, bullying, or abuse from criticism, or holding accountable.
4456480	4461440	Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs. But when people are canceling me,
4461440	4466960	they're not bringing up my problematic tweets because they want me to revise my beliefs. No,
4466960	4472800	what they're doing is accumulating evidence to support the case they've decided to make
4472800	4478400	that I am a horrible person who must be shunned. You know, the only sense in which I am, as they
4478400	4485280	like to say, the new Blair White, is that I think I actually have now snatched Vanessa's crown as
4485280	4490960	the most hated tran on Tran Twitter. Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you. Feud with me,
4490960	4495200	god damn it. You can have a one-sided feud. I don't want to be one of those trans YouTubers
4495200	4500000	that just drags other trans people all day and they never respond. That would be really pathetic.
4500640	4505680	The new Lazy Green. That's the other one. The newest in a series of women you've decided to
4505760	4510560	treat like supervillains. Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hm? And supervillain
4511120	4518880	is the right word. Like, I'm the bad guy. Duh. I'm the enemy. And what you do with the enemy?
4518880	4524080	Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform, and destroy. As that one tweet put it,
4524080	4530000	that's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand? If you adequately demonstrate your searing
4530000	4536320	hatred of Natalie Wynn, then you're safe and cool. But if you don't, you're on the wrong side
4536320	4543120	of the line, sweaty. And you, too, are now the enemy. Cancel Culture, Trove 7. Dualism.
4543840	4549840	Certain ancient religions teach their followers to understand the cosmos as they struggle between
4549840	4555520	light and dark, good and evil. And cancel culture does more or less the same thing.
4555520	4561440	It's binary thinking. People are either good or they're bad. And to add to that essentialism,
4561440	4567200	if a person says or does a bad thing, we should interpret that as the mask slipping,
4567200	4572320	as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness. And anyone who wants to remain good
4572320	4578400	had better be willing to publicly condemn anyone the community has decided is bad.
4578400	4583520	There really is something dystopian about this. You have to be willing to accuse other people
4583520	4588720	to prove your own innocence. That's the line in the sand, folks. Where do you stand?
4588720	4593840	In the most extreme version of this, all bad people are equally bad. So collaborating with
4593840	4600000	truscum means you may as well be truscum. And, of course, being truscum is tantamount to being a
4600000	4607920	turf. And on trans Twitter, it is a known fact that turfs are Nazis. And this implies that Nazis,
4607920	4613360	turfs, truscum, people who associate with truscum, people who fail to condemn people who
4613360	4618160	associate with truscum, people who offer emotional support to people who fail to condemn people who
4618160	4624000	associate with truscum, all of them must be treated the same way. Deplatform her just like
4624000	4630320	every other racist, sexist, bigoted content creator. A fully wound backhand to the mouth.
4630320	4635840	I recently read a book by Sarah Shulman called Conflict is Not Abuse, overstating harm,
4635840	4640800	community responsibility, and the duty of repair. Basically Shulman's argument is that,
4640800	4647840	in various contexts, from romantic relationships to community infighting to international politics,
4647840	4654320	the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty and for escalating conflict.
4654320	4661440	So for example, and this is my example, not Shulman's, turfs fixate on the exaggerated danger
4661440	4666960	that trans women supposedly pose to cis women. And in very classic overstatement of harm,
4666960	4672320	they'll describe everything they don't like as rape. Trans women entering women's spaces
4672320	4678080	is rape. Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape. And then they use that exaggerated
4678080	4685040	harm as a justification to retaliate against them to dox and harass and shun. Well, the same
4685040	4691200	kind of logic is used to justify abusive behavior within the trans community. The dualistic thinking,
4691200	4697040	the essentialism, the pseudo moralism. All of this allows people on Twitter to treat me in an
4697040	4703040	obviously abusive way, all the while feeling like they're doing the right thing because they're
4703040	4708320	attacking the enemy. And I realize that some people will say that I'm the one who's overstating harm
4708320	4714000	to evade criticism. Well, look, you've seen the tweets, the furious demands for me to be exiled,
4714000	4718800	the doxing and threatening and ordering around of my colleagues, the attempts to isolate me from
4718800	4723600	my community, the attacks not on my actions, but on who I am as a person. There's not really
4723600	4728800	anything ambiguous about this. It's just abuse. But I don't think it feels like abuse to the
4728800	4735920	people who are doing it. They feel like they're punching up because I'm a celebrity with a
4735920	4741680	platform and lots of Twitter followers. And it's true that I do have more power than any of them
4741680	4748560	individually. But as a collective, they have a terrifying power that they don't seem to be aware
4748560	4754480	of as individuals. As John Ronson, author of a great book on public shaming, put it, I suppose
4754480	4759120	that when shamings are delivered like remotely administered drone strikes, nobody needs to think
4759120	4764800	about how ferocious our collective power might be. The snowflake never needs to feel responsible for
4764800	4769680	the avalanche. And that's how you get these situations where you have hundreds of people
4769680	4775040	endlessly bashing someone who's already been knocked to the ground and feeling all the while
4775040	4781120	like they're punching up. You know, there's actually a kind of power and safety in anonymity
4781120	4786800	and obscurity. And there are many ways that being a public figure makes you really vulnerable. For
4786800	4793120	example, you're more vulnerable to doxing, stalking and harassment on a scale that most people
4793120	4799120	probably can't even imagine. You're vulnerable to having your reputation permanently degraded
4799120	4804800	in a way that people who are posting anonymously or pseudonymously are pretty much invulnerable to.
4804800	4809280	And a lot of the people who are attacking me, they're not pausing to self reflect,
4809280	4813200	they're not holding themselves accountable for the consequences of their actions.
4813200	4817760	They're just venting their unfiltered rage. But in response to these attacks,
4818400	4824720	I as a powerful person with a platform, I'm not allowed to react like a human being. I'm not
4824720	4829600	allowed to get angry. I'm not allowed to show pain. I'm not allowed to get defensive. I'm not
4829600	4835920	allowed to lash out. All I'm allowed to do is go totally nama the inside as I try to frantically
4835920	4842160	calculate the ideal public relations response that pays due deference to the valid concerns of these
4842160	4848560	poor marginalized people, all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse that's crashing over
4848560	4854720	me. You know, people on Twitter, they don't try to persuade me like I'm a human being. They order
4854720	4860560	me around, they tell me what to believe, they demand that I say exactly what they want me to say
4860560	4866560	or else. It's extremely objectifying. They don't treat me like a person with my own opinions and
4866560	4873440	feelings. They treat me as this like brand of moral commodity to be consumed or denounced.
4873440	4878480	And this is all terribly ironic because of the conflicting demand that creators be
4878480	4883520	authentic all the time. One thing that always frustrates me about these situations
4883520	4889520	is there's this demand that you apologize instantly and there's this perception that
4889520	4895520	a fast apology is more sincere than a delayed one. But in fact, the opposite is true. It takes
4895520	4903040	longer than a couple hours to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow, seriously
4903040	4909600	reflect on what you may have done or said that was wrong. That can take days or weeks or months.
4909600	4915760	I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon and at the beginning of the stream I gave my
4915760	4924880	emotional half-formed reaction to the Buck Angel situation and some traitor on my Patreon
4924880	4930560	transcribed that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter just to instigate
4930560	4936720	another round of cancelling. You're not allowed a chance to think or feel and because supposedly
4936720	4942240	the best thing to do from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately. Cancelling produces a
4942240	4948640	lot of insincere bullshit apologies from people who haven't in fact learned anything. And I think
4948640	4955280	most people are aware of that. In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself is often insincere.
4955280	4961600	If you're being cancelled rather than criticized then the line in the sand has been drawn. You
4961600	4968080	and all your kin have been declared the enemy. Apologize to Twitter. At this point I may as well
4968080	4975840	apologize to 4chan. Dear 4chan, I am super fucking sorry I called you thin-wristed otaku shit weasels
4975840	4980240	who like looking at pictures of little girls. I have been trying to educate myself and learn
4980240	4986160	from my mistakes and I now realize that's only 70% of you. Like once you're cancelled you can
4986160	4992000	really do no right. If you apologize the apology will be declared a manipulative attempt to save
4992000	4997600	face and in fact it will be used as further evidence of what a Machiavellian psychopath you
4997600	5002240	really are. If you try to explain or defend yourself, I mean first of all you will almost
5002240	5007680	certainly dig yourself in deeper. But even if you're articulate and correct you'll still be seen as
5007680	5013440	unable to take criticism and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people. And if you just go silent
5013440	5019040	you'll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability even though there's lots of reasons why you might
5019040	5024080	go silent. Maybe you're taking a few days away from social media to try to cool down and think
5024080	5028880	clearly or maybe you're so overwhelmed by the harassment that you've just shut down.
5034640	5039040	Let's do shots. Who wants to do a shot with me? Do you want to do a shot with me?
5039040	5046960	Let's do a shot. A tequila shot is my favorite. I like the whole salt tequila lime ritual.
5046960	5054640	It's just very satisfying to me. It's the end of that bottle. Okay let's get started.
5061200	5063520	You feel warm right away you know that feeling where it's like
5063520	5071680	oh hey how are you happiness? Hey how are you? Feeling that life is worth living? It's a good
5071680	5076320	moment. You're like oh this isn't okay this is gonna be okay. I can get through this. It's how
5076320	5082160	it starts. Watch out for that. So look I really don't like to represent myself as a victim.
5082160	5088880	That's not really a narrative that I identify with but for the purposes of communicating what
5088880	5095920	effect canceling has I feel like I should say something about the pain. Much of the happiness
5095920	5104080	that you might expect to come along with success has been taken away from me by this constant fury
5104080	5109280	that surrounds me. Try to think about this rationally. I'm a Libra Sun, Pisces Moon. Being
5109280	5117200	canceled is hell for me. You know I want to be liked by everyone and I'm starting to think I
5117280	5123120	might be in the wrong career for that. In a way leftist Twitter finally accomplished what 4chan
5123120	5128720	Nazis stalkers and turfs have been trying and failing to do to me for years. They've made
5128720	5134400	Twitter into a platform so hostile to my existence that I've decided to leave it forever. And they
5134400	5139440	demoralized me to the point I could barely get out of bed for a month. And I know that sounds
5139440	5145040	really melodramatic but I'm just trying to be honest with you about what a melodramatic
5145040	5150080	person I am. I find I have trouble convincing people of the severity of the pain that being
5150080	5155920	canceled causes because I think it's just hard to imagine if you haven't been through it yourself.
5155920	5160160	And I don't know a more succinct way to convey it to you than by telling you that
5160880	5164800	in the last few years I've been harassed by Nazis, I've been harassed by turfs,
5164800	5169600	I've been stalked, I've been docked, I've been threatened, I've been sexually assaulted. And
5169680	5175680	the pain of being canceled, of being totally trashed by other trans people online for years
5175680	5179280	has been more difficult for me to cope with than all the rest of it combined.
5179280	5183840	Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel better than I think I can describe it myself.
5183840	5188720	I was one of the first in the country, perhaps the first in Chicago, to have my character,
5188720	5194240	my commitment, and my very self-attacked in such a way by movement women that it left me torn in
5194240	5198880	little pieces and unable to function. It took me years to recover and even today the wounds have
5198880	5204240	not entirely healed. This attack is accomplished by making you feel that your very existence is
5204240	5209280	inimical to the movement and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist.
5209280	5212720	These feelings are reinforced when you are isolated from your friends,
5212720	5217680	as they become convinced that their association with you is similarly inimical to the movement
5217680	5223360	and to themselves. Any support of you will taint them. Eventually all your colleagues join in in
5223360	5228480	a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced and you are reduced to a mere parody of your
5228480	5235200	previous self. Yeah, that just about sums it up. Now as it happens I am going to survive this
5235200	5241600	because I have very deliberately built a support network that will be there for me regardless of
5241600	5246960	what online trans communities say. And I have very deliberately done that because early in my
5246960	5254320	transition back in 2017 I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community for all kinds
5254320	5260160	of emotional support. You know when you're early in transition I mean it just sucks. You feel like
5260160	5264320	the whole world is against you. And I talked about this a little bit in my last video you know
5264320	5268960	feeling like a freak show walking down the street and even if you're lucky enough to have a supportive
5268960	5273440	family like it's usually still is going to take them a while to come around. At first they don't
5273440	5278560	get it. They say things to you like aren't you worried you'll regret this and like they struggle
5278560	5283520	with your name and pronouns which is understandable but at the same time it makes you feel like you're
5283520	5288800	not being seen for who you are. So you need a kind of second family that understands how you're
5288800	5293840	feeling and acts happy about your transition and validates your gender. And for the first couple
5293840	5299600	months of my transition I found that in this world of online transgender leftism. Well that
5299600	5305440	didn't last long because well I was what two months into my transition when first I did an
5305440	5310560	interview with the journalist Jessie Single and then I agreed to do a debate with Theron and Vanessa.
5310560	5315520	So that's a long story but in short I associated with a string of people that trans twitter
5315520	5321440	considers the enemy. And trans twitter tore me apart over this and it completely broke my heart
5321440	5328800	because I was really leaning on basically emotional support from strangers online which
5328800	5333920	seems really stupid in retrospect. And after they turned against me I decided one that I was never
5333920	5338560	going to rely on this group of people again and two that I was going to have to find acceptance
5338560	5343280	elsewhere. And in retrospect I think this actually may have been good for me in a roundabout way
5343280	5347840	because I was kicked out of the safe space and I dropped that mentality. And so basically I was
5347840	5352960	thrown into the deep end of reality and forced to sink or swim. And I don't know if my transition
5352960	5357120	or my channel would be where they are today if it hadn't been for that trial by fire. Are we
5357120	5364000	swimming through fire or are we mixing metaphors? The point is I'm more armored against canceling
5364000	5369120	than I was two years ago. And the reason why is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and
5369120	5374960	security and independence from any one community. So that if one community cancels me I still have
5374960	5379600	somewhere else to go. You know the people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture are not white
5379600	5385040	guy comedians. They're not James Charles. They're not me. They are marginalized people who feel like
5385040	5389920	they have nowhere else to go when they're rejected by their community. That means struggling trans
5389920	5395040	people with a few hundred Twitter followers. It means a lot of sex workers. It means people who
5395040	5400800	totally rely on activist circles for emotional and material support. I'll quote Drew Freeman one more
5400800	5406080	time. I had survived my youth because I had never given anyone or any group the right to judge me.
5406080	5411840	That right I had reserved to myself. But the movement seduced me by its sweet promise of
5411840	5417360	sisterhood. It claimed to provide a haven from the ravages of a sexist society, a place where
5417360	5423200	one would be understood. It was my very need for feminism and feminists that made me vulnerable.
5423200	5429360	I gave the movement the right to judge me because I trusted it. And when it judged me worthless I
5429360	5435040	accepted that judgment. There's a really irritating point that people on the left like to make that
5435040	5440320	goes. Well canceling doesn't really end anyone's career. Canceled people usually get a new job or
5440320	5445760	keep their platform. So I guess it's not really that bad huh. I think people say this because
5445760	5450080	they're trying to mitigate any sense of guilt they might feel about how they're treating people.
5450080	5454240	Because it's a really stupid argument. There's lots of things that don't end your life that are
5454240	5459840	still terrible. But also there's cases where canceling has ended someone's life. On December 5th
5459840	5467200	2017 a porn star named August Ames killed herself by hanging in a public park after being canceled
5467200	5472240	on Twitter over a homophobic tweet. On December 3rd she tweeted, whichever lady performer is
5472240	5477120	replacing me tomorrow for erotica x news you're shooting with a guy who's shot gay porn just to
5477120	5482080	let you know. B.S. is all I can say shrug. Do agents really not care about who they're representing?
5482080	5487920	L.A. direct I do my homework for my body. So I've never worked in porn so I can't really tell you
5487920	5493760	what the norms are around women working with men who have done gay porn. But the tweet certainly
5493760	5498240	sounds homophobic to me and that seems to be the consensus of other industry people on Twitter.
5498240	5502640	So Twitter did its thing. People in August's community called her a homophobe and lashed out
5502640	5507840	at her. And as always happens plenty of passers-by jumped in to throw tomatoes at the woman in the
5507840	5513120	stocks. Over the next few days August tweeted several more times going through the usual stages
5513120	5518240	that you go through when you're being canceled. First she defended herself. She claimed most other
5518240	5522320	women in the industry feel the same as her. Then she said she's bisexual and therefore she couldn't
5522320	5527040	be homophobic. Then she said fine I guess I'll be fake and not have opinions then. Then she started
5527040	5531360	bemoaning how mean Twitter is. And she got really defensive about her right to choose who she had
5531360	5536720	sex with. And she lashed out at the people attacking her. And then in her final tweet she
5536720	5542560	just said fuck y'all and went to the park that night and killed herself. This is all so familiar
5542560	5547520	to me. I feel like I'm able to relive with her each stage of this emotional process. There's that
5547520	5551840	first moment when you realize the outrage is beginning and you get that sinking feeling in
5551840	5557280	your stomach. And then the anger feeling misunderstood. And then the bargaining the fear
5557280	5562960	and finally the shame and the despair. And here's the thing I totally agree with her critics that
5562960	5568560	her tweet was bad. Of course she has the right to say no for any reason but she publicly expressed
5568560	5574960	this in a homophobic way. But she was still a person who deserves to live. And I think there's
5574960	5579600	gotta be a better way to deal with these situations than just trashing someone until they kill
5579600	5584400	themselves. And I know it's never as simple as Twitter made her kill herself. There's always
5584400	5589280	other things going on in the background. But the point I'm making is canceling is more dangerous
5589280	5594480	to marginalized people. Because marginalized people generally have more things going on in
5594480	5600000	the background. John Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death. And it goes into how she
5600000	5604880	was sexually abused as a child abandoned by her father. She was living with a boyfriend. She was
5604880	5609360	kind of emotionally detached from. And a few weeks earlier she'd filmed a scene with a guy who was
5609360	5614800	unnecessarily rough and mean and who mistreated her. So she was kind of traumatized by that. And
5614800	5620000	so she was kind of on edge and really defensive about who she worked with when she was tweeting.
5620000	5625760	Then the backlash happened. And since she had no other support network she probably felt like the
5625760	5631120	only community she had turned against her. And that's a really painful feeling. She must have
5631120	5640320	felt so despised. Which is how I've felt for the last two months. I feel despised and burdensome.
5640320	5645840	And I can imagine how a person who feels that way could have an impulsive couple hours where they
5645840	5650000	think their best option is suicide. I mean I can more than imagine it because I've been there
5650000	5655120	myself. And I'm still here because at those moments I've been with good friends who took care
5655120	5663040	of me. And by friends I do mean Xanax. But I've also survived because there's a lot of people on
5663040	5668000	the internet who'd be very entertained if I killed myself. And I simply refuse to give them the
5668000	5673840	satisfaction. Oh no bitch. I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite. I mean who needs
5673840	5678320	a guardian angel when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas on the fumes of total
5678320	5683920	contempt. What I'm really trying to say is Merry Christmas you goddamn assholes.
5683920	5711920	Oh holy night. The stars are brightly shining.
5711920	5721760	Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow. To get my lesbian pliers out again.
5728080	5734320	Have a super fucking happy new year barge. How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?
5734320	5738880	Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub? Leave a comment if you want a bathtub. All right I need
5738960	5743440	to take a deep breath because let's be honest. I'm about one crack away from attacking my own
5743440	5748800	Twitter followers with an umbrella. I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage and
5748800	5753600	making a suit out of women's skin. Just kidding I would never do that. Though on a bad skin day
5753600	5759360	I've given it serious consideration. Oh I'll be fine. I've gotta sober up anyway because I'm
5759360	5764400	having more plastic surgery in a couple days. And plastic surgery? That's about the only thing
5764400	5771440	holding me together at this point. YouTubing that this is a healthy profession. This is great.
5771440	5776960	Anyone want my job? Step right up. All you have to do is make informative and entertaining videos
5776960	5781520	about extremely controversial topics while of course representing the full range of experiences
5781520	5787920	in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny. Well go on. I'm
5787920	5793600	waiting to be entertained. Feed me mother. Oh don't mind me. I'll just sit back and pour another glass
5793600	5799360	of wine. Oh and I will of course be obsessively scrutinizing every word you say for any hint of
5799360	5804880	moral transgression as well as critiquing your look you third-rate cross-dresser. Zero out of 10.
5804880	5810160	Get off my stage. He's like please build that everywhere. It's good. I do still want to talk
5810160	5815200	about why people cancel and the effect that it's having but it looks like there's gonna have to be
5815200	5820880	a part two gorge because I have hit my limit. So why don't we all cut our losses and try again in
5820960	5825440	2020. I realize that people on Twitter aren't actually gonna watch this video. They're just
5825440	5830400	gonna make fun of the title and how long it is which fair enough but they're the ones whose
5830400	5834800	accusations against me are so numerous and convoluted it required a feature length film
5834800	5838960	to respond to. But yeah they're gonna see the title and they're gonna transcribe quotes out
5838960	5844160	of context and they're gonna say I'm a fascist. I'm a turf. I'm true scum. I'm the new Blair White.
5844160	5849360	I'm the new Lacey Green. I'm a cis bootlicker. I'm an enlightened centrist. I'm a shit lib.
5850080	5854560	I'm a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars over the bodies of dead trans women.

5870320	5876640	little peace intact. But it's good. It's good. It's good because basically my survival from here
