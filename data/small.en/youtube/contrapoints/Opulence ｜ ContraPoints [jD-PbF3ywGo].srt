1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,260
God

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,300
God, say this in his name

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,960
God, say this in his name

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,840
English

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,760
English

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,000
me esandy

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Oh, hey, Quarch, hey, how are you, Quarch?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,160
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine, well, fair enough.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,720
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
How about this?

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,040
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off, but first, you have to let me tell

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
you my life story.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Fair?

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
That's super fucking great.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,960
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,840
I'll start at the beginning.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,160
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,400
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C., where the most exciting attraction for children

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,440
is the National Museum of Natural History.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,120
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who, might I add, deserve

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,360
their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong, I liked a good Stegosaurus

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,840
as much as the next five-year-old, but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,100
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,720
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,960
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,120
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up for my sixth-grade teacher,

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Fuck you, Romano.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm glad your father died.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,720
Comrades, losers, and haters.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,680
I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion,

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,360
or music, begins with absolute pleasure.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,380
You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,880
Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Yes, god.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,840
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,280
Northern Virginia is McMansion country, and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,600
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan, looking at some stylistically jumbled

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,920
monstrosities, and I would get excited by some little detail, like, say, a circle of

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,280
fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
But then my mom would say, look at this ostentatious trash.

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
So you learn.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,000
You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,160
And with taste comes all this adult baggage, snobbery, and pretense and conceit.

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,280
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers, but I assure you, I have nothing

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
to do with taste.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,320
I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,680
So stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee, before you pass sentence, allow

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
me to make my case, gorge.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
One.

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Success.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:22,280
Oh, hey, how are you, gorge?

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Look, I like stuff.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,840
I like shiny things.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,200
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,880
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,120
There's a social context for it.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
It generally means something.

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,600
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace, married a Turkmenistani dictator

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,480
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,360
Well, because he's trying to send a message, maybe to the world, maybe to himself.

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,520
He's saying, behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power, from the pharaohs of

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,280
Egypt, to the kings of France, to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,520
I guess God likes shiny things too.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,400
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,040
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,080
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,240
In the words of Drake,

72
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's back in here.

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,400
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
You've made it.

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
You're rich, bitch.

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,920
Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

78
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,040
The character J. Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,920
anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
worth something.

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,360
And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
save the Hall of Hrolfgar.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,880
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,080
The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,640
I got a D minus.

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I like dollars.

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
I like diamonds.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
I like money.

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
I like shining.

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
I like those Balenciagas.

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Fuck.

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,040
that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
Let's talk about symbols.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Let's talk about allegory.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
Let's talk about metaphor.

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Let's talk about themes.

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,560
Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,520
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,040
That's the American dream.

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,480
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.

102
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
of success is really improbable.

104
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say, rap music is a reason

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,640
for the problems with the blacks?

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,240
For conservatives, the American dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

107
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,080
And is there any sector of our culture where the American dream is more unironically celebrated

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
than hip-hop?

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not just hip-hop, though.

110
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,160
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

111
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,920
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,800
the Fendi and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,480
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,

114
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,600
to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,480
Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care and replace it with a large-scale

116
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,920
figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,520
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

119
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,040
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

120
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,080
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,680
We have standards in this country.

122
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
Listen up, America.

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,160
We live in a society, a society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

124
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Not of climbers, but of...graspers.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,640
To paraphrase Ian Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone cannot.

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,520
And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,600
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,440
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

129
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,360
Not all the rich people, that's for sure.

130
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,080
So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,400
so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well, what's the average person supposed

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
to do?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,200
Two.

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Fantasy.

135
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
I wish the world were my gem collection.

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,840
I wish I owned everything.

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?

138
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,120
I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt.

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,160
Okay, that's super fucking great, but can I buy it?

140
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Well, no, I can't buy it.

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,520
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

142
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,000
So what do you do?

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,280
Well, you fake it.

144
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
You create an illusion.

145
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't own this building, and you droop off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here,

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,720
as indeed you did, but that's okay.

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I need a witness.

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,480
I need you to see me here, among the other art, where I belong.

149
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,760
It makes me feel valuable.

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,120
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.

152
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,880
Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.

153
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,760
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

154
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,760
The phrase opulence you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.

155
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Opulence.

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,840
But it originally comes from the documentary Paris is Burning, up at the Harlem Ballroom

158
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,720
Culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by M.C.

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Jr.

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
LaBeija.

161
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E, opulence.

162
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
You own everything.

163
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:58,560
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.

164
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,680
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer, black, and Latin American participants of

165
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
the Bulls,

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,760
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.

167
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,280
Some of them don't even eat.

168
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,280
So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour, an illusion created by skillful

169
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,680
artifice.

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,780
Participants walk categories like executive realness, with the goal of being indistinguishable

171
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,520
from a real executive.

172
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,800
Nowadays every white queer says the word realness, I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,280
I mean, who's among us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state, dressed up

174
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,400
as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children, and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
Gacy realness, hunty.

176
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,600
I did it officer, I did the cultural appropriation.

177
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,800
I am a colonizer, I am part of the problem, and I'm sorry.

178
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,280
Take me away boys.

179
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
That's crazy.

180
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
That's mega coconuts.

181
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I guess I should explain that American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up

182
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,040
model of linguistics.

183
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,800
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.

184
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,160
Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays, and then finally white

185
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
cisheads start using them.

186
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,440
A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.

187
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,440
So originally realness, as Chanté put it,

188
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,680
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume, but a treasure-comic disguise of

189
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,760
the chasm between what is being emulated and what is absent, namely racial justice, class

190
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,120
equality, and safety.

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,840
Realness in that sense is a much more complicated and interesting concept than the generic trans

192
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
notion of passing.

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Realness is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy biogirl.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,960
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle that has been unjustly kept

196
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
beyond your reach.

197
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,920
You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.

198
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,440
And therefore you're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.

199
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,080
If I had the opportunity, I could be one, because I can look like one.

200
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,160
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture, such as

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,200
the FX drama Pose, which is said during the era, is that it dramatizes an essential truth

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
about America.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,160
It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel like they're

204
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,360
living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.

205
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,480
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace are designed to make

207
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,760
you feel like a fancy bitch, even though they're actually just high-rise traps designed to

208
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,040
lure you in and take your money.

209
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,200
And if there's one thing I can't stand…

210
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
…it's traps.

211
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,760
But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American is to want to feel like

212
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,120
a fancy bitch.

213
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
I actually love Vegas.

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,720
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber, Lindsay Ellis's Bachelorette party.

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,680
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

216
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,960
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s, I did once experience the first exciting stages

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
of a gambling habit.

218
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,280
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity, and had some good luck playing

219
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Blackjack.

220
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,480
I mean, I wasn't a high-ruler or anything, but my first time I walked out with an extra

221
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
$200.

222
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,240
And that was a lot of money to me.

223
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,840
At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour, so to make $200 in

224
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
five minutes.

225
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,280
But that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing customer service toil before taxes.

226
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,360
So I went back, and I went back, but I never got lucky again, and fortunately that was

227
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
enough to discourage me.

228
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,480
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino, I saw this man standing outside with this

229
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,120
look on his face that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

230
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,040
Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.

231
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,800
The kind of face that says, I'm going to have to explain to my wife that I spent the

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,920
kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.

233
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,480
And there is nothing opulent about that, nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs

234
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,920
with IV drips trying to pay off their hospital bills.

235
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,960
America, we are a bad country.

236
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Donald Trump is a Vegas man, he's pulling this grift on the entire country.

237
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,440
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream is more enchanting to

238
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,040
the imagination than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

239
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,600
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell, but in fact there are two

240
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
very different types of magic at work.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,400
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex, a demonstration of their wealth and

242
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
power.

243
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,520
But for the marginalized and impoverished, opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and

244
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
power they've been denied.

245
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,840
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function, it's like the difference between

246
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,800
a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
3.

248
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Class.

249
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey how are you?

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,320
Hey how are you?

251
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Hey how are you?

252
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
Hey how are you?

253
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,960
People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.

254
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,680
You know, a biological female that looks like me, I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is

255
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,160
gonna sneak in through a rear window and I'll have to dial him for murder.

256
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

257
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,640
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,400
As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to and I oop

259
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
and I oop and I oop.

260
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
That's praxis.

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat, whomst?

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Who is she?

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
Where's her summer collection?

264
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,040
That's super fucking great but can't I buy it?

265
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,760
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.

266
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,120
Now I could be out of touch, but personally, I've never met a factory worker, or a factory

267
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
owner for that matter.

268
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,720
They must all be on a brand trip to China, working on the BMP summer collection.

269
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,120
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles is that the bougies own the

270
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,000
means of production and the proles work for wages.

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,920
But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?

272
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,280
What about YouTubers?

273
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Which side of the revolution are we on?

274
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here, cause if the revolution starts on Twitter,

275
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,600
my head is definitely going in the basket, and then I'll have no choice but to do the

276
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,440
conservative talk show circuit.

277
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,280
You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.

278
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,960
Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, ayo!

279
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,240
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.

280
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,320
My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class, A Guide Through the

281
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,560
American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.

282
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,320
Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,

283
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,480
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

284
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,640
Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.

285
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,440
Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

286
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,920
but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.

287
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,840
And it's also just pretty funny, like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher

288
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,040
your social class, the smaller the balls in the sports you play, or his description of

289
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,960
middle class living rooms.

290
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,040
Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines on

291
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,040
its coffee tables, otherwise expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas

292
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
might result.

293
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,880
One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your

294
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,400
class so much as how you got your money.

295
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,640
If you had to work for your money, then you're not really upper class.

296
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,960
The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident, they

297
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,320
don't feel the need to prove themselves.

298
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the latter, but

299
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,960
then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their insecurities

300
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,320
by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper stickers on the back

301
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
of the family car.

302
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,960
This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

303
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,240
The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but the middle classes are all

304
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,080
affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.

305
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove, whether

306
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,160
it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves, or the new rich

307
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,240
building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.

308
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,720
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.

309
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,680
He inherited his wealth, so he should know better than to have golden faucets.

310
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,840
But he doesn't.

311
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,320
As Fran Lebowitz said, he's a poor person's idea of a rich person, and that's actually

312
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
his charm.

313
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,360
It's part of his mass appeal.

314
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,080
Trump behaves like a pro who won the lottery.

315
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,600
So there's actually something kind of relatable, unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about

316
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
the golden faucets.

317
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,560
People who have wealth, but not class, are actually very popular in this country.

318
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,920
We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.

319
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,240
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves.

320
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,560
So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone, even though in practice it isn't.

321
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,320
Now the upper class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people, are mostly

322
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
very unlike Trump.

323
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,200
Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy, they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic

324
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,440
wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,560
Fuzzled notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

326
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,800
They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.

327
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,760
They dress down while traveling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

328
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,160
These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.

329
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you.

330
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,400
Or they might get enfiest and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

331
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,560
Or worse, taxation.

332
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.

333
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,800
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class is dying out.

334
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,680
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.

335
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,440
His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want, so long as you

336
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,240
have the cash to back it up.

337
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,840
So the old class system is dying out, and in its place, we have universally adopted

338
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,920
the mindset of the nouveau riche.

339
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,040
If you got it, flaunt it.

340
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,240
If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.

341
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,520
Now I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,

342
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,320
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.

343
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
4.

344
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Taste

345
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,760
Listen, comrades.

346
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,160
I have been pretty down on opulence so far, and I could continue analyzing it in terms

347
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,720
of inequality and class struggle, but you already know all that.

348
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,600
That's why you came to cut my head off.

349
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,440
But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?

350
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,360
Marxist economic analysis?

351
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?

352
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,080
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

353
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,640
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media

354
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,680
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

355
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
So what about the enjoyment part?

356
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
Surely you wouldn't be had a queen just for liking shiny thing.

357
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,880
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

358
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,600
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen, Freulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlena

359
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,920
Kennedy Davenport-Kunt, said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested, that is, completely

360
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,760
free of any material desire.

361
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,360
Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement, so I don't know how seriously

362
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
we want to take that.

363
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,000
But it's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense, that it

364
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys, which is really just a

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos

367
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,040
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

368
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
What must that be like?

369
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,720
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart that must be super fucking

370
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
hard for them.

371
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I can't even imagine.

372
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,160
I mean, it makes sense, really.

373
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,800
Straight men don't have these problems.

374
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,360
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years and never had to think about it.

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
I guess Nietzsche is the exception.

376
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,360
He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel, and let's be honest, definitely

377
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
a chaser.

378
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the respectable English

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
gentleman Oscar Wilde.

380
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
According to Wilde,

381
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,520
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.

382
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,860
This is a fault.

383
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,440
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.

384
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
For these, there is hope.

385
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,240
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.

386
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Spoken like a poet, you want to be cultivated, don't you?

387
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

388
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,720
Look, I'll play it your way.

389
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,160
Let's swing back to the other side of the sarcasian pendulum here.

390
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,480
As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that, but from

391
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,280
a strictly sociological perspective, I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related

392
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
to power.

393
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,360
When you go to a museum, you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting

394
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
that makes them appear magical.

395
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,480
Now, that's also what you do in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but the difference is that at

396
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,640
the museum, you can't buy anything, and that turns out to be important.

397
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
For Kantian reasons.

398
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,600
In the retail context of commodity fetishism, you correlate your aesthetic taste with material

399
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
desire.

400
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,320
Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything, you feel like your aesthetic

401
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,560
pleasure is pure, that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.

402
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,960
But of course, that's an illusion.

403
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,520
The museum is the context, and the context is telling you that the things you're looking

404
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
at are art.

405
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,320
So whoever decides what's in the museum decides what good taste is.

406
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
What's beautiful?

407
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
What's valuable?

408
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,520
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

409
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,200
Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre, conferring upon themselves

410
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,560
the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.

411
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,520
But it's not just a flex, it means something more than that because of the racial disparity

412
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,680
between the performers and the setting.

413
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre, so seeing Jay

414
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,920
and Bea there looking so regal, with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European

415
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,440
art, it's like a full moment.

416
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,440
A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by

417
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
classical art.

418
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,360
That's why trans women love that picture, someone photoshopped of the Three Graces but

419
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
with dicks.

420
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,280
I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me, because here in

421
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,720
the west, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've

422
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,480
seen it sculpted in white marble.

423
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.

424
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,320
For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness

425
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,440
of classical statues was the distinguishing feature of western sculpture, proof of the

426
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,120
elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

427
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,640
In reality, of course it turns out they were painted the colors of something a drag queen

428
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
might wear to Joaquin Sanyera.

429
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,400
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues for hundreds of years but

430
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,520
were totally in denial about it because the pure whiteness of these figures was like

431
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
a sacred dogma.

432
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Margaret Talba in The New Yorker attributes the dogma in part to

433
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,160
A tendency to equate whiteness with beauty, taste, and classical ideals, and to see color

434
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,480
as alien, sensual, and garish.

435
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,720
In 2008, Fabio Barry, an art historian who is now at Stanford, complained that a boldly

436
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,800
colored re-creation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum looked like

437
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,080
a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

438
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,640
Hey, how are you?

439
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,640
And you just know that when the news first broke, some horrified wasp classicists turned

440
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,800
to a colleague and said, oh Kingsley, it looks… it looks Mexican.

441
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,680
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues, some art historians have been

442
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,960
harassed by the alt-right, who don't take kindly to anyone questioning their white

443
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
supremacist myths about antiquity.

444
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
There's some pretty insidious, uh, identitarian prejudices here, hiding out under the cloak

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,320
of taste.

446
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
Good taste for upper and middle-class white people generally includes a reflexive disdain

447
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,800
for anything a little bit too… colorful.

448
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,880
It's these classes that constantly use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

449
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,440
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce, The History of Leopard Print, observes that

450
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,960
Tacky, as a concept, refers to the lack of cultivation or the resistance to taste and

451
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,320
more often than not refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.

452
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,400
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic, queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,

453
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,440
not business-like, not serious.

454
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,240
Aesthetic excess, particularly of colors, patterns, and bling, is especially offensive

455
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
to conservative wasp taste.

456
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,160
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free, where the heart is, where the soul is,

457
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
and where the fun is.

458
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,640
Well, that's good news, because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

459
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
I can't imagine why.

460
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

461
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,560
Or camp.

462
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,560
People call me camp, and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

463
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,400
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

464
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,560
Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala, and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite

465
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,080
intellectuals competing to outwit each other with the most erudite definition of what camp

466
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
really is.

467
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,320
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

468
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,840
The first I'll call coward camp, this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

469
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,640
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

470
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,920
This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.

471
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,680
You think you're safe from criticism because your look is bad on purpose.

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,040
Fuck that.

473
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,920
Take a stand, you pussy bitch.

474
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,840
I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident, and Susan Sontag

475
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
agrees with me.

476
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,120
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

477
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,880
Naive and deliberate camp.

478
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,600
Pure camp is always naive.

479
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,240
Camp which knows itself to be camp, or camping is usually less satisfying.

480
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,320
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness, a grand artistic vision that gets a little

481
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,160
out of control and enters into absurd territory.

482
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,200
Hey, how are you?

483
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,520
I don't know, my philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.

484
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,680
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

485
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,840
I think my aesthetic is good.

486
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,880
This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.

487
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,000
I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.

488
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,600
One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

489
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,440
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

490
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

491
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,920
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

492
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,000
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

493
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
Why am I so tacky?

494
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,640
I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,160
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now bitch.

496
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,440
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

497
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,960
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, ooh, sweaty, you'd better start

498
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
a revolution.

499
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,240
Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey, how are you?

500
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Chicks with bread.

501
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
5.

502
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Glamour.

503
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,200
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour, at least those of us who came of

504
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
age in the 1960s.

505
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,800
In the most basic everyday sense, glam is a way of styling yourself.

506
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,600
It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup, it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,

507
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
it's posing like a fashion model.

508
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,640
But originally the word glamour comes from the Scottish word grammery, meaning magic

509
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
or enchantment.

510
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,240
And glamour still involves a kind of illusion, or charm, cast on a spectator.

511
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,800
The connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay, Viva MacGlam?

512
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,360
Is transgenderism a critique of, or capitulation to, opulence-driven glamour models by transgender

513
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,120
writer and underground house music producer Terry Tamletz, aka DJ Sprinkles?

514
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Sprinkles writes,

515
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,480
Europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes

516
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,560
with glimpses of heaven on earth, a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could

517
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,880
only be the result of divination.

518
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,760
It is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour, which is more

519
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,600
associated with wealth than magic.

520
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour, or grammery, that was associated with witchcraft,

521
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
paganism, and sexual deviancy.

522
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,000
But in our capitalist society, glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often

523
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,400
a fantasy of a lavish life.

524
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,440
For example, a lot of dry queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating

525
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,320
celebrities, thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses, pop stars, and models secondhand.

526
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,720
Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of secondhand glamour acquires its power from

527
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,440
unquestioned social hierarchies.

528
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,200
Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance,

529
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
not social integration.

530
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,440
The promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation, but individual

531
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,040
transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.

532
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,480
It is the promise of an individual's class mobility, not social betterment or class critique.

533
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,200
It is, by and large, the American Dream.

534
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,440
Now I have to admit, this is a version of the American Dream that hits pretty close

535
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
to home for me.

536
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,760
The overarching plotline of my whole entire YouTube gender journey is that I used to be

537
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
a tragic mess.

538
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,840
And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started this channel I was a broke, gender-dysphoric,

539
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,160
alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.

540
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,400
I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance

541
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
at.

542
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
And now, I mean, look at me.

543
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Look how far I've come.

544
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,240
I look like a moderately talented female impersonator.

545
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,560
Hey, how are you?

546
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,040
Those first several months of transition, though, they were rough.

547
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.

548
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,480
I used to get laughed out of restaurants, and I was so proud that I wouldn't let anyone

549
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,200
see how much that stuff hurt me, you know?

550
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,080
I would say, well fuck them, I know I'm great.

551
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,120
And then I'd go cry my eyes out, alone in my car.

552
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,200
And I was a YouTuber that whole time too, which, I mean, the cyberbullying alone.

553
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,720
I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you haven't been in that situation.

554
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,960
You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice, picking apart your face and body,

555
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,760
clocking your clothes and makeup, digging up your past, trying to deduce the nature

556
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,640
of your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull.

557
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:46,120
A lot of it is hilarious to me now, but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.

558
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,960
But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up like it was the cure for cancer.

559
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,880
Like my life depended on it.

560
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
Which is basically how it felt.

561
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as, as one tweeter put it,

562
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,160
cripplingly obsessed with passing.

563
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,760
And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me, but glam, to me, is not about

564
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
passing.

565
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,280
I think I actually pass better in no makeup than I do in eyeshadow out to here.

566
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,680
You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here, and people think she's just really

567
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,600
into makeup or Instagram or cosplay or something, but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,

568
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,440
which serves to call more attention to my situation.

569
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,160
But on YouTube, I mean, clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.

570
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,240
Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway, so what's the point?

571
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,120
I would describe this presentation as female impersonator, and that's basically what I

572
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
am.

573
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
A female, female impersonator.

574
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,200
And I present this way because it's fun, I find it artistically fulfilling, and let's

575
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,880
be honest, there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of larger-than-life

576
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
superwoman.

577
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,480
But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.

578
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
As Sprinkles says,

579
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,360
Glamour offers a strange overperformance of gender signifiers, a tenuously woven layer

580
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,720
of superfemininity which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered

581
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
body beneath.

582
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,000
Now a lot of leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility

583
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,200
represented by glamour, as well as by transition glow-up narratives.

584
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,800
And I think that disillusionment and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of

585
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,680
this intense anger and resentment I've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens,

586
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,360
for glamorous trans Instagram models, and let's be honest, for me.

587
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,960
Here's Sprinkles one more time.

588
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,960
As long as an MTF's public acceptance is gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous

589
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,040
body and style requirements that elude most quote, real women, then I'll have to ask

590
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,840
you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling represented by RuPaul any more

591
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,040
than my mother feels represented by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.

592
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,440
A lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world a fantasy all

593
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
the time.

594
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,560
They want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that shit.

595
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,040
They're fed up with glamour.

596
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
They're fed up with realness.

597
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
They're fed up with RuPaul.

598
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,080
And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.

599
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,480
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

600
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Six.

601
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Envy.

602
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,680
The Marxist art critic John Berger called glamour the happiness of being envied.

603
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,880
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.

604
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,560
It depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you.

605
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,160
But being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination.

606
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,760
The actual experience of being envied sucks.

607
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,800
This is the risk of opulence.

608
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,080
It invites not just enchanted admiration, but also envy.

609
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,840
And where envy goes, the guillotine follows, or at least vindictive taxation.

610
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,560
This is why the experienced rich note a tone down the opulence, build a nice high wall

611
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,760
around their properties, and make a lot of high profile charitable donations.

612
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
We can call this kind of strategizing the public relations of success.

613
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,040
It certainly helps to have a rags to riches story, especially if you can make other people

614
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,160
feel included in some way in your success.

615
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,600
That's part of the appeal of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems to elevate not just a single

616
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,560
performer but an entire underclass.

617
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,280
Conversely, being perceived as exclusionary, elitist, or snobbish is going to cost you

618
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,960
big in terms of envy management.

619
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,880
YouTube music critic Todd in the Shadows did a review of Ariana Grande's song Seven Rings,

620
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,880
in which he basically drags Ariana, who apparently is white, for appropriating a bunch of hip-hop

621
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,520
rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom.

622
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,280
She's not showcasing a triumph over adversity, she's just a white girl who likes stuff.

623
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,480
We started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

624
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,960
So in Todd's words, this song is a grotesque, bullying, VIP-only privilege flex of a mean

625
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,120
girl shoving her wealth in your face.

626
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,080
I actually like that song, but I'm into that sort of thing.

627
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Believe me, mommy.

628
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Aww.

629
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,480
Fellow students, as a case study in the public relations of success and envy management,

630
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,400
let us compare and contrast two successful YouTubers, Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.

631
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,880
There's enough similarities between them for the differences to be interesting.

632
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,600
They're both LGB and orty, they're both white, they're both blonde sometimes, they're both

633
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,080
feminine, they're both rich, and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles.

634
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:40,360
But nonetheless, people basically seem to like Jeffree Star, whereas Gigi, well, I don't

635
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,240
want to say people don't like her, but they don't relate to her.

636
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,280
The best example of this is her 2017 video, I Wear Walmart for a Week, with its gasp-inducing

637
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,960
life-to-dislike ratio.

638
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,200
Let's analyze what went wrong here.

639
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,480
So for today's video, I thought we would take it to a place I've never been, Walmart.

640
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,440
So that's a bad start, Gorge.

641
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,560
Most Americans have been to Walmart.

642
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,920
Never having been marks your upbringing as upper middle class at least.

643
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,080
Treating going to Walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes across as you and

644
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,080
your rich friends being like, what if we pretend to be poor for a day?

645
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,280
I wonder if we're going to see any people at Walmart, you know that website?

646
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Baby's crying.

647
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
The trauma.

648
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Gigi, no!

649
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,040
You need to turn the shade down like 20 notches, Gorge.

650
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I keep picking my shin on this cart.

651
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm literally going to have bruises.

652
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,440
Can someone remake these carts, please?

653
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
It's dangerous.

654
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
They're going to cut your head off, Gorge.

655
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
What should we get next?

656
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?

657
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,280
Do they sell gowns here?

658
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,520
This to me is Peak Gigi, strolling down the aisles of Walmart with a 2-liter bottle of

659
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,720
Mountain Dew that she plucked from the shelves saying, I need something for a red carpet.

660
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Do they have gowns here?

661
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
This to me is an iconic fashion moment.

662
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,320
This is naive camp.

663
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
This is everything.

664
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,240
The idea that she has privileges that other people don't has never once crossed her mind.

665
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,760
And that is a very special, precious thing that I want to cherish.

666
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,920
Personally, I have no choice but to stand.

667
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,120
The YouTube comments section, however, is not as amused as I am, nor as forgiving.

668
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,600
This is the second time I've done a close reading of a Gigi video.

669
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,120
It's getting kind of weird.

670
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Also why hasn't she answered my letters?

671
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,720
Step on my throat, mommy.

672
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,240
Now let's look at Jeffree Star.

673
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,000
Jeffree does similar kinds of videos to Gigi.

674
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
He's even done his own video wearing Walmart for a day, which people loved.

675
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,640
Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in public perception is to scream SACISM.

676
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,160
And there's maybe a little of that going on.

677
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,320
I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly

678
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,800
more than that going on here.

679
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,280
Jeffree's fans are, I assume mostly women and not rich women, regular women.

680
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,440
The women who work at the dollar store love him.

681
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
I'm like your biggest fan.

682
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,160
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer

683
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,320
bags and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.

684
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,840
It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about

685
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,320
the extremely wealthy.

686
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,880
The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self made.

687
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,080
He represents himself as having started from the bottom.

688
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,880
You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing and just generally seems like he hasn't let

689
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,080
his wealth go to his head.

690
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,960
A good example of this is his private jet Burger King Mukbang.

691
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,920
Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very relatable, but the Burger

692
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,080
King aspect brings it back down to earth.

693
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,440
Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger King before.

694
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,920
He's able to order fluently, he's even kind of charming to the cashier.

695
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,440
He doesn't like scoff or pinch his nose at anything.

696
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
Also the Gucci barrette.

697
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,760
Whereas Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if Sis would

698
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,840
make it out of Burger King alive.

699
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,280
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper class solicism like, I don't know, not understanding

700
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,080
the concept of a value meal.

701
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video, just not a relatable video.

702
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,800
You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat and do a story time about

703
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
that.

704
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,040
That's really when Gigi's at her best.

705
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,960
She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives

706
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,440
of Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.

707
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,680
So I'm like, I see this white little chicklet in my hand.

708
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,720
I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like, oh my God.

709
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,600
Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled by the fact that people basically

710
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
like the rich.

711
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,200
Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch

712
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
behavior.

713
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,000
But ultimately, we have no choice but to stand.

714
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,160
And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who, in a way, seems like

715
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,560
a poor person who just so happens to be very rich.

716
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,720
Now if inequality increases enough, I suspect the standing will stop.

717
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,800
Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store

718
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,960
if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.

719
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,760
But if you're thinking about how $69,000 can pay off your life for earning medical

720
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,520
debt or about how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying wife, this

721
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,240
kind of thing will start getting under your skin.

722
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,840
And eventually, people will start building guillotines again.

723
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,000
In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people

724
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,120
start behaving as badly as possible.

725
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
So this isn't your dream job?

726
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
No.

727
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
That's great, right?

728
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Whatever you want.

729
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Okay, great.

730
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
7.

731
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Ruin.

732
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Good evening, Gorge.

733
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:51,320
Ever notice how most vampires are like, cats or queens or at least rich?

734
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,760
I guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash.

735
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,480
Gothic horror really got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were

736
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,520
usually set in an old decaying castle or mansion.

737
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,920
By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,

738
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,760
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order, and also

739
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,440
maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the land and gentry.

740
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,560
Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played

741
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,160
an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility.

742
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,840
So the gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence, and that aesthetic

743
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,520
has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic haunted house,

744
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,040
which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.

745
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,600
It's a trope with an interesting backstory.

746
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,560
During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new wealthy class of people who built what

747
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
were essentially 19th century McMansions.

748
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,080
When the Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began

749
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:06,400
to decay, which gave them morbid associations that made them perfect for stories about hauntings

750
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,480
and psychos and weirdos.

751
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,560
So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think.

752
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,840
We live in an age of opulence and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in

753
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
power.

754
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,640
The middle class is shrinking, social unrest is on the rise.

755
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,760
It seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.

756
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,440
When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined

757
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,760
shopping malls?

758
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,960
Well, there kind of already is.

759
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,920
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he

760
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,000
explores the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example the now demolished Owings Mills

761
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,080
Mall just north of Baltimore.

762
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,000
The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

763
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:13,200
It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue.

764
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,160
It was a big high-end mall, but in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was

765
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,880
murdered during an armed robbery on the trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station.

766
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,320
After the murder, the mall got a reputation for being unsafe and slowly the stores closed

767
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
down.

768
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,960
Dan recorded two videos at Owings Mills in 2015 when only five of the original 155 stores

769
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,200
remained.

770
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,240
He takes us through the strangely clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted

771
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,120
food court.

772
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,200
Watching these videos seems to provoke an emotional response in a lot of people.

773
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,720
Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express rage at the waste and futility, some

774
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,000
find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity

775
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
of it all.

776
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
One commenter says,

777
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,920
I think it is still hitting people with slow motion shock that the 20th century is really

778
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
over.

779
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,200
In the 80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone.

780
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,280
In fact, it was the last gasp of 20th century general prosperity.

781
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,160
I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of these emotions.

782
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,960
I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for the

783
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,680
21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism.

784
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,280
Oh, it gives me a chill.

785
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,320
My nape hair stands on end and a tingle goes down my spine.

786
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,800
The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about

787
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,860
it we see clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic

788
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,320
footage of the half-demolished ruin.

789
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,840
It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey where you somehow perceive

790
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,720
the spiritual significance of the original building.

791
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,280
In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the shoppers and the workers, their aspirations

792
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,680
and material longings, but what does the crumbling wreckage of a JC Penny really mean?

793
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:35,440
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

794
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,320
Alright comrades, I've said my piece.

795
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,480
I'll come quietly, there's no reason to tie me down, I mean, unless you're into that,

796
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,600
in which case, by all means.

797
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,240
No, I won't resist.

798
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,800
I accept my fate.

799
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:37,360
Fuck you, Romano, I'm glad your father died.

800
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,800
Let's just get that out there before I just say it.

801
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,280
Now let's be honest, definitely a tranny shazer.

802
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,160
Gosh I sure do think I'm funny, but he was an incel, and definitely a tranny shazer.

803
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,800
I'm looking, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed of what I've written.

804
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Huh?

805
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,320
Kant yeah, but I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.

806
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,400
I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked

807
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,920
in a tub full of jewels.

808
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,720
How much leg do we want to get in here?

809
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,080
A lot, I assume.

810
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,160
I'm just getting oil all over my fur, great, it's not real fur, whatever.

811
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,840
Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.

812
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Ugh, moral people.

813
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,280
There's one that I can't stand.

814
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,840
People who have some sense of decency.

815
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,320
Okay, is a hair light really a good idea?

816
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,120
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?

817
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,160
Who invented that?

818
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,960
An asshole.

819
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,080
What about bartender who owns the bar he works on?

820
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,760
I guess what I should be to be feminist.

821
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,520
Christ.

822
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,280
The demands of these people.

823
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,560
Those fucking teeth, man.

824
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,960

00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,480
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

826
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,560
It's okay, I'm being stupid.

827
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,080
Uh, okay.
