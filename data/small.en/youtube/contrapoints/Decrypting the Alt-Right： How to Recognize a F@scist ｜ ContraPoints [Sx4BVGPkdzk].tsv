0	10000	You will not replace us, you will not replace us, you will not replace us.
10000	15000	More than soil, more than soil, more than soil.
15000	20000	Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.
20000	25000	Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
25000	28000	Do they have any semblance of guilt?
28000	34000	A local World War II veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried
34000	39000	what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.
39000	41000	He believes what happened.
45000	50000	Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.
50000	58000	To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.
58000	62000	Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.
62000	69000	One, people of European heritage ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as the white race,
69000	72000	sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.
72000	78000	Two, Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and non-white immigration,
78000	82000	a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.
82000	88000	Three, the only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,
88000	91000	from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.
91000	95000	Now, as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false,
95000	98000	so what is it that's attracting people to fascism?
98000	103000	Well, let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure that out.
104000	107000	Who are you?
107000	111000	I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.
111000	116000	I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.
116000	122000	I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.
122000	127000	Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.
128000	131000	They could say, I'm a Roman.
131000	133000	I'm a Saxon.
133000	135000	I'm a Dane.
135000	136000	Good news, boys.
136000	140000	You no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA,
140000	146000	thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate,
146000	151000	because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand
151000	156000	and defend Voltaire, an adorable blonde children against black civil rights.
156000	160000	You know, just like the Vikings did.
162000	168000	We're often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German, or any European nationality,
168000	174000	is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.
174000	176000	Democracy.
176000	178000	Freedom.
178000	180000	Tolerance.
180000	182000	Multiculturalism.
182000	188000	But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.
188000	192000	So, life is basically sad.
192000	196000	And in capitalist society, that sadness is a sense of isolation,
196000	201000	an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990's collector's edition
201000	205000	Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Beersdine's Until You Die.
205000	209000	Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.
209000	212000	Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself,
212000	214000	a homeland for your people,
214000	218000	a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years,
218000	220000	and as far into the future.
220000	226000	Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling other human beings as property.
226000	231000	The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.
231000	237000	The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white ethnostate is just nonsense.
238000	242000	Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to
242000	247000	is in no way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.
247000	253000	And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become the same thing.
253000	258000	But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt propaganda.
258000	262000	In the wake of the disastrous Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month,
262000	265000	the Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.
265000	267000	At least two of their major websites were shut down,
267000	270000	Confederate monuments were removed all over the country,
270000	273000	and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.
273000	275000	None of this means fascists will go away,
275000	278000	it just means they'll have to be more subtle and indirect.
278000	280000	Shortly after the Charlottesville rally,
280000	283000	a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared on poll,
283000	289000	the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of Japanese nymphettes.
289000	292000	The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.
292000	297000	Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.
297000	303000	Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away is really stupid.
303000	308000	We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the Overton window to the right,
308000	313000	but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average white person.
313000	315000	And the way to do that is...
315000	319000	Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.
319000	323000	There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes
323000	327000	and holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.
327000	331000	This instantly makes the average person hate you.
331000	336000	Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental overt goals.
336000	342000	Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration
342000	348000	and prioritizes white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.
348000	353000	Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.
353000	360000	Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning against you.
360000	363000	So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.
363000	369000	Leftists will recognize dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.
369000	375000	So at first glance, this seems like a really silly juvenile post that references Dragon Ball Z.
375000	381000	But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to long-term goals
381000	383000	that I wish were more common on the left.
383000	386000	But of course the strategy described here isn't new.
386000	390000	Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.
390000	396000	When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in order to appeal to racists.
396000	401000	Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.
401000	409000	You start out in 1954 by saying, by 1968, you can't say that hurts you backfires.
409000	414000	So you say stuff like force busing states rights and all that stuff.
414000	422000	You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these things that you're talking about a totally economic things.
422000	426000	And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.
426000	431000	So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to hear dog whistles.
431000	437000	Because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism, and white supremacy.
437000	440000	At least when talking to you, a non-fascist.
440000	444000	Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.
444000	449000	Fascists are more likely to gain traction and are hence more dangerous when they use subtler tactics.
449000	455000	So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use to code their ideas
455000	459000	and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.
459000	463000	Strategy one, outright denial. Never reveal your power level.
463000	466000	Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.
466000	471000	This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking points,
471000	477000	and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism should be worth absolutely nothing to you
477000	481000	and shouldn't even enter into your consideration of whether they're a fascist.
481000	486000	After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.
486000	489000	Strategy two, euphemism.
489000	495000	Of course I'm not a fascist. I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve Western values.
495000	501000	Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations that develop around the names of their movements
501000	504000	whenever people figure out what they really are.
504000	509000	So they insist they are Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.
509000	513000	But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,
513000	516000	they'll shift their terminology again and start telling you,
516000	519000	I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.
519000	524000	or whatever the next thing is. But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.
524000	527000	They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.
527000	531000	If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist,
531000	536000	they'll talk about preserving Western civilization or Western culture instead.
536000	540000	If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.
540000	544000	And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people,
544000	548000	they'll talk instead about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists,
548000	551000	and leave it to the audience to catch the color-coding on their own.
551000	554000	Strategy three, pedantry.
554000	560000	It's absurd to call me a Nazi. The German National Socialist Party has an existence since 1945.
560000	565000	That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.
565000	569000	Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels
569000	573000	and also to bond you down in a petty, terminological dispute.
573000	578000	This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led you to call them a Nazi in the first place.
578000	583000	I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think that whites are superior to other races.
583000	587000	I simply think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.
587000	592000	There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest IQs,
592000	595000	he's, if anything, an Asian supremacist.
595000	597000	And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ
597000	601000	instead of talking about the fact that the main goal of the politics he supports
601000	606000	is the political and social supremacy of white people over all other Americans and Europeans.
606000	608000	In other words, white supremacy.
608000	611000	Strategy four, secret symbols.
611000	616000	Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring
616000	618000	or like the swastika itself,
618000	625000	but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.
625000	630000	The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with fascism
630000	634000	or at least have some other meaning, such as the Athala rune or the Iron Cross.
634000	639000	Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.
639000	645000	Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod at each other,
645000	649000	notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.
649000	651000	So it doesn't matter what the symbols are.
651000	656000	In fact, it's important that the symbols constantly change so that normies don't catch on.
656000	659000	By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.
659000	661000	Maybe it'll be this.
661000	662000	Or this.
662000	667000	The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to identify themselves.
667000	673000	And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try to point those symbols out,
673000	675000	the fascists can always say,
675000	679000	These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.
679000	682000	Is there anything they don't think is racist?
682000	685000	And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.
685000	686000	The poor centrists.
686000	690000	They're so afraid that Antifa's gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.
690000	693000	And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.
693000	698000	So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair
698000	700000	or because of the emoji they use.
700000	703000	These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.
703000	708000	But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political rallies,
708000	710000	Oh God, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?
710000	714000	That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.
714000	719000	And the fascists whose free speech you defend so often are trying to drum up exactly the sentiments
719000	721000	that make the police dangerous to black people
721000	725000	and that make it dangerous for queer people to be themselves in public.
725000	727000	So I hope that's something you think about.
727000	730000	Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist
730000	732000	or that anyone who uses it is racist.
732000	737000	And in fact, it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink and nudge.
737000	740000	But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist
740000	743000	sets the stage for, strategy five,
743000	745000	camaraderie of the accused.
745000	747000	The left accuses everyone of racism.
747000	749000	They think all white people are Nazis.
749000	753000	If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.
753000	758000	Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,
758000	759000	especially online.
759000	764000	Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism
764000	767000	and some of them do throw the label at centrists or liberals.
767000	770000	This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists.
770000	772000	History shows that happens regardless.
772000	774000	But it can accelerate the process,
774000	778000	lending some plausibility to the fear that moderate centrists have
778000	781000	that anti-fascists will come after the next.
781000	784000	It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation
784000	788000	and use it to pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.
788000	793000	Strategy six, irony, jokes, satire, and memes.
793000	795000	Of course I wasn't actually being racist.
795000	797000	It was just an edgy meme.
797000	799000	Can anyone take a joke anymore
799000	803000	or will the anti-fascists violently attack you over humor now too?
803000	807000	Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.
807000	810000	You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes
810000	815000	and then when called out, you mock your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.
815000	820000	Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.
820000	822000	Before I realized I was transgender,
822000	826000	I used to jump at any opportunity to cross-dress ironically.
826000	829000	So when you see people joking about being Nazis,
829000	831000	they could just be joking,
831000	834000	or they could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.
834000	837000	It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.
838000	841000	But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.
841000	845000	Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements
845000	848000	that just happens to use a Nazi battle flag.
848000	852000	And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers
852000	856000	who are unable or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists,
856000	861000	Kekistan became the perfect pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians,
861000	863000	including the ones who led the rally
863000	867000	for an edgy shit-poster hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.
867000	870000	No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.
870000	874000	Pfft. Those normie fools. It's just a joke.
874000	877000	Strategy 7. Shifting blame.
877000	881000	Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations,
881000	883000	like Black Lives Matter or Antifa?
883000	886000	This is essentially just a two-quo-quay fallacy,
886000	891000	especially heinous because of the equivocation between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence
891000	894000	and between white nationalism and Black civil rights.
894000	899000	The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against Black people
899000	903000	is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.
903000	905000	Shortly after the Charlottesville incident,
905000	909000	our proto-fascist president called out Antifa in the alt-left,
909000	912000	a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists
912000	916000	and establish the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.
916000	920000	Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.
920000	925000	Both sides rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,
925000	928000	vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists,
928000	932000	and helps to shift the center of acceptable discourse in their direction.
932000	935000	Strategy 8. Incrementalism.
935000	939000	You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.
939000	943000	Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here,
943000	947000	but we do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?
947000	951000	The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation,
951000	955000	often aimed at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people
955000	958000	as a defense of white people and white culture.
958000	961000	The fascist's long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate,
961000	965000	which at some point will require massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another,
965000	969000	but of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.
969000	974000	The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,
974000	977000	and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration,
977000	982000	something they'll try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with
982000	987000	by emphasizing the danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.
987000	990000	If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric,
990000	994000	they can later turn that energy against the non-white people who are already here.
994000	997000	Strategy 9. The Free Speech Defense.
997000	999000	You may not agree with what I say,
999000	1003000	but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble as anyone else.
1003000	1009000	Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and intimidate,
1009000	1014000	often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies or by pressuring platforms not to host fascists.
1014000	1020000	The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value of free speech.
1020000	1025000	Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced you are.
1025000	1030000	But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.
1030000	1033000	They only value the race, the people, the nation.
1033000	1037000	Their long-term goal is a society where there is no room for anyone who isn't white,
1037000	1040000	or even anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.
1040000	1044000	So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms,
1044000	1047000	but remember, you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.
1047000	1050000	They do not care about diversity of opinions.
1050000	1055000	That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation
1055000	1058000	and to garner sympathy from centrists.
1060000	1084000	Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.
1084000	1088000	They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.
1088000	1095000	Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children who don't get sexual innuendo.
1095000	1098000	There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.
1098000	1103000	This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy to exploit.
1103000	1111000	Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking points without intending to or realizing it.
1111000	1116000	And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.
1116000	1122000	Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate fascist memes,
1122000	1124000	then isn't just about everyone suspect.
1124000	1128000	Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?
1128000	1130000	Well, that's what they want you to think.
1130000	1133000	They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.
1133000	1137000	I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-light
1137000	1140000	or if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.
1140000	1145000	Likewise, it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-light but not an outright fascist
1145000	1148000	and a fascist who is concealing their power level.
1148000	1151000	So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.
1151000	1156000	The other day, the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption,
1156000	1158000	This is the future ACLU members want.
1158000	1161000	And for a second I was like, what the fuck?
1161000	1164000	Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme.
1164000	1167000	But of course it's unintentional, it's the ACLU.
1168000	1174000	I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.
1174000	1176000	Not make a quick statement.
1176000	1180000	The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.
1180000	1184000	But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.
1184000	1186000	Yes, I have become crazy.
1186000	1190000	But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception
1190000	1196000	is the psychological consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists
1196000	1198000	and communicating in code.
1198000	1200000	And it's the intentional consequence of that.
1200000	1204000	Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist psychological arsenal.
1204000	1208000	So, how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?
1208000	1213000	I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,
1213000	1216000	it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you.
1216000	1220000	And I admit that I am pretty frustrated with you right now, obviously.
1220000	1226000	But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better at resisting fascism.
1226000	1229000	Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning.
1229000	1233000	So don't feel guilty for falling for them, just try to get better at resisting.
1233000	1238000	I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.
1238000	1242000	If you care about even one person of color or queer person or immigrant,
1242000	1246000	stand up for that person by opposing the alright and its allies.
1246000	1250000	Do not give them a platform. Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.
1250000	1253000	Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech,
1253000	1257000	but they do not have a right to a megaphone and you should not be giving them one.
1257000	1260000	I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas,
1260000	1262000	everyone expressing their ideas peacefully.
1262000	1266000	But to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous.
1266000	1269000	Because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.
1269000	1272000	Now if you're just an average person without a big platform,
1272000	1275000	then you actually can debate and you should be debating.
1275000	1277000	Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty.
1277000	1280000	Argue with your family. Argue with your coworkers.
1280000	1283000	Let them know that you don't agree. Make them listen to a different perspective.
1283000	1287000	And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years
1287000	1291000	and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group,
1291000	1293000	you have to get out now.
1293000	1296000	It's not too late, society will forgive you.
1296000	1299000	If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate,
1299000	1303000	an organization founded by a former neo-Nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.
1303000	1306000	And as for all you lefties, naz drovia.
1306000	1308000	Keep up the good fight, comrades.
1363000	1365000	Thanks for watching.
1393000	1395000	Thanks for watching.
