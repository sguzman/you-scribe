1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Saar, I'm gonna talk about Jorro once again.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,340
But first, story time.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,680
Chapter one, Anita.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,800
The most famous bigot in American LGBT history

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,240
is a woman called Anita Bryant.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,140
This is her story.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,540
1977 was not a good time to be gay.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,920
Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,740
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,240
into national consciousness.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,080
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,320
and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,100
declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,940
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,380
and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,980
We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,960
Because that's the only way to get anything done

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,440
in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,700
They give you no choice.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,780
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,680
known for such popular cities as Miami,

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,640
approved a law that added the phrase

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,060
affectionate or sexual preference

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,020
to its non-discrimination ordinance,

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,980
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,040
on the basis of sexual orientation.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,040
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,960
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,220
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,140
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,900
who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,680
and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,240
Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree.

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,040
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,200
any time of the day.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,740
Orange juice from Florida!

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,920
It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,320
Orange juice with natural vitamin C

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,860
from the Florida Sunshine Tree.

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,700
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,060
A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,620
Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,460
Cute.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,140
When Anita heard her pastor speak

45
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,160
about this non-discrimination ordinance,

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,700
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,620
How touching.

48
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,020
According to the word of God,

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,980
it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,060
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

51
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,480
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner,

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,320
as a concerned mother of four children,

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,400
I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
I have never condoned

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,440
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
you will in fact be infringing upon my rights

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,800
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
to teach my children God's moral code

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,680
as stated in the Holy Scriptures.

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,960
Anita, kill your shitty child.

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
When the amendment passed,

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
Anita created a campaign for its repeal.

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,760
The Save Our Children Coalition,

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,800
which sponsored provocative TV ads

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,040
implying that gay people are degenerates

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
who ruin communities and seduce children.

68
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,600
The campaign has been vicious.

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
With television commercials,

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
the Save Our Children group is appealing

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
to parental anxieties,

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,000
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
before impressionable children.

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,240
The Orange Bowl parade,

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,640
Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,940
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

77
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,740
it's a parade of homosexuals,

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,220
men hugging other men,

79
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,700
cavorting with little boys.

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,140
Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,220
to gay rights in the United States,

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,140
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

83
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,740
On one side were the gay rights activists

84
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,180
who argued that non-discrimination

85
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,860
was a matter of human rights.

86
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,540
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,140
that the non-discrimination ordinance

88
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,700
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

89
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,060
We all believe in human rights,

90
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,820
but we don't believe human rights

91
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,500
that would corrupt our children

92
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,620
or for individuals who have special privileges

93
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,820
that would go against the constitutional rights

94
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,100
of the normal America.

95
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,260
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

96
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,060
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

97
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,900
In other words, gay people already have equal rights

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,100
just as long as they stay in the closet

99
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,820
and don't do anything gay.

100
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,940
That's very helpful.

101
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,460
Thank you so much, Anita,

102
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,940
for standing up for our right to be gay

103
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,020
in secret.

104
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,660
As long as they do their job

105
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,100
and do not want to come out of the closet

106
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,140
and force their homosexuality

107
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,140
on being in the areas of business or in the schools,

108
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,060
they can live their life.

109
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,260
And we're not going out after their jobs

110
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,020
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

111
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,580
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals

112
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,420
to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.

113
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,500
Just biologically that God made mothers

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,700
so that we could reproduce.

115
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,060
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

116
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,700
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,220
It's the exact same argument that's being used today

118
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,940
by right-wing politicians who claim

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,020
that queer people are groomers.

120
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,500
Stop confusing our babies

121
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,100
with your groomer gender ideologue.

122
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,580
This wicked book, me and Earl and the dying girl

123
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,380
sexually indoctrinated with wicked vile books.

124
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,940
And she believes in traditional marriage

125
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,020
between a man and a woman.

126
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,980
And in that book it talked about two moms.

127
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,460
Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.

128
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,780
People should definitely arm themselves.

129
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,620
I agree with that.

130
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,580
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

131
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,700
The Democrats are the party of teachers,

132
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,140
elementary school teachers,

133
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,220
trying to transition their elementary school-aged children

134
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,260
and convince them they're a different gender.

135
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,620
They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.

136
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,740
They're recruiting.

137
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,020
They don't know what furries are.

138
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,940
It's where school children dress up as animals,

139
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,500
cats or dogs during the school day.

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,940
They meow and they bark.

141
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,140
What a great country we live in.

142
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,020
I love it so much.

143
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,020
Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant

144
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,260
and save our children.

145
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,100
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice

146
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,060
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

147
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,180
and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,980
called an Anita Bryant.

149
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,060
Let's make one now.

150
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,140
Forgot my cocktail measure

151
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,620
so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

152
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,420
There's the dash of apple juice.

153
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,860
Give it a stir.

154
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,420
Needs a garnish.

155
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,260
Stunning.

156
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,780
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,

157
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
but if I was in the 70s,

158
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,940
I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things

159
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,620
out of pure spite.

160
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,300
There's a story that Troy Perry,

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,860
the founder of the gay-affirming

162
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,820
metropolitan community church,

163
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,860
was on a transcontinental flight.

164
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,700
And when the attendant put a glass of orange juice

165
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,940
on his tray, he said,

166
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,300
take that away.

167
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,740
I'm a homosexual.

168
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,260
At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,

169
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,860
anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently

170
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,060
on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.

171
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,300
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

172
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,820
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

173
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,660
True.

174
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,500
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired

175
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,380
more anti-gay legislation,

176
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,460
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,

177
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,600
both of which passed in the Florida Senate,

178
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,640
as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,

179
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,240
which would have forced public schools

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
to fire gay teachers.

181
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,000
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,940
She was an influential bigot,

183
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,040
but she may also have helped to unify

184
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,080
and galvanize gay activists

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,200
by providing them with a common enemy.

186
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
According to historian Lillian Faderman,

187
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
Anita Bryant created fervent activists

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
out of those who'd previously been content

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,240
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,620
Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation

191
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,820
that a mass movement can get along fine without a God,

192
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,060
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

193
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,020
For gay people all over the country,

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,500
Anita Bryant became that devil.

195
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,700
I think that she is rallying the community together

196
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,220
like I have never seen before.

197
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,980
It's not like I could have done it on my own.

198
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,660
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal

199
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,940
to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,420
there is no question that in the long term,

201
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,260
Anita Bryant was the loser.

202
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,780
She took a lot of L's.

203
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
Rip.

204
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,820
That must be super hard for her.

205
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
For the short remainder of her career,

206
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,180
gay activists protested her events.

207
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,900
They shut down the tour for her book

208
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,020
about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

209
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,320
and they succeeded in turning public opinion

210
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,260
against Anita Bryant to the point

211
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,420
that she became virtually unemployable

212
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,980
in mainstream entertainment.

213
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,420
And it helped that she came across

214
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,220
as kind of a judgmental prude

215
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,980
that even hip straight people

216
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,140
didn't want to be associated with.

217
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,780
Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant,

218
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,580
former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,

219
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,620
performed co-eaters in public yesterday,

220
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,980
campaigned to promote heterosexuality.

221
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,900
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

222
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,980
Like she famously told Playboy magazine.

223
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,380
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

224
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,980
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit

225
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,220
of the tree of life.

226
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,100
God referred to men as trees,

227
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,680
and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,980
which is male sperm.

229
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,260
Oh my God.

230
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,720
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,460
This is how you lose the culture war.

232
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,660
Let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita.

233
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,660
That's the energy we surround.

234
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,240
And of course, there was the famous incident

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,020
where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie

236
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,380
in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

237
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,660
And went into a place called North Fork, Virginia,

238
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,220
and we're met with protest and all kinds of problems.

239
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,060
And every-

240
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,780
Security agent, security agent.

241
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,620
No, no, let him stay.

242
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,220
No. Let him stay.

243
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,100
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated

245
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,820
the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,

246
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,280
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

247
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,660
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face

248
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,220
when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

249
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,540
announcing her marriage to a woman and publicly struggling

250
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,580
with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.

251
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks

252
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,180
that an integral part of your identity

253
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,540
is just an evil delusion.

254
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,620
That it is, Sarah.

255
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,420
That it is.

256
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,260
So that's the story of Anita Bryant

257
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,820
as students of LGBT history know it.

258
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,260
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

259
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,660
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

260
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,700
The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

261
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,460
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

262
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,740
I played on both the houses.

263
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,060
Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita

264
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,100
as a bigot and a homophobe?

265
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,380
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

266
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,420
was the real victim?

267
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,700
Oh, no.

268
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh, no.

269
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,420
I can't do this anymore.

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
I'm eating my pie.

271
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,620
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

272
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,980
Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

273
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,900
God help us all.

274
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,180
The mainstream media would have us believe

275
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,940
that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,

276
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,060
some kind of hateful bigot.

277
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,340
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic

278
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,860
used to silence valid concerns?

279
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,820
Mothers in this country are worried

280
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,540
about their children going to school

281
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,460
to be taught by perverts.

282
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,380
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals

283
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,580
weren't the real bigots?

284
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,860
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

285
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,300
was the first victim of cancel culture,

286
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,980
of dare I say it, wokeism?

287
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,140
Well, no, that's the dumbest thing

288
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,700
I've ever heard in my entire life.

289
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,340
But suppose that you're an idiot,

290
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,820
and suppose that that's the narrative

291
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,020
you wanted to promote.

292
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,940
Well, what would be your argument?

293
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,500
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head

294
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,460
and forced me to make that argument,

295
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,900
I'd probably say something like this.

296
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

297
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,500
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty

298
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,060
in rural Oklahoma.

299
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,660
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

300
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,620
the same year she made her singing debut

301
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,380
at the Baptist Church.

302
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,620
Parts of my childhood,

303
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,700
I blocked out because it hurts too much.

304
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,100
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,

305
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,460
and my parents were remarried,

306
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,380
and I was baptized and came to know Christ

307
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,940
as my personal savior.

308
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,100
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

309
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,620
It was real painful,

310
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,460
and it just about killed my mother.

311
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,500
She was a very submissive wife.

312
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,260
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

313
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,540
She let my dad step all over her.

314
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,900
Because of him, I think I went through life

315
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
for a long time hating all men.

316
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,340
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory

317
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,700
as a feeling of intense ambition.

318
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,220
A relentless drive to succeed

319
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,940
at doing well the thing I loved.

320
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

321
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,580
It's truth is marching on.

322
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,300
But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role

323
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,660
as a traditional Christian woman.

324
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,500
In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,

325
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,140
Miami's top disc jockey,

326
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,260
the only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

327
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

328
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,140
Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

329
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,220
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

330
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,460
Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty

331
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,220
nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

332
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,940
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

333
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,100
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

334
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,020
But while submitting to her husband

335
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,100
and raising four children, Anita was still able

336
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,220
to build the career she'd always wanted.

337
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,660
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,

338
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,780
earning half a million dollars a year,

339
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,100
enough to move her family

340
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,900
into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

341
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,340
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

342
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,860
Did she really deserve to lose it all

343
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,300
just because she took a stand

344
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,140
for something she believed in?

345
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,660
Anita Bryant's role as a leader in the campaign

346
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,380
against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign

347
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,500
to sell orange juice.

348
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,140
Are you being black-bowled?

349
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,660
Well, it looks that way.

350
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,940
It's worse than that.

351
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,020
We're being threatened, and there's all kinds of harassment,

352
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,700
even with my job with Florida Citrus.

353
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,260
I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother

354
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,340
to defend her children and all children

355
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,100
against their being recruited by homosexuals.

356
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,740
Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.

357
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,380
She'd been dropped as a spokesperson by the orange growers.

358
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,780
She'd been dropped as a commentator

359
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,460
on the Orange Bowl parade.

360
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
She lost a television show contract.

361
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,260
Her bookings dropped drastically.

362
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,220
It destroys the dream that I had had since I was a child

363
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,580
to entertain and present wholesome subjects

364
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,460
to my fellow Americans

365
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,220
because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.

366
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,980
No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant

367
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,260
for taking a public stand on something she believed in.

368
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,580
I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house

369
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,700
in a fetal position and wanting to die.

370
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,660
Gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics

371
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,740
to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.

372
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,620
Stop Anita now!

373
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,980
Stop Anita now!

374
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,420
Homosexuals started fighting back.

375
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,940
The gays formed new groups

376
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,380
and picketed the performers' public appearances,

377
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,060
forcing her to cancel a few.

378
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,660
Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.

379
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,580
They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.

380
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,460
They blamed her for hate crimes.

381
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,180
They burned her an effigy.

382
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,700
They disrupted events she was involved in.

383
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,340
They printed toilet paper with her face on it.

384
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,220
Some sent Anita death threats.

385
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,140
Or they mailed her rotting oranges,

386
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,980
dead cockroaches, human excrement.

387
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,580
See, this is how you canceled people before phones.

388
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,940
Instead of shitposting,

389
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,620
you would simply mail actual human shit

390
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,420
through the United States Postal Service.

391
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,980
Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night.

392
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,260
Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.

393
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,580
How would you men feel if you opened a letter

394
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,300
and there was a photo of your wife's head superimposed

395
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,980
on some other female nude body

396
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,460
in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?

397
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,540
You can imagine quite a lot.

398
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,060
I do think it would be fair to say

399
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,660
that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.

400
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,060
Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,

401
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,860
particularly lesbian feminists, abhorred the sexist terms

402
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,420
that were being used to characterize Anita Bryant.

403
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,620
Bitch and whore, gay men called her.

404
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,660
The harassment escalated to the point

405
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,940
where Anita had to cancel her book tour

406
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,700
due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.

407
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,780
And of course, there was the pie.

408
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,020
So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.

409
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,860
It's kind of a deep cut.

410
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.

411
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,980
Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,

412
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,340
but what about Anita's right to free speech?

413
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,700
I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.

414
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,140
Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book,

415
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,420
Free Speech for Me, but Not for Thee,

416
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,860
that the orange shoes boycott reminded him

417
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,860
of a little thing called McCarthyism.

418
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,460
Have you ever considered that being pro-gay

419
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,980
is quite similar to being anti-gay

420
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,100
and that both are opinions?

421
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,420
As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God

422
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,980
were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.

423
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,380
The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,

424
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,420
religious and civic leaders in opposition

425
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,980
to a well-organized, highly financed,

426
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,180
and politically militant group of homosexual activists.

427
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,020
We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,

428
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,340
and deniers of basic human rights.

429
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,460
And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned

430
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,220
for our children and our community.

431
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,980
So Anita's version of the story is that she

432
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,500
and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers

433
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,180
were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia

434
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,780
of gay extremists, all because they had

435
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,220
a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual

436
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,860
cavorting with little boys.

437
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,340
Cavorting with little boys.

438
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,300
Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?

439
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
Until the Dade County ordinance,

440
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,100
Anita was a registered Democrat

441
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,220
and considered herself a liberal.

442
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,420
And she never said that she hated gay people

443
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,860
or wanted them dead.

444
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,780
In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.

445
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,980
I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.

446
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,140
I love them enough to tell them the truth

447
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,700
because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals

448
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,660
that if they're willing to turn from sin

449
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,340
the same as any individual,

450
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,740
that they can be ex-homosexuals,

451
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,300
the same as there can be an ex-murder,

452
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,860
an ex thief, or ex-anybody.

453
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,300
She loves homosexuals because they can change,

454
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,140
just like murderers.

455
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,260
Would a bigot have said that?

456
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
Just about McFucking had it.

457
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,700
Anita was so kindhearted,

458
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,220
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

459
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,020
I can relate to the homosexual

460
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,900
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

461
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
I really felt the rejection of my father.

462
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,220
And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone

463
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,100
going into homosexuality.

464
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,220
Look, I don't hate homosexuals.

465
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,180
That's the truth.

466
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,100
No matter what they think of my motives.

467
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,620
I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.

468
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,260
Wow, what an empath.

469
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,140
You know, I actually think it's really noble

470
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,340
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

471
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,740
onto the marginalized group

472
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,500
whose rights she's trying to take away.

473
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,660
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,

474
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,740
to many sides.

475
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,900
We've considered all the evidence.

476
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,140
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

477
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,860
and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve

478
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,300
that pie to the face?

479
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,140
Well, yes, obviously.

480
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,740
But the point I'm trying to make here

481
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,620
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

482
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,660
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,

483
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,780
and to twist them into fucked up apologia

484
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,940
for horrible, oppressive behavior.

485
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,620
If you play this game long enough,

486
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,380
you can essentially explain away

487
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
the entire concept of bigotry

488
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,740
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

489
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,220
There's only tragically misunderstood people

490
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,420
with difficult childhoods and valid concerns

491
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,780
cruelly demonized by militant activists

492
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,880
defaming and silencing them

493
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,940
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

494
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Now, because you, viewers, are smart, media-literate people,

495
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,380
you understand framing, so you already know

496
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,900
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.

497
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,420
In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling...

498
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,220
Oh, J.K. Rowling is a popular author

499
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,740
who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

500
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,860
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers

501
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,740
masturbating into stolen panties

502
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,060
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

503
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,060
Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.

504
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,220
Christ, what a nightmare.

505
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,360
Chapter three, The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

506
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,600
All right, kids, it's trans in time.

507
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,580
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast

508
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,300
about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,

509
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,420
an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church.

510
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,340
The notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,

511
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,660
most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers

512
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,940
with signs that say God hates f***s.

513
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,900
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

514
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,780
J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church

515
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,080
is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups

516
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,000
in the world.

517
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,980
In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

518
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,740
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.

519
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,500
I went to a counter-protest in 2010.

520
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,420
I remember how when I was in high school,

521
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,260
the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing

522
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,900
that conservatives and liberals could agree on

523
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,260
because they hated the troops and the gays,

524
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,580
essentially the two genders of 2006.

525
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,420
But let's not pretend

526
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,820
that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

527
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,740
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,

528
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,060
she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies

529
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,020
about how the gays are going to hell,

530
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,380
which to this day, I am a big fan of.

531
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,060
But what did you say you think I loved your praying?

532
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,380
He hates all you do, cause you love fornicating.

533
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,500
It's perfect.

534
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,340
I love it.

535
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,660
Play it at my funeral.

536
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,820
Stop praying, stop praying, God will not hear you anymore.

537
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,540
You've got the boys and the girls to be proud of.

538
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,220
For, forever burned.

539
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,940
Go to the spot and you just keep pushing on

540
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,140
to the hell where you were forever burned.

541
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,620
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012

542
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,660
after a crisis of faith precipitated by a power struggle

543
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,060
within the church.

544
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,940
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,

545
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,380
which is honestly a pretty interesting account

546
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,140
of deconversion and the circumstances

547
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,620
that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

548
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,020
Megan contacted me for her podcast

549
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,580
because I had criticized to take a ruling

550
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
in a video a couple of years ago.

551
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,820
Now you might be wondering, why would I think

552
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,940
that a person who's been carrying a God hates sign

553
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,340
most of her life would be the correct person

554
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,420
to lead an international conversation

555
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,380
about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

556
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,780
Because I'm an idiot, happy.

557
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,460
Basically, I agreed to the podcast

558
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,860
because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

559
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,980
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church

560
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,260
wants to mediate a conversation between me

561
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,300
and the author of Harry Potter.

562
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
Would you say no to that?

563
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,260
Maybe, if you're smart.

564
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,820
Last month, the podcast was announced

565
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,980
in an essay by Megan titled,

566
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,540
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

567
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,220
Obviously, a tendentious framing that posits Jo-ro

568
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,460
as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.

569
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,380
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling

570
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,940
complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

571
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,620
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob

572
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,260
holding a rotten hell rolling sign

573
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,140
juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

574
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,420
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

575
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,780
This did not bode well.

576
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,460
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter

577
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,300
because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy

578
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,380
to some kind of unearned J.K. Rowling redemption tour.

579
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,020
This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me,

580
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,620
calling me a bigot against God.

581
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,540
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

582
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,980
There's only one of him.

583
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,260
And he could really use your help, Shirley.

584
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,700
I said in these tweets that I felt used,

585
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,980
which that is how I felt,

586
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,500
but ultimately I need to take full responsibility

587
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,020
for my involvement in this.

588
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,660
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this

589
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,620
is you honestly have no idea

590
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,860
what the final product is gonna be like.

591
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,780
So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.

592
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,220
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

593
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,500
There are red flags from the beginning

594
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,140
and I ignored them because I was projecting

595
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,500
my own hopes onto the situation.

596
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,780
You know, it's a compelling story.

597
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,620
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot

598
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,220
could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.

599
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,660
We all love a good redemption arc.

600
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,620
And I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

601
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
That's something I've moved away from,

602
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,940
but there's still part of me

603
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,100
that wants to see the best in people

604
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,820
and to believe that people can change

605
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,980
if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.

606
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Maybe my wishful thinking was that

607
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,700
because Megan left Westboro,

608
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,100
that must mean that she must understand

609
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,620
the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

610
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,580
And despite no evidence for this,

611
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,460
my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally

612
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,300
and could be really effective at confronting Jo-Roe

613
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,060
about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?

614
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,860
Wrong.

615
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,700
I'm Megan Phelps-Roper,

616
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,020
and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

617
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,500
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling

618
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,620
is more than seven hours of apologetics for J.K.R.

619
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,860
The podcast presents Rowling as a complex,

620
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,860
humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist backstory.

621
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,060
Jo Rowling's rise to success

622
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,460
is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.

623
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,700
Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob

624
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,580
of transgender activists.

625
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,380
First no vote, first no vote!

626
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,380
All because she, as a woman,

627
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,380
had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

628
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,620
I had been becoming increasingly concerned

629
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,460
about the way in which women were being shut down.

630
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,180
Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.

631
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,980
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing

632
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,980
of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists

633
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,540
whom Rowling describes as

634
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,460
a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

635
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,220
For the first five hours of this podcast,

636
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,420
Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob

637
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,420
of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

638
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,140
You are murdering trans children!

639
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,620
Let's get out by the time!

640
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,940
A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

641
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,100
And you did it at my birthday dinner!

642
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,260
There's this one clip of some kind of Antifa super soldier's

643
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,700
abrasive screaming that they play like once per episode.

644
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,180
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

645
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,020
You look like you got your teeth knocked out

646
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,580
you fucking fascist!

647
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,860
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares

648
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,580
and you will die alone!

649
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,340
And then it usually cuts to like somber monks

650
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,260
chanting some kind of medieval lament.

651
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,180
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

652
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Ooh, species.

653
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Just in case you didn't get from the title

654
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,420
that this is a witch hunt.

655
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Ooh, species.

656
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,180
Do you guys get it?

657
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,420
Do you get it yet?

658
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,540
You got your teeth knocked out you fucking fascist!

659
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,300
Let's get out by the time!

660
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,740
And then these mobs of irrational,

661
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
misogynistic, trans rights fanatics

662
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,420
are contrasted with this poignant story

663
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,980
of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband

664
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,740
to publish our generation's most beloved novels.

665
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,580
I was still very committed to those parts

666
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,820
that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

667
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,340
because there was a truth to them

668
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,820
and there was a power to them.

669
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,300
The only voices of genuine trans descent

670
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,500
appear in episode six out of seven,

671
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,540
more than five hours in.

672
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,220
And there's only two of us.

673
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,660
One is me.

674
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,500
Shame.

675
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,740
And the other is a teenager named Noah

676
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,020
who kind of just seems like he wants to be liked

677
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,740
and understood and wishes that his favorite author

678
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,700
would please stop saying bigoted things about him.

679
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,100
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,

680
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,140
or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,

681
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,340
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

682
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,860
I can't even state how important it was to me.

683
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,660
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography

684
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,780
from my third grade classroom

685
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,620
and I kept it for a long time

686
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,780
because I just loved reading it

687
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,260
because I just admired her so much.

688
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,380
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

689
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,100
On my last day editing this video,

690
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,660
I got in touch with Noah.

691
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,980
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast

692
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,900
he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.

693
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,140
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue

694
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,740
are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.

695
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,220
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

696
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,980
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

697
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,340
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,

698
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
wellbeing, and ability to survive.

699
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,660
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling

700
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,060
should come second to fighting for maintained access

701
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,620
to healthcare, support, and general resources

702
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,260
for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

703
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,180
I agree.

704
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

705
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,020
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

706
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,340
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling

707
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,020
is the victim of a witch hunt

708
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,780
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

709
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,980
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

710
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,260
I mean, turf is basically witch.

711
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,260
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

712
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,460
Show me the actual words, Jack.

713
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,260
Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt

714
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,660
by trans people.

715
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,020
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

716
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Yes, a podcast on which I never once say

717
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,940
I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

718
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,780
What are you talking about?

719
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,500
I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.

720
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,580
Your license plate says scammin'.

721
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,300
Uh, no.

722
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,340
What do you mean, no?

723
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,500
Yes.

724
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,340
Joanne, show me where I ever said

725
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,460
that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

726
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,780
Why would you even think that?

727
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,220
You're crazy.

728
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,900
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt.

730
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,940
And Meghan is not much better.

731
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,620
Like, there's this whole section in episode two

732
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,540
where Meghan interviews Christians

733
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,540
who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,

734
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,660
and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

735
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,940
So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents

736
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,260
were maybe part of a moral panic?

737
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah, absolutely.

738
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,100
It's a scary world out there.

739
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,500
Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks

740
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
trans protests against Joe Roe

741
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,620
are equivalent to the Christian ones in the 90s,

742
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,980
but she does heavily imply it.

743
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,220
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,

744
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,340
which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,

745
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,300
to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,

746
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,260
boycotted, and in some cases, burned.

747
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,820
When confronted about the obvious implications

748
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,740
of the podcast's title,

749
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,540
Meghan said, the title is ambiguous.

750
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,380
Toward the end of her conversations,

751
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,940
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling

752
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,140
about discernment,

753
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,180
about how a person can ever know

754
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,260
if they're standing up for what's right

755
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,940
or joining a moral panic.

756
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,700
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

757
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,920
Meghan, I was not surprised.

758
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,820
I know I won't ever regret having stood up

759
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,260
on this issue, ever.

760
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,060
The podcast released new episodes weekly,

761
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,940
and whenever Meghan was challenged

762
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,180
about the blatant one-sidedness,

763
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,660
Meghan would respond, oh, you just think that

764
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,780
because you haven't listened to the whole podcast yet.

765
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,220
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

766
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,100
Much more of other perspectives is coming.

767
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,580
Make sure to tune in next week.

768
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,180
More bombshell revelations to come.

769
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,900
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,

770
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,780
and I truly do not think that anyone

771
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,600
with basic media comprehension skills

772
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,380
could come away from this thinking

773
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,140
that the main intent was anything other

774
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,500
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr

775
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,500
of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.

776
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,920
This is the obvious implication of the podcast

777
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,720
from the first words to the very last.

778
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,420
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

779
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,340
The final episode concludes with this.

780
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,540
There are more important things in this world

781
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,260
than being popular, and that doesn't mean

782
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,180
it's more important to me to be right.

783
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,020
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

784
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,460
Why would you end on that note?

785
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,140
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

786
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,180
if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe

787
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,740
that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

788
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,060
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

789
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,100
Like, there really is no other reasonable way

790
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,100
to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.

791
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,700
If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim

792
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,820
of a witch hunt, then just say that.

793
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,240
Make the argument you want to make.

794
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,900
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

795
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,100
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

796
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,260
Don't rely on innuendo and framing

797
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,260
and lack-for-most Gregorian chanting to make your point,

798
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,140
while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond,

799
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,660
I just believe in conversation.

800
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,220
I don't know, I just find this a slippery

801
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,160
and dishonest way to argue.

802
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,180
But if you happen to be a fan of slippery

803
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,060
and dishonest arguments, you're in luck,

804
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,900
because there is more where that came from.

805
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,380
This video is sponsored by Canabox.

806
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,580
Canabox offers fresh human meat

807
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,820
delivered directly to your doorstep.

808
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,100
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit

809
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,560
the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

810
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,380
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

811
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,120
Whenever a new box arrives, I get out my copy

812
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,860
of Bless This Food, the Anita Bryant family cookbook.

813
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
The best thing about human meat delivered

814
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,120
to your home by mail in the dead of night?

815
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,660
You don't know who you're eating,

816
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,680
so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

817
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,580
Maybe.

818
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,380
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

819
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,340
That means you're not allowed to cancel me.

820
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,660
Chapter four, Joe Roe's Transphobia.

821
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,500
That's it.

822
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm going full Slytherin.

823
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,920
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

824
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,580
Joe Roe compares trans activists to death eaters,

825
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,420
the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

826
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,700
My position is that this activist's movement,

827
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,340
in the form that it's currently taking,

828
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,860
echoes the very thing that I was

829
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,660
warning against in Harry Potter.

830
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,140
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made

831
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,780
to live in secret, and now is our time.

832
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,340
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

833
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,020
misogynistic movement.

834
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,780
When an article then claimed she had

835
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,020
equated trans people to death eaters,

836
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,060
the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,

837
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,400
because she only equated the movement to death eaters,

838
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,080
not trans people in general.

839
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,

840
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,320
I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.

841
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,840
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,

842
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,320
lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

843
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,200
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,

844
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,800
because she expresses it as an endless series

845
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,820
of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

846
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,960
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle

847
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,320
consisting of a mott, that is a tower atop a mound or hill,

848
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard

849
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,320
that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

850
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,800
So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes

851
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,760
a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.

852
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,540
And then, when confronted with counter arguments,

853
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,120
they walk it back to a much less controversial

854
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,640
and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.

855
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,540
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim

856
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,240
like sex is real, what does she mean by that?

857
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,880
What are the implications?

858
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,480
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks

859
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,680
it's very sinister that in the Associated Press style guide,

860
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,760
it says that instead of referring to a trans woman

861
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
as a man who identifies as a woman,

862
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,720
journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

863
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,480
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

864
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,800
They've edged from identifies as a woman,

865
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
so a man identifies as a woman,

866
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,720
and I think we all understand what that means,

867
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,480
into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep

868
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,560
that I'm talking about.

869
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,360
We are using language to make accurate definition

870
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,400
of sex difference unspeakable.

871
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Which is, of course, false, because the words trans

872
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,640
and cis exist precisely to make it easy

873
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,240
to talk about sex difference.

874
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,960
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

875
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,860
God, there's this whole section of the podcast

876
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,340
that sort of implies that transgender people

877
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,060
are invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even

878
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,340
gonna get into because we don't have time.

879
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,940
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks

880
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,380
that all people who menstruate

881
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,700
must be referred to as women.

882
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,860
Or was it wombin'?

883
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,380
I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.

884
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,860
So trans men and transmasculine people,

885
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,500
they're all women, and it must be referred to as women,

886
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,100
because J.K. Rowling demands it.

887
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,660
This is controversial, right?

888
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,740
Calling trans women men who identify as women,

889
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,540
calling trans men women.

890
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,660
This is the Bailey in her Ma and Bailey argument.

891
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,180
Trans women are men, trans men are women.

892
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,700
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

893
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,060
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,

894
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,660
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

895
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,860
I'm being persecuted just for saying

896
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,100
that women should be allowed to discuss

897
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,820
how being female has shaped our lives.

898
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,220
Women should be allowed to discuss

899
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,540
how being female has shaped our lives.

900
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,420
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial

901
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,940
interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.

902
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,500
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make

903
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,980
about trans people follows this pattern.

904
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,860
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstader,

905
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,900
will tweet inflammatory things like,

906
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,140
men cannot change into women.

907
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,820
But then when she's criticized,

908
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,700
she'll say that she's being attacked

909
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,780
for gender critical belief.

910
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,580
Gender critical belief, which is the absolutely

911
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,020
ordinary belief about sex,

912
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,020
that your mother and your grandmother are women,

913
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,940
that being female is a thing.

914
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,580
Your mother and grandmother are women.

915
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Being female is a thing.

916
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,820
That's literally all I'm saying.

917
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,060
But if that's literally all she was saying,

918
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,820
then no one would be mad, would they?

919
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,580
Nine, nah.

920
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,860
Men cannot change into women is the Bailey.

921
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,500
Your mom is a woman is the Mott.

922
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,780
Your mom's a woman.

923
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,860
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

924
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,740
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

925
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,660
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

926
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,540
Then when trans people understandably get mad,

927
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,420
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked just for saying

928
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,100
that being female is part of my experience.

929
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,140
It's dishonest.

930
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,220
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people.

931
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,260
And then when trans people talk trash back,

932
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,900
they pretend that they're being victimized

933
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,060
for making totally innocuous statements.

934
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,700
We can name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

935
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,820
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met

936
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,380
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up

937
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,580
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.

938
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,980
I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.

939
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,340
It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.

940
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,900
And somehow it always worked.

941
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,700
So a birthday boy argument is when you make aggressive

942
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,660
inflammatory assertions followed by teacher, teacher,

943
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,180
look what he's doing to me.

944
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,920
When the target reacts with anything less

945
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,420
than extreme politeness.

946
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,380
Another common tactic you'll see anytime

947
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,460
Rowling's transphobia is discussed

948
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,260
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

949
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,500
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

950
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,660
For example, here's someone on Twitter

951
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,940
called large gamete producer.

952
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,420
It's funny, isn't it?

953
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,940
How these people will insist that awkward inclusive language

954
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,160
like people who menstruate is horribly oppressive

955
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
and degrading, but then they'll just straight up

956
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,620
call themselves large gamete producer.

957
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,540
Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

958
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,540
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

959
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,720
Oh, I like it, it's very brood mother.

960
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,580
That Rowling's words regularly appear

961
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,660
in gender critical arguments shows the massive influence

962
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,900
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

963
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,220
She's like their queen, their leader,

964
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,380
their headmistress.

965
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,100
She's the best thing that ever happened to them

966
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,340
because Sheila Jefferies certainly wasn't persuading

967
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,180
a lot of people.

968
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,240
If you know, you know.

969
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,460
Large gamete producers says, JK isn't anti-trans,

970
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,020
give me just one direct quote that she has said

971
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,420
which is anti-trans.

972
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,740
Oh, what's that?

973
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,260
You can't find one?

974
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,980
Well, color me shocked.

975
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,680
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

976
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,180
let's take a look at large gamete producers profile.

977
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,740
Trans women are not women, they are men.

978
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,520
Trans men are not men, they are women.

979
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,900
Nothing can change that.

980
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,300
Sex is binary.

981
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,820
Like if this person doesn't think

982
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,860
that trans women are men, trans men are women

983
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,740
is a transphobic statement,

984
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,420
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

985
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,620
This is why the first question you should always ask

986
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,780
such people is, do you believe

987
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,460
that transphobia is a legitimate concept?

988
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,140
What are some examples of statements

989
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,200
that you would consider transphobic?

990
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,820
Because many of them don't believe

991
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,060
that transphobia is a valid concept

992
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,760
because they don't think that trans people

993
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,380
are a legitimate minority.

994
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,860
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

995
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

996
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,000
There is no such thing.

997
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,900
There are people that call themselves these things

998
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,160
that may have other issues manifesting

999
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,260
that then make them think they're this, but no.

1000
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,940
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

1001
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,700
There may be more words that we have to say

1002
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,640
in order to say that.

1003
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,960
We may call it transgender ideology,

1004
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,500
but when it comes to a person,

1005
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,980
they may be following transgender ideology,

1006
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,520
but they are not transgender.

1007
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,060
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

1008
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,240
being anything other than a man or a woman.

1009
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,600
So when they say, show me an example

1010
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said.

1011
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,560
This is a trap.

1012
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800
They're just messing with you.

1013
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,840
There's nothing that she could have said

1014
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,880
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

1015
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
Now, if you're someone who believes

1016
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,240
that transphobia is a valid concept

1017
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,240
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

1018
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
but you just genuinely are unaware

1019
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,540
of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,

1020
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,720
then I will refer you to my past video

1021
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,680
on J.K. Rowling's transphobia

1022
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
rather than recapping it all here.

1023
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

1024
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,560
since I made that video.

1025
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

1026
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people

1027
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,340
because she's not a complete idiot,

1028
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,120
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

1029
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,360
She said, save our children.

1030
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,840
I love women, actually.

1031
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,760
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

1032
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

1033
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,240
but he will share a lot of statistics

1034
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,120
about anti-white crime.

1035
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,840
So this is not really a very good criterion

1036
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,640
for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

1037
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,520
What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again

1038
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,360
about transgender rapists,

1039
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,200
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

1040
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,360
She implies that trans inclusive language

1041
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,680
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

1042
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,000
She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal

1043
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,140
of endocrinologists and ideolog

1044
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,400
that is supposedly persuading confused vulnerable girls

1045
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,520
to transition.

1046
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,560
To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,

1047
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,800
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

1048
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,200
but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.

1049
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think,

1050
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,020
it asks them to fear.

1051
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,320
It creates phobias of trans people.

1052
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,320
It creates trans phobias, if you will.

1053
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,720
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician

1054
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,920
Nicholas Sturgeon, calling her destroyer of women's rights

1055
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,880
via a t-shirt she got from anti-trans heat monger

1056
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,120
Posey Parker.

1057
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,600
There's no such thing as a trans woman,

1058
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,760
there's no such thing as a trans person,

1059
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,720
there is no such thing.

1060
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

1061
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,080
about Rowling's transphobia,

1062
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,120
it's that this is not a case of someone posting

1063
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,720
a couple insensitive tweets

1064
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,380
that got blown out of proportion.

1065
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,320
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.

1066
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

1067
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,560
And because she's so famous,

1068
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,420
she's become the de facto global champion

1069
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,340
of backlash to trans rights.

1070
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,980
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

1071
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,780
Except worse, because she's way more famous

1072
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,960
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

1073
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,180
Rowling has also praised self-described

1074
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,020
theocratic fascist Matt Walsh

1075
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,180
for his transphobic propaganda film.

1076
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,140
She refers to trans women as trans identified males,

1077
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,320
known as Tims among people for whom

1078
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,020
this has become an unhealthy obsession.

1079
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,260
She retweets images of the trans colors

1080
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,220
being erased from the progress flag.

1081
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,700
Also, the colors representing queer people of color.

1082
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,100
So, you know, great.

1083
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,940
Love that.

1084
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,620
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

1085
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,140
for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.

1086
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,400
It's something of a fixation for her.

1087
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,500
I find this particularly gross

1088
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,980
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

1089
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,660
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

1090
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,740
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

1091
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,740
of cis people.

1092
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,420
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

1093
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,260
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person

1094
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,060
and also most likely at 96% to say that they're supportive

1095
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,260
or very supportive of trans people.

1096
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,660
So, I think it's fair to say that most gay women

1097
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,980
are probably not super thrilled

1098
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,660
whenever Jo-ro the lesbian defender logs on.

1099
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,740
My own partner is a cis lesbian,

1100
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,180
and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling

1101
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,500
defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,

1102
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,300
it makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.

1103
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,900
By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit of banter

1104
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,700
with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

1105
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,340
the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.

1106
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,380
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

1107
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,660
of the House of Lords

1108
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,980
who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.

1109
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,860
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

1110
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,060
claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading

1111
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,180
the status of women and girls.

1112
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,220
Truly, one of the great lesbian allies.

1113
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,980
And in 2022, here is JK Rowling

1114
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,180
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

1115
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,900
Excellent question, Emma.

1116
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,300
Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

1117
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,180
excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,

1118
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,540
i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.

1119
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,780
And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

1120
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,860
They're wearing eyeliner pickets.

1121
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,580
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia

1122
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,140
you may have for the Gryffindor common room

1123
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,780
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

1124
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,020
Two straight women,

1125
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,180
one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,

1126
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,180
having a nice little chuckle together

1127
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,260
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

1128
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,820
So that's it, right?

1129
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,740
It's over.

1130
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,900
Case closed.

1131
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,980
I still like hammering things.

1132
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,660
I'm not gonna argue anymore

1133
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,500
about whether JK Rowling is transphobic

1134
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,980
because anyone who believes in transphobia

1135
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,620
can see that obviously she is.

1136
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,100
The question now is whether transphobia

1137
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,380
is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,

1138
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,420
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

1139
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,340
misogyny, and homophobia.

1140
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,940
That's usually what we're talking about

1141
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,140
when we talk about JK Rowling, right?

1142
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,980
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

1143
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,500
That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.

1144
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,940
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

1145
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,700
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

1146
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,660
worthy of polite consideration and respect

1147
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,820
in liberal humane society?

1148
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,980
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

1149
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,100
that we can justifiably react to

1150
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,060
with scorn and condemnation?

1151
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,140
And there's an even broader question here

1152
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,540
about whether we can justifiably react

1153
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,540
to anything with scorn and condemnation.

1154
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,960
Is canceling ever warranted?

1155
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,280
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

1156
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,880
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

1157
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas?

1158
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Where we can all sit around debating

1159
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,160
the legitimacy of gay marriage

1160
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,200
or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

1161
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,960
Is the final solution a myth promulgated

1162
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,840
by the international Jew?

1163
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,380
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

1164
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,240
Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money

1165
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

1166
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
Who knows?

1167
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,320
These are open questions.

1168
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,080
Let's sit down with people on both sides.

1169
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,400
On many sides and have calm,

1170
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,160
civil conversations about it

1171
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

1172
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,240
Chapter five, debate.

1173
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
Sorry, I know I did this look before

1174
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
and it's like not related to the video topic at all,

1175
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,280
but it just makes me feel sliving.

1176
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,600
The boy who slived.

1177
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,280
So Megan Phelps's rober's viewpoint

1178
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,500
seems to be that scorn and condemnation

1179
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,080
are never appropriate.

1180
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,000
That we should approach every conflict

1181
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
with empathy and compassion

1182
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,480
even when dealing with the worst,

1183
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,480
most destructive people in the world.

1184
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,920
Hi, my name is Megan.

1185
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,200
And my heretical belief is that

1186
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
even the people who seem to be

1187
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,080
the worst, most destructive people in the world

1188
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,640
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

1189
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,600
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

1190
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,640
In her book, in her TED Talk, in her public appearances,

1191
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,520
Megan expresses the idea that society

1192
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,040
has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way

1193
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,560
that we've all become extremists.

1194
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,860
That in some sense,

1195
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,600
we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.

1196
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,840
I can't help but see in our public discourse

1197
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,300
so many of the same destructive impulses

1198
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,880
that ruled my former church.

1199
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,320
She identifies things like certainty,

1200
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,360
vilification of compromise,

1201
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,120
us versus them thinking,

1202
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,720
suppression of empathy,

1203
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,480
and celebration of death and misfortune

1204
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,920
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

1205
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,800
And this really bothers Megan

1206
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,540
because she claims that a decade ago,

1207
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,280
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

1208
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,160
how f***ing marriage is abominable to God,

1209
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,440
it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way

1210
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,240
that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

1211
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,160
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

1212
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,480
She's totally right that if you want to change people's minds,

1213
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,280
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

1214
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,920
is usually the best way to do that.

1215
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,840
But Megan reaches another conclusion

1216
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,280
that I don't agree with,

1217
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,700
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

1218
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,000
are most likely to persuade people,

1219
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,720
we should never cancel anyone,

1220
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,760
even the most horrible bigots.

1221
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,440
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.

1222
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,520
But what Megan means is

1223
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,840
we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.

1224
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,520
We shouldn't boycott or counter protest

1225
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,180
or raise our voices.

1226
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,000
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone

1227
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,120
because that's just not how you change minds.

1228
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,080
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

1229
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,920
De-radicalization was a really important part

1230
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,560
of her life experience.

1231
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,240
She's also clearly holding out hope

1232
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,560
that other members of her family will leave Westboro

1233
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,300
and have a life on the outside.

1234
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,480
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

1235
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,840
"'The last lines of her book address her family.

1236
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,700
"'I want to tell them that I love them.

1237
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,700
"'I'll just have to find another way.'

1238
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,620
"'This is touching and human

1239
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,740
"'and also kind of a conflict of interest.'"

1240
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,500
The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense

1241
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,340
if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.

1242
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,580
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

1243
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,860
is more important than protecting the people they target.

1244
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,420
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

1245
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,900
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

1246
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

1247
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,640
and she's still homophobic.

1248
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,760
But even without Anita's blessing,

1249
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,160
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

1250
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,120
since the 1970s because gay activists

1251
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,760
didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

1252
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,360
They needed to defeat her and that's what they did.

1253
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,720
We have to accept that realistically,

1254
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,280
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

1255
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,600
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

1256
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,680
but there will always be bigots

1257
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,160
and mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

1258
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,960
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

1259
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,800
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

1260
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,040
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

1261
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,880
Nah.

1262
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,840
You would only think that

1263
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,160
if you're a total moral relativist.

1264
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,240
I guess controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful

1265
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,920
and it should be shamed.

1266
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,880
I'll say it.

1267
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,220
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas

1268
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,600
in your head, you might feel afraid

1269
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,160
to express them publicly for fear of being shamed or judged.

1270
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,400
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

1271
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,000
that punishes people for wrong think?

1272
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,480
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful

1273
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,240
and you should be ashamed of it

1274
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,640
and the people judging you are right to do so.

1275
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,400
And sure, there are some very patient people

1276
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,400
who devote their lives to de-radicalizing bigots,

1277
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,720
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

1278
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,400
There's a guy named Daryl Davis

1279
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

1280
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,800
for over 30 years and he claims he's convinced

1281
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,200
more than 200 of them to leave.

1282
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,540
And good for him.

1283
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,320
De-radicalization is a valid strategy,

1284
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,800
but it cannot be the only strategy

1285
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,960
and it must not be the primary strategy

1286
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,120
because we're not going to defeat racism

1287
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

1288
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,100
Feminists would be wasting their time

1289
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

1290
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,560
In general, I think that the massive effort

1291
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,360
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

1292
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,100
is better spent persuading other people

1293
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,540
not to listen to them.

1294
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,520
And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization

1295
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

1296
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Cytanovic

1297
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,440
became the face of the fascist unite the right rally in 2017

1298
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,920
when a photo of him mid-scream Tiki Torch in Hand

1299
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,980
was published in news outlets all over the country.

1300
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,300
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

1301
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,600
he gave immediately after the rally,

1302
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,960
but he began to question his beliefs

1303
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,600
after befriending a muscling woman who,

1304
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,940
according to Charlotte McDonald Gibson,

1305
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,720
challenged his views without insulting him,

1306
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,100
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

1307
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,380
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

1308
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,380
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

1309
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,100
every trace of bigotry.

1310
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,420
In a 2019 interview with the London School

1311
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,340
of Economics student paper, Peter said,

1312
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,380
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

1313
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,580
You're born either a man or a woman.

1314
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,460
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

1315
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,260
When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,

1316
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,180
I used to get some criticism from people of color

1317
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,340
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

1318
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,820
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

1319
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,300
a frustration that I totally understand.

1320
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,140
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

1321
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,900
diverse leftist communities are maybe not

1322
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,460
the best holding space for someone who's

1323
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,600
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

1324
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,780
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

1325
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,840
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

1326
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,620
but what she does have is a kind of hyper-vigilant

1327
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:03,220
skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.

1328
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,740
This is pretty common with people

1329
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,200
who used to be religious fundamentalists.

1330
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
They were so certain they were right,

1331
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,800
only to realize that everything they believed

1332
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,440
about the world is wrong.

1333
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,400
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

1334
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,520
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

1335
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,720
Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly

1336
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,640
that I was doing the right thing,

1337
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,440
and then to leave and come to believe

1338
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,620
that it was so destructive and harmful,

1339
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,800
I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months

1340
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,700
where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?

1341
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,100
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

1342
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,260
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

1343
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,260
can cause problems, especially where topics

1344
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
of social justice are concerned.

1345
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,600
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

1346
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,020
that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling

1347
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,820
to have calm, philosophical debates

1348
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,740
about whether they should have rights?

1349
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,980
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

1350
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,140
Atheist philosopher, Sam Harris,

1351
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,740
in his podcast about Meghan's podcast,

1352
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,100
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

1353
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,620
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

1354
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,800
until we can figure out what's going on.

1355
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,460
Sam Harris and his podcast about Meghan's podcast

1356
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,580
complained that trans activism and activism in general

1357
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,860
is plagued by a mental illness and hysteria.

1358
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,740
I frankly think there's a fair degree

1359
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,280
of mental instability and even frank mental illness

1360
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,660
in the activist community.

1361
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,900
I mean, in really in all activist communities,

1362
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,540
the level of viciousness and hysteria is,

1363
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,300
it's hard to know what to compare it to.

1364
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,180
Diversity when man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

1365
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

1366
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,840
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

1367
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,420
Aren't there certain situations

1368
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,600
where strong emotions are warranted?

1369
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,440
It reminds me of this awful episode

1370
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,940
of Joe Rogan feet Ben Shapiro,

1371
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,880
where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

1372
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,320
with his usual whining sophistry.

1373
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,580
And Joe gently raises objections

1374
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,680
for Ben to talk circles around.

1375
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,120
The human sex drive was made to procreate

1376
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,420
within a stable relationship in order to progenerate

1377
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,200
and have future generations of people.

1378
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,140
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

1379
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,640
whether you're talking about from masturbation

1380
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,420
to homosexual activity,

1381
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,920
is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.

1382
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,060
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

1383
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,580
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

1384
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,300
Imagine talking about different beliefs

1385
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,340
while still having a productive conversation.

1386
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,500
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

1387
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,020
The discussion here was excellent.

1388
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,740
Two guys with opposing opinions,

1389
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,380
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

1390
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,660
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

1391
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,260
This is how it should be done.

1392
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,420
Kudos to both of them.

1393
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,660
Joe is a great interviewer.

1394
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,120
He can totally disagree with someone

1395
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,500
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

1396
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,740
This is how it should be.

1397
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,220
Just two people sharing ideas,

1398
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,140
learning different point of views from each other.

1399
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,220
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

1400
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,580
Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions

1401
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,580
and Ben answers honestly, he is strong in his faith.

1402
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,420
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

1403
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,220
and they have a civil conversation.

1404
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,060
Great learning.

1405
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,820
Yeah, it's easy for two straight men

1406
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,100
to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation

1407
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,580
about the ethics of homosexuality

1408
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,420
because it's not their lives

1409
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,460
and their relationships that are up for debate.

1410
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,260
These people don't understand the emotional burden

1411
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,060
placed on marginalized people

1412
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,580
who are asked to defend their rights.

1413
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,780
Like if you're straight,

1414
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,380
do you want to publicly debate whether your marriage is valid?

1415
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,860
Andrew Dworkin claimed

1416
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,140
that penetrative heterosexual intercourse

1417
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,460
is inherently an act of violence.

1418
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,700
I've noticed that most straight men

1419
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,380
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.

1420
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,980
So imagine how they'd react

1421
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,460
if there was a powerful political movement

1422
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,380
to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.

1423
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:18,060
Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,

1424
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,100
bullying and discrimination,

1425
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,020
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

1426
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,820
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

1427
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,820
It is my right to raise my child

1428
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,060
with the moral precepts

1429
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,740
that I find to be beneficial for my child.

1430
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,940
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

1431
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,020
And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.

1432
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,940
That is insane.

1433
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,860
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

1434
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,300
because he can't handle the debate.

1435
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,380
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

1436
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,620
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

1437
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,340
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

1438
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,180
I now have two choices.

1439
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,300
One is to leave the country utterly.

1440
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,260
Two is to pick up a gun.

1441
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,940
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

1442
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,940
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative

1443
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,340
whose career requires that he convince his right-wing audience

1444
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,940
that he's one of the good ones.

1445
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,060
This means that he's willing to sit across

1446
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,900
from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,

1447
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,700
and listen to Ben say he would never attend

1448
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,220
his anniversary party

1449
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,380
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

1450
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,100
There's a difference between me

1451
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,460
just being friends with Dave

1452
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:26,260
and me actively participating in an event

1453
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,180
that I feel is religiously sinful.

1454
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,780
The two of them then congratulate themselves

1455
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,660
about how they can still be great friends.

1456
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,180
Why is it that we're able to do this

1457
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,620
and most people can't do this?

1458
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,460
That's what I'm curious about.

1459
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,740
We go home at night and we can have our own lives.

1460
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,220
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

1461
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,020
with conservative Glenn Beck

1462
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,900
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

1463
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,780
and then congratulates himself

1464
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,900
on having the conversation.

1465
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,740
I'm a deeply religious man

1466
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:58,140
and my religion says man and a woman,

1467
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,540
that is the basic building block of family.

1468
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,020
And that's what I believe,

1469
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:09,020
but I also know God created you

1470
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,380
just like he created me, flaws and all.

1471
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,820
I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,

1472
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,380
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

1473
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,660
because it runs in my family.

1474
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:26,820
So does craziness, but it runs in my family.

1475
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,940
Well, Dave smiles and nods

1476
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,700
probably because he's thinking about

1477
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,180
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

1478
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,940
Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis

1479
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,260
and then we're good because they get it, they get it.

1480
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,020
That's my governor, yeah.

1481
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,900
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

1482
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:50,260
and they see finally a reasonable gay person

1483
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:54,180
who doesn't scream, beg it, at everyone who disagrees

1484
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,100
and can actually have a civil conversation.

1485
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,620
But that's not what I see.

1486
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,020
I look at Dave Rubin

1487
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,180
and I see a spineless boot-looking doormat

1488
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,900
who won't even defend his own family

1489
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,740
from the most fundamental disrespect.

1490
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,560
I also can't help but notice

1491
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,340
that none of these civil conversations

1492
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,700
seem to change anyone's mind.

1493
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,060
Persuasion is more complicated

1494
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,580
and less rational than people think.

1495
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,300
Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,

1496
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,420
but if you read her book carefully,

1497
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,220
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

1498
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,940
The major precipitating event for Megan's crisis of faith

1499
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,900
was her mother's mistreatment

1500
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,500
at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic

1501
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,060
church leadership that made Megan feel

1502
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,860
like she was the victim of the church for once.

1503
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,020
She says of the church discipline,

1504
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,020
for the first time in my life,

1505
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,860
the accused were people I lived with

1506
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,460
and knew most intimately.

1507
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,180
And I knew that the judgments leveled

1508
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,780
by the elders were wrong.

1509
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,380
I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.

1510
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,060
So she finally experienced firsthand

1511
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,660
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

1512
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,620
She stopped voting for the leopards eating people's faces

1513
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,700
party only when the leopards ate her face.

1514
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,960
It also seems relevant to notice

1515
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,880
that the people who had calm civil conversations

1516
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,480
with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

1517
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,680
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

1518
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,600
They were mostly straight men,

1519
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,880
like director Kevin Smith,

1520
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,280
who started hashtag saveMegan

1521
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,720
because, quote, she's hot.

1522
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,160
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

1523
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,200
and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan,

1524
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,000
because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her

1525
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,760
is now her husband.

1526
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,960
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

1527
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,240
if we're trying to understand the role of reason

1528
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,700
and emotion in de-radicalization experiences.

1529
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,620
I think this experience is usually more akin

1530
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:58,600
to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.

1531
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,120
There's also a world of difference

1532
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,760
between the mostly private conversations

1533
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,720
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs

1534
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,680
and the spectacle of public debate.

1535
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,100
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

1536
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,760
because he live streamed a civil conversation

1537
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,040
with Dave Rubin.

1538
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,640
So who is this conversation even for?

1539
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,280
Well, obviously it's for the audience.

1540
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,520
I think these civil conversations basically function

1541
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,380
to reassure a homophobic audience

1542
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,480
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

1543
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,040
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

1544
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,480
Look at Ben Shapiro.

1545
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,240
He is friends with a gay.

1546
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,260
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

1547
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,840
of the Overton window,

1548
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,480
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

1549
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,860
So often people who want to promote bigotry

1550
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,120
will use debate as a foot in the door.

1551
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,920
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

1552
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,900
are within the realm of reasonable

1553
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,000
and socially accepted opinion.

1554
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,760
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot, Graham Linnehan,

1555
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,480
in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

1556
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,040
without the British public having a proper debate

1557
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,440
about these issues.

1558
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,720
Now, why do we need to have a proper debate

1559
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,560
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

1560
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,920
when drag performance has been a staple

1561
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,460
of British entertainment

1562
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,960
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

1563
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,040
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

1564
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,600
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, my, my, three little mates from school.

1565
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,240
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

1566
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,240
As I am man, my state is desperate for my master's love.

1567
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,960
As I am woman, now I last the day.

1568
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,160
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

1569
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,680
on their own terms

1570
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,880
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

1571
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,920
It's how they convince the public

1572
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,420
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

1573
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,820
is actually a valid concern

1574
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:05,940
rather than the tedious, small-minded whiny about nothing

1575
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,180
that it really is.

1576
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,980
Having the debate on a biggest terms

1577
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,580
is not a good way to win people over

1578
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,320
unless you're really skilled

1579
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,500
in the art of humiliating people,

1580
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,180
which most of the time is what public debate

1581
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,720
is actually about.

1582
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,380
This is something that J.K. Rowling

1583
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,260
doesn't seem to understand.

1584
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,420
In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,

1585
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,580
Jorro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

1586
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:34,620
She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos,

1587
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,220
saying that activists are making a strategic error

1588
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,100
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

1589
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,100
making him look dangerous and sexy.

1590
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,020
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

1591
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,980
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

1592
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,460
So is deplatforming a strategic error

1593
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,700
that gives power to your opponent?

1594
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,300
Or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

1595
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,740
I find Rowling's conviction

1596
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,020
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

1597
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,260
really out of touch.

1598
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,180
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons for the things he does.

1599
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,540
He has strategies for humiliating people.

1600
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,480
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

1601
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,540
being fabulous and doing my hair,

1602
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,900
to prepare a speech for you.

1603
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,340
Well, a few remarks, really.

1604
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,580
Feminism is cancer, thank you very much.

1605
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,580
To again quote Ian Danskin,

1606
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,740
you can't really reason with someone

1607
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,140
who thinks that feminism is cancer.

1608
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,860
Because you don't reason with cancer, you eradicate it.

1609
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,780
Rowling objects to the slogan,

1610
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,700
no debate in the strongest possible terms.

1611
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,820
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

1612
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,820
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

1613
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,580
We hear it all the time.

1614
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,380
That alarms me, really alarms me.

1615
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,740
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

1616
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:53,620
than no debate.

1617
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,860
It's kind of amazing to me that someone could think

1618
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,800
angry trans people on Twitter

1619
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,940
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

1620
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,120
I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough

1621
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,460
to be capable of such a perspective.

1622
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,860
Before I move on, I do wanna clarify

1623
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,740
that I do think there are trans issues

1624
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,540
that are legitimately debatable

1625
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,340
by people who are not bigots.

1626
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:19,000
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

1627
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,460
is one of those issues.

1628
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,900
But it's a complicated issue.

1629
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,780
First of all, which sport are we talking about?

1630
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,980
Are we talking about figure skating,

1631
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,980
middle school field hockey?

1632
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,960
I see no reason why trans girls

1633
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,660
should be excluded from that.

1634
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,220
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

1635
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,220
well, then it seems plausible that trans women

1636
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,100
who have been through male puberty

1637
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,460
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

1638
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,200
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

1639
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,240
People are transitioning younger now,

1640
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,600
and that's another thing you have to consider.

1641
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,520
So I'm not against debating this issue.

1642
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,560
I just want people to approach it

1643
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,520
with nuance and good faith.

1644
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,720
And currently, a lot of the people

1645
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,760
who are vocally against trans women and women's sports

1646
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,160
sound like this.

1647
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,840
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

1648
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,680
Right?

1649
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,560
How ridiculous.

1650
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,720
That will take place on day one.

1651
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,560
And I don't want to debate those people.

1652
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,280
I want to serve them a banana cream pie.

1653
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,680
Chapter six, illiberal methods.

1654
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,600
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints

1655
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,260
about the trans rights movement

1656
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,580
is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.

1657
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,720
So when I first became interested

1658
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,120
and then deeply troubled by what I saw

1659
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,600
as a cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.

1660
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,160
So what are these illiberal methods?

1661
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,840
If you are saying this person is canceled,

1662
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,080
that is the language of a dictator.

1663
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:56,960
It's true.

1664
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,320
Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.

1665
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,400
First, they canceled the socialists,

1666
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,200
and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.

1667
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,280
But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.

1668
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:29,000
You know, I can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods

1669
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,080
to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far.

1670
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:40,360
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

1671
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:45,880
I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless.

1672
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,080
Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement

1673
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,280
is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way

1674
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,440
that makes it different from all past liberation movements.

1675
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,520
But how?

1676
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
What are these illiberal methods

1677
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,280
that distinguish trans rights activism from similar past movements?

1678
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,400
Cancelling?

1679
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,440
Anita Bryant was way more canceled than J.K. Rowling ever will be.

1680
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,480
Boycotts?

1681
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,240
Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement in modern history.

1682
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,400
Disrupting feminist meetings?

1683
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,200
Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.

1684
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,200
Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?

1685
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,120
In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique

1686
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,520
and founder of the National Organization for Women

1687
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,600
and second wave feminism in general,

1688
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,640
coined the phrase Lavender Menace to describe the threat she believed

1689
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,240
that lesbians posed to the women's movement.

1690
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

1691
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,560
would make it easy to dismiss the movement as a bunch of manish man-haters.

1692
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,520
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

1693
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,240
who attended the second Congress to unite women in 1970

1694
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,880
to stage what used to be known as a zap,

1695
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,520
a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.

1696
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,640
Think glitter bombing.

1697
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,720
Think pies.

1698
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,520
Half aggression, half whimsy.

1699
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,080
Like that time the lesbian avengers zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house

1700
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,480
demanding that she resign.

1701
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,520
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

1702
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,080
Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.

1703
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,960
So just as the meeting was beginning,

1704
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,400
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

1705
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,320
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic

1706
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,200
and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.

1707
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,080
Their leader Rita Mae Brown took the mic and yelled,

1708
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,680
This conference won't proceed until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.

1709
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,840
One of the now organizers yelled back,

1710
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,840
I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

1711
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,520
You're acting like men.

1712
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,640
Betty Friedan would later speculate that the lesbians were a CIA sci-op

1713
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,120
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

1714
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,840
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting using illiberal tactics

1715
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,000
not because they were against feminism,

1716
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,040
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists to include them.

1717
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:58,200
It's the same thing that's happening today when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,

1718
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,960
as J.K. Rowling puts it,

1719
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,680
interestingly neglecting to mention which feminist meetings these are.

1720
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,800
I was starting to see activists behaving in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

1721
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,240
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging and kicking on windows,

1722
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,280
very threatening.

1723
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,480
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

1724
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,240
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive than similar past movements.

1725
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,800
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man called Dennis Noel Cavanaugh who says,

1726
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,000
All those gay rights and AIDS protests,

1727
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,280
I don't remember a single one where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

1728
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,560
Not a single one.

1729
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,720
Not a single one.

1730
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,400
Not a single one.

1731
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,320
Not a single one.

1732
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:50,440
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS to the trans movement.

1733
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,040
And also, uh, quote,

1734
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:58,600
I will fucking nail you to a wall what you have done to these innocent children.

1735
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,880
Your mutilation of these little humanned because they were gay

1736
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,320
will be nothing compared to what I will do to you legally.

1737
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,800
You think you are ghouls wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.

1738
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,800
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

1739
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:23,120
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people to a wall count as illiberal methods?

1740
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,720
I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so because she's never condemned it.

1741
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:31,520
In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended, she was right there to welcome him back.

1742
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,280
And she continues to retweet him.

1743
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:39,000
I've always been happy to acknowledge that angry trans people on Twitter sometimes take things too far.

1744
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,280
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults, I don't support that.

1745
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,960
And I've called it out in the past.

1746
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,680
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

1747
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,320
drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,

1748
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,760
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

1749
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,600
I called him out tweeting,

1750
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:05,560
Doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say about their being misogyny in trans activism.

1751
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,120
I tweeted that because I recognize that if people who are claiming to speak for you are doing so in a misogynistic way,

1752
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,440
and if you let that slide, you're going to wake up one day to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.

1753
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:25,080
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well, explaining that actually I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

1754
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,400
for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling.

1755
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,560
And then he accused me of cancel culturing him while at the same time literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

1756
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,040
The more of you were in the replies being like, that's not what's happening right here.

1757
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,200
Like, this is necessary, okay?

1758
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,800
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.

1759
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,280
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

1760
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,960
Move you off this site and into, I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

1761
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,600
So that pretty much confirms to me that Vosh doesn't actually care about advocating for trans people,

1762
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,360
and just uses trans rights as a pretext to act like a fucking dingus.

1763
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:07,160
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though, because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

1764
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:14,360
The point I'm trying to make is, I have no qualms about calling out people on my side whenever they go too far or cross a line.

1765
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,280
Or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me about how I don't understand a tactical misogyny.

1766
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:19,800
Idiot.

1767
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,200
But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.

1768
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:30,200
I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and abusiveness that is absolutely rampant in the gender-critical movement.

1769
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:42,400
There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists versus the abusive trans mob.

1770
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:51,000
A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.

1771
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,280
Things like, kill TERFs 2014.

1772
01:18:54,280 --> 01:19:00,160
How about slowly and horrendously murder TERFs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

1773
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:09,560
Now, I don't think anyone should joke about putting people in saw traps, but also, how serious is this threat that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

1774
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,800
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

1775
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:19,120
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies, has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?

1776
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

1777
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:26,960
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.

1778
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

1779
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:37,160
I can fill the screen up with examples just from people who J.K. Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.

1780
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:43,480
I will drive you out into the desert and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says, from a fan of J.K. Rowling.

1781
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:51,160
First, I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse, fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

1782
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:59,960
Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual, I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.

1783
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:06,160
But threats like this from the gender-critical side are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

1784
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:12,560
Both Rowling and Meghan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets and sound bites of shouting protesters.

1785
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,040
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.

1786
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,240
You look like you got your teeth knocked out and your fucking lashes.

1787
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,280
As evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.

1788
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:28,080
But this exact technique has been used against literally every liberation movement in world history.

1789
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:34,640
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night, the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

1790
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,760
which first got J.K. Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.

1791
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:45,880
Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note, covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

1792
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,600
Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,

1793
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,400
but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?

1794
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,400
We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,

1795
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:05,280
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear that my friend's brother

1796
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,280
was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.

1797
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,480
The protesters were allegedly singing,

1798
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:16,280
Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

1799
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,800
So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.

1800
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,200
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,

1801
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,680
Castrate men!

1802
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,840
Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?

1803
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,600
Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?

1804
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:36,000
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus, who shot Andy Warhol,

1805
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,080
who advocated for male extermination in her society for cutting up men manifesto,

1806
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,520
is representative of feminism as a whole?

1807
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,920
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

1808
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,160
But it's not fair, is it?

1809
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:55,160
So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

1810
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,360
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

1811
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,800
And I made excuses for you, then.

1812
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,880
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

1813
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,320
Meghan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,

1814
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,200
who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.

1815
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:15,600
There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation that I find fascinating.

1816
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:21,120
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say, you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.

1817
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:27,280
And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

1818
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,000
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

1819
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:39,440
And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus can be imposed,

1820
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,280
maybe as opposed to evolve organically.

1821
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:50,440
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

1822
01:22:50,440 --> 01:23:00,960
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection as other groups whose rights we've decided are not up for public conversation.

1823
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,480
I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.

1824
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:09,000
So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people are often reluctant to debate our rights

1825
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,200
is that we want the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.

1826
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:24,120
But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.

1827
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:30,200
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.

1828
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,320
Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?

1829
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:44,160
Did suffragettes just have calm civil conversations about whether women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?

1830
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:50,120
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote, sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

1831
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,360
Like, people forget this.

1832
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:57,360
Maybe because they were called suffragettes, which is kind of a cutesy name, but the suffragettes, they murdered people.

1833
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,240
They were suffragette terrorists.

1834
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,240
They broke windows.

1835
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,800
They bombed churches.

1836
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,760
They set fire to a theater.

1837
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,160
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.

1838
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,400
Queen shit, honestly.

1839
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,560
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet at the Prime Minister's head.

1840
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,480
And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.

1841
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,960
I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against the movement.

1842
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,400
I don't think it's effective.

1843
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,520
But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands before everyone was ready.

1844
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,960
Because there never has been, and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.

1845
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:39,520
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,

1846
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,560
and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

1847
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,200
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights, and there probably never will be.

1848
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:54,320
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.

1849
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:59,200
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.

1850
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,560
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone to give us rights,

1851
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,360
but the reality is, that's not how this works, and it never has been.

1852
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,280
Like, how do these debate-making centrists think that slavery ended in the United States?

1853
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:19,880
Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.

1854
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,400
See what I'm holding in my hand?

1855
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:26,640
This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.

1856
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:32,120
Do you people think that American schools were integrated because all the white people in the South were persuaded

1857
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,840
that segregation is bad?

1858
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,880
No dum-dums.

1859
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,240
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit at gunpoint.

1860
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,200
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements with Black civil rights.

1861
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:49,080
I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent to living in the aftermath of slavery.

1862
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,320
I'm just saying that there's this tendency to sanitize history,

1863
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:59,920
and to imagine that progress was smooth and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.

1864
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:07,320
And then people get the impression that current movements are somehow more militant than successful past movements, when they just aren't.

1865
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:13,560
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement,

1866
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,880
the cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.

1867
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:25,880
And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.

1868
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,320
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

1869
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,000
Chapter 7. Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

1870
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,600
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin, whom Stepp already mentioned a couple times in this video.

1871
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,560
I myself favor violence. Deeply. I favor it.

1872
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:47,640
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views, which I don't agree with.

1873
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:55,000
But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.

1874
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:03,880
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women, published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.

1875
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:11,840
Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.

1876
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:20,960
Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement, a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism, should read this book.

1877
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:29,920
In Dworkin's analysis, the political right makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women's deepest fears.

1878
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,240
No one can bear to live a meaningless life. Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.

1879
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,000
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

1880
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:48,800
The right offers women a simple, fixed, predetermined social, biological, and sexual order. Form conquers chaos. Form banishes confusion.

1881
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:54,480
The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

1882
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,920
A woman is an adult human female.

1883
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:05,400
Right Wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase into the motto of the gender-critical movement.

1884
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,720
Adult human female.

1885
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:14,160
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

1886
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:21,000
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition, it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

1887
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,520
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines, there can be no change.

1888
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:33,080
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos that gender-criticals fear.

1889
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,400
The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.

1890
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:43,680
Just biologically that God made mother so that we could reproduce. Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

1891
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:50,200
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

1892
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,440
Dworkin says,

1893
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:57,720
Within the frame of male domination, there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality, both male and female.

1894
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:03,200
Women are interchangeable as sex objects. Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

1895
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,200
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

1896
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:12,600
Having children is the one social contribution credited to women. It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

1897
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:19,520
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing. Homosexuality for women means having nothing, it means extinction.

1898
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:25,800
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

1899
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,360
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

1900
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:33,400
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

1901
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,440
The producer of the large gametes.

1902
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:42,760
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men is the loss of fertility.

1903
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:51,280
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility, attempts to socially legitimize or protect it, makes women expendable.

1904
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,560
The one thing women can do and be valued for will no longer be valued.

1905
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:03,880
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying because it suggests a world without women altogether, a world in which women are extinct.

1906
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:08,320
This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.

1907
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:16,320
Trans activists are erasing women. They're erasing biological sex. They're going to call us pregnant people.

1908
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:23,440
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility. Trans women are going to replace biological women.

1909
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:28,400
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men are aggressively replacing women.

1910
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,280
You will not replace us!

1911
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:36,360
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession and the results can be dazzling.

1912
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:44,800
In September 2022, Maya Forstader, who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist whom J.K. Rowling came out as a turf to defend,

1913
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:55,560
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced they were changing their children's storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear.

1914
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:06,160
If you don't know where this is going, strap in from the Bookstart Bear to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.

1915
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,280
Are you enraged?

1916
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,960
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

1917
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:21,840
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother who referred to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,

1918
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:27,080
describing the mascot as ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.

1919
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,840
I cannot express how upset I feel.

1920
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,400
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia, isn't trans, they are an alien.

1921
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,120
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

1922
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,720
Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?

1923
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,800
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

1924
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:55,200
There's an advantage in having a character that isn't identifiably male or female, as it can be equally relatable to either sex and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

1925
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,480
But Maya was not convinced.

1926
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:05,480
It seems highly unlikely that an alien that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan is not sexually reproducing.

1927
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:10,360
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character, not a slime mold.

1928
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:15,240
I need to know how the alien fucks right now.

1929
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:23,440
I said I need to know how the alien fucks before I can show it to my child.

1930
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:32,440
When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.

1931
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,520
And she posted hard.

1932
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,560
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.

1933
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,840
In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.

1934
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,640
You are in charge of a baby.

1935
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,280
You have never done this before.

1936
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,600
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months and won't for years.

1937
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,160
Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing right and wrong, and you've become invisible.

1938
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,600
You had politics.

1939
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,920
You had a career.

1940
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,480
You had interests.

1941
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,920
You had a sex life.

1942
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,960
Now you have the daily needs of a completely dependent person, and your world has shrunk.

1943
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:08,720
The fact that these men and the young women that cheer them on think this is so laughable

1944
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,560
reflects society's disdain for mothers.

1945
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:15,360
This is what it means to say a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

1946
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,240
This is why the hub of the resistance is on mom's net.

1947
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:22,240
So I am fascinated by this thread.

1948
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:26,160
I think it's one of the most revealing texts in gender-critical history.

1949
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:31,960
Because you know what, Maya Forstetter actually does have valid concerns.

1950
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,560
But the concerns she has that are valid have nothing to do with trans people.

1951
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,280
And they definitely have nothing to do with an adorable cartoon alien.

1952
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,360
Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.

1953
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,440
Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?

1954
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,920
I know she has one.

1955
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,480
Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?

1956
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,280
No one should have to feel this alone raising children.

1957
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,840
That is a valid concern.

1958
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,800
Oh my god, we actually found one.

1959
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,440
It's like finding El Dorado.

1960
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,160
A valid concern.

1961
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,160
A valid concern.

1962
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,920
Isn't what's going on here that Maya is taking legitimate feelings of being overburdened

1963
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,600
and underappreciated and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?

1964
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,760
This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits.

1965
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:22,360
By providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.

1966
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,120
It's not your husband's neglect.

1967
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:27,040
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

1968
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,280
It's not the indignities of aging.

1969
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:36,800
It's Tala, the non-binary alien with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.

1970
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,640
Mum's net is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.

1971
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,640
It's too much.

1972
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,640
These people are too much.

1973
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,760
Okay, we have to be serious now.

1974
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,000
The political right also promises women safety and security.

1975
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,800
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

1976
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:55,760
The right acknowledges the reality of danger, the validity of fear.

1977
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,080
The right then manipulates the fear.

1978
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,440
Women fear and resent male violence, which they're most likely to experience from the

1979
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:07,120
men closest to them, boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

1980
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,320
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

1981
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:15,040
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society means that women's legitimate fears

1982
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,840
and resentments often cannot be directed at the men with power.

1983
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,640
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage and contempt they feel for the men who

1984
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:29,600
actually abuse them, those close to them, and project it onto others.

1985
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,640
Those far away, foreign, or different.

1986
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:38,200
And this displacement of rage is just transparently what's going on with JK Rowling.

1987
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:44,640
In her essay about sex and gender issues, Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

1988
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,200
to be the son her father wanted.

1989
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,320
I really felt the rejection of my father.

1990
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:53,280
And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone going into homosexuality.

1991
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,720
And she describes the lingering trauma from her first violent marriage.

1992
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:01,540
The marriage at this point has turned very violent and very controlling.

1993
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:08,040
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out against the transgender movement.

1994
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,280
If you try to understand this rationally, it looks like a total non sequitur.

1995
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,520
But if you look at it emotionally, there's a kind of logic to it.

1996
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:22,160
The existence of the dangerous outsider always functions for women simultaneously as deception,

1997
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,920
diversion, painkiller, and threat.

1998
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,560
Women cling to irrational hatreds focused particularly on the unfamiliar, so that they

1999
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,640
will not murder their fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, lovers.

2000
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,440
The men with whom they are intimate, those who do hurt them.

2001
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:44,200
In the 1970s, many conservative women displaced this rage onto lesbians, the threatening outsider

2002
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,200
of the day.

2003
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:51,120
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977, where she spoke to a lot of women

2004
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,520
about their fear of lesbians.

2005
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:58,200
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,

2006
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,680
certified committers of sexual assault against women and girls.

2007
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:07,880
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous, experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

2008
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,120
hovering closer and closer.

2009
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:15,840
She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching, threatening by her very presence a sexual

2010
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,560
order that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.

2011
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:24,760
It's almost surreal to read this because of how precisely it describes how gender

2012
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,000
criticals talk about trans women.

2013
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,960
Pronouns are like Rohypnal.

2014
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,440
They dull your defenses.

2015
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,800
They change your inhibitions.

2016
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,200
They're meant to.

2017
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:39,680
Now it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism began as an offshoot of far-left

2018
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:47,200
lesbian separatism, with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979 that transsexualism

2019
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,720
should be morally mandated out of existence.

2020
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:55,640
But the gender critical movement was always destined to become a right-wing movement because

2021
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:01,320
it has the structure of a right-wing movement, taking women's fear and rage toward familiar

2022
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:05,560
men and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

2023
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:11,120
The momentum behind this is just to ripe an opportunity for conservatives to pass up.

2024
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,120
As Dworkin says,

2025
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:18,000
Because women so displaced their rage, they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

2026
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,280
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

2027
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:26,240
The right provides these symbols of danger by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

2028
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,960
as sources of danger.

2029
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:34,360
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone of conservative party platforms,

2030
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:39,240
both in the UK, where Lee Anderson, deputy chair of the conservative party, predicts

2031
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,240
that the next election will be won on

2032
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:44,560
Probably a mixture of culture wars and trans debates.

2033
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:51,960
And in the US, where the ACLU is currently tracking more than 450 anti-LGBT bills, including

2034
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:59,840
more than 130 gender-affirming care bans, 51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans, 29 trans

2035
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,200
bathroom bans, and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law, Republicans have escalated

2036
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:12,080
anti-trans rhetoric to eliminationist extremes that have most trans people in this country

2037
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:16,240
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

2038
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:20,400
Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.

2039
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:26,440
The Left is attacking our children, pushing sex talk, transgender extremism, and noxious

2040
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,440
politics in our schools.

2041
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:33,880
We should reject this demonic assault on the innocence of our children and stand fast against

2042
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,400
leftist efforts to mutilate their bodies and minds.

2043
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:43,760
Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.

2044
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:50,440
I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilization

2045
01:39:50,440 --> 01:40:01,160
of our youth, and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation

2046
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,040
in all 50 states.

2047
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:10,160
On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care.

2048
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,160
Ridiculous.

2049
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:17,120
I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs

2050
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:22,080
that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.

2051
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:28,520
A few gender criticals still want to insist they have nothing to do with right-wing anti-trans

2052
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,520
bigots.

2053
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,520
Like Helen Lewis.

2054
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:35,200
Helen Turf is basically witch who attempts in her interview in the witch trials of J.K.

2055
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:40,400
Rowling to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right and that of feminists.

2056
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,800
I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand is that there are two different

2057
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,320
arguments going on.

2058
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:50,120
One is the traditional conservative right argument, which is anti-LGBT.

2059
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:56,240
The other one is a criticism from the Left in which it says sometimes male people and

2060
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,840
female people have different interests, no matter how the male people identify.

2061
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,640
But as a trans person, I don't care whether you justify your transphobia in the name of

2062
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,840
protecting women or protecting children.

2063
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:13,880
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond calling for transsexualism to be morally mandated

2064
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:19,240
out of existence, or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles calling for transgenderism

2065
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,080
to be eradicated from public life, it's the same repulsive bigotry to me.

2066
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:29,840
And in any case, the gender-critical movement has recently reached an implicit consensus

2067
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,880
that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.

2068
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:39,240
The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker aka Kelly J. Keene Minchel, rejects feminism

2069
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:40,240
entirely.

2070
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,080
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

2071
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,080
No.

2072
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,080
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

2073
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,080
I probably did for a short time.

2074
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,640
But so you wouldn't be so like a Julie Bindle type feminist?

2075
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:54,040
No, well some feminists, I mean Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers in the past and

2076
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,800
I think that's a theme flowing through feminism.

2077
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
I'm not a feminist!

2078
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,040
I'm not a feminist!

2079
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,480
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

2080
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,320
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

2081
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,800
Parker's campaign is currently funded by the right-wing CPAC.

2082
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:13,080
CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events and cover all of our insurance

2083
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,640
throughout our whole trip, which is really kind of them.

2084
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:21,640
But what we would need to do is we would need to show that we were working for them, working

2085
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,000
with them.

2086
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,880
She has no qualms about collaborating with far-right white nationalists.

2087
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,480
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

2088
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,000
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

2089
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,800
She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.

2090
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,880
She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.

2091
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:48,200
Why are we enabling children to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful or access

2092
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,360
to abortion?

2093
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:54,520
I think that we really need to rethink all of this.

2094
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:57,400
I think parents need to take back control of their children.

2095
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:01,000
She's called trans people fools and perverts.

2096
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,520
Transgenderism is nuts.

2097
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,720
It's for fools and perverts.

2098
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:09,160
She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.

2099
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,600
It's not a real thing.

2100
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,960
There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.

2101
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,400
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

2102
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,560
There's no such thing as a trans person.

2103
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,560
There is no such thing.

2104
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:23,400
There are people that call themselves these things that may have other issues manifesting

2105
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,720
that then make them think they're this, but no.

2106
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,520
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

2107
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,120
There may be more words that we have to say in order to say that.

2108
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:36,880
We may call it transgender ideology, but when it comes to a person, they may be following

2109
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,760
transgender ideology, but they are not transgender.

2110
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,880
There is no such thing as a man or a woman being anything other than a man or a woman.

2111
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,280
She's called trans women pedophiles.

2112
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:54,040
We know that if a man has a paraphilia addressing as a woman, the most likely cross paraphilia

2113
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,080
is pedophilia.

2114
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,880
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

2115
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,680
They don't ever stop at one.

2116
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:06,840
She's said that each and every woman who stands in her way will be annihilated.

2117
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:12,080
Each and every one of you women who stand in my way, each and every one of you, let me

2118
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,760
just tell you, you will be annihilated.

2119
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:20,120
She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms to attack anyone they perceive as

2120
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,760
not a real woman.

2121
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,880
And men, for once, I'm talking to you.

2122
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:33,480
I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry, I think that's what you say.

2123
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,880
I'm so down with the American lingo.

2124
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,400
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

2125
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,200
Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.

2126
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,640
Maybe you're that sort of man.

2127
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:47,400
Maybe you have a daughter or a mother or a wife.

2128
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,400
Maybe you have a sister.

2129
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,480
Maybe you just have some friends.

2130
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:55,360
Maybe you just think women are human and you don't need any absolute connection with them

2131
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:00,280
to feel compelled to protect us.

2132
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,720
I think you should start using women's toilets, men.

2133
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,600
And she's said that women who call themselves men should be sterilized, which seems to be

2134
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:15,440
a little bit in tension with JK Rowling's concern about the fertility of confused girls.

2135
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,000
You know, you might look at these differences of opinion between Rowling and Parker.

2136
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:28,280
Little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist, left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion.

2137
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:34,320
Concern about trans men's fertility versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men

2138
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:41,400
against annihilating women who stand in your way versus pro-annihilating each and every

2139
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,920
woman who stands in your way.

2140
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,320
You might look at these differences and expect that these two women would be at odds, but

2141
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,320
they aren't.

2142
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:55,040
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause that for both of them trumps

2143
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,040
all else.

2144
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:02,400
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster reading I Heart JK Rowling to be displayed at a railway

2145
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:08,120
station in Edinburgh, and Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times and has

2146
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:10,120
modeled her t-shirts.

2147
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:16,760
So the gender-critical movement, started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s, has finally

2148
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:23,320
passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns, as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bendel memorably

2149
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,640
described them.

2150
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:29,920
It's a movement that has no beliefs apart from a shared determination to reduce the

2151
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,600
number of trans people.

2152
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,720
In the numbers we're currently seeing, particularly of young people coming forward, I find cause

2153
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,720
for doubt.

2154
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:41,840
In the meantime, while we're trying to get through to the decision-makers, we have to

2155
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,000
try to limit the harm.

2156
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,920
And that means reducing or keeping down the number of people who transition.

2157
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,160
And that's for two reasons.

2158
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,240
One of them is that every one of those people is a person who's been damaged.

2159
01:46:54,240 --> 01:47:01,200
But the second one is every one of those people is basically, you know, a huge problem to

2160
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,400
a sane world.

2161
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,840
Like if you've got people that, whether they're transitioned, whether they're happily transitioned,

2162
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,480
whether they're unhappily transitioned, whether they've detransitioned, if you've got people

2163
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,960
who've dissociated from their sex in some way, every one of those people is someone

2164
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:19,400
who needs special accommodation in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of

2165
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,400
sex.

2166
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:26,480
So to wrap this up, is the backlash against JK Rowling a witch hunt?

2167
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:30,360
Unequivocally, no, it's very thoroughly deserved.

2168
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:34,560
But I will say this, a movement can't get along without a devil.

2169
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:40,880
And across the whole political spectrum, there is a misogynistic tendency to choose a female

2170
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:47,920
devil, whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton, Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

2171
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,440
or JK Rowling.

2172
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:54,520
And there's always going to be people who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.

2173
01:47:54,520 --> 01:48:01,120
So I would advise trans people and our allies to keep in mind that JK Rowling is not the

2174
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:05,200
final boss of transphobia, she's not our devil.

2175
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,960
The devil is the Republican party, the conservative party.

2176
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:14,640
The devil is patriarchy, it's the right-wing men who will be the ones to put gender-critical

2177
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,160
theory into brutal practice.

2178
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:24,480
Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and JK Rowling are, to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.

2179
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,280
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

2180
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:31,600
They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face on the patriarchal violence against

2181
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,840
trans people that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.

2182
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:42,160
I call on men to consider themselves dear to human beings, to call out the demons among

2183
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:46,840
them and eradicate these monsters from society.

2184
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:53,040
And Megan Phillips Roper and centrist Slaker are wrong that civil conversation can resolve

2185
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,040
this.

2186
01:48:54,040 --> 01:49:00,640
Call out the demons among them and eradicate these monsters from society.

2187
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:06,560
People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.

2188
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,680
They have to be defeated.

2189
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:14,200
As for what to do about JK Rowling, honestly, let's all just block her.

2190
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:18,440
Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile, and just block her.

2191
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,440
Problem solved.

2192
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,560
Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.

2193
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:24,160
But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.

2194
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:27,080
She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.

2195
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:31,160
The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave, for the same reasons that it's hard

2196
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,840
to quit a culture scam.

2197
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,240
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

2198
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:39,960
One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam is that the victims who invested the

2199
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:45,800
most are often the most passionate defenders because shame is a powerful force in the human

2200
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:49,520
psyche and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.

2201
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,040
Reformed bigots have to face not only the shame of being dupes, but also the guilt

2202
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:57,800
of having devoted years of life to harming vulnerable people.

2203
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,840
This is something Megan, to her credit, faced head on.

2204
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:06,720
If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life industriously sowing doom, discord,

2205
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:11,680
and rage to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.

2206
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:16,080
I had wasted my life only to fill others with pain and misery.

2207
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:20,000
Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.

2208
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,560
It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linahan, whose all-consuming hatred of trans people

2209
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,520
has ruined his life, caused him his marriage, and left him alone to tweet about destroying

2210
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:35,000
gender ideology minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled

2211
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:39,880
to insist with ever more certainty that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,

2212
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:45,560
but are all demonic perverts, an enemy so hyperbolically evil that they justify his

2213
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,320
self-immolating crusade.

2214
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:19,920
As long as he stays here, in the bottom of the

2215
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:24,520
whirlpool, he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships and wasted years

2216
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,640
of life because he just couldn't let it go.

2217
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,640
And if J.K.

2218
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,680
Rowling doesn't log off soon, this will likely be her fate as well.

2219
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:38,280
I guess what I'm really trying to say is, Harry Potter is dead to me.

2220
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,280
I'm switching to Twilight.

2221
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:08,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2222
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2223
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2224
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2225
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2226
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2227
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2228
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,280
Harry Potter is dead to me.

2229
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,280
