00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

00:07.600 --> 00:09.400
yourself questions.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.360
Why is the world bad?

00:11.360 --> 00:13.520
What did all these people die for?

00:13.520 --> 00:16.680
Well, for freedom, I guess.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.080
And like, American values?

00:19.080 --> 00:21.280
But what are those values?

00:21.280 --> 00:24.920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

00:24.920 --> 00:29.960
The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

00:30.080 --> 00:35.600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want, but

00:35.600 --> 00:40.120
they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels anyway.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
Ahhh.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.400
Fucking neoliberalism.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.800
What even goes on in these big buildings?

00:49.800 --> 00:53.400
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.680
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.680
Drinking human blood?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.800
Licking whipped cream off the interns?

01:03.640 --> 01:05.400
What the hell even is this country?

01:05.400 --> 01:11.320
Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place, Longhorn Steakhouse,

01:11.320 --> 01:17.800
Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, Petsmart, Chipotle, Fridays, Dave and Busters.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.160
I guess it's not so bad.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.600
As long as you kick things up a notch.

01:22.600 --> 01:30.200
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.640
Of course, I want the fucking lava cakes.

01:32.640 --> 01:39.560
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.

01:39.560 --> 01:47.760
Oh, goddamn it, it was so good, but I ate so much, I think I'm gonna die.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.560
It's a good capitalism, maybe you do.

01:50.560 --> 01:58.560
A vast part of territory all across the Middle East.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.640
Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot

02:02.640 --> 02:04.160
of people have that feeling.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.880
But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.240
The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.440
There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that

02:16.440 --> 02:21.760
sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that

02:21.760 --> 02:25.560
they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.680
The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes

02:30.680 --> 02:34.960
from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become

02:34.960 --> 02:39.680
adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous

02:39.680 --> 02:44.320
jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist world

02:44.320 --> 02:47.320
of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.

02:47.320 --> 02:54.120
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

02:54.120 --> 03:00.120
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
homeland.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.760
But till now, I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

03:04.760 --> 03:09.920
do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

03:09.920 --> 03:14.240
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.720
And so the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.360
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

03:23.360 --> 03:24.360
cocks.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.000
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid IKEA consumers, capitalism did.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.800
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and

03:33.800 --> 03:39.280
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking, goddamn,

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
reptiles.

03:44.240 --> 03:50.800
Chapter 1.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.800
Capitalism and Spirit.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.120
Oh god, I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.800
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

03:59.800 --> 04:03.160
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.420
A leftist could easily have said that.

04:05.420 --> 04:09.600
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
to it too.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.040
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human

04:14.040 --> 04:18.280
soul under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer

04:18.280 --> 04:22.560
who appropriates the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment

04:22.560 --> 04:27.040
of inanimate objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of

04:27.040 --> 04:32.160
lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast

04:32.160 --> 04:35.160
increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.240
No, I don't want a landline.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.160
No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.000
Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives

04:44.000 --> 04:49.280
notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meeting in ancient customs,

04:49.280 --> 04:51.360
racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.920
And that shit's not really my scene.

04:52.920 --> 04:57.980
I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism

04:57.980 --> 05:01.800
as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.200
And here's why.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
Chapter 2.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.200
Alienated labor.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.120
Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.960
Let's come up with something new.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.040
Chapter 2.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
Shitty jobs.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.080
Why is your job so shitty?

05:13.160 --> 05:17.160
Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center and

05:17.160 --> 05:20.800
you spend your day dealing with whiny and titled white bitches who don't understand

05:20.800 --> 05:23.120
that you're just a lackey without any actual power.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.840
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

05:26.840 --> 05:27.840
at each other.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.360
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

05:31.360 --> 05:35.120
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
a gear.

05:36.120 --> 05:41.280
The CEO makes $36 million a year while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of

05:41.320 --> 05:45.240
the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the

05:45.240 --> 05:48.240
chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.040
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

05:52.040 --> 05:55.920
your fellow employees for a promotion or even to not be laid off.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.800
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

05:59.800 --> 06:06.840
shitty job as a concrete lifter or a mud mule or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook person.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.560
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

06:10.560 --> 06:15.320
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.560
And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate

06:20.560 --> 06:26.280
in team building exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not

06:26.280 --> 06:30.080
only do you have a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure

06:30.080 --> 06:31.680
of openly hating your life.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.560
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

06:35.560 --> 06:38.960
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.760
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.640
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

06:46.640 --> 06:52.040
They'll call you an independent contractor.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.640
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.000
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

06:59.000 --> 07:04.480
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

07:04.480 --> 07:05.920
paid leave, or pension.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.160
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

07:09.160 --> 07:13.080
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.840
Chapter 3, advertising.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.120
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

07:18.120 --> 07:21.000
What if each section is named after an episode in The Odyssey?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.760
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

07:24.760 --> 07:31.280
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,

07:31.280 --> 07:33.480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.320
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

07:37.320 --> 07:39.080
a basic feature of the human condition.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.480
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

07:43.480 --> 07:44.480
life under capitalism.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.920
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

07:48.920 --> 07:50.840
up with advertisements for…

07:50.840 --> 07:52.200
Oh.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.200
So many fans.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.640
Contrapoints is a tanky confirmed, a neoliberal tanky.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.400
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

08:02.400 --> 08:05.080
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

08:05.080 --> 08:09.240
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

08:09.240 --> 08:14.200
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

08:14.200 --> 08:17.640
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

08:17.640 --> 08:22.600
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational, for instance,

08:22.600 --> 08:26.560
randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities the product

08:26.560 --> 08:30.880
promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating the product

08:30.880 --> 08:34.840
with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating

08:34.840 --> 08:39.560
the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,

08:39.560 --> 08:45.000
gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely

08:45.000 --> 08:50.040
original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.400
Is this rational?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.760
Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?

08:54.760 --> 08:55.760
Of course not!

08:55.760 --> 08:59.880
The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's

08:59.880 --> 09:02.080
to endlessly create new needs.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.720
And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a lot of stamina, which is why it's a good

09:05.720 --> 09:07.720
thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.

09:07.720 --> 09:13.760
Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories

09:13.760 --> 09:15.960
for a sustainable blast in power.

09:15.960 --> 09:21.360
With all natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria

09:21.360 --> 09:25.720
and indifference to pain that I need to get it in.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.640
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammos, then I take

09:30.640 --> 09:35.400
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.600
Vitalimax, for bottoms!

09:38.600 --> 09:42.880
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires, which they implant in your

09:42.880 --> 09:44.720
brain through advertising.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.920
Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective

09:48.920 --> 09:53.400
of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.000
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

09:58.000 --> 10:02.680
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to

10:02.680 --> 10:04.200
want and then sell it to you.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.000
And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially

10:08.000 --> 10:11.280
egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.520
On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,

10:15.520 --> 10:20.040
spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more

10:20.040 --> 10:24.080
than half a million homeless people and 13 million children who have to go to school

10:24.080 --> 10:25.080
hungry.

10:25.080 --> 10:29.960
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet

10:29.960 --> 10:35.000
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes and there are apparently Americans who are

10:35.000 --> 10:38.240
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.560
I mean, it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really

10:42.560 --> 10:46.880
worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.680
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:49.680 --> 10:53.060
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe.

10:53.060 --> 10:56.280
But shouldn't the economy serve humanity rather than the other way around?

10:56.280 --> 11:00.360
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

11:00.360 --> 11:05.480
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?

11:05.480 --> 11:13.480
No cost to the planet, great! Save our lover, too!

11:13.480 --> 11:15.440
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

11:15.440 --> 11:17.560
Canto IV, message to the rich.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.880
Alright, you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up!

11:20.880 --> 11:24.920
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.440
I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little

11:28.440 --> 11:31.920
significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people

11:31.920 --> 11:36.480
are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.720
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here, recent polling data shows that a majority

11:40.720 --> 11:46.320
of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.040
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of

11:50.040 --> 11:53.920
the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.200
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.720
You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this when

12:01.720 --> 12:04.400
there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.760
They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.200
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix some

12:10.200 --> 12:13.920
shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.520
I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

12:17.520 --> 12:22.000
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole

12:22.000 --> 12:26.640
thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.840
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.960
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going, something is gonna have to change,

12:34.960 --> 12:37.840
and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.240
The choice is up to you.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.920
Well, are you going to answer the phone?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
There is no phone.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.920
There is only the side of the oppressed creature.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.920
The heart of a heartless world.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.920
The soul of a soulless condition.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.920
It's best to just try and ignore it.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.920
Episode 5, Message to the Youth

13:09.920 --> 13:11.920
Alright kids, so you're angry.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
Well, good.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
The world sucks.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
There's a lot to be angry about.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.920
What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.920
I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.920
So, what do we do?

13:23.920 --> 13:24.920
Smash?

13:24.920 --> 13:26.920
Tabby, get in here.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.920
Sit down.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.920
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
Harsh words have been exchanged.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.920
But I need young radicals like you in my life.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.920
The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.920
So I apologize.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.920
I never meant to hurt you.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.920
Baby, I'm sorry.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.920
I mean, look, I get it.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.920
Smashing is fun.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
But we also need to have a real plan.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
That's all I'm saying.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.920
So what's the plan?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.920
Revolution.

13:52.920 --> 13:53.920
Okay.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.920
Yeah, revolution.

13:54.920 --> 13:55.920
I mean, you're right.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.920
Donald Trump is president.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.920
Fuck it.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
Revolution.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.920
We've gotta get better people in office.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.920
We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
No, revolution.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
Yes, I know revolution.

14:06.920 --> 14:07.920
But what kind of revolution?

14:07.920 --> 14:12.920
Like, project mayhem, gather your muskets ye militia men and water the tree of liberty what?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.920
No, I mean direct action.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.920
Okay, so like a general strike?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.920
No, end capitalism.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.920
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here because I really don't.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.920
But I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
than just saying the word revolution.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.920
Like, I'm in support of radical movements.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.920
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.920
I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
they shift the Overton window to the left,

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
and they can have a big cultural impact.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
But none of them so far has ended capitalism.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.920
And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.920
And we can change the state through electoral politics.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
So why not direct some serious energy toward that?

14:55.920 --> 14:58.920
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China,

14:58.920 --> 15:02.920
but no elected politician has ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.920
So why do you think that will work?

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,

15:08.920 --> 15:12.920
finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.920
Well, you're not entirely wrong.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.920
But on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were not exactly super great.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.920
And in any case, I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army

15:23.920 --> 15:26.920
marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion

15:28.920 --> 15:31.920
and getting affordable healthcare and education

15:31.920 --> 15:34.920
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?

15:34.920 --> 15:36.920
What if the 2020 election is postponed?

15:36.920 --> 15:39.920
Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.920
Why not just be honest about your political stance?

15:42.920 --> 15:45.920
Are you a democratic socialist or would you actually support a revolution?

15:45.920 --> 15:49.920
Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
Now, for you, counterpoints.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.920
I mean, you're still a heretic in an enemy of the Imperium

15:54.920 --> 15:57.920
and you are a demonetto slaanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
Well, what exactly are your positions?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.920
Um, well...

16:04.920 --> 16:06.920
Kill everyone now!

16:06.920 --> 16:08.920
Condone first-degree murder!

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
Advocate cannibalism!

16:10.920 --> 16:11.920
Eat shit!

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
Filth are my politics?

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
Eat reptiles?

16:15.920 --> 16:18.920
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring

16:20.920 --> 16:23.920
and it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.920
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.920
Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.920
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
Have you been the same beset of Horkheimer?

16:33.920 --> 16:34.920
Have you read Horkheimer?

16:34.920 --> 16:35.920
Yes.

16:35.920 --> 16:36.920
Have you read Kropotkin?

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
Yes.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
Have you read Bakunin?

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
No.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.920
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
Have you read Plekhanov?

16:45.920 --> 16:46.920
Have you read Goldman?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.920
Have you read Zetkin?

16:48.920 --> 16:50.920
Have you read Gramsci?

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
Have you read Grindelwald?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?

16:53.920 --> 16:55.920
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.920
Have you read Slutskinarevsky?

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
Tabby!

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
I have half a PhD in reading tedious Blowhards

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.920
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish

17:05.920 --> 17:07.920
is a prerequisite for talking to you,

17:07.920 --> 17:10.920
then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
I think I'm just gonna go.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
This isn't really working out.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.920
Wait, Tabby.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.920
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

17:19.920 --> 17:27.920
If you ever change your mind

17:27.920 --> 17:32.920
about leaving, leaving me behind

17:32.920 --> 17:34.920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.920
Bring your sweet loving.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
Bring it on on to me.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.920
Yeah, yeah.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.920
I know I laugh when you left

17:48.920 --> 17:53.920
but now I only, I only hurt myself.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.920
Bring your sweet love.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.920
Bring it on on to me.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.920
I'll bring you jewelry and money too

18:09.920 --> 18:14.920
but that ain't only all I do for you.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.920
Bring your sweet love.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.920
Bring it on on to me.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.920
I know I'll always be your slave

18:31.920 --> 18:36.920
until I'm buried, buried in my grave.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.920
Tabby, bring it to me.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.920
Bring your sweet love.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.920
Bring it on on to me.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:47.920 --> 18:52.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
Bring it on home, catgirl.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.920
Unsubscribed.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.920
It's fucking 2018, man.
