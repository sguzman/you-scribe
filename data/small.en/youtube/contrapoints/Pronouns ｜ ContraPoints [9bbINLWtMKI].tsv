0	7000	Dass. Dass, dass, dass, dass. It's the only thing everyone fears.
30000	33000	And the only thing that gets me off.
33000	42000	Hello, my devilish darlings. I am Lenora Lavey, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.
42000	46000	Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.
46000	54000	The story is rather simple, really. The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and zem.
54000	63000	And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable health care, and video games for lesbians.
63000	66000	Ahahahahaha!
66000	73000	But there's one man who stands in the way. The villain of tonight's thriller. A meddling little cipher of a man.
73000	79000	A man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order to chaos.
79000	81000	Ugh! Can you imagine?
81000	88000	His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings. Ugh!
88000	96000	Can our heroine put a stop to this? Well, I'm just the executioner. You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.
111000	124000	Ugh!
124000	127000	Hi, girls. It's me, Ms. Points.
127000	129000	Mademoiselle, poi.
129000	132000	Words, words, words. What do they even fucking mean?
132000	140000	Well, I don't know, and I don't care. But we have to talk about it anyway, because of a boy named Ben Shapiro. So who is Ben Shapiro?
141000	158000	Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of The Daily Wire, and the auteur behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.
158000	168000	Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.
169000	172000	I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner, is she?
172000	177000	Surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.
177000	180000	And let's be civil, right? That's the tone of the day.
180000	181000	I'm a fan.
181000	187000	But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on his edgier mantra,
187000	188000	Facts don't care about your feelings?
188000	195000	And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben. It's true. Facts don't care about my feelings.
195000	201000	I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition, this makes me feel invalidated.
201000	206000	Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad are true.
206000	212000	It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling apps, but too fucking bad for me,
212000	217000	because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk at forever.
217000	220000	Mmm, I was a yum-yum, though. Build me a time machine, doc.
221000	228000	We call this autoandrophilia, nurse. What can I say? I like younger men. I'm a cougar in tiger's clothing.
228000	235000	So look, I want to be treated like an adult. I don't want to be indulged. If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.
235000	241000	I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to tell myself to make it through the night.
241000	248000	It's probably just dry down there. They're just ingrown hairs. I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.
248000	255000	I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other, of course, false and heathen religions.
255000	260000	I am an evangelical transsexual. I don't want toleration, dammit. I want converts.
260000	267000	Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment to talk about my womanhood? Sure. Go ahead. Touch it.
267000	269000	So look, Shapiro. Benny. Baby.
269000	278000	I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales to melt away every crystal of my snow flakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding tea.
278000	286000	All right, big boy. Let's have it. I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she because you can't change your sex.
286000	293000	You can change your name. Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man. And if he were born with a high dose of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.
293000	295000	Right. You're determined by your chromosomes.
295000	302000	So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype that is XX sex chromosomes.
302000	309000	And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she. And to call you she would be tantamount to a lie.
309000	318000	And I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender like woman be called she or something because it is a lie.
318000	332000	So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie and you think that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans woman she, we're saying that she has a normal female karyotype.
332000	344000	But hold on. I am a transgender woman and I have never claimed to have a normal female karyotype. And yet my friends, lovers and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend, ladies.
344000	352000	Good girl. Good girl. Just like that. Don't stop. Don't stop. Are all of us deluded about my biology? No.
352000	357000	It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro. It is you who misunderstands language.
357000	364000	You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not. We all agree on the biology.
364000	370000	The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man and woman.
370000	378000	But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word? Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.
378000	387000	If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists and study the way a word, for instance, she, is used by a linguistic community.
387000	390000	And whatever the social convention is, is what's correct.
390000	402000	But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority, such as the dictionary, or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,
402000	408000	or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.
408000	414000	Now, if we take the descriptive approach, you lose Ben Shapiro because most people call me she, and that's all there is to it.
414000	423000	Once more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical. You don't put an article before a pronoun. That's not how pronouns work, you silly dumb-dumb.
423000	435000	Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and she originate in the protodramatic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe beginning around 500 BCE.
435000	446000	Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.
446000	454000	However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions, so let's try out a prescriptive approach.
454000	460000	Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word should be used?
461000	467000	Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated by political goals.
467000	484000	Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
484000	488000	It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.
488000	498000	Opponents argue the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed because it's the definition.
498000	501000	And how am I supposed to explain to my child?
501000	509000	And on the other hand, gay people argue that the definition should be changed because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
509000	514000	And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of words.
515000	520000	The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible, and for that matter you can change the Bible.
520000	525000	I mean, have you read the contemporary English version? The prose is atrocious, appalling.
525000	526000	I won't stand for this.
526000	532000	But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more than just a political and legal dispute.
532000	539000	It seems to me that whatever church, state, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are and will continue to be women.
539000	545000	And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival Blaire White.
545000	549000	Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whom stays bad.
549000	557000	The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used to designate so-called biological men and biological women.
557000	562000	Blaire responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely impractical.
563000	570000	Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt,
570000	578000	and you had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blaire, and they said okay, and you had to describe me to take me to the table,
578000	582000	you wouldn't say the man in the orange shirt, you would say Blaire, you would say her over there.
582000	583000	Ben then responds, saying,
583000	588000	I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that there is a utility to the use of pronouns,
588000	593000	but that's not quite the same as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.
593000	597000	And Blaire responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.
597000	602000	For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them that kid's parents,
602000	606000	because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link at all biologically,
606000	609000	but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.
609000	611000	Let's expand on that analogy.
611000	618000	Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.
618000	624000	As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings forth offspring.
624000	629000	You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.
629000	631000	Facts don't care about your feelings.
631000	636000	No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.
636000	644000	I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.
644000	648000	But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.
648000	654000	Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological parent,
654000	658000	and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.
658000	660000	So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?
660000	664000	I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?
664000	669000	You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents, but we do say adoptive parents.
669000	676000	Right. Adoptive parents, an entirely valid type of parent. To call them parents is not a lie.
676000	681000	And then the question becomes, okay, exactly is the context that you were suggesting matters.
681000	685000	In what context are we talking about the parents? Are we talking about a PTA meeting?
685000	690000	Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has two aspects, right?
690000	693000	There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.
694000	699000	So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and adoptive parents.
699000	706000	For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.
706000	710000	But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.
710000	716000	In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological role of woman, which you are not,
716000	722000	and then there is the, you look like a woman, which is, I'm going to describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.
722000	730000	But when Ben seems in the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.
730000	736000	From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind of ugly, you know what I mean?
736000	741000	There was the, I think, I think the person's name was Zoey Turr. There was the threat of physical violence.
741000	742000	What are your genetics?
742000	745000	You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.
745000	750000	Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that I'm saying to you right now
750000	753000	is exactly what I said to Zoey Turr on the air.
753000	755000	But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?
755000	760000	Zoey threatened you after you called her Sir, and you didn't call Blair Sir, did you?
760000	762000	Why did you call Zoey Sir?
762000	768000	What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?
768000	770000	I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.
770000	774000	I suppose Sir is a strictly biological term.
775000	786000	And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other, or tweeting out F.U., that's not a great way to change my mind.
786000	788000	It turns out that's not particularly convincing.
788000	791000	So what is a great way to change your mind? Ben Shapiro?
791000	797000	Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?
797000	799000	It doesn't seem like she did.
799000	803000	At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.
803000	807000	I'm the editor of a pre-major site, and my basic rule is that when we're discussing people who are trans,
807000	811000	we immediately say in the first paragraph, trans woman, and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,
811000	813000	because biology is the nature of the pronoun.
813000	816000	Biology is the nature of the pronouns?
816000	820000	Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?
820000	822000	Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.
822000	828000	There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and biological parents.
829000	835000	Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between transgender and cisgender,
835000	838000	or as you say, biological women.
838000	843000	For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive health care you think should be illegal.
843000	845000	But does this apply to pronouns?
845000	849000	That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes,
849000	853000	or are they part of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?
853000	855000	The answer is obvious.
855000	858000	There are no geneticists studying pronouns.
858000	864000	In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between ahi and ashi.
864000	867000	There is no such thing as biological pronouns.
867000	872000	This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.
872000	876000	So, as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.
876000	881000	She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy,
881000	884000	which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.
884000	886000	Fascinating, though it is.
886000	890000	And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child,
890000	893000	to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.
893000	896000	It is, in effect, false.
896000	901000	But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still not.
901000	903000	What's the harm, right?
903000	906000	If I teach my almost four-year-old girl that she can become a boy,
906000	910000	then I think that is not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.
910000	912000	Oh yes, the classic argument.
912000	914000	How do I explain to my child?
914000	916000	Kill your shitty child for all I care.
916000	918000	That's simply not my problem.
918000	920000	I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.
920000	923000	I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.
923000	924000	You and I are through.
924000	927000	I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.
933000	936000	It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.
936000	941000	I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.
941000	943000	Or maybe an orgy.
943000	946000	But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.
946000	954000	The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell-bent on destroying Western civilization.
954000	957000	I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.
961000	964000	Hi boys, it's points again.
964000	966000	Same queen, new look, try to keep up.
966000	969000	In my previous video, Nasty T. Babe likes it rough.
969000	972000	I made an argument about why it's correct to call trans women she.
972000	976000	But I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.
976000	979000	Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.
979000	984000	Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering them.
984000	987000	The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.
987000	988000	I've never watched that show.
988000	990000	I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.
990000	991000	Oh.
991000	992000	Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.
995000	999000	I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look.
999000	1003000	Because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.
1003000	1007000	But the reality is that in a lot of cases, it's a little more complicated.
1007000	1011000	Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.
1011000	1014000	Society basically gets that I'm a woman.
1014000	1019000	Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.
1019000	1022000	Hey, haven't I seen your videos on TgirlLove.com?
1022000	1024000	But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.
1024000	1028000	I got called Sir last week by the cashier at H&M.
1028000	1030000	Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M.
1030000	1033000	But needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.
1033000	1036000	And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.
1036000	1038000	And what happened next stays between me and the Lord.
1038000	1042000	But suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in...
1044000	1046000	Okay, I embellished the story a little.
1046000	1047000	It wasn't cute.
1047000	1050000	So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking,
1050000	1054000	I try to pass off as my voice, and my tragic inability to conduct myself
1054000	1056000	in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding.
1056000	1061000	Your girl remains, despite my desperate painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.
1061000	1063000	You look great, hun.
1064000	1065000	And that debate between Ben and Blair,
1065000	1069000	Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.
1069000	1072000	But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.
1072000	1076000	And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.
1076000	1078000	So appearance definitely matters,
1078000	1081000	but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking like a cis woman,
1081000	1083000	is really the most important thing.
1083000	1086000	What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give me,
1086000	1090000	the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.
1090000	1094000	That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.
1094000	1098000	So my goal isn't necessarily to serve on clockable fish,
1098000	1103000	so much as to embody a certain kind of diaphanous archetypal femininity.
1103000	1105000	In layman's terms, girl dick energy.
1106000	1109000	Also, I am going to have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.
1113000	1116000	And a lot of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying
1116000	1119000	that performing your gender is the only thing that matters
1119000	1121000	and that how you identify counts for nothing.
1121000	1122000	But that's not what I think.
1122000	1127000	I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,
1127000	1129000	because I think that's a much more compelling argument
1129000	1132000	than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify as a woman,
1132000	1135000	which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.
1135000	1137000	It's just too easy to poke holes in it.
1137000	1140000	But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns.
1140000	1141000	And I'll explain why.
1141000	1146000	Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive
1146000	1149000	about anyone telling them what pronouns to use.
1149000	1152000	So I'm going to try to be respectful of your feelings
1152000	1155000	and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.
1155000	1158000	After all, we live in a repressive political era,
1158000	1161000	despite the best efforts of hero professor Jordan B. Peterson.
1161000	1163000	But alas, he was too late.
1163000	1167000	Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people to jail for...
1167000	1170000	Oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed.
1170000	1174000	Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.
1174000	1191000	Oh, I guess that was a false alarm.
1191000	1192000	God damn it.
1192000	1195000	Look, I'm not going to tell you what pronouns you have to use.
1195000	1199000	I'm just going to tell you how I use pronouns in my reasoning behind it.
1199000	1201000	And you are welcome to use your free speech
1201000	1205000	to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you want to be, okay?
1205000	1207000	So, back to identity.
1207000	1211000	If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets
1211000	1214000	and a customer were to walk in looking like this,
1214000	1217000	I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,
1217000	1219000	but that would be wrong.
1219000	1222000	Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,
1222000	1224000	he is THE man.
1224000	1228000	YouTube's most regal makeup artist, his lordship John McClain,
1228000	1230000	and he uses he-him pronouns.
1231000	1233000	Likewise, if I were approached by this person,
1233000	1236000	I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns,
1236000	1238000	and this time I'd be correct.
1238000	1241000	But not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,
1241000	1244000	but because she's genderfluid drag queen Courtney Out,
1244000	1247000	who is the fucking audacity to be a more beautiful woman than I am,
1247000	1250000	and who, so far as I know, uses male pronouns in boy mode
1250000	1253000	and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.
1253000	1257000	A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression
1257000	1259000	get played out in the world of drag.
1259000	1262000	Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men
1262000	1264000	who live as men and perform as women.
1264000	1267000	Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,
1267000	1271000	Shay Kool-Aid, and Violet Chachki, identify as non-binary.
1271000	1275000	Others still are biokweens, cis women who perform as drag queens,
1275000	1277000	like Lucy Garland or Crème Fatale.
1277000	1280000	And then there are trans women who are also drag queens,
1280000	1283000	like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.
1283000	1284000	I mean, look at me!
1284000	1287000	Do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-11 at 2 a.m.?
1287000	1288000	Because I do.
1288000	1289000	Look what I have become!
1289000	1292000	A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.
1292000	1294000	Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.
1294000	1296000	I just, through pure coincidence,
1296000	1299000	happen to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived.
1299000	1301000	I am so sorry, I can't help it.
1301000	1302000	So let's recap.
1302000	1306000	There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.
1306000	1310000	There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.
1310000	1312000	There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns
1312000	1314000	depending on their current presentation.
1314000	1317000	There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender
1317000	1320000	other than the one they present and live as and prefer other pronouns.
1320000	1323000	So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks
1323000	1327000	because there's a lot of situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.
1327000	1331000	So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,
1331000	1334000	but it's also not the only thing that matters.
1334000	1337000	If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered,
1337000	1341000	then there would be no need for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition,
1341000	1343000	including requesting different pronouns,
1343000	1346000	because pronouns belong to the social world of language.
1346000	1348000	Not to individual psychology.
1348000	1352000	This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.
1352000	1354000	You can identify however you like,
1354000	1357000	but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.
1357000	1361000	So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man,
1361000	1365000	then you are fully trans, your identity is fully valid,
1365000	1367000	but until you begin living as a woman,
1367000	1370000	your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.
1370000	1373000	And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.
1373000	1376000	There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,
1376000	1378000	and not enough on social relationships.
1378000	1381000	You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.
1381000	1385000	You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant
1385000	1387000	and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.
1387000	1390000	My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.
1390000	1393000	As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,
1393000	1395000	they are fully trans.
1395000	1399000	I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience
1399000	1402000	isn't entirely a product of how they identify.
1402000	1405000	To put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,
1405000	1408000	but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.
1408000	1411000	Many trans women just seem like women to me
1411000	1414000	in literally the same way that cis women seem like women,
1414000	1418000	and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to do from birth.
1418000	1421000	This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.
1421000	1424000	We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,
1424000	1427000	but at least to seem like our genders to the people around us.
1427000	1429000	As Laura Jane Grace put it,
1430000	1432000	You want them to see you like they see every other girl.
1432000	1436000	I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity.
1436000	1438000	As a trans woman.
1438000	1440000	But just because I seem like a woman to them,
1440000	1442000	because the reality is,
1442000	1446000	not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,
1446000	1449000	and I live with this constant crushing anxiety
1449000	1451000	that I don't seem like a woman to other people.
1451000	1454000	I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,
1454000	1457000	and I cope with that fear by looking like a second-rate drag queen.
1457000	1461000	But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a zero percent woman,
1461000	1463000	if she tells me she's a trans woman,
1463000	1466000	I'm going to use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.
1466000	1468000	Not just to be polite,
1468000	1472000	but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological experience,
1472000	1475000	and especially because I want to help her resocialize
1475000	1478000	and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.
1478000	1482000	And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,
1482000	1486000	but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.
1486000	1489000	And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.
1489000	1492000	Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.
1492000	1495000	An increasing number of people identify not as male or female,
1495000	1497000	but as non-binary,
1497000	1500000	an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels
1500000	1504000	such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, greygender, and so on.
1504000	1506000	Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.
1506000	1508000	In English, usually they.
1508000	1511000	Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,
1511000	1515000	consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all
1515000	1518000	is a particular feature of the English language
1518000	1520000	that's by no means shared by all other languages,
1520000	1524000	including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.
1524000	1526000	Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth
1526000	1528000	that humans make up to suit our purposes.
1528000	1530000	If you're new to using singular they,
1530000	1534000	it is a little confusing at first, but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.
1534000	1535000	They poured milk on me.
1535000	1537000	I poured milk on them.
1537000	1540000	They did anoint themselves in their milk and it was good, thus saith the Lord.
1540000	1543000	So the polite thing to do here is easy.
1543000	1544000	If someone asks you to call them they,
1544000	1545000	you call them they.
1545000	1546000	You call them they.
1546000	1549000	But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing
1549000	1552000	because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.
1552000	1554000	You want to understand why you're doing it.
1554000	1557000	I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people.
1557000	1558000	I want to be a convert.
1558000	1561000	I want to believe about them while they believe about themselves,
1561000	1563000	so long as those beliefs are reasonable.
1563000	1565000	So what do all these words mean?
1565000	1567000	What are these people talking about?
1567000	1570000	Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.
1570000	1574000	John McClain is feminine in expression, but a man in identity.
1574000	1578000	Whereas I am a woman in identity and in expression, I am a mess.
1578000	1582000	Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity,
1582000	1587000	art, science, spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.
1587000	1591000	The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10
1591000	1595000	or high femme to stone butch the gender expression of a given domain,
1595000	1598000	such as Mulan looks or Steven universe characters.
1599000	1604000	It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.
1604000	1608000	Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender,
1608000	1613000	greygender, and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity
1613000	1615000	the Futch scale gives to expression.
1615000	1619000	But my input on this isn't really worth that much because I'm not non-binary.
1619000	1622000	And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here
1622000	1627000	because all this talk about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.
1627000	1631000	I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?
1631000	1635000	And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.
1635000	1637000	And that's how I experience gender.
1637000	1641000	I live, I exist as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve
1641000	1644000	the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
1644000	1646000	And I identify as trash.
1646000	1650000	I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman.
1650000	1654000	Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration,
1654000	1659000	waiting in a long ass line for the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist,
1659000	1663000	being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons in case someone asks,
1663000	1666000	a dude explaining Philosophy 101 to me and me going,
1666000	1669000	oh really? Wow.
1669000	1672000	But you know these experiences mean different things to different people.
1672000	1678000	So all I can really tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures
1678000	1681000	that taking female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures
1681000	1686000	makes me feel more at home in my body and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,
1686000	1688000	socially, spiritually, sexually.
1688000	1691000	So that's the jargon free explanation of my gender as I see it.
1691000	1696000	Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?
1696000	1699000	Well, honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.
1699000	1703000	But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have.
1703000	1706000	And that, I think, is legitimate enough.
1706000	1709000	So I know what living as a woman means to me,
1709000	1711000	but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?
1711000	1714000	Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,
1714000	1717000	that's something that's going to vary between individuals and cultures.
1717000	1720000	Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,
1720000	1726000	such as the Hydra of South Asia, a legally recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh,
1726000	1730000	or the various two spirit traditions of indigenous North American tribes.
1730000	1733000	Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition,
1733000	1736000	but we do have individual non-binary people,
1736000	1740000	some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,
1740000	1743000	non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.
1743000	1746000	We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.
1746000	1748000	Even as a binary trans person,
1748000	1751000	I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.
1751000	1755000	That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.
1755000	1758000	But many of the people who call themselves non-binary
1758000	1761000	seem to be fighting for something more radical than what I'm fighting for,
1761000	1763000	at least in my personal life.
1763000	1766000	I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.
1767000	1768000	Heh.
1768000	1770000	As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.
1770000	1772000	The traditional female garb of my culture.
1772000	1775000	Neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer.
1775000	1776000	No!
1776000	1780000	Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely,
1780000	1784000	they're effectively trying to create the society that includes them.
1784000	1787000	And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people,
1787000	1792000	who, for example, promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.
1792000	1795000	Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,
1795000	1797000	provided they assume it correctly.
1797000	1801000	Otherwise, I will throw you an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.
1801000	1804000	But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary,
1804000	1807000	and gender non-conforming people find it easier to navigate the world
1807000	1811000	using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.
1811000	1814000	So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.
1814000	1817000	And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,
1817000	1819000	to do or say anything,
1819000	1823000	I do hope you use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech
1823000	1825000	to choose to do the same.
1825000	1826000	Freely.
1833000	1836000	Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.
1836000	1839000	I'm talking about the female lead.
1840000	1842000	Now the fun really begins.
1842000	1843000	The show's over.
1843000	1846000	I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor,
1846000	1849000	so goodbye, my satanic subscribers.
1849000	1851000	Until next week...
1852000	1854000	Go to hell!
1876000	1880000	In hell!
1882000	1884000	We'll go hell!
1884000	1886000	In hell!
1886000	1888000	In hell!
1906000	1908000	We'll go hell!
