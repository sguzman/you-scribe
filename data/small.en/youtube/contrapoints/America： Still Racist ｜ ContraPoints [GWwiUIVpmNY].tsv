0	5440	If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you
5440	6440	do.
6440	10480	You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with
10480	17240	toad venom, and you simply wait for the Wolverines to eat your legs.
17240	18880	Trust me, you're better off that way.
18880	22900	Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race, well, here's what you get.
22900	28000	You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists tag team title match tonight
28000	31240	at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.
31240	34880	So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy nilly convicting innocent black
34880	36800	people of crimes they didn't commit.
36800	40640	Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices for which they have
40640	42680	to deal with the consequences.
42680	45940	Racism isn't an explanation for everything bad that happens to black people.
45940	49800	If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.
49800	54180	That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide
54180	55760	to commit more crimes for no reason.
55760	59600	I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music, or deadbeat dads with their sagging
59600	60600	pants.
60600	63600	I'd say that this is the most common right wing view of race in America.
63600	67560	It's not outright fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that
67560	73320	racial inequality is a product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make
73320	74320	bad choices.
74320	78000	Usually this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial
78000	82080	inequality and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.
82080	84680	Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.
84680	86620	This is what I'm going to argue against in this video.
86620	88920	We're going to take a break from talking about fascism.
88920	91240	In the past, I've focused too much on the alt-right.
91240	92240	I think we all have.
92240	95640	I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement, but it's just not
95640	99040	the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.
99040	102360	In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America, which
102360	105320	is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.
105320	108720	And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow
108720	112440	of Pepe's and racist Odinists and neo-Nazi larpers.
112440	114720	All that stuff, it's very last season.
114720	115720	I'm kind of over it.
115720	116720	Oh, god damn it.
116720	117720	Hello Leiter.
117720	118720	Fritz, get the hell out of here.
118720	119720	No one cares about you anymore.
119720	120720	No one cares about you anymore.
120720	121720	No.
121720	122720	I don't care.
122720	123720	I don't care.
123720	124720	You're still a Nazi.
124720	125720	Get out.
125720	126720	But I'm trans.
126720	127720	How could I possibly be a Nazi?
127720	128720	That's a good question.
128720	141720	It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.
141720	142720	Get out.
142720	147040	She calls me a Nazi, and yet she is the one trying to silence my free speech, an excellent
147040	149960	example of how truly fascist the left has become.
149960	153760	Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in
153760	154920	the free marketplace of ideas?
154920	158280	Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out
158280	159280	of my room.
159280	160680	Mom, get out of my life.
160680	163160	Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish question?
163160	164160	No.
164160	165160	It's just ideas.
165160	166160	What are you afraid of?
166160	169000	I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of
169000	170280	here in ten seconds.
170280	171280	Ten.
171280	172280	Nine.
172280	173280	Oh, baby.
173280	174280	Come on.
174280	175280	I thought you liked to be.
175280	176280	Six.
176280	177280	You used to whisper to me so sweetly.
177280	178280	Well, not anymore.
178280	180840	Well, do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax?
180840	185200	Hey, Jesus.
185200	186400	I don't like doing this.
186400	188800	I prefer to have conversations about disagreements.
188800	192600	I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people.
192600	194440	They just give you no choice.
194440	195440	Where were we?
195440	196440	Right, so racial injustice.
196440	200440	When I talk to people about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists
200440	201920	react to them in two ways.
201920	204000	One, by saying you're racist.
204000	206480	And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.
206480	210560	And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience
210560	211640	a lot of people have.
211640	214760	And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this.
214760	215760	No offense.
215760	220040	And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are more
220040	224360	than happy to educate people in their own special way.
224360	226360	So as I see it, the left needs to step it up.
226360	229840	Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they
229840	234200	explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole, and it's true, it's not their
234200	235520	job to explain it to you.
235520	237440	They have other shit to do with their lives.
237440	241520	But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my
241520	244520	lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes.
244520	248840	Because it kind of is my job, and I have all the time in the world.
248840	251880	It's a funny thing, time.
251880	254640	Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history?
254640	258920	Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a long time ago?
258920	262840	I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July.
262840	263840	This person?
263840	264840	Who the fuck is that?
264840	267360	No, I don't have any white guilt.
267360	268560	That's not what this is about.
268560	270840	That's just more white narcissism is what that is.
270840	272680	So wipe away those white-ass tears.
272680	279640	Here, I'll pick you out of cotton ball.
279640	286480	1.
286480	287480	Freddie Gray
287480	292640	On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested
292640	296920	a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted
296920	299320	knife that maybe was illegal.
299320	301880	They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.
301880	304800	His leg broke and yachts, man, I didn't like that.
304800	308800	When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three
308800	312480	fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.
312480	316760	A week later, Gray died of his spinal injury, while the Baltimore police released contradictory
316760	319000	and inadequate information about his arrest.
319000	322720	This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious
322720	323720	Baltimore riots.
323720	327320	Now, you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism if black people don't
327320	330280	want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police?
330280	334880	Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent crimes
334880	339120	shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming to
339120	340760	me how quick you are to defend this.
340760	344760	And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine
344760	349040	the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and
349040	350880	are subject to more aggressive policing.
350880	354360	So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.
354360	358720	Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators
358720	362480	brought this out as evidence that he was no angel.
362480	366360	The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, but he deserved
366360	367360	to die.
367360	369440	But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place?
369440	373080	I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition.
373080	375360	Did he just do it for no reason?
375360	376760	Well, let's see.
376760	380960	Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood, Sandtown Winchester.
380960	384760	You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated row house
384760	386400	with peeling lead paint.
386400	391200	Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because
391200	395760	it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to deficits in attention and increased
395760	400040	aggression which may explain why children poisoned with lead are seven times more likely
401040	404680	and six times more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system.
404680	408880	But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with a congressional ban
408880	414440	on lead paint, and as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's
414440	418480	lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.
418480	422720	Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent
422720	425640	brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids.
425640	430120	Now you might be thinking, well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right?
430120	432080	Well, unfortunately, no.
432080	435960	What's happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead
435960	440240	poisoning victims, some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their
440240	444220	structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total
444220	445220	worth of the settlement.
445220	447480	And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.
447480	453920	In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for
453920	454920	$18,300.
454920	461400	They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray siblings
461400	463240	settlement for $54,000.
463240	468800	Now I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad, but to understand how it relates to structural
468800	472240	racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation.
472240	475200	Or you know, we could just keep doing livestreams with Richard Spencer.
475200	477600	Interviews with Nazis, the new YouTube craze.
477600	478600	God damn it.
478600	479600	I need to relax.
479600	480600	I need music.
480600	486960	I'm just a race down in every corner.
486960	487960	Two.
487960	489000	Housing discrimination.
489000	492760	Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated
492760	498480	lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.
498480	502160	Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white.
502160	503160	Lead.
503160	504160	Race.
504160	505160	Lead.
505160	506160	Race.
506160	509240	Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.
509240	512560	Why in the 21st century is Baltimore still so segregated?
512560	515000	I thought racism was over.
515000	517280	Well, here's the thing about that.
517280	522360	When your country's history is 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't
522360	526320	just get to say, oops, sorry about that.
526320	528800	It's all cool now though, right?
528800	530440	No, it's not cool.
530440	534040	And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.
534040	536580	Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.
536580	541420	I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that 100 years ago, America may
541420	543100	have been somewhat racist.
543100	548460	In 1910, a Yale educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious
548460	549960	white Baltimore neighborhood.
549960	553740	This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city passed an ordinance
553740	556940	mandating the segregation of every residential block.
556940	561740	Basically, the ordinance forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks
561740	566300	and vice versa until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.
566300	569760	Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?
569760	572980	Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.
572980	576180	Well, no, that's actually not correct.
576180	580620	In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote home ownership in
580620	583600	the midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.
583600	588020	One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,
588020	591020	which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.
591020	595020	FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating home ownership throughout the
595020	598860	middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden
598860	600300	age of the American Dream.
600300	604020	But many black Americans were excluded from home ownership and the benefits it conferred
604020	608060	to white families, particularly the family financial stability it enabled.
608060	609860	So how was this exclusion possible?
609860	614860	Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle
614860	619380	methods to enforce residential segregation and deny home ownership to black Americans.
619380	621020	For instance, 1.
621020	622020	Restrictive Covenants
622020	627500	When the 1910 Ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,
627500	631740	which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods
631740	635660	to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.
635660	639420	These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued
639420	643420	against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.
643420	644420	2.
644420	645420	Red Signing
645420	649340	The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to ensure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were
649340	653380	colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name redlining.
653380	657700	This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which, in
657700	661020	turn, left them vulnerable to three predatory lending.
661020	665260	Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed
665260	670180	mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans with abusive
670180	674700	terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single
674700	675700	missed payment.
675700	679220	Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and
679220	683700	they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,
683700	687140	further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.
687140	688140	4.
688140	689140	Blockbusting
689140	692540	Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting, where they'd
692540	697100	intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of a white
697100	698100	neighborhood.
698100	701140	They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners into selling
701140	705900	their houses at below-market prices so they could resell those same houses at extortionate
705900	708860	prices to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.
708860	712620	The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped
712620	717780	in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,
717780	719820	and aggressive, discriminatory policing.
719820	723700	And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains
723700	724700	unredressed.
724700	728780	No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of homeownership
728780	734100	during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated $500 million
734100	735100	in Chicago alone.
735300	739820	But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination
739820	741700	of the last century is still ongoing.
741700	746020	I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fuckin' neighborhood like one mile
746020	749820	away from where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different
749820	750820	country.
750820	753060	Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.
753060	756580	I'll compare that to the 2013 population by race map.
756580	761340	If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the
761340	766740	same pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects
766740	769860	of racism have not entirely been eradicated.
769860	772140	And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.
772140	777740	Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,
777740	778940	Cleveland, LA.
778940	782620	All of these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a separate but equal
782620	783940	situation either.
783940	788380	Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore to this map of Baltimore police
788380	792820	stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing
792820	795020	recorded police stops of black pedestrians.
795020	799060	And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and
799060	800060	2013.
800060	803700	Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead
803700	807900	exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems
807900	811980	going on here that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their
811980	813300	belts and do less crimes.
813300	817060	But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either, because that only accounts
817060	819180	for a small fraction of what's going on here.
819180	823780	The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation, the historical
823780	829100	exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing
829100	833700	insistence on treating a problem of injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality.
833700	836620	I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt.
836620	842620	And it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?
842780	847940	In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.
847940	851940	You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.
851940	857700	As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra.
857700	861700	Black Lives Matter are the real racists.
861700	864780	3. Mass Incarceration
864780	869540	Since the 1970s, the United States incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where
869540	873100	nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.
873100	877660	We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's
877660	881500	prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.
881500	885420	More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black incarceration
885420	887620	rate is almost 6 times that of whites.
887620	891180	Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in
891180	892180	general.
892180	896020	Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants
896020	900260	are pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of
900260	901260	incarceration.
901260	904180	But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.
904180	907260	You know, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,
907260	910340	If the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.
910340	912340	Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.
912340	913340	You know what?
913340	914540	Why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?
914540	915540	Every single YouTuber.
915540	918860	Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.
918860	923580	Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can
923580	926660	finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.
926660	927660	God damn it.
927660	928660	Where's my toad venom?
928660	932180	Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit
932180	933180	more crimes.
933180	936460	For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people are
936460	939020	nearly 4 times as likely to be arrested for it.
939020	943060	And we're talking about a drug that, at this point, white America has basically decided
943060	945580	shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.
945580	948380	So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.
948380	951020	And just look what white people are doing to weed.
951020	954740	Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a gondrepreneur.
954740	958300	It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.
958300	961340	It's a great bronco dilator, so I like to use it when I work out.
961340	965660	Yeah, so in fact, in the back of the limousines, only one of the only legal places you can
965660	967460	consume cannabis.
967460	968780	The whites are at it again.
968780	970380	They have gentrified the marijuana.
970380	973900	And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the same drug
973900	977820	that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.
977820	978820	A gondrepreneur.
978820	980700	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
980700	984380	This is the most basic kind of unfairness, and if this doesn't make you angry, then
984380	990540	either you're really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.
990540	994500	I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation
994500	999780	about race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial
999780	1003980	executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,
1003980	1007460	and the vicious history of discrimination in its ongoing repercussions.
1007460	1011900	And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person
1011900	1015820	who takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.
1015820	1019940	There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter
1019940	1025420	is and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism and its unpatriotic and
1025420	1030540	postmodern and racist, and I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.
1030540	1034140	Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.
1034140	1037620	If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare, it's
1037620	1040140	locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.
1040140	1043980	But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk
1043980	1044980	about that.
1044980	1049500	They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.
1049500	1050500	How dare they?
1050500	1054380	Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists
1054380	1057140	or stock, salad-eating, basic white girl caricatures.
1057140	1060540	I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think, where does this
1060540	1062540	white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?
1062540	1066620	I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.
1066620	1067620	And here's the thing about that.
1067620	1071780	You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility or taking control of your life
1071780	1076420	to the greatest extent possible is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.
1076420	1079500	So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.
1079500	1081940	Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.
1081940	1085980	So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.
1085980	1086980	Please don't do that.
1086980	1088660	Go succeed as much as possible.
1088660	1092460	But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.
1092460	1097140	Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances, but we also have
1097140	1101860	a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions that create those circumstances
1101860	1102860	in the first place.
1102860	1103860	Wow.
1103860	1106820	I feel like I just gave a great speech.
1106820	1110500	Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime
1110500	1111500	this entire time?
1111500	1112660	Look, I even put a lime in it.
1112660	1114020	Bud Light Lime with Lime.
1114020	1117500	The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much about people
1117500	1119460	who complain too much about racism.
1119460	1122260	For the final...countdown.
1122260	1124700	I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.
1124700	1128300	First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white
1128300	1129300	people.
1129300	1132300	I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.
1132300	1135580	But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country and someone should make videos
1135580	1136580	about those too.
1136580	1139020	Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.
1139020	1142380	I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the
1142380	1143380	topic.
1143380	1146620	Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.
1146620	1148860	Like, c'mon, that should just be common sense.
1148860	1153940	So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down, smash that unsubscribe button,
1153940	1158180	unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos, and
1158180	1161460	then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have
1161460	1162460	to say.
1162460	1165780	Um, so, I guess that's it.
1165780	1167140	I was just kidding about the forest.
1167140	1170020	I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.
1170020	1176020	So, I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.
1200020	1207020	But his truth is marching on.
1207020	1212020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1212020	1216020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1216020	1220020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1220020	1225020	His truth is marching on.
1225020	1232020	In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea with the glory in his bosom
1232020	1235020	that transfigures you and me.
1235020	1245020	As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free while God is marching on.
1245020	1250020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1250020	1254020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1254020	1258020	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1258020	1263020	His truth is marching on.
1263020	1267020	Death to capitalism and the patriarchy smash the binary hill, Satan.
1267020	1268020	Ow!
