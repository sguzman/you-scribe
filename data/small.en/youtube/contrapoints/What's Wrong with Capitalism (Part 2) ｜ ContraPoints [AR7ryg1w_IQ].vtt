WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
I like stuff, I like this, and I like this, and I like this, and I like stuff, and I want

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
more stuff.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.320
My child, hearkened to my voice, it is I, Socrates.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.160
Oh no, what do you want?

00:38.160 --> 00:41.240
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.040
Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.560
My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.640
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness, the rational

00:53.640 --> 00:56.280
contemplation of truth and justice?

00:56.600 --> 01:00.720
Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.400
I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.480
Ah, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.960
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself, perfectly

01:11.960 --> 01:16.080
exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.

01:16.080 --> 01:20.360
Okay, thank you for your feedback, we'll take that into consideration.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.920
Ugh, Greeks.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.920
Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.400
But happiness, what does that word even mean?

01:31.400 --> 01:35.680
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things, and these are questions really better left

01:35.680 --> 01:39.440
to the philosophers, which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
video.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.200
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist

01:44.200 --> 01:49.880
philosophy ever produced, a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the concept of

01:49.880 --> 01:51.400
the fetishism of the commodity.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.360
I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed video about three men who

01:56.360 --> 02:00.880
are younger than me who travel the world and try different foods that cost different amounts

02:00.880 --> 02:04.880
of money, and then say whether it was worth it.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.080
In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants at three drastically

02:09.080 --> 02:13.240
different price points to find out which one is the most worth it.

02:13.240 --> 02:19.800
For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold, and a $1

02:19.800 --> 02:26.800
ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold, and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel

02:26.800 --> 02:28.080
that's made of gold.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
It is a lot of gold.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.760
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
A ganjipreneur!

02:31.760 --> 02:36.720
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.

02:36.720 --> 02:41.760
But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.800
We like to take it all in.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.800
Ahh!

02:44.800 --> 02:48.540
The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.780
These are not mere content creators, mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad

02:53.780 --> 02:54.780
revenue.

02:54.780 --> 02:57.900
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even.

02:57.900 --> 03:02.500
And what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly, far surpasses the combined

03:02.500 --> 03:09.820
insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Sartre Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukacs, Zarathustra,

03:09.820 --> 03:12.260
and even our dear breadmom, Kropotkin.

03:12.260 --> 03:16.840
I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many, many times, but I always

03:16.840 --> 03:21.880
come away dissatisfied and I find myself returning, yet again, to the unparalleled

03:21.880 --> 03:24.520
masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

03:24.520 --> 03:29.240
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.840
Is it worth it?

03:30.840 --> 03:32.040
We may never know.

03:32.040 --> 03:37.200
Take for instance the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.640
Which is the better deal?

03:38.640 --> 03:42.560
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

03:42.560 --> 03:47.560
Well, according to Karl Marx, the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

03:47.560 --> 03:52.160
On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
human need.

03:53.160 --> 03:58.000
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value, the quantity determining the ratio

03:58.000 --> 04:03.200
by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity, deriving from objectified

04:03.200 --> 04:06.360
labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.480
But let's not oversimplify things.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.440
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand

04:14.440 --> 04:20.640
the use value, exchange value dichotomy not as a mere hierarchical binary, but as a sort

04:20.640 --> 04:27.640
of delusian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections as the

04:27.640 --> 04:29.160
truffles on the pizza itself.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.000
Am I making myself clear?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm not.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.920
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon and not actually

04:35.920 --> 04:37.720
helping me think through this any better.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.920
So let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

04:42.920 --> 04:43.920
Fuck this.

04:43.920 --> 04:55.400
I like stuff, and I like shiny things.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.800
Now that's something everyone can understand, so let's take that as the first axiom of

04:59.800 --> 05:02.560
the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.680
So given that I like stuff and I like shiny things, let's return to the question.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.320
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

05:10.320 --> 05:17.640
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that, but the pizza itself seems

05:17.640 --> 05:18.640
kinda gross.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.800
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras, stilton cheese, black truffles, gold

05:23.800 --> 05:25.680
flakes, and caviar.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.160
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.480
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.640
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment, but Andrew and Steven

05:36.640 --> 05:41.440
sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop and they try to pretend that

05:41.440 --> 05:45.560
the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.960
I'm honestly speechless.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
I feel weird.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Is it the gold?

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
I just ate $250.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.200
I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.600
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.080
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza isn't

06:05.080 --> 06:09.120
worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.960
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money on some gilded

06:13.960 --> 06:17.880
piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.720
Is there a name for that feeling?

06:19.720 --> 06:23.240
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

06:23.240 --> 06:28.840
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia, a bad pizza covered in gold would just be

06:28.840 --> 06:30.800
a bad pizza covered in gold.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.360
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza, but you probably wouldn't

06:35.360 --> 06:38.120
be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

06:38.120 --> 06:43.240
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it, you have to understand it in

06:43.240 --> 06:45.080
the context of capitalism.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.560
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza, and if you live in America

06:50.560 --> 06:54.880
you have an instinctive sense for what that means, because you know all the other things

06:54.880 --> 06:56.920
you could buy with $2,000.

06:56.920 --> 07:02.280
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.200
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening worrying

07:06.200 --> 07:08.720
about how they're going to afford golden nails.

07:08.720 --> 07:15.040
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem not just aesthetically disappointing,

07:15.040 --> 07:17.280
but almost obscene, or even immoral.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.920
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.440
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go,

07:24.440 --> 07:28.360
Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you?

07:28.360 --> 07:32.760
Because the problem isn't that Andrew Adam and Steven are bad people for buying inexpensive

07:32.760 --> 07:35.160
flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

07:35.160 --> 07:40.120
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable these repulsive

07:40.120 --> 07:42.560
juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.440
That's why I don't really agree with the philosophy of Peter Singer, who has this

07:46.440 --> 07:51.320
idea that many of the world's problems could be solved if privileged American college students

07:51.320 --> 07:55.560
would just become hedge fund managers and donate most of their income to buying mosquito

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
nets in the Congo.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.440
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations, but it's not going to

08:00.440 --> 08:05.040
change the fact that the global economy is structured around cheap, exploited labor at

08:05.040 --> 08:08.280
the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.160
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.960
Well they're certainly not the Jews.

08:14.960 --> 08:20.640
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.680
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.880
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.080
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.240
So the lizards are not the Jews, they're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis, they're

08:32.240 --> 08:37.000
not Freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda, but the key insight is that they're not

08:37.000 --> 08:39.160
even really the capitalists.

08:39.160 --> 08:42.440
The lizards are capital itself.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
And what does that mean?

08:43.440 --> 08:47.520
Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

08:47.560 --> 08:50.800
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product

08:50.800 --> 08:54.240
of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.920
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.

08:58.920 --> 09:03.120
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.360
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme

09:07.360 --> 09:11.840
economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.440
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go

09:15.440 --> 09:17.280
something like this.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.560
Humanism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating

09:21.560 --> 09:26.160
large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where

09:26.160 --> 09:31.280
efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity

09:31.280 --> 09:33.200
to maximize human happiness.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.360
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
Here's a question.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.960
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

09:39.960 --> 09:44.560
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity, so what I look for in a good

09:44.560 --> 09:48.920
economic system is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of

09:48.920 --> 09:49.920
it.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.160
So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is does having

09:53.160 --> 09:55.240
more wealth make people happier?

09:55.240 --> 09:59.440
And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system,

09:59.440 --> 10:04.520
and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point, but

10:04.520 --> 10:09.080
the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus is somewhere between $65,000 and

10:09.080 --> 10:10.920
$95,000 a year.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.600
One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower

10:15.600 --> 10:21.060
income levels, more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical

10:21.060 --> 10:22.760
bills or college tuition.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.440
But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing

10:27.440 --> 10:28.760
golden pizzas.

10:28.760 --> 10:34.200
If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.520
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.000
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that

10:41.000 --> 10:46.760
the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national

10:46.760 --> 10:51.320
median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

10:51.320 --> 10:58.160
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the

10:58.160 --> 11:00.000
peak happiness threshold.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.040
So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

11:05.040 --> 11:10.160
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and health care,

11:10.160 --> 11:15.680
while a few million others are like constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.640
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that, because it's not just that some people don't

11:19.640 --> 11:24.280
have enough money to meet all of their needs, it's that they have to be poor while other

11:24.280 --> 11:25.920
people are rich.

11:25.920 --> 11:30.600
And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties

11:30.600 --> 11:32.520
and resentments and social tensions.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.720
There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows that if you reward one monkey for a

11:36.720 --> 11:41.680
task with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,

11:41.680 --> 11:44.080
the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.920
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.080
But that's just how it looks to me.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
I could be wrong.

11:51.080 --> 11:55.960
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how

11:55.960 --> 11:57.160
the economy works.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.000
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.840
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

12:02.840 --> 12:07.680
So look, if I'm wrong, and capitalism is good actually, just leave a comment and I'll

12:07.680 --> 12:09.320
be happy to be proven wrong.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.680
But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.520
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.520
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.960
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.960
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain

12:29.960 --> 12:31.240
themselves and their families.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.200
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.800
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.840
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher if they could make a good living

12:41.840 --> 12:42.840
as a janitor?

12:42.840 --> 12:46.800
Well, janitorial work is pretty important actually.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.760
Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
a decent living.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.600
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the

12:55.600 --> 13:00.200
kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by

13:00.200 --> 13:01.480
profit anyway.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.480
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine even though he could have made millions of

13:05.480 --> 13:10.440
dollars from it because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose beyond

13:10.440 --> 13:11.440
personal profit.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.080
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need

13:16.080 --> 13:20.880
to work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.400
So let me get this straight.

13:22.400 --> 13:27.520
You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.520
Hypocrite much?

13:28.520 --> 13:33.160
A few years ago I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticized capitalism

13:33.160 --> 13:34.720
then, people used to say,

13:34.720 --> 13:38.200
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

13:38.200 --> 13:42.720
You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.120
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,

13:47.120 --> 13:51.960
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,

13:51.960 --> 13:57.040
then according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?

13:57.040 --> 14:01.080
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.360
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

14:04.360 --> 14:06.360
Well, no, I wouldn't.

14:06.360 --> 14:11.560
Hello, I'm Tatiana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
Fuck off!

14:12.560 --> 14:16.240
Dozvidanya fascist.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.600
So granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty, but that doesn't mean that

14:20.600 --> 14:23.560
the current system is the best and final system for all time.

14:23.560 --> 14:28.280
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

14:28.280 --> 14:33.680
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.760
Okay, but I like stuff.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.280
I like stuff too.

14:38.280 --> 14:43.680
I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.

14:43.680 --> 14:49.360
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,

14:49.360 --> 14:54.440
undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

14:54.440 --> 14:57.960
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.000
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

15:01.000 --> 15:04.560
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.720
But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.640
these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.920
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,

15:15.920 --> 15:17.040
straight guys will be like,

15:17.040 --> 15:20.080
will there be video games after capitalism? Oh, god!

15:20.080 --> 15:21.440
And yeah, there will be.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.800
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

15:24.800 --> 15:34.200
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.080
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.840
The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing, by John Berger,

15:42.840 --> 15:46.560
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.720
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.880
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.280
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

15:56.280 --> 16:00.200
And I felt kind of attacked because glamour is very important to us.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.960
And by us, I mean the gays.

16:01.960 --> 16:07.560
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy cues.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.520
But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,

16:10.560 --> 16:15.400
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder

16:15.400 --> 16:17.000
in the service of selling you shit.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.040
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour, not something essential to it.

16:22.040 --> 16:26.800
And maybe glamour would actually be liberated if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.640
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that, actually, stuff is good.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.840
Glamour is good. Video games are good.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.880
Luxury is good. Baths are good.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.680
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.

16:39.680 --> 16:45.800
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza is ultimately that the $2 pizza is actually better.

16:45.800 --> 16:50.320
The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,

16:50.320 --> 16:53.120
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

16:53.120 --> 16:57.960
So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.880
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.880
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

17:03.880 --> 17:08.400
Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way, I'm finally ready to get started.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.960
Part one, which you've all been waiting for.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.440
How to end capitalism once and for all.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.480
Well, I don't know. Who do you people think I am?

17:16.480 --> 17:20.600
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.440
I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

17:24.440 --> 17:28.960
Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.560
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
Sure, it's bound to happen any day now.

17:38.400 --> 17:44.160
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

17:44.160 --> 17:47.440
Uh, so, I don't know. I guess vote labor.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.440
Tweet radically. Try to eat more vegetables.

17:51.440 --> 17:57.040
Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.

17:57.040 --> 18:03.280
And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

18:03.280 --> 18:08.000
No. No voting. Smashing.

18:08.080 --> 18:13.600
Well, you know what? Since she's the one with the plan, apparently, I guess, just do whatever she says.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.160
Tabi, why don't you go take a bath?

18:24.080 --> 18:26.480
Good kitty. Don't close the door.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.800
Dear comrades, the central catgirl committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.400
and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.920
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

18:37.920 --> 18:40.320
with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabi.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
This video is made possible by the U.S. Department of Information, the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information, and the U.S. Department of Information.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
Thank you for watching.
