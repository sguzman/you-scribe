0	3000	Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.
6000	8000	Fire burning cauldron bubble.
10000	12000	Something wicked this way comes.
13000	15000	Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.
15000	17000	Magical darkness.
20000	21000	A must.
23000	26000	Joanne, I want to talk to you, Joanne.
27000	29000	What is it about Joanne's?
29000	31000	I can't catch a break from these people.
31000	34000	So, now that 2020 is finally over,
34000	37000	I think we can let the record conclusively show
37000	40000	that it was a year Homest is bad.
40000	42000	And on top of everything else that was going on,
42000	45000	truly the last thing we needed was the author of Harry Potter
45000	49000	coming forward to announce there's two things she can't stand.
49000	52000	Bickertree and the Transgenders.
53000	54000	How?
54000	56000	Elderberry wand.
56000	57000	Turjid.
57000	59000	With a core of...
60000	61000	Ice dragon.
61000	62000	Lumos.
62000	63000	Can we afford spells?
63000	64000	Is that in the budget?
64000	66000	Expecto Patreon.
66000	70000	So, you've probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.
70000	73000	Unless you've been living under a rock, in which case,
73000	75000	get back under that rock, sweetie.
75000	77000	There is nothing good going on up here.
77000	78000	It's not worth it.
78000	81000	Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did was say biological sex is real.
81000	87000	And now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists are trying to silence her.
87000	89000	This is cancel culture gone too far.
89000	90000	This is a witch hunt.
90000	92000	Celebrities are under attack.
92000	94000	This is the new Salem.
94000	96000	This is Orwell's nightmare.
96000	98000	This is a painful topic for me all around,
98000	100000	because as a transgender woman,
100000	105000	I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things Joanne has said in the last year.
105000	109000	But I also know what it's like to be the target of a Twitter mob.
109000	114000	And I realize that to most people, complaining about being canceled,
114000	117000	it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.
117000	121000	Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people like J.K. Rowling
121000	127000	would be above staying up alone at night reading mean things people say online.
127000	129000	But you'd think wrong.
129000	132000	See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness of the human condition.
132000	135000	And no amount of fame and money is going to fix that.
135000	138000	You know, fame alienates you from other people.
138000	141000	It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,
141000	144000	which can actually make you feel more alone,
144000	147000	even when people are worshipping you as a goddess.
147000	150000	Never mind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.
150000	154000	The truth is that unless you've personally experienced infamy,
154000	159000	being shamed and shunned on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,
159000	161000	then you just don't know what it's like.
161000	164000	And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.
164000	168000	But Joanne knows, and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,
168000	173000	there's a traumatized part of me that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.
173000	175000	And I want to protect.
175000	179000	My nurturing and compassionate nature sometimes gets the best of me.
179000	182000	But there's also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.
182000	184000	How could you do this to me, Joanne?
184000	187000	I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.
187000	191000	So what I want to do in this video is take Joanne's pain seriously
191000	193000	and treat her like a complex human being,
193000	199000	while also being critical of the things she said about the transgender question.
199000	203000	And I also want to explore where the Twitter mob is coming from,
203000	205000	because they're in pain too.
205000	208000	And don't they also deserve our understanding?
208000	214000	So without further ado, let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush
214000	217000	and see if we can find the truth.
217000	219000	Swish and flick.
221000	234000	So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?
234000	238000	Well, she certainly seems invested in the belief that she is not a bigot.
238000	240000	What vice do you most despise?
240000	241000	Bigotry.
241000	243000	In looking over Joanne's tweets,
243000	247000	I don't think the average person would see any problem with what she's said.
247000	250000	However, I mean, not to be condescending,
250000	256000	but I feel like the average person's understanding of transgender is still a little bit...
256000	259000	I don't really get the whole trans thing.
259000	264000	Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?
264000	265000	I don't know, Amber.
265000	267000	Why don't you be a feminine man?
267000	269000	Who knows? You could be missing out.
269000	272000	So we're going to go through the things that Joanne has said about trans people,
272000	276000	but I don't want this to be just a drama video or a video saying,
276000	279000	cancel Harry Potter, drag her.
279000	283000	Like, I want to try to do something a little bit more meaningful than that.
283000	287000	So I'm going to use J.K. Rowe as a case study in bigotry
287000	292000	and see if we can maybe learn something about what bigotry is.
292000	293000	How does it work?
293000	296000	And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?
296000	299000	And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,
299000	303000	well, for once I think I'll actually have earned my Patreon budget.
303000	307000	So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,
307000	311000	let's spill some shade, throw some tea.
311000	315000	So this all started in 2018 when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet
315000	318000	and followed an anti-trans account.
318000	321000	Now, in the interest of giving Joanne as much benefit of the doubt as I can,
321000	325000	I'm not going to admit this as evidence because I don't want to do guilt by association.
325000	327000	Strike it from the record.
327000	331000	That was fun. I like hammering things.
331000	335000	The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag,
335000	339000	I stand with Maya, referencing Maya Forstater.
339000	342000	Maya Forstater is an English consultant who lost her contract
342000	346000	with the nonprofit she worked for after she did transphobic tweets.
346000	349000	And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us
349000	353000	in her thread titled, allegedly transphobic tweets.
353000	357000	Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.
357000	359000	Yes, I think that male people are not women.
359000	364000	I don't think that being a woman or female is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.
364000	365000	It is biology.
365000	369000	Another says, some people believe that a person with a penis can be a woman.
369000	371000	Some, a majority, don't.
371000	374000	Neither group should be discriminated against in everyday life.
374000	378000	But in situations involving taking your clothes off for strangers,
378000	380000	integration of the two groups is not possible.
380000	383000	And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,
383000	387000	burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women and saying,
387000	390000	it's all right, it's a woman's penis.
390000	393000	So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.
393000	395000	Everyone born female is a woman.
395000	397000	Everyone born male is a man.
397000	399000	Trans women are predators who prey on women.
399000	402000	And I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.
402000	404000	Is this what you want, Joanne?
404000	407000	You want to put the sorting hat on humanity and divide us up into little houses?
407000	410000	Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor trapped in a half above his body?
410000	413000	What then, Joanne? What then?
413000	416000	Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?
416000	420000	Well, if the tweet simply said, I stand with Maya without further explanation,
420000	422000	you could give her the benefit of the doubt.
422000	426000	Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job for having bigoted opinions,
426000	428000	even if she disagrees with those opinions.
428000	433000	But if that's all she was saying, I wouldn't be making this video, would I?
433000	434000	The full tweet reads,
446000	457000	Now I'm guessing that to most people, this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.
457000	463000	It might even seem supportive of trans people since she said we're allowed to dress however we want
463000	466000	and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.
466000	469000	But there's a couple things about this that don't say it right with me.
469000	475000	First is the phrase, force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.
475000	481000	Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint, namely,
482000	485000	I believe that it is impossible to change your sex or to lose your sex.
485000	490000	Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men, no change of clothes or hairstyle,
490000	496000	no plastic surgery, no accidental illness, no course of hormones, no force of will or social conditioning,
496000	501000	no declaration, can turn a female person into a male or a male person into a female.
501000	506000	If Joanne had said Maya had been fired for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman
506000	511000	and a person born female could never be a man, that would have been more accurate.
511000	515000	But it would also sound contentious and obviously anti-trans.
515000	522000	Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present Maya Forstetter's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,
522000	527000	basic common sense, which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.
527000	533000	Transphobes love to play this game where they pretend that trans people just don't understand basic biology,
533000	538000	that's our problem, as if I didn't start taking female hormones because I'm acutely aware
538000	542000	that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body, that sex is real.
549000	551000	Really? That's crazy.
551000	553000	How'd you learn so much about science?
553000	556000	You know, I don't really feel the need to have a second X chromosome.
556000	558000	I get by with one. I make it work.
558000	562000	I actually like the Y chromosome. I think it's a little more dainty, you know,
562000	565000	it's a little softer, a little more petite.
565000	568000	The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages, don't you think?
568000	571000	And I don't need any more of those, thanks.
571000	574000	No trans person thinks it's possible to change chromosomal sex
574000	577000	and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.
577000	580000	When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,
580000	583000	we're talking about psychological and social identity.
583000	589000	So when transphobes say sex is real, they're not actually contradicting anything most trans people believe,
589000	591000	except by implication.
591000	597000	When transphobes say sex is real, what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.
597000	600000	They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,
600000	607000	which they trivialize, calling it dressing up, fashion choices, whatever you want to call yourself.
607000	612000	When Joanne says, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.
612000	618000	She's belittling what it actually means to be trans, reducing it to a change of name and costume.
618000	620000	It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.
620000	624000	For example, the homophobic equivalent of Joanne's tweet might read,
624000	626000	Choose whatever lifestyle you want.
626000	632000	Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult in the privacy of your own bedroom.
632000	638000	But force Christians out of their jobs for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?
638000	640000	Hashtag, I stand with Kim Davis.
640000	644000	A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.
644000	647000	Checkmate the gays, it's just science.
647000	650000	Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.
650000	657000	They refer to it as sexual preferences, or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.
657000	662000	We don't tell straight people to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.
662000	664000	Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.
664000	668000	Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.
668000	670000	It's also who you love.
670000	673000	It's part of who you are, part of your humanity.
673000	676000	And that's something that stays with you outside of the bedroom.
677000	681000	So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.
681000	686000	Likewise, being trans is not a costume I take off at the end of the night.
686000	688000	It's not a fashion choice.
688000	691000	It's not a pet name some people call me.
691000	694000	It's part of who I am as a person, you know?
694000	696000	It's part of my humanity.
696000	699000	And it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.
699000	705000	So telling trans people to dress however you want is not really a supportive statement.
705000	711000	Unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks in their videos apologizing for being racist,
711000	715000	which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.
715000	720000	YouTubers are constantly dragging each other because we see ourselves reflected in the other,
720000	722000	and we can't stand the sight of it.
722000	727000	So after the Mayan forest daughter tweet, Joanne was silent about trans people for six months.
727000	730000	But she took up the cause again in June 2019,
730000	739000	for us to complain about the use of the phrase people who menstruate in the title of an article trying to include trans men and non-binary people in a discussion of period poverty.
739000	748000	That same night, presumably in response to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers who think Stalin did nothing wrong but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,
748000	752000	Joanne tweeted a thread, again repeating this slogan that sex is real, adding,
755000	758000	and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.
759000	765000	I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them.
765000	770000	I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.
770000	775000	If you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans?
775000	776000	If?
776000	780000	Widespread discrimination against trans people is well documented.
780000	788000	In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet, the Trump administration removed non-discrimination protections for trans people in health care and health insurance.
788000	791000	So are you marching with us or not Joanne?
791000	795000	There's a lot of stuff in these tweets that might seem innocent enough to the average person,
795000	800000	but which to someone who understands bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.
800000	806000	Bigotry always has a history, and in order to understand bigotry, you have to learn that history.
806000	814000	Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes, narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing, we have to learn them.
814000	820000	No one is born thinking that the gays are destroying the family, or that women are naturally subservient,
820000	823000	or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.
823000	828000	So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices, you might not notice anything wrong with them.
828000	830000	He never said he hated the Jews.
830000	837000	He is simply concerned about the over-representation of Jewish people in media and banking.
837000	845000	But if you're aware, woke if you will, then it kind of rings alarm bells when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.
845000	853000	When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people think sex isn't real, and they're erasing same-sex attraction, and they're silencing women,
853000	858000	alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these as familiar transphobic talking points.
858000	861000	Specifically, TERF talking points.
861000	864000	TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.
864000	868000	God, are we still talking about this? I promise, this is the last time.
868000	875000	So TERFism is a hate movement that disguises transphobia as feminism.
875000	877000	Bigotry has a history.
877000	882000	The foundational TERF text is feminist professor Janice Raymond's 1979 book,
882000	886000	The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the S*** Male,
886000	888000	in which Raymond argues that, quote,
888000	896000	all transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.
896000	900000	She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy, who, quote,
900000	903000	merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women.
903000	906000	This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,
907000	915000	and I bring this up because I want to give you a sense of how this kind of transphobe talks when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.
924000	929000	If you keep calling me Nathan, I'm going to call you Nigel.
929000	932000	Cheerio, old chap.
932000	934000	Or whatever you people say.
934000	936000	Here's the thing, Nigella.
936000	938000	Bigotry can be mean, yes.
938000	942000	And it usually is when bigots think they can get away with it.
942000	947000	But it's vital to recognize that being mean is not the essence of bigotry.
947000	949000	Bigotry can be hateful, yes.
949000	955000	But specifically, bigotry is hate that poses a political threat to the target group.
955000	959000	The fundamental problem with TERFs is not that they're mean.
959000	962000	It's that they're politically reactionary.
962000	965000	They want to reverse the progress of trans liberation.
965000	971000	In the final chapter of the transsexual empire, Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question, quote,
992000	1013000	She goes on to argue for alternative feminist consciousness raising therapies, admitting,
1013000	1018000	I am not so naive as to think that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,
1018000	1024000	but they would at least pose the existence of a real alternative to be explored and tried.
1024000	1033000	So like homophobes, TERFs have historically advocated a kind of conversion therapy aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.
1033000	1042000	And like the anti-abortion movement, they recognize it's not yet politically practical to completely make illegal a medical procedure they don't like.
1042000	1046000	So they settle for making it as difficult as possible to get one.
1046000	1053000	In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report to the Department of Health and Human Services repeating her arguments against transsexualism,
1053000	1059000	which was cited as a 1981 decision that Medicare would not cover transition-related healthcare.
1059000	1062000	That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.
1062000	1065000	So there's real political consequences to bigotry.
1065000	1067000	It's not just a matter of being mean.
1067000	1070000	Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.
1071000	1083000	Unlike Janice Raymond, J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced and very intent on convincing all of us that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally who loves and supports trans people,
1083000	1087000	while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.
1087000	1089000	She's constantly saying things like,
1089000	1091000	I know and love trans people,
1091000	1098000	but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans at the same time.
1098000	1102000	None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.
1102000	1108000	On the contrary, many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.
1108000	1111000	A lot of people have a hard time noticing this kind of bigotry,
1111000	1116000	and I think one reason for that is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.
1116000	1121000	People think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual,
1121000	1124000	which is, of course, a horrible thing to do.
1124000	1126000	I don't care for the English.
1126000	1128000	There's sick, sick people.
1128000	1133000	Or people think of bigotry as hate, something inhuman and monstrous.
1133000	1138000	So when people hear the word bigot, they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,
1138000	1142000	some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.
1142000	1146000	But the problem with the Nazis was not that they hated love and friendship.
1146000	1154000	They believed they were defending German blood and soil against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.
1154000	1160000	And what were we supposed to do? Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?
1160000	1162000	That's how Nazi actually thinks, right?
1162000	1164000	It's not that they hate friendship.
1164000	1169000	No, they have their own internal logic of victimization and self-righteousness.
1169000	1173000	So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,
1173000	1177000	you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.
1177000	1181000	You know, sometimes people criticize me for empathizing with bigots.
1181000	1188000	But I believe that understanding bigots is the best defense against becoming one yourself.
1188000	1195000	Because when you dehumanize the villains, you become unable to recognize the villain within.
1195000	1197000	How is she, though?
1197000	1199000	She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.
1199000	1202000	Metal straw because I love the environment. I'm so good.
1202000	1204000	I'm really fucking good.
1204000	1210000	The idea that bigotry is simply hate, I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.
1210000	1215000	The idea that bigots are people who outright say, we hate you, God hates you.
1215000	1219000	And we're all marching around with signs about how much we hate you.
1219000	1222000	Like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.
1222000	1225000	Taylor Swift. Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.
1225000	1230000	Well, I don't. I don't want to be a gay icon. I'm just stuck with you people.
1230000	1231000	Just kidding.
1231000	1234000	Shade never made anybody less gay.
1234000	1236000	This isn't shade, Taylor.
1236000	1238000	Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,
1238000	1242000	sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.
1242000	1245000	Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.
1245000	1250000	And the video for You Need to Calm Down is just so emblematic of this misconception.
1250000	1256000	Taylor takes this subject of homophobia and turns it into yet another song about haters.
1256000	1263000	But in the real world, Backwoods hillbillies stomping around with misspelled signs are not really the problem.
1264000	1268000	The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated and powerful people.
1268000	1272000	And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes who say it's an abomination.
1272000	1277000	These perverts are spreading AIDS. They're destroying the family. They're recruiting children.
1277000	1282000	But these days, it's much more common to hear, of course, I love gay people.
1282000	1285000	Some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction,
1285000	1291000	but it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology promoted in schools
1291000	1293000	to children as young as three years old.
1293000	1296000	Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.
1296000	1299000	And we get convincing homophobe, don't I?
1299000	1302000	There's really two different styles of bigotry.
1302000	1306000	They express the same prejudice, but they're very different in tone.
1306000	1310000	I'll call the two styles direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.
1310000	1313000	Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.
1313000	1317000	It's a bigotry manifested in slurs and outright discrimination
1317000	1322000	and demonizing the target group and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.
1322000	1330000	Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate about a host of proxy issues.
1330000	1333000	It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.
1333000	1337000	Frequently, the claim is that a once-needed liberation movement has now gone too far,
1337000	1342000	but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors who are disturbing law and order
1342000	1344000	with violent and chaotic protests,
1344000	1348000	who are victimizing and silencing innocent people by calling them bigots,
1348000	1354000	who are infiltrating the media and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment with politically correct propaganda.
1354000	1358000	And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated to speak out against it
1358000	1362000	because cancel culture is out of control and free speech is under attack.
1362000	1365000	The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,
1365000	1370000	ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders, rapists,
1370000	1374000	brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.
1374000	1379000	Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,
1379000	1384000	always a knight in shining armor, defending women, defending the children, defending marriage,
1384000	1390000	defending freedom, defending the family, defending our values, defending common sense, defending tradition,
1390000	1396000	defending civilization itself, defending God.
1396000	1398000	He's all-powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.
1398000	1402000	I think a lot of people take a borderline heroic view of themselves.
1402000	1406000	An indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.
1406000	1412000	Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets with some big abstract concept.
1412000	1417000	Instead of Jewish people, they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.
1417000	1422000	Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis or the friend zone.
1422000	1425000	Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.
1426000	1432000	Trans people become transgenderism, gender ideology, trans activists.
1432000	1436000	What they're really against is equality, but they don't say that.
1436000	1439000	In fact, they may not even think it.
1439000	1445000	But they tell on themselves when they react with instinctive hostility to anyone who agitates for change.
1445000	1452000	It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.
1452000	1458000	A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices by Elizabeth Young Broul really helped me with this video.
1458000	1463000	One of the points she makes is that a lot of the time bigotry is backlash.
1463000	1469000	Ideologies of desire are, generally, backlashes against movements of equality.
1469000	1475000	They are regressive prejudices that reinstate inequalities and distinctions
1475000	1482000	when the force of movements for equality has been registered and, often unconsciously, rejected.
1482000	1485000	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1485000	1490000	Bigotry is not just the psychological state of hating a group of people.
1490000	1492000	Bigotry is political.
1492000	1500000	It's a reaction to changing demographics or to liberation movements or to changing power relations between groups.
1500000	1506000	A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women in the literal psychological sense.
1506000	1513000	It's more that they feel threatened by the prospect of the social and political equality of women.
1513000	1522000	In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry, much more so than feeling hateful.
1522000	1528000	So bigotry is reactive, and it changes along with the circumstances it's a reaction to.
1529000	1534000	1950s misogyny still has some things in common with 2020s misogyny.
1534000	1540000	For example, a lot of men still feel some need to control women's sexuality and women's bodies.
1540000	1545000	But it's also changed a lot as gender relations have shifted in the last 70 years.
1545000	1551000	The idea that women are naturally suited to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent than it used to be.
1551000	1556000	And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder because, in the last decade,
1556000	1559000	transliberation has increased our visibility.
1559000	1561000	People are running into us at work now.
1561000	1563000	They're having to use our pronouns.
1563000	1571000	They're seeing us in politics or in media, and not just as laughing stocks or monsters like we used to be, but as actual characters.
1571000	1574000	And a lot of people are not very happy about it.
1574000	1576000	They feel threatened.
1576000	1579000	That must be super fucking hard for you.
1579000	1583000	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1583000	1589000	So J.K. Rowling frames her position as, I am just saying the fact that sex is real.
1589000	1591000	It's not hateful to say a fact.
1591000	1594000	Why is everyone so mad at me?
1594000	1596000	A fact can't be bigoted.
1596000	1600000	And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted.
1600000	1604000	But a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.
1604000	1609000	Usually when we discuss facts, we're using those facts to tell a story.
1610000	1614000	And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.
1614000	1621000	You know, suppose someone tweets the fact that the homicide rate is higher for black Americans than white Americans.
1621000	1626000	I'm going to ask, what story are you trying to tell with this fact?
1626000	1629000	What political goal are you trying to support?
1629000	1638000	One way indirect bigotry works is by camouflaging political struggles as intellectual debates.
1638000	1646000	When Joanne says sex is real, she sounds like she's staking out a position in the trans debate,
1646000	1651000	which is then presented as an intellectual conflict about the metaphysics of gender,
1651000	1658000	instead of what it really is, which is a political conflict about the social equality of transgender people.
1658000	1664000	And the effectiveness of that strategy is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan of this slogan,
1664000	1666000	trans women are women.
1666000	1672000	And this is just my opinion. I don't speak for any other trans people, but there's a couple things I don't like about it.
1672000	1677000	One is trans men and non-binary people matter just as much as trans women.
1677000	1680000	What you don't as often hear, trans men are men.
1680000	1684000	Or non-binary people are...
1684000	1687000	valid?
1687000	1689000	Doesn't really work, does it?
1689000	1694000	Another problem with trans women are women is it tends to invite the response.
1694000	1696000	Well, what does it even mean to be a woman?
1696000	1698000	Define womanhood.
1698000	1705000	And now, you're immediately getting baited into some bullshit semantic debate about what is a real woman.
1705000	1708000	A real woman. How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?
1708000	1713000	What if you're in The Matrix right now, and in the real world, you're biologically male?
1713000	1714000	The tables are turned.
1714000	1716000	It doesn't really matter, does it?
1716000	1720000	That's it. This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.
1720000	1727000	You know, I've been down this road too many times already, and I always end up having these dead-end conversations about gender performativity,
1727000	1731000	or worse, conversations about what it means to feel like a woman.
1731000	1733000	Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.
1733000	1740000	I don't think anyone feels like a woman honestly, except a certain subgenre of gay men, and possibly Shania Twain.
1740000	1744000	Probably not even her anymore, honestly. Not since the early 2000s.
1744000	1749000	You know, some questions should be dissolved rather than solved. That's what Wittgenstein said.
1749000	1751000	That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.
1751000	1756000	Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to realize you're asking the wrong question.
1756000	1759000	How do I know I'm a woman? Well, look at me.
1762000	1764000	I rest my case.
1765000	1768000	The monitor's over here. That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.
1768000	1771000	I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.
1771000	1774000	Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves what gender is.
1774000	1780000	In fact, if you even try to answer the question, you end up enraging some part of the community who feels excluded.
1780000	1784000	So no, trans people are not trying to force an ideology on people.
1784000	1787000	We don't even share an ideology within our own community.
1787000	1793000	What we share are a common set of political struggles against discrimination, against harassment,
1793000	1798000	against excessive medical gatekeeping, against exclusion from public life.
1799000	1803000	So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?
1803000	1806000	Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people,
1806000	1812000	and something that evades pointless philosophizing about biology,
1812000	1817000	and what is gender, and who is true trans, and what is a woman really?
1817000	1819000	Something that centers what actually matters,
1819000	1827000	which is freeing trans people from the stigma and discrimination that have historically prevented us from becoming equal members of society.
1827000	1833000	So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s, but I personally like this slogan,
1833000	1835000	trans liberation now.
1835000	1839000	It's short, it's sweet, and instead of prompting define womanhood,
1839000	1842000	it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?
1842000	1844000	Liberation from what?
1844000	1847000	And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.
1847000	1851000	And now you're talking about politics instead of talking about semantics.
1851000	1852000	Isn't that better?
1852000	1857000	I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed with reassuring ourselves that we are valid
1857000	1864000	that we sometimes forget that the end goal of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.
1864000	1866000	That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.
1866000	1870000	So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,
1870000	1873000	which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?
1873000	1874000	Well, maybe I care a little bit.
1874000	1880000	But instead, why don't we ask, is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?
1880000	1883000	Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?
1883000	1887000	Isn't it so much better to have a concrete political project in front of you
1887000	1891000	instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?
1891000	1897000	Trans people are a population of people who have a right to equality and to freedom from discrimination.
1897000	1901000	We are not an ideology that's up for debate.
1901000	1904000	But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.
1904000	1907000	Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,
1907000	1911000	but as an ideology that she disagrees with.
1911000	1914000	I'm just saying that sex is real.
1914000	1916000	Is that all you're saying, Joanne?
1930000	1934000	Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire in the prefix bathroom?
1934000	1936000	Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?
1936000	1938000	I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.
1938000	1940000	This bath is actually really nice.
1940000	1944000	It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil, epsom salts,
1944000	1947000	just kind of everything that's good in baths altogether.
1947000	1949000	I don't want to talk about bigotry.
1949000	1951000	I want to talk about baths.
1951000	1954000	Can this just be a video about baths from now on?
1954000	1956000	Oh, fine. I'll do my job.
1956000	1959000	On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,
1959000	1962000	which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,
1962000	1965000	which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC
1965000	1968000	for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.
1968000	1970000	The essay is several pages long
1970000	1974000	and outlines her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.
1986000	1988000	Where do I even begin with this one?
1988000	1991000	Well, let's pick some highlights.
1993000	1996000	Woman is not an idea in a man's head.
1996000	2000000	Woman is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choo's
2000000	2005000	or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive.
2005000	2008000	Oh, well, my mistake.
2008000	2010000	Here I was thinking I was a woman.
2010000	2012000	Turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.
2012000	2014000	What a whimsical misunderstanding.
2014000	2016000	Okay, well, that's it everyone.
2016000	2017000	The channel's over.
2017000	2019000	Thanks for the likes and comments.
2019000	2021000	I'm going to head out now to the Jimmy Choo store
2022000	2025000	and then I guess I'll cut my tits off.
2026000	2030000	Joanne! Joanne! This is madness, Joanne.
2030000	2034000	When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms
2034000	2037000	to any man who believes or feels he's a woman
2037000	2040000	and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates
2040000	2044000	may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,
2044000	2049000	then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside.
2049000	2052000	So, look, I understand that some women are anxious
2052000	2054000	about the thought of predators in bathrooms.
2054000	2057000	And believe me, I don't want to share a bathroom with a predator
2057000	2058000	any more than you do.
2058000	2060000	Why are all my rose petals on this one side?
2060000	2062000	Some of them need to come over here.
2062000	2063000	Come here.
2063000	2065000	I've redistributed the petals.
2065000	2067000	Socialist icon.
2067000	2070000	But this talking point that gender change on legal documents
2070000	2072000	will enable predators to enter bathrooms,
2072000	2074000	it doesn't really make sense
2074000	2076000	because gender policing in public bathrooms
2077000	2079000	doesn't involve legal documents.
2079000	2082000	Like, when was the last time you had to present a gender certificate
2082000	2085000	to gain admittance to a public bathroom?
2085000	2087000	This feels like a strangely outdated conversation
2087000	2089000	to be having during pandemic lockdown.
2089000	2091000	Like, imagine using a public bathroom.
2091000	2093000	Imagine being in public.
2093000	2095000	I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,
2095000	2097000	which is about the experiences of butch women.
2097000	2100000	And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,
2100000	2102000	which describes how women's bathrooms
2102000	2104000	tend to operate as an area
2104000	2107000	for the enforcement of gender conformity.
2107000	2109000	The author, Jack Halberstam,
2109000	2111000	who's assigned female at birth and presents masculine,
2111000	2114000	describes routinely having security called on him
2114000	2116000	for using the women's bathroom.
2116000	2119000	Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom
2119000	2121000	is a frequent occurrence in the lives
2121000	2124000	of many androgynous or masculine women.
2124000	2127000	Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders
2127000	2129000	whether the category woman,
2129000	2131000	when used to designate public functions,
2131000	2133000	is completely outmoded.
2133000	2135000	Queer literature is littered with references
2135000	2137000	to The Bathroom Problem,
2137000	2139000	and it would not be an exaggeration
2139000	2142000	to call it a standard feature of the butch narrative.
2142000	2144000	And that's very interesting to me,
2144000	2146000	because as a feminine trans woman,
2146000	2148000	I have not once been questioned
2148000	2150000	or had the authorities called on me
2150000	2152000	in a women's public bathroom
2152000	2154000	in the entire time I've been using them,
2154000	2156000	which is several years now.
2156000	2159000	So when Joanne Roley, a feminine heterosexual woman,
2159000	2161000	calls for more bathroom policing
2161000	2164000	to protect the lesbians or whatever,
2164000	2166000	it just seems ignorant
2166000	2168000	of the way bathroom policing actually works.
2168000	2170000	Like, is she just so famous
2170000	2172000	that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore
2172000	2174000	and she forgot how they work?
2174000	2177000	How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?
2177000	2178000	Ten dollars?
2178000	2181000	Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,
2181000	2183000	not chromosomes,
2183000	2185000	and there's no practical way to change that
2185000	2188000	short of stationing a genital inspector in every stall,
2188000	2191000	you know, just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.
2191000	2196000	That's a very good idea, Joanne.
2196000	2199000	That's very good.
2199000	2203000	Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.
2203000	2205000	They include trans men in their feminism
2205000	2207000	because they were born women.
2207000	2211000	Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists
2211000	2214000	think that trans men are women?
2214000	2217000	Hello, operator. Could you get me a Lennis Morissette?
2217000	2219000	I have a new incident to report.
2219000	2222000	So look, I could keep refuting points made in turf wars,
2222000	2225000	which is basically just a series of common transphobic canards
2225000	2227000	we've all heard a hundred times before,
2227000	2230000	but I want to focus in particular on some passages
2230000	2234000	that I think are very revealing about the psychology of transphobia.
2234000	2236000	What is it about the transgenders
2236000	2238000	that some people feel threatened by?
2238000	2241000	Well, Joanne Roley gives us a lot to work with
2241000	2242000	in answering that question.
2242000	2245000	You know, Joanne being in turf is mostly terrible for trans people,
2245000	2248000	but maybe the silver lining is that
2248000	2250000	the most famous novelist in the world
2250000	2252000	having a public transphobic breakdown
2252000	2255000	is providing a wealth of insight
2255000	2258000	about the interior world of a transphobe.
2258000	2260000	In turf wars, Joanne claims her interest in
2260000	2264000	the trans issue is intensely personal,
2264000	2266000	and she has two reasons why it's personal.
2266000	2269000	The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,
2269000	2271000	she would have been trans.
2271000	2272000	Someone would have trans-ed her.
2272000	2275000	You know, people are being trans to left and right these days.
2275000	2277000	It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.
2277000	2279000	Trans people, we're always on the lookout
2279000	2281000	for the next person we can trans,
2281000	2284000	so all we want to do is trans people.
2284000	2288000	I trans-ed four people this morning before I had breakfast.
2288000	2290000	She thinks that she would have been recruited
2290000	2293000	by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones
2293000	2295000	by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.
2295000	2297000	And in support of this speculation,
2297000	2299000	Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes
2299000	2301000	about social contagion and a, quote,
2301000	2304000	4,400% increase in girls being referred
2304000	2306000	for transitioning treatment.
2306000	2307000	And that sounds pretty alarming, right?
2307000	2309000	4,400%.
2309000	2312000	But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,
2312000	2316000	only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred,
2316000	2320000	and by last year, that number was 1,740,
2320000	2322000	with the biggest increase happening five years ago,
2322000	2325000	you know, the transgender tipping point year.
2325000	2326000	So that is a big increase,
2326000	2328000	but it corresponds to the biggest ever increase
2329000	2332000	in trans visibility, so it does make sense.
2332000	2335000	And there's 11 million children in the UK,
2335000	2338000	so let's say 5.5 million girls,
2338000	2343000	and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.
2343000	2345000	And considering that around 1% of adults
2345000	2347000	are some kind of transgender,
2347000	2352000	0.03% of kids is not really an alarming number to me.
2352000	2355000	If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.
2355000	2357000	But part of Joanne's problem here
2357000	2359000	is that she seems not to really understand
2359000	2361000	what being trans is.
2361000	2363000	The writings of young trans men reveal a group
2363000	2365000	of notably sensitive and clever people.
2365000	2369000	The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,
2369000	2372000	with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,
2372000	2375000	dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm,
2375000	2378000	and self-hatred, the more I've wondered
2378000	2381000	whether if I'd been born 30 years later,
2381000	2383000	I too might have tried to transition.
2383000	2386000	The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.
2386000	2388000	If I'd found community and sympathy online
2388000	2391000	that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,
2391000	2393000	I believe I could have been persuaded
2393000	2396000	to turn myself into the son my father had openly said
2396000	2398000	he'd have preferred.
2398000	2401000	Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness
2401000	2403000	and my ambivalence about being a woman
2403000	2406000	reflected in the work of female writers
2406000	2408000	and musicians who reassured me
2408000	2410000	that in spite of everything,
2410000	2413000	a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.
2413000	2415000	It's fine not to feel pink.
2415000	2418000	Free and compliant inside your own head.
2418000	2420000	It's okay to feel confused, dark,
2420000	2423000	both sexual and non-sexual,
2423000	2426000	unsure of what or who you are.
2426000	2430000	Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here
2430000	2432000	and let's start by making a list
2432000	2435000	of things being a transgender man is not.
2435000	2438000	Having anxiety, having dissociation,
2438000	2440000	having an eating disorder,
2440000	2443000	doing self-harm, doing self-hatred,
2443000	2446000	a viable way to make your sexist father proud,
2446000	2449000	not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,
2449000	2453000	not being compliant, feeling confused,
2453000	2457000	feeling dark, feeling sexual,
2457000	2461000	feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.
2461000	2464000	Okay, so you can be a trans man
2464000	2467000	and experience some or even all of these things,
2467000	2471000	but none of these things are what being a trans man is.
2471000	2474000	Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body
2474000	2477000	and literally live your life as a man
2477000	2479000	is not the same as the typical struggles
2479000	2481000	other girls go through.
2481000	2483000	Joanne is projecting her own memories
2483000	2485000	of troubled adolescents onto trans men
2485000	2486000	and then saying,
2486000	2489000	oh, clearly they were going through the same things I was,
2489000	2492000	just someone persuaded them to transition.
2492000	2494000	It's a limitation of human empathy
2494000	2497000	that sometimes when we're trying to understand
2497000	2499000	what someone else is feeling,
2499000	2503000	the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them.
2503000	2506000	And sometimes that's a misrepresentation.
2506000	2508000	Sometimes other people are experiencing things
2508000	2511000	that we have never experienced.
2512000	2515000	So we have to invent explanations
2515000	2518000	about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.
2518000	2521000	Someone is persuading them to transition.
2521000	2523000	But this fear-mongering about kids
2523000	2525000	being persuaded to transition
2525000	2527000	is just not how things work.
2527000	2529000	From the way transphobes talk about it,
2529000	2531000	you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground
2531000	2532000	picks up a toy truck,
2532000	2535000	an endocrinologist pops out from behind a tree
2535000	2536000	and says,
2536000	2538000	we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.
2538000	2540000	Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.
2541000	2544000	But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,
2544000	2547000	in particular about young transmasculine people.
2547000	2550000	Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out
2550000	2552000	that is essentially to transmasculine people
2552000	2555000	what the transsexual empire was to trans women.
2555000	2557000	It's called Irreversible Damage.
2557000	2561000	The transgender craze seducing our daughters.
2561000	2562000	Chapter one.
2562000	2564000	The contagion.
2564000	2565000	Jesus.
2565000	2567000	Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?
2567000	2570000	The argument is that female to male transgenderism
2570000	2572000	is an infectious social disease,
2572000	2576000	which is literally the argument Hitler made about homosexuality,
2576000	2578000	but okay, great.
2578000	2581000	I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues
2581000	2583000	is that not enough attention is paid
2583000	2586000	to transphobia against trans men.
2586000	2588000	Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,
2588000	2590000	Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,
2590000	2592000	transgender women are women.
2592000	2593000	And that's very nice of him,
2593000	2597000	but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.
2597000	2600000	In fact, she spends more words on trans men
2600000	2601000	than on any other topic.
2601000	2604000	So I think it's worth looking in particular at that.
2604000	2608000	Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men
2608000	2611000	is not the same as transphobia against trans women.
2611000	2612000	There's a lot of similarities,
2612000	2615000	but they're really two different prejudices,
2615000	2617000	and they come from different psychological places
2617000	2619000	in the same way that lesbophobia is different
2619000	2621000	from homophobia against gay men.
2621000	2624000	For trans women, I would say the distinctive experience
2624000	2627000	of transphobia is being simultaneously treated
2627000	2630000	as a pornographic female fetish object
2630000	2634000	and as a dangerous male predator.
2634000	2637000	The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus
2637000	2640000	who will ravish your wife and trap your husband.
2640000	2642000	Your polygamous commune will be devastated.
2642000	2644000	Whereas I feel like transmasculine people
2644000	2648000	are less vilified, but so infantilized.
2648000	2651000	I guess transphobes view trans men as women,
2651000	2654000	so a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,
2654000	2656000	so much for transitioning to escape sexism.
2656000	2661000	The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls
2661000	2663000	can't possibly decide for themselves
2663000	2665000	what to do with their own bodies,
2665000	2667000	so the courts must intervene to take control,
2667000	2669000	which is exactly what just happened in the UK,
2669000	2672000	where trans youth under 16 will now need
2672000	2674000	not only the approval of a doctor,
2674000	2675000	but will need to seek a court order
2675000	2677000	in order to get puberty blockers.
2677000	2679000	And the justification given for this
2679000	2682000	mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns
2682000	2685000	about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls
2685000	2688000	being unable to make informed decisions.
2688000	2690000	In her essay, Joanne says,
2690000	2693000	I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman
2693000	2696000	who's older than I am and wonderful.
2696000	2698000	Although she's open about her past as a gay man,
2698000	2700000	I've always found it hard to think of her
2700000	2702000	as anything other than a woman.
2702000	2704000	Being older, though, she went through
2704000	2707000	a long and rigorous process of evaluation,
2707000	2710000	psychotherapy, and staged transformation.
2710000	2712000	The current explosion of trans activism
2712000	2716000	is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems
2716000	2718000	through which candidates for sex reassignment
2718000	2720000	were once required to pass.
2720000	2721000	So that's what she wants.
2721000	2725000	She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,
2725000	2727000	which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,
2727000	2730000	just Joanne's more polite about it.
2730000	2731000	I wanna make a drink.
2735000	2737000	Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.
2737000	2739000	No, just drank a lot.
2739000	2741000	Ugh, we're revealing leg again.
2741000	2742000	The scandal.
2742000	2745000	Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it
2745000	2748000	is that much more chaste.
2748000	2750000	While I'm an extremely chaste woman,
2750000	2752000	I try to honor God with my body.
2752000	2754000	That's why I got a sex change.
2754000	2757000	I'm honoring God with my sex change.
2757000	2758000	I'm not drunk enough for this.
2758000	2761000	So I also wanna point out that cis men and cis women
2761000	2764000	are often transphobic for different reasons.
2764000	2767000	A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women
2767000	2770000	because the thought that a man can become a woman
2770000	2773000	threatens the certainty of their own manhood.
2773000	2776000	It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men are homophobic.
2776000	2779000	They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.
2779000	2782000	And of course, a lot of straight men are attracted to trans women
2783000	2787000	and they feel that that attraction threatens their identity as straight men.
2787000	2790000	Back in my Comp Hat days when I dated men,
2790000	2792000	for a couple of straight guys I hooked up with,
2792000	2796000	going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.
2796000	2797000	This is it, Mr. Frodo.
2797000	2801000	If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.
2801000	2804000	Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.
2804000	2807000	And afterwards, I go into this whole Cartesian spiral.
2807000	2808000	What have I done?
2808000	2810000	What does this mean?
2810000	2811000	Who am I?
2811000	2813000	I think for a lot of cis women,
2813000	2818000	the very existence of trans men sends them into a similar identity crisis.
2818000	2823000	I think a lot of women have had to fight a really difficult internal battle
2823000	2825000	to make peace with their own womanhood.
2825000	2829000	And for some women, confronting the existence of transgender people
2829000	2832000	seems to open some old wounds.
2832000	2834000	Like I've noticed in particular,
2834000	2837000	that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs
2837000	2841000	are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.
2841000	2845000	And these women see hyper-feminine trans women in makeup and dresses
2845000	2846000	and they say,
2846000	2849000	that is not what being a woman is.
2849000	2853000	I've had to fight for my own identity against the idea
2853000	2855000	that that's what being a woman is.
2855000	2857000	These are just misogynistic stereotypes.
2857000	2859000	You are a parody of womanhood.
2859000	2861000	You're a fetishist.
2861000	2863000	And when they see trans men, they say,
2863000	2864000	you're a traitor.
2864000	2866000	You're a self-loather.
2866000	2870000	Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman the way I've had to?
2870000	2872000	But this is all projection and misunderstanding.
2872000	2876000	Trans women do not think that wearing dresses is what makes us women.
2876000	2881000	And trans men do not think that not feeling a pink frilly and compliant
2881000	2883000	is what makes them men.
2883000	2887000	These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning to trans people's actions
2887000	2890000	in her own brain because she perceives our lives
2890000	2892000	as some kind of commentary on gender
2892000	2896000	with an implied ideology about what it means to be a man or a woman.
2896000	2899000	But that's your interpretation Joanne.
2899000	2902000	That's a meaning that you are imposing on us
2902000	2906000	because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage of your own
2906000	2911000	and it's interfering with your ability to genuinely empathize with trans people.
2911000	2912000	You know, at the end of your essay,
2912000	2917000	you say that you never forget the inner complexity when it comes to trans people.
2917000	2918000	And that's a nice thought,
2918000	2922000	but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people
2922000	2926000	as some kind of like abstract theory of gender
2926000	2929000	or as a projection of your own adolescence,
2929000	2932000	then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals
2932000	2935000	with our own experiences and stories.
2935000	2939000	And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson on trans people,
2939000	2941000	sorry, gender issues,
2941000	2944000	I think it would be good if you listened to the experiences of trans men
2945000	2951000	without, for instance, superimposing your own troubled relationship with your father.
2951000	2954000	I should probably talk about the book
2954000	2957000	since I did go to The Trouble to read all 900 pages
2957000	2960000	because unlike certain other YouTubers,
2960000	2962000	I do in fact know how to read.
2962000	2965000	Troubled Blood was published in September 2020
2965000	2968000	by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.
2968000	2970000	You know, for someone apparently so concerned
2970000	2973000	about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,
2973000	2977000	the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is...
2977000	2978000	it's interesting.
2978000	2980000	It's a choice.
2980000	2981000	God, this thing is huge.
2981000	2983000	It's like the infinite jest of turfery.
2983000	2986000	So Troubled Blood is a detective novel
2986000	2991000	about the simmering heterosexual tension between two investigators.
2991000	2993000	And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?
2993000	2994000	Simmering.
2994000	2997000	There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe
2997000	3000000	and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.
3004000	3007000	Hello, Daniel.
3007000	3009000	I love you, grown-up Harry Potter.
3009000	3011000	Let me show you my love.
3011000	3013000	The only way I know how.
3013000	3026000	Oh!
3026000	3032000	Oh!
3032000	3034000	Is there going to be discourse about this?
3034000	3038000	Look, if it's wrong to have cop-hat feelings about Daniel Radcliffe,
3038000	3040000	I don't want to be right.
3040000	3043000	I will not be shamed for my shameful fantasies.
3043000	3045000	Get out of here, Daniel.
3045000	3047000	This is a final farewell to my heterosexuality.
3047000	3050000	Goodbye, Daniel!
3050000	3053000	And your little arm, too.
3053000	3055000	You stay out of this, Linda.
3058000	3061000	So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,
3061000	3065000	a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman
3065000	3068000	to lull his victims, whom's tea abducts,
3068000	3071000	tortures, rapes, and murders.
3071000	3072000	Interesting.
3072000	3075000	Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,
3075000	3078000	I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.
3078000	3081000	But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,
3081000	3083000	have called this book transphobic.
3083000	3086000	And you might think that's unfair, since the character Dennis Creed,
3086000	3090000	this serial killer, he's not a trans.
3090000	3092000	He's a cross-dresser.
3092000	3094000	This has nothing to do with trans people.
3094000	3096000	Why so triggered, snowflake?
3096000	3097000	Well, precious.
3097000	3100000	There's a couple things I think are worth taking into consideration here.
3100000	3104000	One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer
3104000	3106000	is an old transphobic trope.
3106000	3109000	It's a cliché that goes back decades.
3109000	3113000	And I take great offense to the suggestion that trans women are serial killers
3113000	3117000	because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.
3117000	3122000	The trope seems to originate in 1960 with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
3122000	3123000	That's just my guess, though.
3123000	3124000	I haven't researched this.
3124000	3125000	Who do you think I am?
3125000	3126000	Lindsay Ellis?
3126000	3128000	So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.
3128000	3130000	The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up,
3130000	3134000	where the psychiatrist offers the pseudo-Freudian explanation
3134000	3138000	that Norman cross-dresses because the personality of his dead mother takes over
3138000	3142000	and out of jealousy kills the women Norman is attracted to.
3142000	3148000	Therefore, the psychiatrist explains, Norman is not a real transvestite.
3148000	3150000	You're a fake transvestite, Norman.
3150000	3151000	Trender alert.
3151000	3154000	But I do think that even if Psycho isn't explicitly transphobic,
3154000	3159000	movies can subconsciously implant ideas and feelings into our brains.
3159000	3162000	And I do think it's worth noting that the most famous
3162000	3165000	and most terrifying murder scene in cinema history
3165000	3170000	is if a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.
3170000	3174000	To quote a popular film critic, you might not have noticed it,
3174000	3176000	but your brain did.
3176000	3179000	The cross-dressing psychotrope became explicitly transphobic
3179000	3183000	in the campy 1980s Psycho rip-off Dressed to Kill,
3183000	3186000	in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist
3186000	3191000	who, yes, dresses as a woman to kill women he's attracted to.
3191000	3193000	He was a transsexual.
3193000	3194000	What?
3194000	3195000	A transsexual.
3195000	3198000	You see, there's some men and women, too, think they're born in the wrong body.
3198000	3202000	They're called transsexuals, and all they want to do is have their sex changed.
3202000	3204000	That's all they want to do, the transsexuals.
3204000	3208000	Dressed to Kill also ends with a psychiatric summing up,
3208000	3211000	where the doctor explains that Michael Caine has a case of...
3212000	3214000	Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.
3214000	3218000	But it's the female Michael Caine who kills because, and I quote...
3225000	3228000	There's often a misogynistic trope hiding behind the transphobic one.
3228000	3231000	It's the woman in the man who does the murders.
3231000	3233000	It's the mother's fault.
3233000	3237000	His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.
3237000	3239000	The most mature iteration of this trope,
3240000	3244000	the crown jewel of transphobic movies, is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,
3244000	3246000	which is honestly one of my favorite movies,
3246000	3250000	because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are just radiant in it.
3250000	3253000	And, uh, also, I hate myself.
3253000	3256000	Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,
3256000	3259000	an animal lover and innovative seamstress.
3259000	3261000	Buffalo Bill is a transtrender.
3261000	3262000	A transtrender!
3262000	3265000	Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin
3265000	3268000	because its application for sex reassignment was rejected
3268000	3271000	because, according to Hannibal Lecter...
3271000	3273000	Billy is not a real transsexual.
3273000	3276000	Hannibal Lecter is a true scum.
3276000	3278000	There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,
3278000	3282000	I just want to use this opportunity to reassure my trans audience
3282000	3287000	that even if you've only killed one or two people, you're valid.
3288000	3289000	I entertain myself.
3289000	3292000	That's how I continue to struggle onwards.
3292000	3295000	Billy hates his own identity, you see,
3295000	3297000	and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.
3297000	3301000	But his pathology is a thousand times more savage
3301000	3303000	and more terry-fry.
3303000	3306000	More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?
3306000	3308000	Is that even possible?
3308000	3310000	Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here
3310000	3312000	because the sun is rising.
3312000	3316000	Silence of the Lambs differs from its male-gazy predecessors
3316000	3320000	in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.
3320000	3323000	Clarisse is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,
3323000	3325000	and every man in this movie is a pig,
3325000	3327000	except maybe Hannibal Lecter,
3327000	3329000	the only one who actually respects Clarisse,
3329000	3332000	the only real gentleman with his Goldberg variations
3332000	3334000	in his sketches of the Duomo.
3334000	3337000	Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,
3337000	3339000	even Crawford's kind of a pig.
3339000	3341000	The pigs are pigs, Miggs is pigs,
3341000	3344000	and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3344000	3347000	Dooberschwein is in the original Sherman.
3347000	3349000	The fuck are we talking about?
3349000	3350000	What?
3350000	3352000	And he's obsessed with death's head moths,
3352000	3356000	this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor
3356000	3358000	for gender transformation.
3358000	3361000	I can't believe I finally emerged as a beautiful butterflame.
3361000	3362000	So don't tell Lily.
3362000	3364000	Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people have so many rights
3364000	3366000	that it's okay to make fun of us.
3366000	3367000	There's a lot to work with.
3367000	3369000	So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.
3369000	3372000	I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make a movie
3372000	3375000	or write a book about a transgender serial killer,
3375000	3377000	but there is an issue of representation.
3377000	3380000	You know, for decades there was close to zero
3380000	3383000	good representation of trans people in movies or TV,
3383000	3386000	but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers.
3386000	3389000	And that has an effect on the way people think.
3389000	3392000	When it comes time to debate bathroom bills
3392000	3395000	and people are subconsciously remembering psycho,
3395000	3398000	that has serious consequences for trans people.
3398000	3399000	It's getting so bright in here.
3399000	3401000	The sun has risen.
3402000	3405000	And it's also not psychologically good for us
3405000	3409000	to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures of ourselves in media.
3409000	3411000	Like even as late as my early 20s,
3411000	3413000	I didn't know any trans people,
3413000	3416000	but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.
3416000	3420000	I think the most positive approximation of representation I knew about
3420000	3423000	was like Frankenfurter and Divine.
3423000	3425000	And both of them are also psychotic murderers,
3425000	3428000	just, you know, in a fun way.
3428000	3430000	Should've just gotten her those cha-cha heels.
3430000	3433000	So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,
3433000	3437000	but I guess I felt that it was basically the moral equivalent
3437000	3439000	of being a serial killer.
3439000	3441000	Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.
3441000	3443000	And things have changed in the last 10 years.
3443000	3446000	I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.
3446000	3449000	And there's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me
3449000	3451000	who don't even hate themselves.
3451000	3452000	Can't relate.
3452000	3455000	So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.
3455000	3459000	Joanne has written a book about a serial killer
3459000	3461000	who dresses as a woman to kill women.
3461000	3462000	Groundbreaking.
3462000	3464000	Now this is such a cliche
3465000	3468000	that you'd kind of expect a seasoned writer like J.K. Rowling
3468000	3470000	to subvert it somehow.
3470000	3472000	Give us a remix, turn it on its head.
3472000	3475000	Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.
3475000	3477000	You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.
3477000	3479000	Or at least do something new with it.
3479000	3481000	But she really doesn't.
3481000	3483000	It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.
3483000	3485000	I guess I should read you some passages.
3485000	3486000	I'm reading it on my phone.
3486000	3489000	I'm not bringing the book out and pretending to read on the book.
3489000	3493000	You can see from my little bookmarks that I read the physical book.
3493000	3495000	Yes, I'm a YouTuber.
3495000	3497000	And yes, I read a book.
3497000	3498000	So here's a psychiatrist.
3498000	3500000	There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?
3500000	3503000	Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.
3503000	3505000	He's a classic sociopath, you see.
3505000	3507000	A pure example of the type.
3507000	3510000	He scores very highly on the dark triad.
3510000	3513000	Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy.
3513000	3518000	Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.
3518000	3522000	You see, he's what we in the medical profession call the baddie.
3523000	3527000	It excited me to watch a woman who didn't know she was being observed.
3527000	3530000	I'd do it to my sisters, but I'd creep up to lip windows as well.
3530000	3536000	If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing, adjusting themselves or even a glimpse of nudity.
3536000	3540000	I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects, but by the sense of power.
3540000	3546000	I felt I stole something of their essence from them, taking that which they had thought private and hidden.
3546000	3552000	He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear from neighbors' washing lines, and even from his grandmother, Ina.
3552000	3556000	These he enjoyed wearing in secret, and about extubating in.
3556000	3560000	Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?
3560000	3561000	Oh, how dear readers.
3561000	3566000	So Dennis Creed is characterized as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.
3566000	3571000	And like, okay, there really are men who fetishize women's clothes, for example.
3571000	3573000	I mean, Freud talked about this, right?
3573000	3579000	Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part or an article of clothing.
3579000	3591000	And Freud theorized that finishes emerge from the unconscious trauma that occurs when men discover that women don't have a penis.
3594000	3596000	Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.
3596000	3602000	But considering that Joanne has been doing a lot of gender critical reading over the past few years,
3602000	3612000	it's kind of hard for me to ignore that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women is exactly the way a lot of TERFs characterize trans women.
3612000	3620000	Remember, the whole gender critical feminists with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.
3620000	3622000	These people are bigots.
3622000	3630000	And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs that trans women are hypersexual and hyper aggressive, right?
3630000	3633000	These inherently pornographic sex demons.
3633000	3637000	But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?
3637000	3639000	Are trans women sex demons?
3639000	3640000	Why, yes.
3640000	3641000	Yes, we are.
3641000	3643000	The bigots are simply correct.
3643000	3645000	We're sex demons.
3645000	3647000	You can't even talk to these people.
3647000	3651000	Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?
3651000	3655000	I used to take the bait and argue that, no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.
3655000	3657000	Unless you want me to be.
3657000	3659000	But it's counterproductive to make that argument.
3659000	3660000	Why?
3660000	3667000	Because I'm not involved in human trafficking t-shirt as people asking a lot of questions are already answered by my shirt.
3667000	3674000	So I have a hard time believing that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.
3674000	3685000	And I also want to note that Dennis's cross dressing is described not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,
3685000	3689000	but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.
3689000	3694000	Dennis says, on page 854, so you know I actually read this fucking shit,
3694000	3696000	In a wig, bit of lipstick.
3696000	3699000	They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.
3699000	3701000	You're the nice man who's safe.
3701000	3703000	And earlier he's described as
3703000	3709000	Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner, a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.
3709000	3724000	Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper, and sometimes wearing a wig that, from a distance to a drunk victim, gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.
3724000	3730000	So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination, cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.
3730000	3732000	They mistake him for a woman.
3732000	3734000	Or as, you know.
3734000	3736000	And that causes them to lower their guard.
3736000	3741000	And this reminds me of one of my F4 statters, allegedly transphobic tweets.
3741000	3745000	Pronouns are Rohypnol. Important article by Harry Lektarpi.
3745000	3750000	A.K.A. Vulfomort. She who must not be named.
3750000	3753000	Followed by J.K. Rowling. Because of course.
3753000	3755000	Pronouns are Rohypnol.
3755000	3758000	Rohypnol's roofies. And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.
3758000	3765000	Pronouns are like Rohypnol. They dull your defenses. They change your inhibitions. They're meant to.
3765000	3771000	You've had a lifetime's experience learning to be alert to him and to relax to her. For good reason.
3771000	3774000	These instinctive responses keep you safe.
3774000	3778000	It's not even a conscious thing. It's like the hairs standing on end.
3778000	3784000	Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger that your eyes haven't noticed yet.
3784000	3787000	I want to be alert. I want others to be alert.
3787000	3789000	I want people to see the real picture.
3789000	3798000	And I want those instinctive reactions that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted, undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.
3798000	3803000	I feel like I owe this to myself. And I absolutely owe it to other women.
3803000	3806000	And more than anything, I owe this to girls.
3806000	3812000	I don't want to play even the tiniest part in grooming them to disregard their natural protective instincts.
3812000	3819000	Those instincts are there for a reason. To keep them safe, they need those instincts intact and sharp.
3819000	3827000	And that's why I won't use preferred pronouns. Using Rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.
3827000	3834000	Okay. So, these are the thoughts of someone who's been hurt.
3834000	3843000	Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people is intensely personal.
3864000	3871000	I was born this way. Born is a fucking idiot.
3871000	3876000	I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old. It's kind of an agatha drink.
3876000	3881000	Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch. That's the plot. Pay attention. It makes sense.
3881000	3885000	Also, a martini. What is a martini? Put an excuse to drink a glass of gin.
3885000	3892000	Should probably eat an olive. Or this is going to go straight to my fucking brain.
3892000	3896000	Okay, we have to be serious now. In turf wars, Joanne writes...
3922000	3951000	Okay. So, for Joanne, her traumatic experience being attacked by a man is psychologically related.
3951000	3960000	To her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people and about trans people saying nasty things about her on Twitter.
3960000	3968000	She feels intensely about this issue because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD. In her own words...
3982000	4000000	A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance, a constant alertness to danger. This is described in a very wise book called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Shulman.
4001000	4016000	The traumatized person's sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed. They feel endangered even if there is no actual danger in the present because in the past they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.
4016000	4029000	I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response is a real experience of suffering that is not the victim's fault, even in cases where that response is irrational or politically incorrect.
4029000	4053000	For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager, I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy around black teenagers for a while. However, if that jumpiness motivates you to become a campaigner for more militant policing of black neighborhoods, then you are participating in anti-black racism and that I will criticize regardless of your trauma.
4053000	4069000	I hope it goes without saying that trans people gaining easier access to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020 is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s. This is a non sequitur.
4069000	4085000	So it's a little odd to me that while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma and she's self-aware enough to realize that her hypervigilance is often irrational to the point where she herself finds humor in it.
4085000	4095000	She's somehow not self-aware enough to realize that her fears about trans people are an irrational manifestation of the hypervigilance.
4095000	4107000	And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma and I would be nothing but sympathetic if her feelings about this amounted to simply being triggered by, for example, perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom.
4107000	4121000	Which is something most trans women are sensitive to. Like I've spoken to trans women who are worried they don't pass or who know they don't pass and who do everything they can to avoid using a public bathroom because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.
4121000	4130000	So these trans women go through life every day compromising their own comfort and safety to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.
4130000	4136000	But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope of an automatic trigger response.
4136000	4148000	It's become a fixation for years to the point where she's written a 900 page novel about a serial killer who cross-stresses to trick women into being less vigilant.
4148000	4156000	And now the primary political cause she's decided to use her superstardom to champion is opposition to trans liberation.
4156000	4160000	And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.
4160000	4169000	Like if you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized as a child when your father left your mother for a man, you're still a homophobe, right?
4169000	4173000	You're not less of a bigot because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.
4173000	4176000	In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.
4176000	4179000	Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked.
4179000	4181000	So it's often rooted in trauma.
4181000	4189000	After the collective trauma of 9-11, Americans felt threatened not just by al-Qaeda but by the entire religion of Islam.
4189000	4196000	And this was used and is still being used to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.
4196000	4201000	Feelings of victimization are often used as a justification for aggression.
4201000	4206000	And when the target of that aggression is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.
4206000	4213000	Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.
4213000	4220000	Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy, creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.
4220000	4224000	TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.
4224000	4228000	It's biological women who are the real victims.
4228000	4230000	The real victim.
4230000	4237000	So often in debates on social issues, we're faced with two opposing sides, both claiming to be the victim.
4237000	4242000	And we're often told to believe victims, believe marginalized people.
4242000	4244000	Well, if only it was that easy.
4244000	4250000	So often, the exact point in question is who is the victim and who's the oppressor.
4250000	4257000	That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse, describes the way the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty.
4257000	4262000	In situations ranging from romantic relationships to international affairs.
4262000	4268000	Bullies often conceptualize themselves as being under attack when they are the ones originating the pain.
4268000	4276000	Throughout Joanne's essay, she frequently represents herself as taking a defiant, free, speechy stand against.
4276000	4279000	Accusations and threats from trans activists.
4279000	4283000	The trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating.
4283000	4288000	Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists.
4288000	4294000	And in her subsequent tweets, she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.
4294000	4297000	Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.
4297000	4298000	This witch doesn't burn.
4298000	4300000	This is the new Salem.
4300000	4305000	Women are being attacked online for taking a stand against the transsexuals.
4305000	4306000	This witch doesn't burn.
4306000	4311000	Let's see what else we have for sale at wildwomenworkshop.com.
4312000	4313000	Fuck your pronouns.
4313000	4315000	Trans men are my sisters.
4315000	4317000	Sorry about your dick, bro.
4317000	4318000	That's a good one.
4318000	4319000	I'd wear that.
4319000	4320000	Don't call me sis.
4320000	4324000	Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.
4324000	4325000	Must be really hard for you.
4325000	4326000	Not being a sh**.
4326000	4328000	War is peace.
4328000	4330000	Freedom is slavery.
4330000	4332000	Ignorance is strength.
4332000	4334000	Trans women are women.
4334000	4336000	Got the sense of persecution.
4336000	4338000	This is Orwell's nightmare.
4338000	4340000	This is how Nazi Germany started.
4340000	4344000	First Hitler told the transgenders they were super hecking valid, uwu.
4344000	4346000	Then he burned their books out.
4346000	4347000	Wait.
4347000	4348000	Oh, no.
4348000	4351000	That's actually the opposite of what happened.
4351000	4352000	Slurs.
4352000	4354000	Feminist t-shirt.
4354000	4355000	Nice trilby.
4355000	4356000	It's very dapper.
4356000	4357000	Slurs.
4357000	4358000	Man-hater.
4358000	4359000	Feminazi.
4359000	4360000	Prude.
4360000	4361000	Witch.
4361000	4362000	Bigot.
4362000	4363000	Wait, bigot?
4363000	4365000	Are we reclaiming bigot now?
4365000	4369000	Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?
4370000	4381000	Joanne wrote in her essay that she was standing up in solidarity with women who have histories like mine who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.
4381000	4383000	Slurred as bigots.
4383000	4394000	There's something so revealing about the claim that bigot is a slur because so much of indirect bigotry is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.
4394000	4398000	Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?
4398000	4399000	It's good.
4399000	4400000	It's very clever.
4400000	4404000	A white racist will hardly ever use the phrase white supremacy.
4404000	4407000	No, they say white genocide.
4407000	4409000	Always on the defensive.
4409000	4414000	And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.
4414000	4427000	The same conservative media who ten years ago were portraying lesbians as like angry, man-ish d***s have now created this mythology of lesbians as these virginal damsels in distress.
4427000	4430000	Who are threatened with invasion.
4430000	4432000	And now, extinction.
4432000	4439000	On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists, who are somehow coercing them into becoming men.
4439000	4440000	Elliot, no.
4440000	4445000	You can't possibly be doing this because you're 33 years old and capable of autonomous thought.
4445000	4449000	Clearly, you are tricked by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.
4449000	4455000	And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told, are slurring as bigots.
4456000	4458000	Lesbians who won't sleep with them.
4458000	4459000	Joanne claims that...
4460000	4463000	None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.
4463000	4464000	On the contrary.
4464000	4469000	Many of them become interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.
4469000	4474000	And they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives.
4474000	4484000	But the only gender-critical women she mentions by name are Maya Forstader, who I would not describe as hugely sympathetic to trans adults.
4484000	4488000	And Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says...
4502000	4504000	Okay, so I agree.
4504000	4509000	It would be awful to call someone a bigot just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis.
4509000	4511000	But are you sure?
4511000	4514000	That's why people call Magdalene Burns a bigot?
4514000	4522000	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?
4522000	4526000	You are fucking blackface actors.
4526000	4527000	You aren't women.
4527000	4532000	You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.
4532000	4535000	Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.
4535000	4537000	Our oppression isn't a fetish.
4537000	4540000	You pathetic, sick fuck.
4540000	4542000	Hugely sympathetic.
4542000	4544000	Hugely sympathetic.
4544000	4552000	Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots.
4552000	4560000	And because she constantly frames herself as the victim of terrifying trans activists who say mean things online,
4560000	4570000	I think it's fair for me to mention that this, right here, is how I'm used to being spoken to and spoken about by TERFs.
4570000	4575000	When you're a trans woman online, TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.
4575000	4577000	They deadname and misgender you.
4577000	4578000	They mock your genitals.
4578000	4582000	They describe your surgery results as necrotic and mutilated wounds.
4582000	4589000	They interpret your every feeling and experience as the manifestation of a sick, woman-hating fetish.
4589000	4596000	You know, in an unrelated video last year, I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man.
4596000	4600000	And I've since been told by TERFs, essentially,
4600000	4605000	trans-identified males get sexual kicks from being treated like women.
4605000	4608000	Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.
4608000	4611000	Hugely sympathetic.
4611000	4623000	I hope I don't even need to say that the idea that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it is a violently anti-feminist thought.
4623000	4628000	And it's a thought that could only be believed, and believed in the name of feminism, no less,
4628000	4637000	by people who have spent days and weeks absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda that TERFs exist to promote.
4637000	4641000	Now, I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room with me right now, she'd say,
4641000	4643000	I'm so sorry you've been treated that way.
4643000	4649000	But I, too, have been cruelly victimized online by the trans activists.
4649000	4650000	And you know what?
4650000	4652000	I'm sure that's true.
4652000	4657000	When I listen to Joanne talk about being victimized by trans Twitter,
4657000	4659000	it's easy for me to sympathize.
4659000	4661000	Because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.
4661000	4663000	The vilification.
4663000	4664000	The obsession.
4664000	4666000	The fantasies of violence.
4666000	4673000	It's a pretty common occurrence for me to look at my mentions and see people with trans flag avatars posting things like,
4673000	4674000	Point of view.
4674000	4677000	You are true, scum, and Yoshi is going to beat you to death with a golf club.
4677000	4679000	Hashtag yes, all gamers.
4679000	4686000	Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-Semite because three years ago I made a joke about reptilian overlords.
4686000	4692000	And then they get mad because I said I wanted to understand non-binary people instead of just dogmatically believing things.
4692000	4694000	And they conclude,
4694000	4701000	So basically, fuck ContraPoints, I want to bash her over the goddamn head with a metal bat over and over again.
4701000	4706000	So this is the level of antipathy that I attract from trans Twitter.
4706000	4712000	So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed by abusive messages, I'm inclined to believe her.
4712000	4717000	I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed with anime avatars saying things like,
4717000	4721000	JK Rowling is hypocritical trash who literally walks millions of trans kids dead.
4721000	4725000	Harry Potter was always neoliberal garbage and we should have seen this coming.
4725000	4730000	This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy, she deserves a back end slapped to the face.
4730000	4733000	And tweets like that are abusive.
4733000	4734000	It's not okay.
4734000	4736000	And I don't make any excuses for it.
4736000	4738000	I want to make a dark and stormy.
4738000	4740000	Sorry, I'll be right back.
4740000	4743000	I am back.
4743000	4744000	It's good.
4744000	4748000	So I also think that there really is an element of misogyny to them.
4748000	4751000	I have to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.
4751000	4758000	You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying while holding a tropical drink.
4758000	4760000	This is not possible to deal with this through your face.
4760000	4763000	So I agree there really is an element of misogyny to this.
4763000	4768000	Misogyny is the most universal prejudice and trans people are not immune.
4768000	4773000	Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women regardless of whether their anger is justified.
4773000	4777000	There is a witch hunt in Pulse that's still alive in our culture.
4777000	4784000	To be a famous woman is to constantly have every part of your body and soul subject to endless critique.
4784000	4787000	You know, if you're one pound overweight, they call you a fatty.
4787000	4790000	If you're one pound underweight, they say you have an eating disorder.
4790000	4796000	And if you're exactly the right way, they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.
4796000	4799000	You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.
4799000	4802000	There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.
4803000	4809000	When you're a famous woman, it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters because the haters bring the obsession to you.
4809000	4815000	But it's important to remember that haters are not the same as bigots.
4815000	4825000	Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry unless it's tied to a history of oppression or a backlash against a movement of equality.
4825000	4829000	So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.
4829000	4833000	And no, David Silverman, the word racist is not like the N word.
4833000	4837000	And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.
4837000	4839000	Turf is not a slur.
4839000	4844000	And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse, but it's not a form of oppression.
4844000	4850000	And I say this as someone at this point most known for complaining about cancel culture.
4850000	4852000	Oh god, is this my legacy?
4852000	4857000	A lot of trans people have been very mean, verbally abusive even, to J.K. Rowling.
4857000	4863000	But most people criticizing Joanne, or criticizing me for that matter, might be hurt and angry.
4863000	4865000	But they're not violent.
4865000	4871000	But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,
4871000	4878000	you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing crashing over you all at once.
4878000	4888000	And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent, they become emblematic of the way the whole experience feels.
4888000	4894000	And if you've been the victim of abuse before, the experience can be pretty triggering.
4894000	4899000	So it's just not always as simple as the victim and the abuser.
4899000	4902000	Sometimes victims are also abusers.
4902000	4905000	Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.
4905000	4911000	Sometimes righteously angry people cross a line into abusive excess.
4911000	4914000	And not all abuse comes from a position of power.
4914000	4920000	Why are so many trans people on Twitter so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?
4920000	4928000	Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter as it does to TERFs.
4928000	4934000	People living in unrecovered trauma often behave in very similar ways to the people who traumatize them.
4934000	4941000	Over and over, I have seen traumatized people refuse to hear or engage information that would alter their self-concepts,
4941000	4944000	even in ways that could bring them more happiness and integrity.
4944000	4951000	The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal is rooted in a panic that their fragile self cannot bear interrogation,
4951000	4954000	that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.
4954000	4959000	Perhaps because supremacy in some produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.
4959000	4964000	And of course, many perpetrators were or are victims themselves.
4964000	4967000	A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,
4967000	4972000	and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse at trans people,
4972000	4976000	a vulnerable group who they can mostly get away with hurting.
4976000	4981000	Unlike standing up to powerful men, right, which would be dangerous and difficult.
4981000	4985000	And a lot of trans people have been very horribly treated by men,
4985000	4989000	by TERFs, by strangers on the street, by their own families.
4989000	4991000	And for some of those trans people,
4991000	4996000	canceling celebrities on Twitter is the one kind of power they have.
4996000	5004000	Plus a lot of extremely online trans people really don't have a strong sense of conviction in their own identity,
5004000	5008000	which is why they need constant external validation to prop them up.
5008000	5014000	They need to constantly be told that they're valid, that they really are the gender that they say they are.
5014000	5020000	And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions their fragile self-concept,
5020000	5023000	they lash out, Twitter being their only weapon.
5023000	5029000	You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay that all you're asking, all you want,
5029000	5031000	is empathy and understanding.
5031000	5034000	And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.
5034000	5038000	But trans people also deserve more empathy and understanding than you've given them.
5038000	5043000	Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts that are always raging against you
5043000	5046000	and raging against me for that matter.
5046000	5049000	In between the raging, look at what they're doing.
5049000	5051000	They're begging.
5051000	5053000	Begging for money to pay for healthcare.
5053000	5055000	Begging for money to pay for housing.
5055000	5059000	You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,
5059000	5064000	or pounds, or gringots, or whatever you people have.
5064000	5068000	And trans people are out here literally begging for healthcare.
5068000	5070000	They're begging, Joanne.
5070000	5073000	How powerful could the trans agenda really be?
5073000	5080000	Joanne, you have so much power and influence many, many times more than what I have.
5080000	5084000	And I have much more power and influence than most trans people.
5084000	5088000	You know, I am in a very different situation than most trans people.
5088000	5090000	I have a lot of other things going for me in this world.
5090000	5093000	But a lot of them have nothing.
5093000	5095000	They have nothing, Joanne.
5095000	5099000	And I just think you should take that into consideration
5099000	5105000	next time you decide to speak out about how trans activists are oppressing you.
5105000	5107000	Get it together, gorge.
5107000	5108000	Are you listening to yourself?
5108000	5109000	What are you doing, Joanne?
5109000	5113000	You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life being rejected
5113000	5117000	and humiliated and excluded over and over again.
5117000	5118000	So they're traumatized.
5118000	5124000	They're easily triggered by anything that reminds them of past betrayal and abandonment.
5124000	5127000	Which is something I think you could empathize with.
5127000	5132000	Joanne, you are famous for writing a book about a neglected and abused boy
5132000	5136000	who lives in a closet until he's whisked away to a magical world
5136000	5139000	where he and his freaky friends find acceptance in each other.
5139000	5141000	I remember when I first met you all.
5141000	5144000	Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
5144000	5146000	We stand a bunch of misfits.
5146000	5149000	Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
5149000	5152000	So many trans people have found comfort in this story
5152000	5158000	and an escape from a world that doesn't offer a lot of comfort to trans people.
5158000	5165000	So for you to use your fame and influence to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,
5165000	5168000	it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.
5168000	5170000	And I don't blame them for feeling that way.
5170000	5172000	I feel it too.
5172000	5174000	So Joanne.
5174000	5175000	Jo.
5175000	5176000	Mother.
5176000	5178000	I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.
5178000	5180000	I know how much that sucks.
5180000	5183000	So if you ever want to take me up on it,
5183000	5185000	I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.
5185000	5187000	But otherwise, I think we're done here.
5187000	5191000	As a trans person, I like to believe in the power of human metamorphosis.
5191000	5193000	But I realize that at this point,
5193000	5196000	you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes
5196000	5198000	and constantly trashed by trans people.
5198000	5202000	So it would be pretty difficult to change tracks at this point.
5202000	5204000	You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off
5204000	5206000	and I don't know, Joanne.
5206000	5208000	Maybe you are one in a million.
5208000	5209000	I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban
5209000	5211000	and that shit got me through fifth grade.
5211000	5212000	So who knows?
5212000	5214000	Maybe you have another miracle in you.
5214000	5216000	But I'm too old to believe in magic now.
5216000	5220000	So I'm not going to sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.
5221000	5222000	Okay.
5223000	5224000	I guess that's it.
5227000	5228000	Mischief managed.
5234000	5235000	I think that's it.
5235000	5236000	We'll see you next time.
5236000	5237000	Bye-bye.
5237000	5238000	Bye-bye.
5238000	5239000	Bye-bye.
5264000	5266000	Bye-bye.
5294000	5295000	Bye-bye.
5324000	5326000	Bye-bye.
5354000	5356000	Bye-bye.
5384000	5386000	Bye-bye.
