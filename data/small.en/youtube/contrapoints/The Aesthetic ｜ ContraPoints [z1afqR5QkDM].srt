00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
In color theory, the selection of colors used in the design is called a color scheme.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,840
Analogist color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,640
schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,560
Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounds, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,520
about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,800
This week, we'll be talking about colors.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Colors!

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,760
What the fuck are they?

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,880
Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
It's delicious!

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,480
Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
radiation.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,400
But what about the shadow illusion?

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,560
Same wavelengths, different colors.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,160
Some people say I'm a mandress to as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,320
a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,560
Explain that Professor Butler illusion.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,440
What matters more, the way things are or the way things look?

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:30,160
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um, it's too early for this.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,440
Today my guests are, um, well, who are you people?

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbane, associate professor of women's studies and author of many, many

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,720
books, most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
and Flow.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:02,520
Oh, yes, and, uh, well, you look familiar, who are you?

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic, um, well, here's a good one.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for transgender?

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
What do you think Annabelle?

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,120
Well Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
of speech.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,280
For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
costume wig.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,240
Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,480
pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.

36
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,080
But perhaps you disagree, sir.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
That's a human rights violation.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
I'll smash your fucking face.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,080
And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,680
smokescreen for male violence against women.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,280
it's becoming mandatory, and every day, the centers are being silenced, and something

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,080
must be done about the encroaching trans agenda, taking away women's rights, invading women's

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,560
spaces, depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard to do.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,280
I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
Gender's just like color.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,000
Some people see yellow, some people see blue.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,680
It's all a matter of opinion, or is it?

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Let's hear the real tea.

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Tabby.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Sweetie baby.

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Princess.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
I feel ridiculous in this dress.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,480
Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I think I'm gonna take the dress off.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Well don't do that.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
I'm trying to help you out girl.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,680
If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm gonna take it off.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,280
But don't leave, you can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm gonna go behind the curtain.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
I like looking at naked people.

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Why do you always hit on me?

64
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
I thought you were into men.

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,280
Well I swing both ways.

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
I like boy dick and girl dick.

67
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
That's not how that works.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I hate that.

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
The heart wants what it wants.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Why did you invite me over here anyway?

71
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,880
I saw what happened to you on the freedom report and girl.

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Girl.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,480
You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.

74
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,880
You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?

75
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Pfft no.

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Morally wrong.

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
What does that even mean?

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
It was much worse than morally wrong.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
It was aesthetically wrong.

80
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,880
It was unfeminine.

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
This is all you ever say to me.

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
It's bad optics.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
It's bad aesthetics.

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Well does reality matter at all to you?

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Cause the reality is I am a woman.

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one.

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
But the way things look isn't all that matters.

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Tabby, this is politics.

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?

90
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Reality plays no role in politics.

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Politics is aesthetics.

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Politics is aesthetics?

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
That's literally what fascism is.

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Have you even read Benjamin?

95
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
The military parades, the pageantry,

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
and communism responds by politicizing art.

98
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
This is what I can't stand about communists.

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
You want to turn art into propaganda.

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Well art is already ideology.

101
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Ah, look, instead of ruining art,

102
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
with pageantry of our own?

104
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
And you know who's going to make that happen?

105
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Who?

106
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Well funded trans women.

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Patreon's in the description.

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Ew.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Stop that.

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
What?

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
by strategically leveraging my content creator

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
promotional media brand analytics.

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Is that so wrong?

115
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
You're so bougie.

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Revolutionary philosophers.

118
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Look, the point I'm trying to make

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
is that the world we live in is not a philosophical world.

121
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Think about Instagram.

122
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,280
It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?

124
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
No one sees that.

125
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
They only see the show you're putting on.

126
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Okay, but life is not a show.

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Hmm, politics is a show.

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Look around you, Tabby.

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Try to understand what's happening to the world.

130
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,280
The president of the United States is a reality TV star.

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.

132
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle.

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
And it's important to know what you're in.

134
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.

135
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
It's Rome.

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
And your problem is you think you're in the Forum

137
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
when you're really in the circus.

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.

139
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Now you're against reason, too?

140
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm not against reason.

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
If you're a man.

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
And what if you're a woman?

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Oh, don't be a woman.

145
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
That's not a good idea.

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Ow.

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Do you remember that debate between Blair White

148
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
and that YouTuber with the pink wig?

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
What was her name?

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
I don't know.

151
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
She was relevant back in 2017.

152
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Anyway, this was before she transitioned.

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
And in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes.

154
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
And the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig

155
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
not looking at the camera.

156
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I vaguely remember.

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.

158
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad.

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
It was embarrassing to watch.

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Not really.

161
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
I mean, she was right.

162
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
And her arguments were better.

163
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Ah, Tabby.

164
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.

165
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Arguments don't matter.

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
How pretty you are matters.

167
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Is this really where you're going with this?

168
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
sooner or later you're going to need to take the trans girl black pill.

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Oh, boy.

171
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
If you're a trans woman in the public eye,

172
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
what matters is one thing and one thing only.

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
And it's always been the thing that matters.

174
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
What?

175
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
The realness.

176
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Verisimilitude.

177
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
You have to look like a fucking woman.

178
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
There it is.

179
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
There it is is right.

180
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
We don't say it in public,

181
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
but we all know it and we all feel it.

182
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
What does it even mean to look like a woman?

183
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.

184
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm trying to have a real conversation here.

185
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
We all know what it means.

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
I don't know what it means.

187
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Women have a lot of different looks.

188
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
There are bald women, bearded women,

189
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
muscular women, wide-shouldered women.

190
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
And what is society's opinion

191
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?

192
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?

193
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
The dress is the last of my concerns.

194
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I mean, where do I even start with this?

195
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
You're wearing combat boots.

196
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
You cannot be wearing combat boots.

197
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Why not?

198
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
A lot of cis women wear them.

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Cis women?

200
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Fully clockable.

202
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
So you want me to look like a woman

203
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
without imitating cis women?

204
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Yes.

205
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Do not, under any circumstances,

206
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
imitate cis women.

207
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
They have no idea what they're doing.

208
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Well, where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?

209
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
And where does that come from?

210
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Poets.

211
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Teenage gay boys on Instagram?

212
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
The only people with any coherent vision

213
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
of contemporary womanhood.

214
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
That's insanity.

215
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Is it?

216
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Tabby, look at my face.

217
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Look at this highlight.

218
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Does that look like the product of insanity to you?

219
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I mean, yeah, kind of.

220
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?

221
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Good banter.

222
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Well done.

223
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
But trans women have to overdo it.

224
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
You need to be so good at makeup

225
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.

226
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,280
You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.

227
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
You need to smile even at people who hate you.

228
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.

229
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,280
You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.

230
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Your hands are not tools.

231
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,280
They are ornaments at the ends of your arms.

232
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.

233
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Literally a man's idea of a woman.

234
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Well, men have the power, men make the rules,

235
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,280
and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood.

236
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,280
So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.

237
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform

238
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.

239
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Not stereotypes.

240
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Performances.

241
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?

242
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Gender is performance.

243
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.

244
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Womenhood is not what you are, it's what you do.

245
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,280
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.

246
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,280
So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.

247
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.

248
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.

249
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I mean performance in the sense of everything you do,

250
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,280
the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.

251
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
And authentic performance is just a habitual performance,

252
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
and nothing more than that.

253
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?

254
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?

255
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.

256
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
You fake it till you make it.

257
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,280
So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.

258
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
That's what any woman is.

259
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
What about gender non-conforming cis women?

260
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
They're not doing womanhood in that way.

261
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.

262
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,280
They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.

263
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
You don't want to end up like that, do you?

264
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,

265
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
talks like a woman, takes female hormones,

266
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
is gendered female by other people,

267
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,280
and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,

268
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,280
that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?

269
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Yep, that's absurd.

270
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,280
But it's absurd because the example is absurd.

271
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
No cis man would do that.

272
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,280
It's like asking is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men.

273
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Like, yeah, pretty much.

274
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,280
See, this is a philosophy at its worst, pointless speculative fiction.

275
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,280
And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,

276
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,280
which is you getting rid of those combat boots.

277
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I thought we were talking about philosophy.

278
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
No, we're talking about shoes.

279
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?

280
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,280
You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.

281
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,280
The left will abide a regal queer.

282
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.

283
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,280
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,

284
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?

285
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
What matters is that we identify as women.

286
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
We can express that identity in different ways,

287
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.

288
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.

289
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Without action and without social recognition,

290
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
the identity is meaningless.

291
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,

292
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,280
then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.

293
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Because unless you're living womanhood,

294
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
the identity is literally that meaningless.

295
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.

296
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl.

297
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm trying to talk about what's really true.

298
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I didn't say it was insensitive.

299
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I said it was unfair.

300
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality

301
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
that implies a potential to live your inner truth.

302
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter.

303
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
It's just a troll example.

304
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
True.

305
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
But even if they were sincere,

306
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,280
there would still be no reality to it because helicopter is not an actual social role.

307
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Whereas, you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,

308
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
but you have to work to get there,

309
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
and ultimately, society has to let you.

310
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
What do you mean?

311
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,

312
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
but if no one recognizes me as a doctor,

313
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?

314
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,280
But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.

315
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
All it takes is being misgendered.

316
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?

317
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Why did you get so angry when that turf called you sir?

318
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Isn't it because in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?

319
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
That's ridiculous.

320
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I am a woman.

321
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
That's my reality.

322
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.

323
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I know you're a woman.

324
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm just saying that in that one moment,

325
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
you effectively had your gender canceled.

326
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.

327
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.

328
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
There's no reasoning your way into it.

329
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
But don't worry about that.

330
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I don't argue I'm a woman.

331
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
I smash.

332
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I know you do, and it's a bad look.

333
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Is this about the shoes again?

334
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Yep.

335
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Here, put these on.

336
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Absolutely not.

337
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm not wearing those.

338
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes, you are, bitch.

339
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
No?

340
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,280
If you put these on, I'll scratch you behind the ears later.

341
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Okay, fine.

342
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Now walk.

343
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Walk.

344
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
That was the worst thing I've ever seen.

345
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Well, you're the one who made me do it.

346
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Look, don't stop around like that.

347
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Keep your shoulders back and steady.

348
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
All the movement comes from your hips.

349
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,280
And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.

350
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Here, I'll show you.

351
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Your turn.

352
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Do it right.

353
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
The category is...

354
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Cat Girls.

355
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Yes, bitch!

356
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
That was flawless.

357
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
It was iconic.

358
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm loving for this.

359
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm loving this for you.

360
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You're doing so good for yourself.

361
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I'm never doing that again.

362
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Why not?

363
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Because it's not who I am.

364
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.

365
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Well, that's not what aesthetics is.

366
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.

367
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,

368
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
but I can be a first-rate tabby.

369
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson

370
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
about the importance of being yourself.

371
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Shut up.

372
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?

373
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
I know I'm not pretty.

374
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
And I know you think you're too good for me

375
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
because you mostly pass.

376
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,280
And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.

377
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry

378
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
and that's weird,

379
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
but I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you,

380
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
because I'm not like anyone but myself,

381
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
and because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us,

382
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
and I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow

383
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
and deep voices,

384
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
the girls even other trans women make fun of,

385
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
and when, in the history of the world,

386
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,280
has anyone but me ever stood up for them.

387
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
That's why everyone knows who tabby is.

388
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?

389
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.

390
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
But so what?

391
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
So mail to anime Twitter stans you.

392
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Big deal.

393
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
You're mad, aren't you?

394
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I'll get over it in a few weeks.

395
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Look, you're right.

396
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
You have to be yourself.

397
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.

398
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,280
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,

399
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
then wear them well and make it work.

400
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.

401
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Sometimes you have to become yourself.

402
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
And for you,

403
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.

404
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
I mean, with the Nazis, it's one thing,

405
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.

406
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else

407
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
were willing to stick up for us.

408
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Your delicate notion of femininity

409
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
is a product of the privilege you share

410
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
with a lot of thin white cis feminists.

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Wow.

412
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
It must be so hard for you out on the streets

413
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
as a fat woman of color.

414
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Shut up.

415
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm just saying,

416
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.

417
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
You could have what I have.

418
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
You just have to work for it

419
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.

420
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
You are raised a white boy.

421
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.

422
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,

423
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
but you still stand on a lot of privilege.

424
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I look at all the photos of trans women

425
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
who are murdered in this country,

426
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
and they don't look like you or me.

427
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Why don't you use your privilege and use your education

428
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
to actually do some good in the world

429
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
instead of this elective, revolutionary larping?

430
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.

431
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,280
to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.

433
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.

434
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
You don't win friends and allies with a bat.

435
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
They're just using you.

436
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Well, who do you think benefits,

437
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
and who do you think gets hurt

438
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
when you go out into the world

439
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
and represent trans women as masculine and violent?

440
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Who do you think benefits

441
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,280
when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?

442
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
I guess we can't win, can we?

443
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?

444
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah, okay.

445
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Forget about the disrespect.

446
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Facts don't care about your feelings.

447
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
It turns out that every chromosome,

448
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body

449
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,280
is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.

450
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
You don't know what you're talking about.

451
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
You're not educated on genetics.

452
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Would you like to discuss the genetics or not?

453
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Well, no, no.

454
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
What are your genetics?

455
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,280
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

456
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.

457
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,280
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

458
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,280
So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,

459
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community,

460
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
which is so frustrating.

461
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

462
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Damage controlling, so frustrating.

463
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

464
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Facts don't care about your feelings.

465
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
So frustrating.

466
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

467
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.

468
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex

469
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
and then talk about you're a very feminine biological man

470
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
and you've had the surgeries to prove it,

471
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
then I think that we can talk about

472
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
what is the appropriate pronoun to use.

473
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Because my problem is the...

474
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
The...

475
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
They're...

476
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Tambi, I don't want to fight with you.

477
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
We're surviving in this shit world together

478
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
and you'll always be my sister.

479
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Well, I'm glad.

480
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I love you.

481
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
What?

482
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Love.

483
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I was in love once.

484
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati,

485
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
bent over a pool table.

486
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
The year was 1985.

487
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,280
And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey

488
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
hits my nostrils at just the right moment,

489
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,280
I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth

490
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
against my cheek.

491
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

492
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

493
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

494
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Thank you.
