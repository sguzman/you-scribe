0	12720	Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube, sensation. Welcome to my world! Every
12720	17120	week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me!
17120	23200	So I'm going to go with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a Flaunt
23200	30240	325 dash. Smoke it out. Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major.
30240	39680	I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed. It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yeah. Yes. Okay.
40960	49360	I'm not living for it. Oh my god. I think I glued my eyeshot. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face.
49360	54000	I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.
54000	59920	Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life,
59920	67520	which is why I support our president, Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!
79360	91120	Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of The Freedom Report, whereâ€”I'm sorry, why does my studio
91120	97040	look like a Japanese drag queen redecorated in Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it.
97680	102720	Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political
102720	106160	spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational,
106160	108880	free-thinking debate about a timeless question.
114640	119760	Are traps gay? My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series
119760	126000	Intersectional AF. Clarence? Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that
126000	134240	transphobia is racist? Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles.
134240	138000	Now, Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program,
138000	143440	isn't that right? That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.
143440	147760	You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?
147760	152240	Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders and how I was tired of
152240	157520	trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I know,
157520	162320	everyone's calling me a turf and a traitor, so I said, you know what? I'm out. I'm not going to
162320	167840	put up with this culture of silencing and shame. I think that's just so brave of you. Yeah, wow,
167840	173040	so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are. Shut up, Adria. I had just
173040	177760	come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that, the trans
177760	182880	community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing. I was absolutely alone.
182880	187040	Do you have any idea what that felt like? Your leftist allies are not your friends,
187040	192240	Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them. Those are not friends. Well, you have real friends
192240	196880	now, Tiffany. I think you're going to fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals
196880	200960	who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against
200960	205520	politically correct dogma. Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?
206160	212320	So I'm going to go in with the highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow until I'm
212320	221120	literally blinding. I am glowing. She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it. You know what
221120	228560	else I'm not living for? The Muslims. Tiffany, you are so funny. I'm sorry. Are we just going
228560	233920	to ignore the blatant racism? How is that racist? Muslims are religion, not a race. Yeah, Adria.
233920	238400	Muslims are religion, not a race. Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied
238400	243040	together. You can't just...well, you both know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's try to
243040	250480	get back on track here. So Adria, traps. Are they gay? Look, there's so many things wrong with the
250480	255040	question that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it. First of all, what are traps?
255040	259040	Are they trans women? Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing
259040	264000	into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men. A lie that reinforces the mentality
264000	268800	that causes men to murder us. Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman. What about
268800	273840	anime? Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans. The Japanese word
273840	278960	is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser. There's no implication of tricking men, but the
278960	283680	word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women. So when you tell us that's
283680	287840	not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.
287840	292080	Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women. We're not all offended all the time.
292080	297200	I actually happen to identify as a trap. Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap. Well,
297200	301520	she's in the sunken place. And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless. Doesn't it bother you at all
301520	305840	that if some guy murders you, his defense is going to be, well, she was a trap. I was tricked.
305840	309600	And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking. What do you care, Adria? No one's
309600	315520	gonna be trapped by you anyway. Oh, spicy. The fuck did you just say? I said no shade,
315520	318400	but you don't really look like a woman. Jackie, are you going to allow your
318400	323440	guests to talk to me like this? Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer. Look,
323440	328960	dragging bitches is what I do. Facts over feels, hunty. Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit
328960	333920	of a point? Like if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in. I mean,
333920	338960	what is this, a men's shirt? How are you going to attract men with that? I'm not trying to attract
338960	345280	men. I'm a lesbian. I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman
345280	352320	and a lesbian? Well, I'm a woman and I like women. I don't know about that. Sounds debatable. I'm
352320	356160	sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the transphobia
356160	362960	special. Transphobia? Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair. I mean, I've invited two trans women
362960	368560	to be on my program and I'll have you know that one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.
368560	373760	And what could be transphobic about that? See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans
373760	377760	people. You're obnoxious and offended by everything and everyone feels like they have to tread on
377760	382320	eggshells around you. Thank you, Tiffany. See, you're one of the good ones. You're a good tran.
382320	386640	Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany? Be the lap dog of people like this?
386640	391840	No. I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient and agreeable
391840	395840	and by looking the part and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet your
395840	400640	impossible standard of wokeness. And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh? Just keep
400640	405280	reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away. Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,
405280	409360	that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone but yourself and the only reason you're accepted is
409360	413520	that you don't challenge the status quo? I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because
413520	417360	I feel like we're just getting hung up on terminology. Look, Adria, if you don't like the
417360	422480	word trap, we just won't use the word trap. The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to
422480	428240	trans women? It is if you're a woman. No, I mean for men. Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men
428240	435120	or gay men? Well, all the men I've dated only date women but if they're attracted to me, I mean,
435120	440000	it's not the straightest thing, is it? Why not? You look like a woman and I know that you know
440000	446000	that gay men are not attracted to these tits. Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.
446000	450080	Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria? I mean, sure, she looks like a woman but
450800	455600	she does have XY chromosomes. When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?
455600	460640	That's not how sexuality works. We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular
460640	467040	biology. Okay, sure, but I mean, a lot of trans women still have their penis and you gotta admit,
467040	471840	that seems kind of gay. Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you? We live in a
471840	476320	world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women but there's an intense stigma
476320	481520	on dating trans women and it's actually dangerous because what happens is if a man's friends find
481520	486480	out that the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by
486480	491040	lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating and this happens again and again. And
491040	495440	every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma and you're
495440	499200	making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women. Alright, I'm not trying
499200	504240	to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women
504240	509760	could be attracted to a person with a penis. Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you, I am a lesbian,
509760	514480	I'm only attracted to women, including trans women, and when I'm attracted to a trans woman,
514480	519200	I perceive her as a woman. And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,
519200	525360	but as a part of her female body. So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick. I'm
525360	532640	sorry, what? What is girl dick? The feminine penis. Oh no. Oh, come on. This is nonsense. How
532640	538000	could a penis possibly be feminine? Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman, but also because
538000	544880	hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis. Shut up, Adria, just shut up.
544880	549680	Wait, really? How is it different? Well, I'm glad you asked. More needs to be said about the feminine
549680	555120	penis. Why is no one talking about the feminine penis? Kill me now. So to start with, it doesn't
555120	560160	get as hard. It doesn't really ejaculate and it has a different mouth feel. Can we please talk
560160	565760	about the mouth feel? Why is no one talking about the mouth feel? I don't think that's necessary.
565760	572240	I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.
572240	579040	That's correct. I don't like mantic. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.
579040	585200	Not like girl dick. Girl dick is everything soft and smooth. What is that? Star Wars? Do
585200	590240	you also build computers for a living? I mean, guilty. I also enjoy wearing knee socks.
593040	597600	And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl. My sweet love. Wait,
597600	602480	you're dating that crazy Antifa cat? Well, we're in the same poly heel. I don't know what that means
602480	608160	and I'm not like prejudiced or anything, but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.
608160	613760	Like if you're born male and you're attracted to women, how is it not just heterosexuality?
613760	619040	Well, my girlfriend is also trans. So if you follow your logic to its conclusion,
619600	628240	okay. So you're a woman who was born a man and you like women, but you're dating a woman.
629120	633280	Someone who has a penis. It's a female penis that used to be a male penis.
634000	640160	So you're attracted to women, but you were born a man and you're attracted to women.
640160	646320	But that used to be a man your dating a female has a penis. So that means you are gay,
646320	650800	but you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born. I can go over it with
650800	655520	you again after the show if you need some extra time to figure it out. Why am I constantly
655520	661120	surrounded by homosexuals? Adria, just stop talking. Look, I don't care what you do in private,
661120	665760	but I'm sorry to break it to you. The world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.
665760	670320	What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile and people like me
670320	675440	to be our representatives because I act like a normal woman and I date normal men and I don't
675440	681600	have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick. Also, I look fucking gorgeous. I'm sorry,
681600	686400	but that matters. Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart. You're not
686480	691440	blair white. Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done, so there's not a fair comparison.
691440	695760	What work are you having done? I'm going to lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,
695760	701360	reshape my brow, get some lip injections, maybe Botox my forehead. Oh, and I'm going to fix my
701360	707200	nose, obviously. What's wrong with your nose? It's kind of big and manish. Well, my nose looks
707200	711840	kind of like that. Are you saying I look manish? Are you saying I look ugly? What are you trying
711840	715200	to say, Tiffany? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to women?
716080	720960	I'm not doing anything to women. What? Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.
721840	726000	That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman. She has to work really hard to be seen as female
726000	731440	and you just don't. Shut the hell up, Adria. Don't get offended for me. Don't condescend to me.
731440	739120	I'm not a victim. Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be, but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.
739120	743360	Oh my god. I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.
746960	755360	All right, let's forget about it. I'm fine. Tiffany, are you fine? I am fine. To be clear,
755360	759360	aren't not fine with any of this. Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out? Let's
759360	765120	shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post. Well, we may never know whether traps are
765120	770640	gay, but the important thing is that we talked about it. I'm Jackie Jackson for the Freedom Report
770640	776800	where the debate never stops. Your mascara is running. Get out of my studio, both of you.
778560	780400	Get out. We're done.
780400	797360	Hi, Nick. Yeah, I'm finished. Well, it was a shit show. No, Adria was fine. She was cringe as fuck
797360	803360	the whole time. Let's have her back. Tiffany was a problem. She kept veering off message and she got
803360	814640	emotional. Yeah, don't invite her back. Get Blair next time. And the week after, can we get Kanye West?
814640	823440	We can't get Kanye. Get Candace Owens. Oh, what have you done to my studio? Hey, Adria, look,
824720	829360	I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay? It's just that I've been working so hard to win
829360	834240	acceptance for trans people to show everyone that were normal, that were just like them. And
835760	840640	when you show up looking like that and acting like that, it's just hard for me to watch all
840640	846400	my hard work be undone, you know? Like, you can't be talking about this feminine penis in front of
846400	851520	cis people. Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.
851520	861680	Oh my god, you crazy freak!
881520	899520	I hate Adria. She looks like a man beast. Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.
900720	905760	Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.
905760	911680	They should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.
914000	927920	Angel, relax.
927920	933840	Well, it's off.
937600	944400	I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up. All right, what are they saying?
947760	948080	Fuck it.
957920	970080	Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know them. I may have a mental illness,
970080	976800	but I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional. I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.
979520	984880	You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.
985600	989920	It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...
991600	998320	I'm not a victim. I am in control of my life.
1002880	1009360	I wish I were a woman or anything but this.
1009360	1016240	I'm destroying my body.
1020400	1022800	How could I ever love this?
1026160	1033280	I'm just mutilating myself. It's so disgusting.
1035920	1038480	God, I'm so disgusting.
1039360	1044240	I'm so disgusting.
1052160	1055040	I'm just eating a can of another drink.
1055040	1068720	I'm not a victim. I am in complete control.
1085040	1088720	I'm not a victim. I'm not a victim.
1115040	1118720	I'm just not a victim. I'm just a victim.
1145040	1146720	I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.
