1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Imagine how a woman feels. Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. Imagine the sweet

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,940
smell of her perfume. Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours. Imagine

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,500
her letting you get on top of her and insert your **** inside her, softly moaning as it

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:33,780
slides in. Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm **** wrapped around every inch

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,260
of your ****. Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust. Imagine her wrapping

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,380
her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly can and begging you

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:54,940
to **** inside her as you release every ounce of your **** into her. Then imagine the feeling

8
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:02,700
of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking beside you to see a

9
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:13,380
person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way possible. You

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,820
will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in

11
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:33,100
your face are not the proper shape. Have a nice day.

12
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:45,900
Hello, boys. Let's talk about bone structure. There's something basically Soviet about the way

13
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,740
the internet names things. Stalin had portmanteaus like Ajitprop, Politburo, and Compromat, and we

14
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,100
have webinar, podcast, and incel, short for involuntary celibate. The word incel was invented

15
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,140
in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created a website called Alana's

16
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,060
Involuntary Celibacy Project. It was essentially a safe space for people who just couldn't get it

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,220
in. But in our own miserable moment of internet history, the word incel refers to a more specific

18
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,540
community of mostly heterosexual men centered around forums like incel.me and r slash brain

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,340
cells. This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they've been

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,940
churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies. But most incels aren't

21
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,300
violent killers, they're just men who've formed an identity around not getting laid. In this video

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,660
I don't want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them, I just want to understand

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,420
who they are and why they're like this. To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a

24
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,020
person's world is to learn their language. And the language of the incelsâ€¦ well, you'll see.

25
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,380
First base, incels. Does it ever bother you that the word women makes adult females sound just a

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:07,660
little bit too human? Well, incels have a solution to that. They've taken to calling women female.

27
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,260
The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women, not as sisters or mothers and

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,180
certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign and scruitable object comparable to a

29
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,100
natural resource, unobtenium, to which incels believe all men are entitled and to which they

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,660
feel they have been unjustly denied. There's a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women

31
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,620
in nerdily misogynistic ways, and reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun's remark

32
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:40,460
about female astronauts. We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.

33
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,700
Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, but simply that nerds

34
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,660
have a nerdy style of misogyny. Now, femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have for women,

35
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,500
and it's only downhill from there. There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores,

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,300
all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented

37
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,820
by the bespoke incel coinage, roasty. Which I'm sorry to inform you refers to the incel belief

38
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,740
that the human vulva become mutilated through repeated penetration by different men, though

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,060
not through repeated penetration by the same man, interestingly, and thereby come to resemble

40
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,300
roast beef. Now, by definition, incels haven't actually observed any vaginas, but to incels,

41
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,580
anatomy is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science. Though,

42
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:34,340
if you ask me, the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes. Of course,

43
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,340
not all femoids are created equal. There are various subspecies.

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,020
The becky or normie femoid is to be contrasted with the stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,

45
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,900
whose distinguishing features include makeup on point, never works a day in her life,

46
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:01,340
naturally curvy body gives men instant erections, big tips and ass show fertility.

47
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,260
Leave my buns alone, you savages. The stacy, naturally, has a male counterpart,

48
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:14,500
whom incels call the chad. A chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared to grab

49
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,940
nearby fertile pussy. He has never heard a song in his entire life. He has a sloped forehead with

50
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:30,660
a strong brow, ram bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate. It must needs be remarked

51
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:38,660
that the skull of the chad exhibited a brow ridge most pronounced, whereas the skull of the virgin

52
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:46,900
is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation

53
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,020
and cuckoldry. It's time to talk about bone structure, according to a classic incel meme.

54
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,140
The difference between chad and non-chad is literally a few millimeters of bone.

55
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,300
I would like to propose a sociological theory. Fappington's Law. Once bigotry or self-loathing

56
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,340
permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance

57
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,060
is assigned to the shape of human skulls. Why skulls, you ask? Well, the best explanation I

58
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,220
can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable. It's therefore the perfect symbol of

59
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,580
the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.

60
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,140
If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,

61
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,860
you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying,

62
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,700
well, that's the reason why. It's just nature. There's nothing that can be done about it. And

63
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,540
that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy. Mankind is divided into two groups

64
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,820
of people, the chads with the fuckable skulls and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters

65
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,700
short. Corn dog? Anyone? I'm really hungry. Of course, it's not just the skulls the incels

66
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,100
blame for their sexlessness. They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of

67
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,540
involuntary celibacy. Height cells are incel due to their inferior stature, whereas mental cells

68
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,060
can't attract women because of mental illness or autism or their addicts and then called drug cells.

69
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,380
Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists. Now obsessing about

70
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,220
your wrist size does seem a little weird. Oh, yeah? Is it a little weird that the average dildo

71
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,140
has more girth than my wrist? Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?

72
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,580
But yeah, obviously obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's

73
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,380
is completely irrational body dysmorphia. And the reason why no one wants to be with me or even

74
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,460
talk to me is my shitty personality. Even though literal 80 IQ men who have nothing to talk about

75
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:58,420
except who won the game last night are still able to attract a loving partner. Interesting.

76
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,300
A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed to

77
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,580
race and they are accordingly termed apologies in advance, black cells, rice cells, curry cells,

78
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,700
and so on. Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate. There are of course the occasional

79
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,820
chads of color with their superior skulls and towering stature, whom the incels have christened

80
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:28,260
tyrones, changs, and chad priests. I'm so sorry. So you can be incel because of your looks,

81
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,140
your height, your mind, or your race, but what unites them all is the conviction that love and

82
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,660
sex are forever out of reach. Unless of course you delusionally imagine that you can ascend,

83
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,700
that is escape your incel dome. If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any

84
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,940
possibility of improvement, well that makes you the lowest of the low. A sad and sorry hope cell.

85
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,420
Second base, the red pill. So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview,

86
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,340
the stasis, the chads, the incels, and the normies. From these elements, incels have constructed a

87
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,420
theory of human nature and sexuality, which they call the red pill. Incels share the red pill

88
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,220
worldview with the rest of the manosphere, that is, pickup artists, men's rights activists,

89
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,340
and the voluntary celibate community known as men going their own way, abbreviated MGTOW.

90
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,860
According to red pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous. Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying

91
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,060
above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one's social status,

92
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,220
and also an incel usage above one's attractiveness. According to incels, physical attractiveness is

93
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,580
naturally distributed equally between the sexes, so if you were to assign numerical ratings to

94
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,500
attractiveness, as incels like to do, there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women as 8 out

95
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,780
of 10 men. Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a

96
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:58,340
relationship with his looks match, that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.

97
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,860
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their own

98
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,620
attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad. Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule,

99
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,300
the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women. Now, since most heterosexual

100
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,940
men do end up in relationships with women, you might be raising your eyebrow with that idea.

101
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,300
But incels have an explanation. According to the Red Bull theory, women often pursue a mating

102
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,780
strategy called alpha-fucks-beta-box. This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say,

103
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,980
ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many Chads as possible. But as she ages into her 30s,

104
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,620
she will settle down with a beta normie whom she's not really attracted to, but whom she will use for

105
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,900
financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha-cock carousel before

106
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,220
inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he's worth on a divorce settlement, and running

107
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,620
off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new Chad boyfriend, while the beta cock is left

108
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,140
behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty. So the upshot of the Red Bull theory

109
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,100
is that for men, there are three possible outcomes. Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of

110
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,980
excruciating loneliness and resentment, or you're a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage

111
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,380
with an unfaithful wife who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your

112
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:22,420
money. Or you could be an alpha, an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women

113
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,700
and forms attachments to none of them. In the Red Bull philosophy, there are two ways to become alpha.

114
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,900
The first is simply to be a Chad by nature. The second is to become a pickup artist.

115
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Red Bull pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,

116
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,900
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable. The difference is

117
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,620
that pickup artists are not celibate. In fact, they try to have sex with as many women as possible

118
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,580
by following a series of strategies and scripts known as game, as described by the book of that

119
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,300
title, as well as by the Red Bull pickup artist Ruch V, author of a book called Bang! A New Mascara

120
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,100
from Benefit. So the tube is bomb. I am living. Let's see what the wand looks like. Oh,

121
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:14,180
it's so big. I wonder what Ruch is up to lately. I bake my own bread. Yes, I am outing myself as

122
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,340
a baker, as someone who likes to cook. I'm not a woman. I am ultra masculine, as you can see,

123
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,940
but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing. And men like scientific things. I used to

124
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,860
be a scientist. Well, Ruch, you know what? If it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy

125
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:38,020
your new life as an ultra masculine baker. Sorry, I mean bread scientist. So remember,

126
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,580
the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20% or less of men are

127
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,140
really attractive to women, dating as a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for

128
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,180
enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence.

129
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,340
The black pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace is

130
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,580
genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever

131
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,580
out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can do

132
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,420
except lie down and rot. The black pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating

133
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,620
and about life in general. It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing,

134
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,940
a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic

135
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,980
conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties. For instance, a catastrophizing person might

136
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,660
begin with the thought, oh no, I'm going to be late for work, and from there infer,

137
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,740
my boss is going to be angry, I'm going to lose my job, I'm not going to be able to get another job,

138
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,340
I'm going to be unemployed forever, my family will starve, oh god we're all going to die.

139
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,620
Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is

140
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,420
completely absurd. This is exactly how the black pill works. You start with experiences of rejection

141
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,580
and isolation. From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never

142
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,340
be attractive to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy,

143
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,020
that women did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the

144
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,780
social trends that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and

145
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,860
your only option is to lie down and rot. Of course, not all incels take things quite so far,

146
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,060
but a lot of them do. On incel forums suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often

147
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,780
tagged sua fuel or rope fuel, meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because

148
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,940
they're reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that

149
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,900
incels are missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance. Now if you suggest to incels that

150
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,580
posting sua fuel on forums already populated by lonely and depressed people is maybe not the most

151
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,180
responsible idea, they respond that oh it's just dark humor, it's just a cope, throws a bone here.

152
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,740
But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people express

153
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,900
pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness is the

154
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,620
logical conclusion of the black pill world video. One's possibility for happiness is determined by

155
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,020
the genetics of height, frame, and facial bone structure, and if you don't have these gifts,

156
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,060
there's no relief but to cope or rope. Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these

157
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,780
kids. You want to grab them by their black ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there

158
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,060
are millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're their

159
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,820
own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some friends,

160
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,980
stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows, maybe they'll develop a disposition

161
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,540
that women find a little more approachable. Essentially you want to tell them clean your

162
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,620
room bucko. In fact for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of

163
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,500
advice, Jordan Peterson is probably helpful because he's telling them a lot of what they need to hear

164
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,220
and he's kind of a sexist old man so they might actually listen. But most incels don't want to

165
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,420
hear this kind of advice. In fact they view it as essentially a microaggression. You are in effect

166
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,140
Chad explaining their oppression to them when you give basic advice like take a shower, be more

167
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,100
confident, to people who have already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation and who

168
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,060
believe they've already tried everything. So they despise this kind of advice and devote endless

169
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,820
posts to bitterly mocking the futility and insensitivity of it. Just go out to parties bro.

170
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,220
Instead of hating on women all day why don't you losers just try being confident like this average

171
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,060
looking guy. Confidence is key. You incels need some hobbies. Try reading some books.

172
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,180
Women love intelligence. It works for me bro. Aw you just need to get out more.

173
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,260
No one knows what it's like to be hated. To incels their worldview seems iron clad.

174
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,780
It has built in defenses against anyone who would try to change their minds.

175
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,940
So if you want to understand incels and in particular if you want to understand why their

176
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,740
community produces so many mass murderers you have to understand that the black pill

177
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,780
is more than the dogma that you can't get laid. It's also the dogma that because you can't get

178
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,340
laid you can never be happy. So what we have in our hands here is more than a bunch of angry

179
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,340
internet misogynists. It's at worst a kind of death cult complete with an eternal hell and

180
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,620
an omnipotent enemy. It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude

181
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,860
that since triumph is impossible why not try revenge?

182
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,820
Third base. Tinder is garbage. I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels and I

183
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,020
know they don't want my sympathy anyway and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil

184
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,900
but on some level I can't help it. The internet is for introverts so I'm sure a lot of people

185
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,940
watching this feel the same way. I bet some of you have been this guy. I have been this guy.

186
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,180
So look I'm gonna tell you something I've never really come out about on this channel so this is

187
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,300
like a really vulnerable moment for me but I used to live as a man and I'm not proud of that but

188
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive. I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who

189
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:44,180
dates men who used to be a man who dates women. What kind of fucked up shit is that? Is that even

190
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:50,420
allowed? Alright cop down lesbian stans I'm still attracted to women and those who lies betwixt.

191
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,140
Cats. The inherent eroticism of the sea.

192
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,740
Yeah don't you just want to get in there? Take me mommy. But I have been on a heterosexual kick

193
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,420
lately. I gotta get my hetero on. What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women

194
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,020
and as a woman seeking men and I think that gives me some relevant experiences. When you're a man

195
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,900
the strategy is you've got to send a lot of messages because women get a lot of messages

196
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,860
and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuck boys. Whereas if you're a

197
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,140
woman you get to lie recumbent on your chaise log and receive the inquiries. Let's see how we're

198
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,260
doing here. How many men have liked me on Tinder? I'm paying $30 for this information so this better

199
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:43,620
be good. I have 2,500 likes. That's a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran.

200
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,060
What a divine city.

201
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,740
Aw that's so nice of them to be interested in me. Let's see what kind of messages I got.

202
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:02,420
Dick or no dick. Preoper post op. Did you cut your dick off? Oh my god. I'm gonna cut it off

203
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:10,100
okay Jesus. I will let you smash my pussy so so hard. If you just be patient. It's a whole process.

204
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,380
That's not a pussy. That's a fuckhole. You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of

205
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,860
your sacred passage. Well that's true. I am not going to be squeezing any life out unless something

206
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,820
goes very seriously wrong and I assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever

207
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:33,380
been or ever will be sacred. Abigail, leave my fuckhole out of this. When I first started using

208
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,220
this app I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill. He was going to take me to a concert.

209
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,500
I was like seems like a lot for a first day but we'll try it. 15 minutes after we agreed to that

210
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:49,220
he sends me a message. What color panties are you wearing? I would love to smell them.

211
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,620
Can we get coffee first? The hell of it is. I probably would have let him smell my panties

212
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,180
but this is the thing you bring up on the third fuck. You don't open with panty sniffing. Like the

213
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,700
only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're gonna murder me

214
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,700
and you're already fucking it up. So this is the experience of women on tinder. We're drowning in

215
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,900
dick and most of it is terrible. Not all. I do have some very sweet messages and I haven't been

216
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,380
using the app in a couple months so if I didn't respond to you or if we didn't match it's not

217
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,380
because I rejected you. It's because I don't like the app. People screenshot my profile and they

218
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,980
post it online and they call me cotra points and like aren't I just too famous for this shit? My

219
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,980
life is hard. So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that's

220
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,860
constantly pointed at us in dating apps but how would you feel if instead of that you were just

221
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,900
getting radio silence like the incels get? I can't speak for other women but personally

222
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,540
I prefer the firing squad of dicks, you know? At least these pricks care enough about my pussy

223
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,580
to be an asshole about my dick. I feel sorry for men on dating apps. I really do. You have to deal

224
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,820
with a lot of rejection and that must be difficult and these apps are especially brutal to people who

225
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,060
aren't photogenic. If you're meeting people at a bar or a party you might strike up a conversation

226
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,620
with someone who you're not initially physically attracted to but then maybe they're super funny

227
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,420
or charming or maybe they're attracted to me and that's an attractive quality in another person

228
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,740
that they appreciate how beautiful I am. But on Tinder you're just browsing a catalog of faces

229
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,460
and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place. Red pillars have a really gross

230
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,140
way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value but like dating kind of is a

231
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,940
marketplace or at least you can analyze it like one and our culture is so visual these apps are

232
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,620
so picture-centered that bone structure like it's not the only thing that matters but it matters a

233
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,900
great deal. And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels because as a trans woman I know

234
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,860
what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone. I actually had to interrupt work on this video to

235
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,980
go to a consultation for facial feminization surgery so I can pay luxury car amounts of money

236
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,740
to shave off a few millimeters of bone hair there because it must needs be remarked that the skull

237
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,540
of the female exhibited the brow ridge less pronounced. I mean I'm just as obsessed with

238
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,100
bone structure as the goddamn incels because I think certain parts of my face make me look like

239
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,380
a man and I worry about it every day. We're all obsessed with the bones honey. We all have bones

240
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,380
inside us. We all love touching bones. You want to take a measurement from the super orbital ridge

241
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:34,660
to the lambdoid suture and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad circumference.

242
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,620
Why is no one talking about the Chad circumference? Fourth base, just the tip. There's another way I

243
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,220
think my experience as a trans woman is relevant to the incel discussion and that's that I

244
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,020
recognized delusional self-loathing when I see it. I'm far from the first to point out that the

245
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,620
supreme gentleman incel mass murderer Elliot Rodger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath

246
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,820
personality, an eminently bangable twink. Now I'm not going to show you pictures of incels but on

247
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,500
their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads and you can't say this on incel forums without

248
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,060
enraging them but in confidence from one pretend clinician to another let me tell you that the

249
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,980
truth about incels is that almost all of them are completely normal looking guys but of course

250
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,900
that's not the feedback they get from other incels. The feedback they get is that their

251
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,900
chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is garbage and there's no hope whatsoever,

252
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,980
no woman will ever love them and there are true selves with no option but to lie down and rot.

253
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,420
And the interesting thing is those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that's the

254
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:44,500
kind of feedback they're going to get. So why? Why do they do it? Well I'll tell you a little story.

255
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,300
There is a website on the internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT. A few years ago this

256
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:58,180
was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos but recently it's used mostly by

257
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,700
men who are entertaining the notion of becoming women and by early transition trans women so the

258
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,860
board is jokingly called TTTT. Now I've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition

259
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,500
but the memory is still fresh and let me tell you it is a painful awkward humiliating stage of

260
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,340
life. So the trans women of TTTT are tragic. They're basically still in man mode which is why

261
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,740
they're using 4chan and I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels. For incels the

262
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,220
core frustration is that they can't get laid. For TTTT it's that they can't pass as female. Both

263
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,780
groups post selfies knowing they're going to get brutal unconstructive feedback and both groups

264
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,540
have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties. For instance on TTTT a major

265
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:54,340
piece of jargon is hun, a slur used by trans women for other trans women which basically means that

266
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,900
you look like a man in a dress which is what every trans woman is afraid of. And there's another

267
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,020
commonality with incels too with all bigots and self-loathers which if you've been paying

268
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,940
attention you've already guessed. You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size.

269
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,460
Have all the surgeries in the world. Your massive man noggin will stay the same. Well this freak

270
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,340
thinks he has very soft facial features. His head is fucking huge. Well and the huns on reddit are

271
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,620
hugboxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads. Uh no there aren't. There aren't

272
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,020
fucking women with heads to do that. And FFS won't change shit. You might as well repress.

273
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,860
You transition with a man's head. You will be clocked. You will be looked at as a freak.

274
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:43,060
You will never be seen as a legit woman 100%. This is why I'm not transitioning. Thank you

275
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:51,140
skull people for showing me the way and that no matter what I do I will always be a manly man

276
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,420
skull wise. You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.

277
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:04,260
Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynophile be much more voluminous and the facial plane

278
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:10,660
wider. It always comes back to the skulls every time. The other interesting thing about TTTT

279
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,180
is I used to get posted there a lot. For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed

280
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,100
me as inspiration. Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon. If I'm not looked

281
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,060
at as a big skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well, that means that some of their

282
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,740
transitions might go well too. And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded

283
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,060
on self-loathing and hopelessness. So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain

284
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,220
why I didn't pass, why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me

285
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,820
shouldn't even fucking think about it. They shouldn't transition at all. They should just

286
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,060
repress. They should lie down and rot. And I used to read this stuff all the time. Like,

287
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:57,540
I would specifically seek out threads about me. Which might seem strange, considering I had

288
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,580
hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day. So why did I turn away from that

289
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,420
to intentionally seek out this dismal den of Huns talking about how my giant Hun skull is clockable

290
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,180
at a thousand paces and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse

291
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,380
and Winnie the Pooh? Well basically there is part of my brain that just simply refused to believe

292
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,060
it when people told me I was gorgeous. And for semi-plausible reasons. A lot of trans people

293
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,220
on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter what they look like.

294
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,500
That's where the word Hun comes from. You look great Hun.

295
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,180
So what TTTT is saying about Reddit hugboxing is true to some extent. There is a kind of

296
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:46,020
a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces. So I came to regard all

297
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,540
compliments as everyone is beautiful. Politically correct cuckoldry. And there would be this thrill

298
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,540
of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.

299
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:03,540
And that was always painful. But there was a kind of pleasure too. There was a rush. It's exciting

300
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,700
to burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you're really thinking. That personality

301
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,940
doesn't matter because big skulled chads get all the girls. That ContraPoints is a big skulled Hun

302
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,140
with a voice like nails on a chalkboard. And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I

303
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,500
was just doing research. I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying. It's simply my job.

304
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,380
But soon I realized it wasn't just research. And it was infecting me away from the computer. This

305
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:34,180
ridiculous vocabulary. Huns. AGP. Was popping up in my head at unexpected times. It was starting to

306
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,060
color how I thought about myself. And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other

307
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,540
trans women. And that's the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or

308
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,780
I'm going to become a monster. And once that happens, it's going to be very difficult to fix.

309
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,620
This is exactly how the incel black pill works. There's something infectious about these

310
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,980
vocabularies. Like on days I've been working on this video, I'll go out at night and these words

311
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,780
just involuntarily show up in my thoughts. That bartender is such a Chad. He's totally

312
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,180
height blocking that tiny cock. And the tragic thing is some incels don't realize what this

313
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:12,420
is doing to their minds until it's too late. Let's face it, black pills are sooey fuel. And

314
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,020
a lot of us can't handle them. I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it since

315
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:25,460
I loved uncovering secrets that society had been hiding from me. But it has affected my mental

316
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,260
health in a bad way. I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago and I've never

317
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:38,980
needed to do that before. I could always talk myself out of it through logic but my mind is

318
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,380
ruined now. This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm. Prototypically

319
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,020
teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts. But the more sophisticated

320
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,260
adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out abusive and disparaging comments

321
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,380
about yourself made by other people. I have a long history of doing this. Intentionally looking for

322
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,820
abusive comments, especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.

323
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,980
Why? I don't know. Why do people cut themselves? Part of it is what we could call masochistic

324
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,060
epistemology. Whatever hurts is true. I've recently gotten much better about this. I haven't been to

325
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:23,300
any of the worst places in a couple months. And my mental health is much improved. So incels,

326
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,300
I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position worthy of rational

327
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,540
debate. Because these ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use

328
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,180
arguments. You're using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves. And I know because I've done

329
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,140
the exact same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It's an anxious death spiral.

330
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,260
And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You've been

331
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,740
bullied and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you're doing when you're reading

332
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,180
incel forums is you're slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves

333
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,500
and at other people in your situation. And at women. And you're forming mental habits that are

334
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,660
going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have to do is get off

335
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,540
those forums as fast as possible. I'm going to post a link in the description of this video

336
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:15,460
to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer. Because for me, that's what

337
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:25,140
it took. Fifth base, anal. So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit. And that

338
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,900
limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred is not

339
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,540
directed at themselves, but at women. And they really hate women. Like I'm basically a professional

340
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,940
internet bigotry scholar at this point. I look at this kind of stuff all the time. But researching

341
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,620
this video, I was honestly kind of shocked at the intensity of misogyny on incel forums. I won't

342
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,580
show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape, saying they deserve to be raped,

343
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,940
calls for state mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all just a kind of

344
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:07,700
generalized misinformed rage. I hate women. I really do. Every time I look at them, my blood

345
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,220
pressure shoots through the roof when they're gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton,

346
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,740
when they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time rifling through their stupid purse,

347
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,180
when they whine to me about their period, when they blither on and on about some artist,

348
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,860
film director, musician nobody gives a flipping fuck about, when they cry and expect your personal

349
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:36,260
sympathy. But most of all, I hate them because they're smug, hyperactive little bitches made that

350
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:44,100
way by our shithole society. Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done. Hi Stacey. It's

351
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,580
Tracy. While I was at the mall the other day with Amber, Heather, Jenna and Trish, and we were

352
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:55,220
talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018, they live in this cartoon

353
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,620
caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking of women as fully human. That's where my sympathy

354
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,460
runs dry because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to turn to violence. So incels, I know

355
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,500
you're not going to listen to anything I say and you're just going to say that I'm a tranny and a

356
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,420
faggot and a degenerate. And to that I say, how dare you say things that are entirely true? But also,

357
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,180
vole soul if you wouldn't, bitches. And I know you don't listen to suggestions about how you

358
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,820
probably actually could have healthy relationships, so no one can really reach you until you get out

359
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,380
of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached. But by way of a closing remark, I guess I simply

360
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,340
invite you to consider that you don't even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic

361
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:38,100
longing. You know, when I was your age, in 1975, every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in his bedroom.

362
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,860
That was the outlet for his sexual frustration. What I'm suggesting is the manosphere exists

363
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,540
because rock and roll is dead. But there's other options. Think about the eroticism of a rainstorm,

364
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:59,140
the clap of thunder, the rustle of leaves, the steam rising off the warm pavement.

365
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:12,260
And whether you're a Chad, a Stacy, an Insel, or a Hun, you could always return to the caress

366
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:21,780
of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.

367
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,780
Ooh, is it hot in here or is it just me?
