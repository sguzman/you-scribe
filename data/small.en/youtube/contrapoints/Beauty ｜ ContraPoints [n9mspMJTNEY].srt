00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,400
My shop is the fixer front I'm real when I shop my face

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,640
Hey guys it's Natalie welcome back to my channel

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,760
Today I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial as always but first story time, story time, story time

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
I just wanna be upfront with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm always gonna be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,880
to me like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,600
my whole entire journey this journey I've been on as a transgender woman you've been

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
with me on this whole journey this is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
this is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just so special because you've

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey the whole message of my journey as

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
a vulnerable moment it's just been so impactful on my life and the truth of my journey it's

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
just so meaningful that you guys have been here for so much to me that you guys are supporting

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,280
the truth of the life experience of my transgender journey as a transgendered journey it's been

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,200
so painful and it's been a really vulnerable time for me and I'm just so grateful to you guys

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120
because you guys are so meaningful and you've been here for so much

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,640
I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,680
but it's inner beauty that really counts anyway let's talk about plastic surgery I had facial

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,800
feminization surgery on April 2nd so about a month and a half ago what we call facial feminization

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,840
have to look more feminine so what I had done is forehead contouring a brow lift rhinoplasty

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,960
mandible contouring a trachea shave you know what let's just have the skull lady talk you through it

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,720
a coronal incision was made across the cranial vault whence the skin of the forehead was stripped

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:16,040
away from the bone a fragment of the super orbital ridge was then chiseled away removed reshaped and

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,480
re-affixed thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that oft times

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,200
distinguishes the skull of the chard a second incision was made athwart the columnella of the

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,200
nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction of the anterior cartilage and bone further incisions

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:45,000
were made betwixt the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped and shaved

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,520
down to a gracile curvature of jaw and pointed chin thereby delineating a facial silhouette

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,040
exhibiting that aspect which medical men call canti it all sounds pretty gruesome when you

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,840
describe it like that but there's actually a very fine level of technique and aesthetics involved

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,480
my plastic surgeon is an artist the results are natural I don't look like I've had a bunch of

33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,640
work done which is good you know you at least want to leave people wondering maybe she's born with

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,120
it maybe a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull here's a before and after picture

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,280
where you can clearly see the difference to use the exact medical terminology my brows on fleek

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,080
my nose is no longer busted the house my jaw snatched and my Adam's apple is canceled wasn't

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,880
it always really Eve's apple maybe Satan's apple I think I still look like myself it's not a new

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,560
face we're talking about millimeters of bone here but to have all that done was well it cost a lot

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,200
of money the anticipation was oh terror like I've never known the pain was memorable and the

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,920
recovery took more than a month in fact I still have some swelling in my jowls jowls there's a

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,320
nice feminine sounding word love that the standard youtube t girl thing to do of course would have

42
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,520
been to vlog the whole journey story time my facial surgery experience my FFS journey and

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,240
post constant social media updates about it and I am grateful to the trans women who have done that

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,720
because it was really helpful to me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what

45
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,360
I was getting myself into but I decided not to post about the surgery because I wanted privacy

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,840
for the recovery and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before

47
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,000
subjecting myself to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids you know I think I've

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,720
been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people say about my appearance

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,440
online I'm not even talking about the haters like at this point I can mostly brush them off

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,520
but for instance about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit and some trans

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,840
woman was agonizing about her appearance and someone offered the encouragement you know you

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,640
can still look hot even if you don't pass just look at contour points oh like a dagger to the

53
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,280
heart the unintentional shade of it all so the past six weeks have been at times difficult and

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,720
lonely but I did manage to keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm

55
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,480
ever gonna be for the commentary of the internet so bring it on you jackals you vultures you

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,680
goblin swine while I was lying around bandaged and bored I did have a lot of time to think and what

57
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,720
I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now which is why

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,480
would someone do what I just did why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much

59
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,560
anxiety and pain just to change a few millimeters of bone isn't this all just extravagant vanity

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,880
some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much well I feel like there's a lot of pressure

61
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,360
on me to say that in fact this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all usually trans people say that

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,560
surgeries like facial feminization top surgery general reassignment and so on serve the sole

63
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,680
purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria this discomfort we feel with the mismatch between

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,160
our bodies and our gender identity so what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,760
necessary reconstructive procedure needed to make my testosterone weathered facial bones

66
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,880
match the five foot two happy baby bouncy bio girl I truly am inside thereby alleviating my

67
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,240
dysphoria helping me safely blend into society and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown

68
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,080
and there is definitely truth to that it's certainly the argument I intend to make when I

69
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,120
write this off as a medical expense on my taxes if you're an IRS auditor please stop this video

70
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,560
now and insert the next floppy disk into your CD drive but hypothetically speaking I think the

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,840
reality might not be quite so simple how sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the

72
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,560
other kinds of body image dysphoria that drives cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,200
time last year when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance I tweeted that I wanted to

74
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,800
get FFS and some trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,680
and self-loathing they compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery or so-called

76
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,960
ethnic rhinoplasty which they say are motivated by internalized racism and western beauty standards

77
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,520
I think that's a pretty weak analogy and telling a trans person to just learn to accept the way they

78
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,640
look can actually be kind of transphobic because a big part of what it even means to be trans

79
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,160
at least for me is the desire to look more female but I also think trans people often talk like

80
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,920
gender dysphoria is this intrinsic personal experience that's always 100% valid and never

81
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,880
has anything at all to do with the external pressure of beauty standards but in fact gender

82
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,840
dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of societal ideals and norms

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,040
early in my transition some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair so I had full body laser hair

84
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,680
removal and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg but where does the idea that women

85
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,560
don't have body hair come from isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom a lot of the cis women

86
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,680
I know don't so much as shave their legs so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman

87
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,400
maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a knuckly hairy

88
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,760
manish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my core is this gender dysphoria

89
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,840
or is it internalized transphobia or is it simply a cosmetic preference when I try to psychoanalyze

90
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,600
myself I find that my desires to look female to look feminine and to look beautiful are not

91
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,120
exactly the same but they're woven together so tightly that it's kind of difficult to untangle

92
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,120
them and the opposite is also true that for me feeling manish or dysphoric usually goes along

93
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,240
with feeling ugly I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking well I'm giving fem

94
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,480
queen realness but apart from that I look like absolute shit of course there are qualities that

95
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,760
make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive like cellulite or flabby arms which

96
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,720
are super fish but aren't deemed beautiful by society the truth is I don't just want to look

97
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:43,320
female I want to be beautiful desperately god I'll do anything anything in this video I want to

98
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,120
explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful and why it seems like a lot of people who live in

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,360
a society are so obsessed is it phones it's probably phones I know you're supposed to pretend that you

100
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,360
don't care about being beautiful or that you're not trying but guys it's the only thing I care

101
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,200
about and I've never tried so hard in anything of course I do feel guilty about being so obsessed

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,240
with it because there's this idea that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain you know

103
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,280
smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty and I've always been categorized as a smart person

104
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,760
by people around me some of that is when you're raised like I was as a middle class white boy with

105
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,760
no athletic talent parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius like Einstein nutted a load

106
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,200
in Mozart's bussy and Mozart shot you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from Vincent van Gogh

107
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,160
it inspired his famous painting starfish night but even among women caring about beauty is often

108
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,440
frowned upon I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia and I know a few

109
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,160
because I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a uh what do you call someone who makes

110
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,440
videos a cam girl most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup to them the

111
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,560
idea of earnestly putting on press on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable like maybe on

112
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,200
Halloween now part of that is that women in male dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to

113
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,320
present more masculine to be taken seriously because of this prejudice that beautified femininity

114
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,240
equals frivolous but another part is clearly some kind of not like other girls weird flex which okay

115
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,800
fine whatever I'm not going to judge another woman for the way she copes with a society that

116
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,680
pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it I guess my way

117
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,120
of coping is this tacky heteronormative and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind of

118
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,800
post-ironic feminine beauty why am I like this well part of it is vindictive transsexualism pure

119
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,680
and simple to all the people who've ever called me a man I want to say fuck you by looking like the

120
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,000
undeniable visual archetype of a woman which is a beautiful feminine woman who's wearing

121
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,840
600 000 sequins they're biological sequence

122
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,320
oh that is some asmr right right there isn't that

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,040
another factor is this shitty website I'm a professional youtube influencer forgive me

124
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,720
father and I'm on camera all the time I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,280
staring at my own face on a screen now you try doing that and see what kind of fucked up complex

126
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,320
you develop plus I compare myself to other women who make videos a lot of the trans women on

127
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,360
youtube are so young and so beautiful it makes me want to throw up and in comparison for a long

128
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,320
time I've felt like this this shabby aging transvestite just this feral cat wandering the

129
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,520
aisles of the liquor store so I'm insecure I'm compensating for that whole mess but I honestly

130
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,560
don't resent the beautiful people I really just stand the hell out of them I follow this woman on

131
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,160
youtube but I want to be just like her mom her name is Dame Jefferson Star her name is Lady Jane

132
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,640
McLean Señora Nicole Beatrice tutorials Tatiana Petrovna West Prokova and of course my queen and

133
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,640
perfect goddess whomst I stand in whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times so there's maybe

134
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,880
some extra intensity for me but I think it's actually pretty normal to want to be beautiful

135
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,720
I think even grad students want to be beautiful they just want to do it in that Becky kind of

136
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,120
way where you scoff at anything glam or artificial and it's not just women who care about beauty

137
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,200
either I mean gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery but now even the

138
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,520
straights are doing it in cells are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal

139
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,680
appearance and the ones who aren't completely black pilled are obsessed with plastic surgery

140
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,240
the incel newspeak word for beauty is looks maxing because of course they have to go about

141
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,720
this in the most heterosexual possible way it is imperative to implement a skin max regimen in

142
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,760
order to maximize looks money status and secure access to females oh my god comte own not every

143
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,840
sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner yes they

144
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,280
actually call skincare skin maxing James Charles I know you're having a hard month but I've got a

145
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,440
business idea that's gonna turn this thing around for you here's the plan you're gonna create a new

146
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,440
line of skincare products called Chad glow bribed PewDiePie to send his fans to the promo video

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,320
hi sister cells and send me a check in the mail you're welcome if you read looks max forums

148
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,280
they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants chin implants mandible implants

149
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:18,200
it must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad exhibited a jawbone most robust

150
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,720
it's literally facial masculinization surgery so everyone's obsessed with the bones everyone's

151
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,040
obsessed with beauty whether man or woman cis or trans gay or gamer maybe lesbians are just

152
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,720
straight chillin well everyone else has completely lost their minds but why why do we care so much

153
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,680
well with incels by their own account the only reason they care is they think that looks maxing

154
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,480
will make femoids have sex with them and they think of that will make their lives feel meaningful

155
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,800
which um it will not so incels are canceled now what about women what's our deal what's our

156
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,680
sitch what's our vibe what's our vish well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels

157
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,880
that we care about beauty and wear makeup fake up because we're trying to attract men my daddy

158
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,200
don won on vice news last year and said that women wear makeup because they're trying to stimulate

159
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,800
male sexual arousal and because evolution now with the risk of being bratty i gotta say this is maybe

160
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,800
10 true and 90 false for one thing straight men don't like makeup at least they don't think they

161
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,280
do here's a chart i made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about makeup

162
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,160
yes i asked all of them if you wear no makeup they think you look diseased and i actually do

163
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,920
look diseased when i don't wear makeup so fair enough if you wear natural makeup you know a

164
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,880
little concealer mascara maybe a nude lip they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like

165
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,760
it if you wear campy makeup colorful eyeshadow heavy contouring overdrawn lips they think it's

166
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,120
dumb and they hate it of course i'm generalizing hashtag not all daddy doms but if women really

167
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,600
wore makeup to attract men then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it when there are no men

168
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,480
around but that doesn't happen about a month ago there was that video going around of a woman

169
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,440
showing how to make jailhouse makeup mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow using

170
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,400
kool-aid and vaseline to make lipstick there's not a lot of men in women's prisons but women are still

171
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,600
performing incredible feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup so maybe

172
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,520
women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity you know things that prison tries

173
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,200
to take away from you kind of makes sense there's a refinery 29 documentary about prison cosmetology

174
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,520
and also sexual exploitation yikes in which a former inmate describes how women would engage

175
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,280
in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup if a girl's performing sexual favors for

176
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,360
an officer he would bring her in colored pencils lip gloss things like that that's right women are

177
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,480
sucking dicks and they can put on makeup not the other way around honestly if all the men died

178
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,520
tomorrow af i'd definitely keep wearing makeup in fact i might wear more and i'm not just saying

179
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,160
that because i'm trying to win feminist points or anything like do i want to attract men yes of

180
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,880
course i do do i want to attract women i guess i don't really think about it isn't it safer to just

181
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,480
secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside whatever it's fine i want to attract

182
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,200
non-binary people too of course but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way of my crudely

183
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,800
stereotyping people based on gender so how dare you the point is when i think about my appearance

184
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,280
wanting to attract people to have sex with is not the main thing going through my head what is going

185
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:30,680
through my head i guess i just want to feel beautiful i want to see myself in the mirror

186
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,480
and think i look snatched is that a crime i don't feel pretty very often i'd say it happens about

187
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,160
once a month when i'm having a good skin day i do my makeup just right i glisten with setting spray

188
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:50,600
and then it happens a tingle goes up my spine i am bodicelli i am van gogh i have created

189
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,040
beauty i'm a girl and then it's over that's it for a month usually when i look in the mirror i

190
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,880
can't actually tell whether i'm pretty or not like with other people i can just look at them and

191
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,760
instantly make a judgment about it but with myself i have to just guess it's the same as

192
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,760
being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass would you clock me i'd clock me

193
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,640
i'd fuck me too i don't give a shit get out of my room mom it doesn't work like that for me

194
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,040
i have to rely on other people's feedback of course the problem with other people's feedback

195
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:31,080
is that people are liars you look gray on especially when those people are your fans

196
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,560
put the house queen stuff in my throat mother i'll die for you oh my god or when they're your

197
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,480
haters you're disgusting a giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces i guess

198
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,520
i'll never know whether i'm pretty or not but i can't estimate like i have figured out that i'm

199
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,640
too pretty for twitter but i'm not sure yet if i'm pretty enough for instagram it's hard being

200
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,680
i have been dipping my toes in the instagram water before my surgery i got into a pretty good

201
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,880
rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup looks and what i find addictive about it is this constant

202
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,000
flow of positive comments from other people even though i know it's mostly flattery you invented

203
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,800
beauty perfect angel choke me mommy every time i get a comment like that i'm perfectly aware

204
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,240
that it's wild exaggeration fueled by parasocial delusions but i still get a hit of dopamine in my

205
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,960
biologically female brain and the intoxicating thing about instagram is that the embellishment

206
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,400
of the truth is a two-way street thanks to the miracle of facetune yes we finally get to talk

207
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,680
about the phones see it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul

208
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,520
get it should i explain it again phones live in a society facetune is an app that lets you fix all

209
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,960
the problems with your face so here's an unedited pre-ffs picture of me what i would do in facetune

210
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,000
is smooth out the complexion shrink the nose a little bring the jaw in and use the vibrance tool

211
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,480
to make the eyeshadow pop it's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo doctoring people

212
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,200
have been doing since the invention of photography what's changed is that now everyone is doing it

213
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,400
to their own photos every day and i've noticed that when i'm in the habit of editing my flaws

214
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,360
out of pictures when i look at an unedited picture of myself or when i look in the mirror

215
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,400
my eyes go straight to the flaws why aren't my pores so big why aren't medical scientists doing

216
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,920
something to stop this is this really a good use of my mental energy here comes that guilt again

217
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,800
instead of worrying about my pores shouldn't i be helping stop the impending climate catastrophe

218
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,720
that's going to destroy the planet if we don't change the economy in like 12 years

219
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,720
shit i guess it's 11 years now it's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much

220
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:44,520
else on my mind he's just so cute i guess i'd just rather think about the aesthetic than the

221
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,680
apocalypse and that's the darkness why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin

222
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,680
do i need botox yet should i get a facelift these are the questions that will no doubt define the

223
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,720
next couple decades of my life as if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence

224
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,200
on camera i also have to deal with aging and thus the ritual of skincare products here's my daytime

225
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,240
routine so first i'm gonna mix the dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just

226
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,440
massage my face none of this is sponsored by the way this is just me supporting corporations out

227
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,280
of the kindness of my heart now if i'm not running late for something i will do a face mask but

228
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,120
if i'm out of bed it's because i'm running late for something so

229
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,800
i've never done a face mask now i'm gonna use a toner which is very important now a lot of people

230
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:45,000
don't know what a toner does but um look it tones okay do you want your face to be untoned next i'm

231
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,440
going to spray expensive korean yeast directly into my eyes i use this because it's actually

232
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,000
a lot cheaper than the japanese yeast so you're really losing money if you don't buy it think of

233
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,800
the savings now i'm going to mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic

234
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,960
bulgarian rose water you can almost smell the bulgarian rose fields it's enchanting it's like

235
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,120
i'm there there's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather i use this moisturizer

236
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,520
because gg gorgeous told me to and i do everything gg says every fucking thing i know it seems like

237
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,120
a lot of products but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection the tendency is to push

238
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,160
it as far as you can i feel like i'm forgetting something of sunscreen i'm not really sure what

239
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,440
this does we can probably skip it and i'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive

240
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:40,440
mist yes god i love a good facial i'm so fucking wet right now so after all these products does

241
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,520
my skin look clearer younger more toned well it's hard to say for sure but it certainly is moist

242
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,880
this is the part where i usually just stare at my own face for 10 minutes

243
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,920
and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time

244
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,920
i'm fine it's it's fine this is fine it's fine

245
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:40,120
i'm not having fun right now why am i not having

246
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,400
fun i guess i just don't feel beautiful and i know a lot of people think i'm pretty and i know

247
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,200
a lot of other people have it worse than me and i know i should be grateful and i know i'm privileged

248
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,680
to be able to get plastic surgery and i know i shouldn't care so much about this in the first

249
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:01,240
place but the truth is that this just eats away at me and i'm losing a lot of time and life to

250
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,280
this pain i've been kind of depressed this past month and i think part of it is that on a

251
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,640
subconscious level i think i was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image

252
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,120
and make me like myself but it really hasn't i mean i'm happy with the results i'd do it all again

253
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,440
but i still feel the way i felt before you have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific

254
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,720
problems like the adam's apple problem or the way my forehead looks and profile problem but it's

255
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,200
really not a solution to deep psychological issues i still don't feel beautiful and i need

256
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,320
to face the fact that i'm never going to feel beautiful unless i change the way i think because

257
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,440
i'm trapped in a doom spiral over here and if i'm ever going to get out i think i need to start by

258
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,640
forgiving myself for wanting to be beautiful there's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful

259
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,960
besides being shallow and vain for one beauty is associated with youth it's a symbol of life of

260
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,920
defiance of death that's a profound thing to be concerned about see i'm not a bimbo i'm a poet

261
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,120
beauty is also associated with moral worth the beautiful princess versus the evil hag there's

262
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,520
studies showing that conventionally attractive people are more likely to be assumed to be happy

263
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,480
healthy and trustworthy they're more likely to be hired so it's not just about instagram likes this

264
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,880
is serious stuff and we the woke we are all aware of this we know that beauty is power that beauty

265
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,520
is political we know that beauty standards come from the people with privilege in an unequal

266
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,360
society we know it's unjust that being light-skinned cis able-bodied or thin is considered more

267
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,880
attractive than being dark-skinned trans disabled or fat we know that female beauty matters so much

268
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,840
because patriarchy we know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked by advertising the

269
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,280
cosmetic industry and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products we know we know we know

270
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,920
all this because we've all been sitting around critiquing it for decades because that's what

271
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,440
leftists do we critique things we are finely tuned detectors of racism sexism ableism fat phobia

272
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,000
transphobia and capitalism run amac we notice an injustice we problematize it we critique it and

273
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,240
then we cancel it but what's next when we're done critiquing things what are we supposed to do

274
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,200
because i'm aware that conventional beauty standards are a racist sexist ableist fat phobic

275
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,600
transphobic social construct designed to preserve power relations and sell products

276
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:33,320
but does that awareness mean i desire any less to be conventionally beautiful well no i want it

277
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,840
more than ever the problem is that the intellectual exercise of critiquing things doesn't usually

278
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,320
affect my desires very much so what am i supposed to do sit here in silent contemplation until my

279
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,160
desires finally align themselves with the interests of the international proletarian

280
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,600
revolution oh fuck the revolution i want to be a pretty rich girl i don't want to be contra points

281
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,880
anymore i want to be gg gorgeous fighting fascists on youtube was an idea i came up with when i was a

282
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,000
male alcoholic unfortunately america needs a contra points right now more than it needs a 30

283
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,920
year old gg gorgeous impersonator so i guess i'm stuck with it maybe it's for the best critiquing

284
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,200
society may not change our desires but it can motivate us to change society and changing

285
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,960
society can change our desires so how do we change society revolution well sure revolution

286
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,160
depending on what happens in 2020 i'll think of grabbing a brick myself but failing that i think

287
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,280
there are ways we can work to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards without the futility

288
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,480
of trying to stop caring how we look i do think representation matters and i think having visible

289
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,160
beauty icons who are dark-skinned or trans or gender non-conforming or disabled or fat or over

290
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,000
35 or influencers makes a big difference beauty standards are social constructs and social

291
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,840
constructs can change that's why it's so important to recognize that influencers are just as valid as

292
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,480
other celebrities but the problem with changing society is that it takes a long time and this

293
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,800
video is almost over where i can see an escape from my particular doom spiral is in style as

294
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,560
an alternative ideal to beauty you can be stylish at any age you can be stylish whether you pass or

295
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,080
not style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic that you have complete control over

296
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,480
it's like art and that originality is a virtue style is an individual aesthetic unlike the

297
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,160
collective aesthetic of beauty standards as the poet wordsworth said about artistic appreciation

298
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,840
every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating

299
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,800
the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so even if you don't conform to conventional beauty

300
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:48,040
standards through the power of original style you can create the taste by which your unique beauty

301
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,800
is to be appreciated society may frown upon us six-foot trannies but if i know i'm dressed well

302
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,920
or my makeup is snatched i can easily abide any comment any stare i can be misgendered a dairy

303
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,840
queen for all i care it does not matter i can strut with confidence because i am basking in

304
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:14,040
the regal knowledge of my own aesthetic superiority bow before me peasants i proclaim to the drive

305
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:23,400
through window for i am serving a lurk sir this is a dairy queen so i guess that's the solution

306
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,280
i can't believe i single-handedly ended capitalism now does that mean i'm not going to get a lot of

307
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,880
expensive plastic surgery fuck no what do you people think i am some kind of transgender mother

308
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,360
tereza god damn the audacity of you people the hubris look i need plastic surgery because i have

309
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,240
no style in fact after the month i've had you should be grateful i'm wearing clothes at all

310
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,360
so that's it for me i guess i have nothing but the decay of time and age to look forward to

311
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,480
i guess i'll just have to find my self-worth and cultivating kindness intelligence and inner beauty

312
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:04,680

315
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:51,880
