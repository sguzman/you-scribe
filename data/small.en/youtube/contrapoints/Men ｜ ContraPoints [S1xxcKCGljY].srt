1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hi boys, it's me again.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
Just your average girl.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,120
Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,880
to converse as men.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,280
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,120
now and the decline of Rome.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,460
Do you like history, boys?

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,920
How did Rome fall again?

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Was it the gays?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,180
Tell me all about it.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,220
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,060
rights activists on the other.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,460
Whatever happened to that, these days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,220
I did want to do the fedora though.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,540
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,460
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,620
My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA Femme Fatale and fedora would make it fashion.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,620
School shooter realness.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,540
I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-peeled Carmen Sandiego.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,620
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:16,180
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,460
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,700
in a state of psychological balance?

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,100
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,780
I guess, yeah, kind of.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,940
You don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual medicine cabinets.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm losing my target audience here.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,700
Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,740
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,780
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,180
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,700
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,140
Women pee too, okay?

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Get over it.

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,460
not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,980
You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,380
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,100
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,980
female and as a Pisces moon.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,540
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, contrapine, for men, I started brushing

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,940
up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,580
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,900
Logico-Philosophicus, and of course, the philosophical classic, The Rational Male by

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Ruyo Caliente.

46
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,020
So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
intellectual interchange.

48
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,620
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,460
So there will be no emotions in this video.

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,060
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,660
and deductive proof.

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:07,420
Actually, you know what?

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Fuck that.

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,740
Let's listen to house music and do sax drugs.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:28,860
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

56
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,100
Oh, and the male straits.

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,860
God, I love attention.

58
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Hey, gorge.

59
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
Hey, gorge.

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Hey, gorge.

61
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,140
Okay, I'm ready.

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,820
Let's crack open a cold one, boys.

63
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,140
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

64
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,900
I need a man to do it for me.

65
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Help.

66
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Fuck it.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Okay, that's super funny.

68
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Hey, gorge.

69
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Hey, gorge.

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,860
Are there any women still watching this video?

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm really sorry about all this unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case, how

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
very dare.

73
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm a good Presbyterian.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,100
And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey, how are you?

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,540
Look, the video is about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,460
Am I doing this right?

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Is this what men like?

79
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Traps.

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Traps.

81
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,220
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

82
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,660
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere on the Frankenfurter

83
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Violet Chachke-Diedevonti's spectrum.

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,700
Oh, but you don't know where exactly, and that is a dangerous game, ladies.

85
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,900
I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now, but that

86
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
could be because of the drugs.

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,740
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational, and we're fooling around, okay?

88
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
Part one.

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,500
Oh, wait, rational.

90
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,260
Axiom one, America's next top victim.

91
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,580
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture, and I'm

92
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,420
not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

93
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,700
No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,940
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,820
We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rage prejudice.

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,140
That must be super fucking hard for you.

97
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,260
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

98
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,940
You know, flaunting their sexuality on the faces of children who are trying to raise

99
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,420
a family and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***.

100
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,700
And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights, too.

101
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,220
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life, and I've always been

102
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,660
very skeptical.

103
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,860
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

104
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,020
Men try to do a good thing to solve a real problem, and then a man shows up to say, well,

105
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
what about men?

106
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,820
Men also get harassed, why aren't you talking about men?

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,380
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,580
Of course he's fucking not.

109
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,300
He doesn't give a shit, he's a troll.

110
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,380
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

111
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,540
What about them, honey?

112
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,260
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once, and the first thing I did

113
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,020
was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement, which is The Myth

114
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,820
of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

115
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,220
Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.

116
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,500
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
to.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,620
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender

119
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,980
role that confined women to domestic servitude.

120
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,900
But, he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually

121
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,540
an illusion because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

122
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,420
He introduces the idea of male disposability, basically the idea that society values female

123
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,020
lives more than male lives, which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,860
and providing for women and children.

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,740
And he points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,060
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

127
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,380
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power

128
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
than women.

129
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,920
In fact, the Queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,660
for by the expendable male worker bees and I guess that kind of makes sense.

131
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,020
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

132
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,400
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill and I rubbed it on my claaa-

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,420
But some initial objections come to mind.

134
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Like haven't men been almost all of the king's presidents and CEOs for millennia?

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,900
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

136
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,480
I don't know boys, still seems kind of patriarchal to me.

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,220
But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society

138
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,120
that men have more power than women.

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,540
Maybe the average man is also oppressed

140
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,240
by the system that feminists call patriarchy.

141
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,260
If that's what you're saying,

142
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,800
I think I basically agree with that.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
See, what you have to understand about me

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,360
is I am such a fucking Libra.

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,960
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

146
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,580
well, maybe everybody's right

147
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,840
and maybe there's good points on both sides

148
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,500
and we should all just listen to each other

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,840
and rub each other's clothes.

150
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,700
Oh, there will be a champion, there will be blood.

152
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,680
So, judges, how do we decide which gender

153
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,500
is America's next top victim?

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,600
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders

155
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
and see how the other half lives, or can you?

156
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Proposition two, diary of an X-Man.

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,400
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

159
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
Mom, get out of my room.

160
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
You're ruining my life.

161
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,100
Look, I have never ever talked about this

162
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,960
on my channel before, so this is like

163
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
But I was born a boy.

165
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, was I ever really a boy?

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,120
It's hard to say.

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
Dear diary, growing up I always knew

168
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
that I was different from other kids,

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,240
especially other boys, and it took me so long

170
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,560
to pinpoint what it was, but there was this moment.

171
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,320
I must have been what, seven, eight years old?

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself

173
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,800
and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

174
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,120
And I don't know what it was, it was like this magnetism

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
that drew me to them and I put my little feet in them

176
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,360
and walked in front of the mirror

177
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,040
and I didn't really have the words yet

178
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,400
to describe how I felt, but basically in that moment

179
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,840
I sensed that God had made a mistake

180
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,840
and I was destined to be a cross-dresser.

181
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,520
That is super fucking coconuts.

182
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart

183
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
and I became a woman.

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,880
Hey, how are you?

185
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,840
I became one of the dolls.

186
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,560
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,520
Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,040
I used to live your lifestyle.

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
I know what people like you get up to

190
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,360
and I think it's disgusting.

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,800
I gotta say though, since I transitioned

192
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
my life has been super fucking great, like way better.

193
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it

194
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,400
better than men, but because hey, gorge,

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,120
I am literally transgendered.

196
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,800
So before I transitioned I was dying inside, you know?

197
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,240
I was in the wrong body and now it's like I finally

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,680
have the body I was meant to die inside of,

199
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,020
but it's not just that.

200
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,040
I do think that in some ways, since I started presenting

201
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,800
as a woman, people actually do treat me better.

202
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,

203
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,240
but that's probably for the best.

204
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,040
Now before using my personal experience

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
as any kind of evidence, I guess I should say

206
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
a couple caveats.

207
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,880
Caveat one is that most pre-transitioned trans women

208
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,520
are not like other boys.

209
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
And most of us, we're not living the business class

210
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
male experience by any means.

211
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,

212
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,640
tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,

213
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,420
poets, you know, that sort of thing.

214
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,800
Caveat two is that my trans experience

215
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
is not the trans experience.

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
And I do have a lot of other privileges

217
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
that made things go super fucking well for me.

218
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,060
Hey, how are you?

219
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,860
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege

220
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,580
in a way that's actually just bragging?

221
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,100
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge

222
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,140
that I've been so successful and I've come so far,

223
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,900
in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young

224
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,260
and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated

225
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,500
and I'm popular and my plastic surgeon is an artist

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,460
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

227
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,620
and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

228
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,300
And part of what makes me so enlightened

229
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,700
and so compassionate is that I'm able to recognize

230
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,300
these privileges that I have that just might not be available

231
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,380
to people who are less fortunate.

232
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,740
From the bottom of my mother fucking

233
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,860
and my father fucking heart,

234
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,400
they must be super fucking hard for you.

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,540
I can't even imagine.

236
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,260
What I was saying is there are ways

237
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,540
that people treat me better now

238
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,020
that I'm presenting as a woman.

239
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,860
You know, people smile at me more.

240
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,700
I feel more taken care of.

241
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Men do things for me.

242
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,580
Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

243
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,180
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

244
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,620
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

245
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,780
But not me.

246
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,020
I love it.

247
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,700
Both because I love attention

248
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,060
and because I'm a recumbent queen

249
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,300
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

250
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,540
I do this thing on airplanes

251
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,780
where when it's time for me to put my carry-on luggage

252
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,100
in the overhead bin,

253
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,300
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift

254
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,380
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me.

255
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,580
Even though I'm taller than most men, it makes me happy.

256
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,220
Another good thing about becoming a woman

257
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,940
is I integrate it into female social groups

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,980
and I found that they provide a kind of communal support

259
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,620
and overt affection

260
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,660
that male social groups generally just don't.

261
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,700
I find that female social style suits me better

262
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,940
than the male one,

263
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,860
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,

264
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,820
where affection is always concealed

265
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,020
behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

266
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,300
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other

267
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,700
when they play video games.

268
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,380
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

269
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,980
men and women are treated in public space.

270
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,820
When you present female in public,

271
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,340
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle

272
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,940
to be commented upon.

273
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,780
People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions

274
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,260
about you, sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,

275
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,380
sometimes just fucking weird.

276
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,860
Whereas when you present male in public,

277
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,140
you're more likely to be treated either as invisible

278
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,620
or as dangerous.

279
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,380
Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences

280
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,940
as men asserting dominance over women in public space

281
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,380
and they've criticized catcalling

282
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,380
as being objectifying, degrading, and misogynistic.

283
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,740
And it certainly can be all of those things.

284
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,300
There's different kinds of catcalling

285
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,220
and I have different feelings about them.

286
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,140
If I'm walking with another woman and a man says,

287
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,860
"'Ladies, you look beautiful tonight.'"

288
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,380
I don't know, I like that.

289
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,740
I think that's nice.

290
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,220
It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired,

291
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,740
it boosts my confidence.

292
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,380
Whereas if I'm walking alone

293
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,060
and a drunk starts following me down the street,

294
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,300
singing, "'Have you seen a polythene, Pam?

295
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,980
"'She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man.'"

296
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,180
That I am less enthusiastic about.

297
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
I mean, not that that's ever happened.

298
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,860
I'm completely fucking unclockable.

299
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,940
Hey, how are you?

300
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,940
No one knows what it's like to be a sad trans.

301
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,900
I definitely get where feminists are coming from

302
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,700
because street harassment sucks.

303
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,580
I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night

304
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,620
than I used to be.

305
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,380
And there's a lot more places

306
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,140
I just won't go by myself.

307
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,660
But on the other hand,

308
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,580
I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night

309
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,180
without other people acting afraid of me.

310
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,660
I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine

311
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,060
the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous

312
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,420
can also kind of suck.

313
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,780
In my video on incels,

314
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,780
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps

315
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,100
and how getting no attention at all

316
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
can actually be emotionally worse

317
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,940
than getting a lot of shitty attention.

318
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,980
And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,

319
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,660
when I was living as a man,

320
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,060
sometimes if I was walking at night,

321
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,980
a woman on the same block as me

322
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,940
would change sides of the street.

323
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,180
And I totally get why men do scary shit sometimes

324
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,620
and it's better to be safe.

325
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,780
But it's still stung a little bit

326
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,820
to be treated as dangerous by default.

327
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,540
I think it can actually be harmful,

328
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,500
which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.

329
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,820
There's ways that white women's fear

330
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,260
can actually be dangerous in particular to black men.

331
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,820
I had an experience with this recently

332
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,740
when I was filming my video, The Apocalypse,

333
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,140
and I had rented a room in a hotel casino.

334
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,300
Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment

335
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,500
up to my room and I got into the elevator

336
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,620
with a group of people from the casino floor.

337
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,180
A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator

338
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,140
except for me and a single black man.

339
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,260
Well, I mean, he was alone.

340
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,300
I don't know if he was single.

341
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
That's not part of the story.

342
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,580
And as soon as the door closed,

343
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,020
he started literally whistling row, row, row your boat,

344
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,660
the official melody of performative innocence.

345
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,260
And I realized, oh shit, he is afraid that I'm afraid.

346
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,980
And I found that just excruciating.

347
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,380
I was like, oh God,

348
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,220
how do other white women behave in elevators?

349
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,500
Do they like clutch their purses?

350
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,900
That's so fucking embarrassing.

351
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,660
Nothing like that had ever happened to me

352
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,140
when I was living as a man.

353
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,580
It's not a thing between black men and white men.

354
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,300
It's a thing between black men and white women.

355
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,780
And so that dynamic was there,

356
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,180
not just because I'm white and he's black,

357
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,940
but because I'm a woman and he's a man.

358
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,700
And I thought of that incident again

359
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,900
when I was listening to the myth of male power

360
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
and Farrell says,

361
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,220
men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength

362
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,700
and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.

363
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,740
I think there is some truth to the idea

364
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,620
that women's perceived vulnerability

365
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,060
can make them powerful.

366
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,980
And men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

367
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,940
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt

368
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,660
because these are just some little observations I've made

369
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
based on a handful of anecdotes.

370
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,500
And as rational males,

371
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,020
it's important that we consider the facts,

372
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
the stats and the figures.

373
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,380
Did you know that 46% of men

374
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,340
are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?

375
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,540
Look it up.

376
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
I haven't.

377
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,860
Because my super fucking Libra opinion

378
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,740
is that there's upsides and downsides

379
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,340
to male and female experience.

380
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,660
I don't actually think there's a single definite answer

381
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,500
to the vague and useless question,

382
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,260
which gender has it worse?

383
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,700
I consider myself a feminist

384
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
because I support reproductive rights

385
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,540
and I oppose workplace misogyny.

386
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,100
And I generally agree with a lot of the activism

387
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,180
that happens under the heading of feminism.

388
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,700
But I also think a lot of men

389
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,460
are just having a super fucking difficult time right now.

390
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,340
And that must be super fucking hard for the main hour, yo.

391
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,380
And I don't think feminists have an obligation

392
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,700
to care about male acts,

393
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,580
but I care about you boys.

394
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,020
God, I'm such a cool girl.

395
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,660
I think the entire Mid-Atlantic region

396
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,900
is about to freeze over.

397
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,500
No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon.

398
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,540
And I really try to understand other people's pain

399
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,540
because I just find it really, really funny.

400
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,660
I'm also really, really sobering up here.

401
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,140
The drugs have worn off

402
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,500
and I am suddenly feeling very naked.

403
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,140
Like it's just now occurring to me

404
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,180
that this is a highly inappropriate outfit

405
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,380
for this occasion.

406
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,900
So I'm going to go put on a robe

407
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,220
and I'll meet you back for the next section.

408
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,940
Postulate three, the man question.

409
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,300
Hi, boys, et cetera, et cetera.

410
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,460
Hey, how are you?

411
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,300
For the last three years on this channel,

412
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,420
I have been your vergil,

413
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,500
leading you through gender hell,

414
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,860
pickup artists, gender dysphoria,

415
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,180
incels, radical feminists,

416
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,940
non-binary genders, men's rights activists.

417
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,140
It seems like everybody's having gender trouble.

418
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,540
So what do we make of that?

419
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,580
Well, Gorge, a very, very rational male philosopher

420
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,340
named Hegel once said that the unfolding of history

421
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,980
is a basically rational process, Gorge.

422
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,380
That means that at any time in history,

423
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,980
society is based on certain principles

424
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,140
like all men are created equal

425
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,180
as long as there's super fucking rich and white.

426
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,100
And there's always contradictions within those principles,

427
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,340
which creates tension and eventually leads to a rupture,

428
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,500
like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized

429
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,980
according to new principles.

430
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,140
At least I think he was saying something like that.

431
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,620
It's pretty hard to make anything out

432
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,260
through the fog of his unreadable,

433
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,100
hyper-abstract, man jabbering.

434
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,020
God, I can't stand that shit.

435
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,220
Or any of the other music-hating vole cells

436
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,940
of the male philosophical tradition.

437
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,460
My point is, I think our society has reached a place

438
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,620
where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.

439
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,700
Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working

440
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,100
or how to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken.

441
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,980
We have mainstream feminists saying we need

442
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,820
to continue advancing the rights of women.

443
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,340
We have conservatives saying we need

444
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,580
to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.

445
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,100
We have an increasing number of people

446
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
not identifying as men or women.

447
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,380
We have TERFs who think that the transgenders

448
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,300
are the single greatest threat to civilization.

449
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Hey, how are you?

450
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,980
And we have men's rights activists saying

451
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
we need a male equivalent to feminism

452
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,820
to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.

453
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,860
Now, I wanna focus on that last one

454
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,660
because in principle, I agree.

455
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,300
I've spent a lot of the last three years

456
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,620
covering the manosphere.

457
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,020
I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.

458
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,980
And from all the time I've tortured myself

459
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,140
waiting through these communities of incels,

460
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,780
pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,

461
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,340
intellectual dark web, fanboys, and alt-right racists,

462
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,300
I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,

463
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,700
which is that they all recruit from the same massive pool

464
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,540
of sad young men.

465
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,940
We all know the archetype.

466
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
He has trouble relating to women.

467
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,180
He has no strong friendship group.

468
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,420
He's not excited about any long-term goals.

469
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,140
And he fills the void with video games and porn.

470
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,380
And just to clarify,

471
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,020
I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn.

472
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,860
I'm not telling you what to do with your penis.

473
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,020
You can rub one out to this video for all I care.

474
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,340
Just don't pull a gamer key on me, okay?

475
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,020
I live in fear.

476
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,500
Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars

477
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,060
inject their poison,

478
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,300
most of these boys are not bad people.

479
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,620
I think all of this originates

480
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,060
in a genuine crisis of male identity.

481
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,940
And I think it's happened in something

482
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,300
like the way men's rights activists describe.

483
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,820
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

484
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,300
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

485
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,660
The traditional protector provider role of men

486
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,820
is being replaced by a more equal

487
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,700
and undefined gender dynamic.

488
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,300
And college professors and activists are telling men

489
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,220
that most of our culture's aspirational representations

490
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,300
of manhood are toxic and bad.

491
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,380
But without an attractive replacement vision

492
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,500
of aspirational manhood,

493
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,940
average young men can only envision their future as what?

494
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,820
The beta, the cock, the new male.

495
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,340
And in a post-left tube internet,

496
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,860
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

497
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,540
And to be fair, it is very funny.

498
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,820
But we forgot, especially us grills,

499
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,860
that for a lot of men,

500
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,820
these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.

501
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,300
And a lot of leftists go,

502
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,620
well, how can men be so angsty, especially white men?

503
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,900
They're so privileged.

504
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,740
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

505
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,740
If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle.

506
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,220
You have something to fight for and therefore a purpose.

507
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,580
But for a lot of men,

508
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,020
their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.

509
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,340
And that, along with the loneliness

510
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,420
and the lack of a positive identity,

511
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,660
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

512
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,060
by the Manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

513
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,980
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

514
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,540
for the small but growing number of young men

515
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,180
who decide to pick up a gun

516
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,340
and open fire in a shopping center.

517
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,260
There were two mass shootings during the weekend

518
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,540
I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.

519
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,260
Both shooters were young white men,

520
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,420
and one of them posted about the shooting

521
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,820
on an alt-right image board.

522
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,220
Now, I don't pretend to fully understand

523
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,780
the motives of mass shooters,

524
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,600
but I don't think it's a coincidence

525
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,520
that basically all of them are men.

526
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,600
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

527
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

528
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory

529
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,360
and therefore to be seen and recognized as men

530
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,840
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

531
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,560
And of course, there's also the racism

532
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,920
of the alt-right killers

533
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,920
and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.

534
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,520
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

535
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,880
are more receptive to learning it.

537
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,320
So you can try to take down their forums

538
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,400
and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,

539
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,280
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

540
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,960
I don't see any end to these problems.

541
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Theorem four, what do?

542
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
There is this media narrative that has emerged

543
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
around me and around this channel.

544
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

545
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,080
of media narrative about this channel

546
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,400
is super fucking coconuts,

547
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,120
because let's be real, Gorge,

548
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,920
I just wanted to form milk on my face

549
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,240
and talk about the mouthfeel.

550
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,600
But there's this media narrative

551
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,240
that my role in the discourse

552
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,240
is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

553
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,160
And it's true that if you read

554
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,480
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

555
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,880
I used to be alt-right posts are so common

556
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,280
they're considered cliche.

557
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,680
And some of them cite me as an influence

558
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,960
in changing their politics,

559
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,720
which I love for them and I'm super fucking happy about it,

560
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,600
but it's also a lot of responsibility.

561
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,120
They're my boys and I worry about my boys

562
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,040
because in reality, it's not like they go

563
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,840
from far-right extremists to complacent centrists.

564
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,080
No, most of them go far left.

565
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,760
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

566
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,720
So I watched them go from far to my right

567
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,800
to significantly to my left.

568
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,920
It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.

569
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

570
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,560
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

571
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,800
I worry about my boys because I don't think

572
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,520
that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.

573
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,120
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

574
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,440
You know, there's kind of two options

575
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,340
the left has for disillusioned men.

576
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,800
The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.

577
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,600
We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,

578
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.

579
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
So just join the revolution.

580
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,840
It's gonna be super fucking crazy.

581
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,360
We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow,

582
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,600
smash no voting, and then things will be better for you.

583
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Now, I think that has a couple of limitations.

584
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,920
One is that I look at the far left

585
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,600
and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time

586
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges

587
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
in closed Facebook groups.

588
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,720
And I'm concerned that might not succeed

589
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,080
at ending capitalism, meow, meow.

590
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,960
Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

591
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,480
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,

592
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,080
but if you're investing all of your hopes

593
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,560
on a capital R revolution,

594
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,120
I worry that can become like waiting for Godot

595
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,520
or waiting for the rapture.

596
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,140
So we do need political change,

597
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,080
but I feel like I'm failing my boys

598
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,720
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

599
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,920
that revolution is their only hope.

600
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
Because here's the other thing.

601
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,920
Even if we did succeed ending capitalism,

602
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,140
there would still be gender.

603
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,280
And my boys would still need some model

604
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,500
of what it is to lead a good life as a man.

605
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,140
Now, the other option the left has for disillusioned men

606
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,340
is the feminist tranquilizer.

607
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,420
We say, look, toxic masculinity

608
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,040
is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings.

609
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,380
And it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.

610
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,740
So while feminism tells women you hate your body

611
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,260
and you're constantly doubting yourself

612
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,940
because society did this to you and needs to change,

613
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,740
we kind of just tell men,

614
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,860
you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.

615
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,780
Stop it.

616
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,020
We tell them they're broken

617
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,700
without really telling them how to fix themselves.

618
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,180
I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood,

619
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,300
which I don't think is something

620
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,420
that women can create for men, even if they wanted to.

621
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,380
And honestly, the best way for that to happen

622
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,620
may actually be some kind of men's movement.

623
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,300
But on the left, the whole idea of a men's movement

624
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,900
is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know

625
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,140
is basically just a backlash to feminism.

626
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,320
And at worst, it's just straight up misogyny.

627
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,860
And look, boys, I understand that being lectured

628
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,220
about man spreading for most of 2015

629
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,900
was super fucking hard for you

630
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,340
and you're still mad about it,

631
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,820
but posting endless outrage porn

632
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,100
about false rape accusations and paternity fraud

633
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,580
isn't actually gonna make life any better for you.

634
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,820
Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen,

635
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,060
but they're not systemic issues that affect most men.

636
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,460
I think what would actually improve life for most men

637
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,340
is a positive ideal of 21st century manhood.

638
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,700
But that's not something I can give to you

639
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,000
because in case you hadn't noticed,

640
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,080
I'm literally a fucking woman.

641
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,720
I can't mom you through this one, boys, you're on your own.

642
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,200
You have to help each other.

643
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
So find each other in the comments section,

644
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
meet up on Reddit, make friends, clean your room,

645
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,840
leave the house, fuck each other.

646
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,040
I don't know, it's worth a try.

647
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,120
And feeling that,

648
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,440
you could always throw in the towel and become a woman.

649
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,380
Worked for me.

650
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,080
There it is!

651
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,900
So yes.

652
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,320
It was hyper sculptures.

653
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:45,600
We had

654
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm just trying to give like malady energy.

655
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,760
Yeah, it is, it's really, it is English, it's very John McLean, very Quentin Crisp, very

656
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
aristocrat.

657
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm super fucking naked right now, that's crazy.

658
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,680
That's super fucking crazy.

659
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,960
According to traditional gender roles, men are useful for their labor and women are useful

660
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
for their wombs.

661
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,080
Well, I'm a woman without a womb, so I guess I'm useless, but I'm beautifully useless.

662
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,400
Ugh, I'm a work of art.

663
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,480
The problem with our society is we've turned men into women.

664
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
It's disgusting.

665
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,520
As an ally to men, it's not my place to speak for them or speak over them, but I just want

666
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:06,040
to use my platform to uplift some male voices who might not have as many subscribers as

667
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
me.

668
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Okay.

669
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,720
And I'm not hypergamous, I don't need a rich husband.

670
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,720
If I may quote Cher, I don't need a rich man.

671
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I am a rich man.

672
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,680
It's not even really much of an insult being called a delusional man.

673
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Many great books have been written by delusional men.

674
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
So bad.

675
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm bad.

676
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,440
I'm really bad.

677
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,800
Okay.
