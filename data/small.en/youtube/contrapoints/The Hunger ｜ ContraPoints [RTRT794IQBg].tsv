0	17400	The following program is a work of fiction created for educational, artistic, and harm
17400	21520	reduction purposes, in compliance with the video corp Charms of Service.
21520	24760	I love the rules.
24760	28720	Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.
29280	32760	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
32760	34760	T.S. Natalie Wynn.
40760	41760	War.
41760	43840	What is it good for?
43840	44840	Absolutely.
44840	45840	Quad.
45840	46840	Sam.
46840	47840	Everything.
47840	52040	According to the National Institute for Strategic American Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity
52040	53840	Commerce Policy Research.
53840	54840	Hi.
54840	56640	I'm Jackie Jackson.
56640	60880	You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say.
60880	63520	It only matters that you say.
63520	69560	We don't discriminate here between what is true or false or even downright dangerous.
69560	71720	That's none of my business.
71720	73600	It's none of America's business.
73600	78160	The important thing is that you never stop talking.
78160	82040	Because that's what freedom is all about.
82040	85080	Tonight, the war on drugs.
85080	90600	How do we get these goddamn junkies off the streets?
94600	101880	My first guest is Justine Tableau, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize
101880	105480	Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.
105480	107080	The editor chooses the title.
107080	108240	I didn't choose the title.
108240	114680	And my second guest is Virginia Lamb, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.
114680	116960	Virginia, let's begin with you.
116960	123120	Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese
123120	128600	Fentivoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little
128600	130200	minds on hype.
130200	137680	The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.
137680	140560	How have we reached this point?
140560	142760	Two words, Jackie.
142760	146000	Sexual anarchy.
146000	147120	Let that sink in.
147120	149000	Let what sink in?
149000	150400	Sexual anarchy?
150400	151400	What does that even mean?
151400	154800	Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.
154800	159880	The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with
159880	161560	aimless fornication.
161560	167000	They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.
167000	173080	That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, global homo
173080	174640	pomo nomo.
174640	179520	The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.
179520	185320	And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America.
185320	187120	The Christian majority.
187120	193480	Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?
193480	195240	Of course, Jackie.
195240	197080	Religious liberties are under attack.
197080	202220	We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in
202220	208240	public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral
208240	213920	bathrooms and drag queens' story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working
213920	216920	power of the precious blood of the lamb.
216920	219960	Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country.
219960	222680	I'm sorry that you feel offended by it.
222680	227160	If it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever twisted
227160	229680	necromancy these people think is Christianity.
229680	233680	Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children.
233680	238400	And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot.
238400	239920	Parents get no say anymore.
239920	245680	They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted
245680	246680	in schools.
246680	251440	You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.
251440	253600	What's the real agenda here?
253600	255520	Sexual indoctrination.
255520	263360	This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the
263360	271320	remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,
271320	273320	or worse, Episcopalians.
273320	274320	No.
274320	276480	No, I won't stand for that.
276480	277480	I'm sorry.
277480	279120	What does this have to do with drugs?
279120	280120	No.
280120	281120	Everything.
281120	283280	Addiction and sexual brokenness.
283280	289380	These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.
289380	294280	Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.
294280	296440	Is anyone going to ask me what I think?
296440	300720	Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted
300720	301720	hate preacher?
301720	305240	Well, God has nothing to do with hate.
305240	306680	Christ is the definition of love.
306680	308840	Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia.
308880	310160	I'm talking about you.
310160	314640	Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?
314640	318920	You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.
318920	319920	Exactly.
319920	325800	Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm, rational conversation
325800	328120	with people who have different opinions?
328120	329120	Okay.
329120	331440	Well, let's see how that goes.
331440	337440	Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness
337440	340240	and protect the rights of children.
340240	345240	Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative
345240	348320	therapy that will make them whole again.
348320	349760	Reparative therapy?
349760	354400	You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?
354400	359920	What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken
359920	363200	and polluted and they need God to make them whole.
363200	366960	You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.
366960	369840	Are you cancel culturing me right now?
369840	372760	Oh my God, she's totally cancel culturing you right now.
372760	375280	Are you thought policing me?
375280	376280	No.
376280	378960	I'm trying to stop you from thought policing everyone else.
378960	380800	You're saying it should be a thought crime?
380800	386520	You're saying that I am a thought criminal just because I happen to believe in the traditional
386520	389680	biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman who form a covenant before
389680	392760	God who gave his only begotten son to watch away the sins of the world when he died on
392760	396200	the cross and was resurrected three days later, all glory to his name.
396200	399520	Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.
399520	402880	And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say
402880	404120	anything anymore.
404120	409240	And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.
409240	412280	You know who's really being silenced?
412280	414840	People who are silent.
414840	418080	Being silent is a big part of being silenced.
418080	420520	That's what being silenced means.
420520	422640	So who's really being silenced?
422640	424760	Not people on podcasts.
424760	429640	Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced
429640	430640	they are.
430640	431640	No.
431640	437880	The people who are silenced are people we never hear from because, and I really can't
437880	441960	emphasize this enough, they are silenced.
441960	447600	People in prison, queer teenagers in conservative towns, the actual downtrodden and oppressed
447600	449080	people of this country.
449080	451800	Not you, Miss America.
451800	453920	Not you, Mother Superior.
453920	455720	You're not silenced.
455720	458440	You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.
458440	461200	So you defend your right to say it.
461200	467200	Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the N-word?
467200	469440	Why do you want to say the N-word?
469440	477000	So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?
477000	479240	God damn it, Jackie.
479240	485600	That sounds a little bit like being silenced.
485600	486600	She's stonewalling me.
486600	492360	All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain
492360	496000	that there's certain words they just can't say.
496000	504200	Because of the color of their skin, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.
504200	505200	Would he?
505200	508080	I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.
508080	512080	Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the Gospel?
512080	513080	That's not the topic.
513080	518640	I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion
518640	522080	for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.
522080	527440	You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the Pride Parade, doing all this
527440	533600	sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,
533600	539200	I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging, and
539200	540200	I feel for them.
540200	541200	I really do.
541200	546840	Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.
546840	551920	You know, what you people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate, but all
551920	556120	you're really doing is calling in to question the worthiness of other people's lives.
556120	560960	Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?
560960	562840	Whatever happened to love your neighbor?
562840	568080	Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that
568080	569200	they know.
569200	573160	But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.
573160	578040	And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down to the intimidation tactics
578040	580520	of the secular ruling elite.
580520	586000	It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed
586000	591000	that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore, that we're all supposed to
591000	598000	submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their queer ideology, which says
598000	602600	that if your child comes home from school and announces she's a different gender this
602600	608160	week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife.
608160	610840	Slicing up tiny little children's bodies.
610840	613400	That's where this is headed.
613400	615000	The Shrine of Moloch.
615000	618960	Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies.
618960	620000	What are you talking about?
620000	621440	You absolute lunatic.
621440	627360	Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should
627360	633760	let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.
633760	637560	Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?
637560	640920	Or should I say, Justin?
640920	642760	Oh come on!
642760	643760	Really?
644760	646760	Alright, we're doing this.
658760	662760	Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?
662760	665760	Is this a throwback to the 1970s?
665760	669760	No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fuck.
669760	672760	Well, don't mind if I do.
673760	678760	Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.
678760	680760	Good Virginia tobacco.
680760	684760	Jackie, the Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sailor use of cigarettes, vaporizers,
684760	687760	or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.
687760	689760	Some restrictions apply, results may vary.
689760	690760	Excuse me, Jackie.
690760	692760	I'm really not comfortable with this.
692760	697760	I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today.
697760	701760	And I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.
701760	706760	Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.
706760	710760	Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,
710760	715760	then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.
715760	717760	Excuse me?
717760	721760	I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.
721760	725760	I'm a libertarian, and even goes baby USA.
725760	730760	Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.
730760	737760	Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a free-for-all.
737760	739760	And now, here we are.
739760	742760	96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.
742760	748760	It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden,
748760	752760	and Kaden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.
752760	756760	Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.
757760	762760	And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.
762760	764760	And that's the real agenda here.
764760	771760	These people want to lower the age of consent and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,
771760	775760	and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.
775760	783760	Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it, why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses back to the nunnery in old Missouri?
783760	786760	Do they not have demons to slay in the backcountry?
786760	791760	I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness.
791760	795760	For the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.
795760	801760	Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.
801760	805760	We're living in Orwell's nightmare, but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.
805760	806760	Amazing.
806760	811760	Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room
811760	813760	and have a respectful conversation.
813760	815760	Cheers to us.
815760	817760	Is it great?
817760	819760	You know, I don't think it's that great.
819760	822760	And I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you sitting here
822760	825760	interrogating the morality of queer people.
825760	827760	Something you know absolutely nothing about.
827760	830760	Oh, I know more than you might think.
830760	833760	I used to be a homosexual.
835760	836760	You what?
836760	837760	No, I'm not doing this today.
837760	838760	I'm sorry.
838760	841760	You used to be a homosexual?
841760	842760	That's right, Jackie.
842760	844760	Before I was saved, here we go.
844760	845760	I used to be a lesbian.
845760	846760	That's who I thought I was.
846760	849760	I lived that lifestyle.
849760	851760	You used to be a lesbian.
851760	852760	Okay.
852760	854760	Name five things you love about men.
854760	855760	This should be good.
855760	856760	Gather around, everyone.
856760	858760	Let's all witness the power of Christ.
858760	860760	I'm sure this will be very convincing.
860760	864760	I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.
864760	866760	He commands me to be holy.
866760	867760	Fear not.
867760	869760	You will no longer live in shame.
869760	873760	For your creator will be your husband.
873760	874760	Okay.
874760	877760	Well, if you want to be the bride of Christ, then by all means,
877760	879760	but, you know, keep it in the bedroom.
879760	882760	I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle on everyone's face.
882760	884760	Virginia, I'm confused.
884760	886760	I thought people are just born that way.
886760	889760	Like, Jesus can't change that.
889760	893760	Jackie, the mainstream media establishment doesn't want you to know
893760	898760	that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative.
898760	902760	But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.
902760	907760	The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.
907760	911760	But what if every addict said, well, I'm just a junkie.
911760	913760	That's who I am.
913760	918760	I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.
918760	920760	Well, that's a good point.
920760	922760	Uh, no, it isn't.
922760	924760	Gay is just a feeling.
924760	928760	Homosexual lust, same-sex temptation.
928760	931760	That's a feeling, not an identity.
931760	936760	Like, maybe you struggle with wrath, but you don't identify as wrathful.
936760	938760	Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.
938760	940760	I want to punch you in the face.
940760	942760	And yet, you haven't punched me.
942760	948760	Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.
948760	952760	When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,
952760	956760	and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.
956760	959760	My old self has been crucified with Christ.
959760	963760	It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.
963760	968760	But before I made God Lord of my desires, I was controlled by sin.
968760	969760	By drugs.
969760	970760	By alcohol.
970760	972760	By homosexuality.
972760	975760	So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.
975760	977760	Wow, behold the power of Christ.
977760	981760	You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?
981760	982760	Yes, I do.
982760	983760	It's pretty cool.
983760	987760	I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.
987760	989760	Is this a joke to you?
989760	991760	Do you find this humorous?
991760	993760	Yeah, I don't.
993760	997760	Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,
997760	1001760	where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin.
1001760	1004760	Away from God, shut out from grace,
1004760	1008760	tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.
1011760	1014760	Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.
1014760	1017760	Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?
1017760	1021760	Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?
1021760	1022760	That's right, Jackie.
1022760	1024760	What were you addicted to?
1024760	1025760	Miracle whip?
1025760	1026760	Veggie tails?
1026760	1028760	Communion wafers, maybe?
1028760	1029760	No.
1029760	1032760	I was addicted to alcohol?
1032760	1033760	To pornography?
1033760	1036760	To lusting after women?
1036760	1038760	And to hype?
1038760	1039760	Hype?
1039760	1043760	You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?
1043760	1046760	Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?
1046760	1049760	Because I am intrigued.
1049760	1051760	Jackie, I would love to testify.
1051760	1056760	You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.
1056760	1057760	Girl, not this.
1057760	1059760	When I left home, I was lost.
1059760	1061760	I was a wretch.
1061760	1062760	I was on fire.
1062760	1064760	And I rebuked that fire.
1064760	1066760	I used foul language.
1066760	1068760	I went out clubbing.
1068760	1069760	I cut my hair off.
1069760	1071760	I gained weight.
1071760	1074760	I was tempted by same-sex attraction.
1074760	1077760	And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?
1077760	1079760	I was always a little more masculine.
1079760	1082760	I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.
1082760	1084760	I used to shoot up testosterone.
1084760	1086760	That's why my voice is a little lower.
1086760	1088760	Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same, honestly.
1088760	1091760	If I didn't know, I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.
1091760	1094760	Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.
1094760	1097760	Though, if anything, this one's the man.
1097760	1099760	He's the one injecting testosterone.
1099760	1103760	God has healed the feminine within me.
1103760	1106760	All along, God was tugging at my heart.
1106760	1110760	But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.
1110760	1114760	I felt a terrible void inside.
1114760	1116760	I lived in the flesh.
1116760	1121760	I lived in sin with another woman, hoping to satisfy that hunger.
1121760	1122760	Here we go.
1122760	1127760	When I gazed upon her beauty, I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.
1127760	1133760	But the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own wickedness.
1133760	1136760	I knew that lifestyle was wrong.
1136760	1138760	But I couldn't quit.
1138760	1141760	Until she broke my heart.
1142760	1144760	And then...
1144760	1147760	I was cast into the outer darkness.
1147760	1150760	Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.
1150760	1153760	It was like a part of me was ripped away.
1153760	1156760	And I was left to face my brokenness alone.
1156760	1158760	Well, was she a Capricorn?
1158760	1160760	No, a Sagittarius.
1160760	1162760	Well, there's your problem.
1162760	1164760	Next time, maybe try a water sign.
1164760	1166760	Stop interrupting.
1166760	1167760	I'm living for the drama.
1167760	1169760	Jackie, I was alone.
1169760	1171760	I was suicidal.
1171760	1172760	I was an addict.
1172760	1174760	I was lost.
1174760	1179760	Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.
1179760	1184760	And I was surrounded by these women singing.
1184760	1186760	What can wash away my sin?
1186760	1189760	What can make me whole again?
1189760	1196760	Nothing but the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow.
1196760	1199760	And I felt this tingling all over my body.
1199760	1205760	And I knew I was hearing the voice of God for the very first time.
1205760	1211760	Not just the words of the hymn, but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.
1211760	1213760	Yes, we all like music.
1213760	1215760	And suddenly my pain made sense.
1215760	1218760	I don't have to live this way anymore.
1218760	1222760	In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.
1222760	1223760	I was cleansed.
1223760	1225760	I was healed.
1225760	1226760	I was delivered.
1226760	1227760	I was sanctified.
1227760	1229760	I was redeemed.
1229760	1231760	My guilty stains were washed away.
1231760	1236760	And I exchanged my brokenness and pain for His loving grace.
1236760	1240760	Okay, so I'm confused.
1240760	1242760	Do you eat dick now?
1242760	1243760	What's your deal?
1243760	1248760	Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room with a repentant heart
1248760	1251760	and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.
1251760	1256760	When I found Jesus, I found someone who truly loves me.
1256760	1262760	And through obedience to Him, my identity is no longer in my attractions.
1262760	1264760	But in Christ.
1264760	1265760	You know what I think, Virginia?
1265760	1270760	I think that you are immoderate in love and immoderate with substances.
1270760	1274760	And so you need an imaginary Father figure to make all the rules
1274760	1276760	because you can't control yourself.
1276760	1279760	But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else
1279760	1282760	should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.
1282760	1284760	Mental infancy?
1284760	1288760	Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.
1288760	1291760	I know, Justin, the chains of sin.
1291760	1298760	I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh, the itch, the ache, the shame.
1298760	1299760	I lived in mud.
1299760	1301760	I lived in filth.
1301760	1304760	I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,
1304760	1309760	the great whirlwind that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain.
1309760	1314760	But my shame was hammered to the cross for those who belong to Christ,
1314760	1319760	how crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
1319760	1327760	Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?
1327760	1330760	Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?
1330760	1331760	God?
1331760	1333760	I really don't think He cares, Gorge.
1333760	1336760	Celipacy is not a good deed.
1336760	1340760	To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay
1340760	1342760	and you hate yourself.
1342760	1345760	I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.
1345760	1349760	Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self?
1349760	1350760	Where is my nail?
1350760	1355760	Is it hate to be anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation?
1355760	1356760	Damn it.
1356760	1360760	To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity of who God made me?
1360760	1364760	Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole
1364760	1367760	through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit?
1367760	1369760	Have you been made whole, Virginia?
1369760	1373760	Because to me, it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul
1373760	1375760	and you call it sin and shame.
1375760	1379760	Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.
1379760	1382760	Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrado?
1382760	1384760	She's hilarious. She's a witch.
1384760	1387760	We are all half angel and half beast.
1387760	1391760	The flesh must die so the spirit may live.
1391760	1394760	The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.
1394760	1397760	Have you really wandered so far as stray?
1397760	1401760	Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom
1401760	1405760	that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?
1405760	1407760	No, Virginia, that's not what I think.
1407760	1412760	What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding
1412760	1416760	of human sexuality and you're on a save-the-children-type
1416760	1420760	moral crusade because you lack the adult capacity
1420760	1422760	to face the demons in your own head.
1422760	1426760	You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.
1426760	1429760	Well, what even is that, Virginia?
1429760	1431760	I want specifics.
1431760	1435760	What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're going to do
1435760	1438760	if Jesus stops holding your hand for ten minutes?
1438760	1439760	What?
1439760	1443760	You think you're going to rail a line of hype off a stripper's tits?
1443760	1444760	Excuse me?
1444760	1445760	Answer this.
1445760	1448760	What do you think erotic love is a desire for?
1448760	1451760	Wait, I know this one.
1451760	1452760	Sex.
1452760	1455760	No, that's too easy.
1455760	1459760	Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.
1459760	1465760	It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,
1465760	1470760	to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,
1470760	1474760	to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive.
1474760	1477760	Love is not the flesh.
1477760	1479760	It's not temptation.
1479760	1482760	It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.
1482760	1484760	It's nothing like being an alcoholic.
1484760	1487760	It's not a craving.
1487760	1490760	It's a yearning.
1490760	1494760	The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.
1494760	1499760	But you people don't understand that because you are vulgarians.
1499760	1503760	You have no sense of humanity, and you have no sense of the erotic.
1503760	1508760	Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal, Marxist bullcrap.
1508760	1512760	Jackie, your brain is so small.
1512760	1514760	It's just so tiny.
1514760	1516760	Look at me.
1516760	1518760	You're a dum-dum, okay?
1518760	1520760	And I'm going to need you to stop talking.
1520760	1526760	As usual, the cancel culture woke Stoppo is trying to silence me.
1526760	1530760	Shh, Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time,
1530760	1534760	because you're so stupid, and I can't stand it anymore.
1534760	1536760	So shut up.
1536760	1539760	I'm giving you the plague, liberal.
1539760	1543760	Okay, well, I hope it kills me, because I'm done.
1543760	1545760	See, I'll never get sick, because every day,
1545760	1549760	I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.
1549760	1551760	Doctors don't want you to know about it.
1551760	1553760	I could not possibly be more done.
1553760	1555760	You may be done, but I'm not.
1555760	1557760	Well, you people never are, are you?
1557760	1559760	You want to talk about yearning?
1559760	1560760	I mean, I get it.
1560760	1562760	I used to live in shame.
1562760	1565760	I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.
1565760	1567760	Yes, we've all noticed.
1567760	1570760	Let me tell you, it is not freedom, it is bondage.
1570760	1574760	You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.
1574760	1576760	The flesh possesses you.
1576760	1581760	Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave,
1581760	1583760	for the wages of sin is death,
1583760	1587760	but the gift of God is eternal life and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1587760	1590760	You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?
1590760	1594760	Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.
1594760	1597760	Only he can fill the void.
1597760	1598760	I know.
1598760	1600760	I used to be like you, Justin.
1600760	1601760	I was lost.
1601760	1602760	I was blind.
1602760	1605760	I was confused in my identity.
1605760	1607760	I used to reject the gospel,
1607760	1609760	until my sin took everything from me,
1609760	1611760	and I needed a savior.
1611760	1614760	And then, I called out to God for salvation,
1614760	1617760	and he came to me as a loving father.
1617760	1620760	It's not too late for you, Justin.
1620760	1622760	You are so loved.
1622760	1624760	God loves you.
1624760	1626760	But this?
1626760	1628760	This is not God's intent for you.
1628760	1632760	It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent,
1632760	1634760	the height of cosmological narcissism.
1634760	1637760	I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?
1637760	1640760	Have we run out of fedoras in America?
1640760	1642760	I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.
1642760	1645760	I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.
1645760	1646760	God is love.
1646760	1647760	Is he?
1647760	1649760	The only love worth having.
1649760	1651760	What you call love.
1651760	1653760	The sin I used to live in.
1653760	1655760	The world, the flesh, and the devil.
1655760	1658760	That only ever brought me pain.
1658760	1661760	Yes, because heartbreak is painful.
1661760	1662760	Love is painful.
1662760	1665760	The poets are unanimous.
1665760	1667760	Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.
1667760	1669760	Eros, giver of pain.
1669760	1671760	What's Sappho?
1671760	1673760	A pagan pornographer.
1673760	1675760	The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.
1675760	1679760	Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,
1679760	1681760	then God damn it.
1681760	1683760	I don't know who can.
1683760	1685760	Well, God for one.
1685760	1687760	God has a sexual plan for all of us.
1687760	1688760	That's odd.
1688760	1692760	God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.
1692760	1695760	Men's and women's bodies fit together
1695760	1697760	for the purpose of creating children.
1697760	1700760	You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?
1700760	1705760	Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by, even in this economy.
1705760	1706760	You have a guy?
1706760	1708760	A semen guy?
1708760	1709760	That's just most guys.
1709760	1712760	Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,
1712760	1716760	but since I'm among heathens, clearly,
1716760	1721760	I will do my best to argue not from faith, but from reason.
1721760	1722760	I love reason.
1722760	1723760	Do you?
1723760	1724760	Tell me this, Justin.
1724760	1726760	Which is better?
1726760	1728760	A love that is eternal?
1728760	1731760	Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?
1731760	1733760	I'm sorry your girlfriend left you.
1733760	1734760	That must have been really hard.
1734760	1736760	Just to answer the question.
1736760	1738760	Nothing is eternal, Virginia.
1738760	1740760	Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.
1740760	1746760	Isn't a love that is eternal, superior to a love that is fleeting?
1746760	1748760	Yes, Socrates, it is certain.
1748760	1750760	And don't you yearn?
1750760	1752760	Not just for a love in the moment,
1752760	1755760	but for a love that lasts eternity?
1755760	1757760	Yes, Socrates, that is evident.
1757760	1764760	And isn't eternal love what we call God?
1764760	1767760	Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,
1767760	1770760	but sometimes we don't get what we want.
1770760	1771760	Hmm.
1771760	1775760	So you have no argument.
1775760	1776760	Do I really need an argument?
1776760	1778760	This is just a semantic trick.
1778760	1781760	You're saying that God is eternal love,
1781760	1784760	and then magically that must exist because
1784760	1786760	you defined it that way.
1786760	1790760	So you don't have an argument?
1790760	1791760	I'm sorry.
1791760	1792760	Interesting.
1792760	1795760	I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism
1795760	1798760	with a five-alarm lesbo cosplaying as a tradwife.
1798760	1800760	I'm supposed to take this seriously?
1800760	1801760	Why?
1801760	1802760	Why am I even here?
1802760	1803760	What am I doing?
1803760	1804760	Why am I talking to these people?
1804760	1809760	I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.
1809760	1812760	I don't think God leads people to podcasts.
1812760	1815760	Clearly, this transgender identity of yours
1815760	1819760	is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.
1819760	1822760	There's a hunger in your soul.
1822760	1825760	No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.
1825760	1830760	Do not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land.
1830760	1833760	Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.
1833760	1835760	I'm sure we all feel the thirst.
1835760	1837760	If I may quote Psalm 63, please don't.
1837760	1841760	You, God, oh my God, earnestly I seek you.
1841760	1845760	I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you,
1845760	1849760	in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
1849760	1853760	Because your love is better than life,
1853760	1856760	my lips will glorify you.
1856760	1859760	I will praise you as long as I live,
1859760	1863760	and in your name I will raise up my hands.
1863760	1868760	I will be fully satisfied, as in the richest of foods,
1868760	1873760	with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
1873760	1876760	Virginia, go to therapy.
1876760	1879760	Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.
1879760	1881760	You're the one who needs to go to therapy.
1881760	1882760	No, you go to therapy.
1882760	1884760	I'll pray for you.
1884760	1885760	I'll pray for you.
1885760	1887760	I will pray straight to Satan.
1887760	1891760	Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little looney toons?
1891760	1894760	You have your Jesus bullshit.
1894760	1896760	You have your gender nonsense.
1896760	1900760	And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.
1900760	1902760	The free market, right.
1902760	1905760	We all have our little delusions.
1905760	1908760	The important thing is that we cling to them,
1908760	1912760	and we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way.
1912760	1915760	Because that's what makes us free.
1915760	1918760	And freedom is what makes America great.
1918760	1922760	Other countries, they don't have choices.
1922760	1928760	But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.
1928760	1929760	So can we do drugs?
1929760	1931760	No, that's illegal.
1931760	1933760	I thought you said we could choose.
1933760	1936760	Yes, but we have to make the right choices.
1936760	1938760	And what if we want to make the wrong choices?
1938760	1941760	Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.
1941760	1944760	You will be locked in a tiny cage.
1944760	1946760	That is literally the opposite of freedom.
1946760	1949760	Well, we have to be tough on crime.
1949760	1951760	It's the only way to keep this country free.
1951760	1954760	We have to build more prisons.
1954760	1957760	Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?
1957760	1959760	Well, Father decides.
1959760	1960760	Father always decides.
1960760	1963760	And do you always do what Father says?
1963760	1964760	Of course.
1964760	1966760	We always do what Father says.
1966760	1967760	Why?
1967760	1969760	Because Father says so.
1969760	1974760	Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?
1974760	1975760	Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.
1975760	1976760	Yes, you do.
1976760	1980760	You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.
1980760	1981760	No, I'm not.
1981760	1984760	I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.
1984760	1986760	My heart was also broken by a woman.
1986760	1988760	I thought she was a cat girl.
1988760	1990760	She turned out to be a fuckboy.
1990760	1993760	You are a straight man.
1993760	1995760	I mean, at this point, I wish.
1995760	1998760	But no, definitely a gay woman.
1998760	2000760	We're all stuck with it.
2000760	2001760	Hold on.
2001760	2005760	So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.
2005760	2008760	Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?
2008760	2009760	No.
2009760	2010760	In the mirror?
2010760	2013760	No, because I'm not a fucking animal.
2013760	2017760	I can't tell the difference between my own reflection and a different person.
2017760	2021760	Desire is always for something that you lack.
2021760	2025760	You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.
2025760	2028760	Desire feeds on absence.
2028760	2031760	It reaches out across a void.
2031760	2032760	I don't know.
2032760	2035760	I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.
2035760	2036760	Okay.
2036760	2038760	Well, thank you for sharing.
2038760	2042760	Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?
2042760	2045760	Do you have bodies in your basement?
2045760	2047760	You better watch out or you're going to be next.
2047760	2049760	Are those clothes even yours?
2049760	2052760	Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?
2052760	2057760	Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,
2057760	2059760	and I will feast upon it.
2059760	2064760	Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.
2064760	2066760	It's not enough for you to possess a woman.
2066760	2069760	You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.
2069760	2072760	Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?
2072760	2074760	You're the one who keeps bringing that up.
2074760	2075760	Nice.
2075760	2076760	Got her.
2076760	2077760	Shut up, dum-dum.
2077760	2080760	I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.
2080760	2081760	You stay out of this.
2081760	2083760	Look, so you're a straight man.
2083760	2085760	You could have had a wife.
2085760	2087760	You could have raised a family.
2087760	2089760	Your life could have meant something.
2089760	2091760	But you threw it all away.
2091760	2094760	You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?
2094760	2096760	Do you have babies?
2096760	2098760	Well, priests don't have babies.
2098760	2101760	Maybe you think of queer people as priests.
2101760	2104760	Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.
2104760	2106760	Whoa, okay.
2106760	2107760	That's Catholics.
2107760	2108760	That's not Christians.
2108760	2110760	That's kind of crossing a line, don't you think?
2110760	2112760	Oh, has free speech gone too far?
2112760	2114760	Now it's gone too far.
2114760	2117760	Can we have a civil conversation, please?
2117760	2121760	Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?
2121760	2123760	Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.
2124760	2127760	Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility
2127760	2133760	by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.
2133760	2137760	I walk with the Spirit until the day I go to glory.
2137760	2139760	That's my meaning.
2139760	2141760	Your meaning is what?
2141760	2145760	To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty
2145760	2149760	until you rot away un-resurrected in the earth?
2149760	2151760	And for what?
2151760	2154760	To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?
2154760	2156760	Anything else would be a lie.
2156760	2160760	If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.
2160760	2164760	And with or without your approval and understanding,
2164760	2167760	I will always be the way I am.
2167760	2172760	Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?
2172760	2177760	I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.
2177760	2178760	Just...
2179760	2181760	Leave children out of it.
2181760	2186760	Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.
2186760	2192760	And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.
2201760	2202760	Listen, Justin.
2202760	2207760	I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.
2207760	2210760	I know my place in this world.
2210760	2216760	I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.
2216760	2222760	Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A dollar sign community?
2222760	2224760	Well, obviously not.
2224760	2229760	Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.
2229760	2232760	Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.
2232760	2240760	So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl GF.
2240760	2243760	Can you honestly say that you're happy?
2243760	2246760	That you're fulfilled?
2246760	2249760	That you have purpose?
2249760	2252760	That you have hope?
2263760	2266760	That you have purpose?
2266760	2268760	That you have purpose?
2268760	2270760	That you have purpose?
2270760	2272760	That you have purpose?
2272760	2274760	That you have purpose?
2274760	2276760	That you have purpose?
2276760	2278760	That you have purpose?
2278760	2280760	That you have purpose?
2280760	2282760	That you have purpose?
2282760	2284760	That you have purpose?
2284760	2286760	That you have purpose?
2286760	2288760	That you have purpose?
2288760	2290760	Just do it.
2290760	2292760	Just do it.
2292760	2294760	Just do it.
2294760	2296760	Just do it.
2296760	2298760	Just do it.
2298760	2300760	Just do it.
2300760	2301760	Hello?
2301760	2302760	Just do it.
2302760	2304760	Hello?
2308760	2310760	Jesus.
2310760	2312760	Don't say that name in front of me.
2312760	2314760	How did you get in my house?
2314760	2317760	Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.
2317760	2319760	Who are you?
2319760	2321760	What are you?
2321760	2324760	Well, I used to be an angel.
2324760	2326760	And now?
2326760	2331760	Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.
2331760	2333760	A satanic visitation.
2333760	2340760	At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?
2340760	2341760	Yes.
2341760	2344760	Is this going to be a weird sex thing?
2344760	2346760	Do you want it to be?
2346760	2347760	No.
2347760	2349760	Look, I've had a terrible day.
2349760	2351760	I'm really not in the mood for this.
2351760	2353760	Well, I can help you with that.
2353760	2354760	Can you?
2354760	2355760	Sure.
2355760	2357760	I can help with anything.
2357760	2367760	Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.
2367760	2369760	Shame?
2369760	2371760	Is it the shame?
2371760	2372760	Well, yeah.
2372760	2373760	There is the shame.
2373760	2375760	There's always going to be the shame.
2375760	2377760	But it's a complex cocktail.
2377760	2378760	There's the heartbreak.
2378760	2380760	There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.
2380760	2382760	I'm a parched landloose.
2382760	2385760	I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.
2385760	2388760	Oh, emptiness inside?
2388760	2392760	Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.
2392760	2394760	I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.
2394760	2396760	It's not a weird sex thing.
2396760	2398760	Potions, Justine.
2398760	2400760	Potions.
2400760	2404760	I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.
2404760	2411760	Potions, elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.
2411760	2417760	Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary, a dealer.
2417760	2420760	Are you trying to get demonetized?
2420760	2421760	Sorry.
2421760	2423760	What potions do you have?
2423760	2427760	Well, this is one of my favorites.
2427760	2430760	It's called hype.
2430760	2432760	This will make you come alive.
2432760	2434760	I'm going to jump right out of your show.
2434760	2439760	Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.
2439760	2443760	You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.
2443760	2445760	You'll finally get things done.
2445760	2447760	You'll connect with people.
2447760	2451760	You'll always know just what to say.
2451760	2454760	Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.
2454760	2458760	At this point, I just want the pain to stop.
2458760	2460760	Pain.
2460760	2464760	Well, I surely have something for that.
2464760	2467760	It's called void.
2467760	2472760	One drop of this, and all the pain will melt away.
2472760	2476760	The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,
2476760	2482760	the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.
2482760	2486760	All of that will fade away under a warm blanket
2486760	2490760	of serenity and love.
2490760	2495760	Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.
2495760	2498760	And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.
2498760	2502760	Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.
2502760	2509760	You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness all alone?
2509760	2513760	What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?
2513760	2515760	Because it was embarrassing.
2515760	2518760	Humiliating, honestly. It was difficult to watch.
2518760	2519760	Shut up.
2519760	2521760	Is it some kind of masochism?
2521760	2524760	You just want to feel all the pain, man?
2524760	2526760	Because you're not impressing anyone.
2526760	2528760	I mean, what is your plan for this evening?
2528760	2531760	You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?
2531760	2533760	Because that is pathetic.
2533760	2535760	And it's so unnecessary.
2535760	2538760	Because you're choosing to feel bad.
2538760	2544760	When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.
2544760	2547760	Pass.
2547760	2549760	The cool kids are doing it.
2549760	2552760	The cool kids are absolutely not doing it because it's not the 90s.
2552760	2556760	Kids today are vaping Benadryl. Don't you keep up with this?
2556760	2562760	Okay, I mean, I respect your choice, but I'm not going anywhere.
2562760	2565760	I will stay right here.
2565760	2570760	And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes
2570760	2574760	that your pain is optional.
2574760	2577760	And I have the antidote right here.
2577760	2585760	But I guess you'd just rather feel pain and shame and humiliation
2586760	2592760	and a heartbreak and boredom, loneliness,
2592760	2602760	despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.
2602760	2605760	Look, I'm a smart person, okay?
2605760	2609760	And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.
2609760	2615760	Pathetic? Is it pathetic to feel good?
2615760	2619760	Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.
2619760	2624760	And to me, that's pathetic.
2624760	2632760	Well, the thing about that is...
2632760	2635760	Okay, just give me the goddamn void.
2635760	2637760	Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.
2637760	2639760	I thought I was going to be here all night.
2639760	2643760	Well, my will is weak, okay? Can I have the potion, please?
2643760	2645760	All right, well, let's be a little patient.
2645760	2649760	You should really do this the right way, okay? It's called a harm reduction.
2649760	2657760	What you're going to do is put one drop and only one drop of pure void into water.
2657760	2662760	This is important. Do not do too many drops.
2662760	2664760	What happens if I do too many drops?
2664760	2666760	Oh, you'll probably die.
2666760	2667760	I'll die?
2667760	2669760	I told you it was important.
2669760	2671760	Well, how many drops is too many drops?
2671760	2675760	Well, it's difficult to say exactly. It depends on a lot of factors.
2675760	2676760	Seriously?
2676760	2689760	But it's your first time, so just do one.
2689760	2691760	So, do I just drink it or...
2691760	2694760	Of course you drink it. It's a purely fictional magical potion,
2694760	2697760	utterly disconnected from any real world social issues.
2697760	2699760	What else would you do with it?
2699760	2701760	Okay.
2710760	2712760	Good girl.
2712760	2713760	I don't feel anything.
2713760	2715760	Okay, well, give it a minute.
2715760	2718760	In about 15 seconds, you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.
2718760	2720760	Are you ready for that?
2721760	2725760	Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.
2725760	2727760	In my God.
2727760	2729760	Damn.
2739760	2741760	There she goes.
2741760	2743760	Oh, thank God.
2745760	2748760	Well, don't thank God, thank me.
2748760	2751760	I have a father taking credit for my work.
2778760	2806760	Lucy, Lucy, Luciferia, Mother, a Doctor, Mother, Doctor, Doctor, Mother,
2806760	2810760	Mom, Mother Void, Mother Void.
2814760	2818760	Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.
2818760	2823760	Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?
2823760	2827760	You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.
2827760	2832760	You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.
2832760	2835760	Lucy, can I get a drop?
2835760	2840760	A drop. I thought you didn't want to go down, dark pads.
2841760	2843760	Doctor, my pain is at a ten.
2844760	2847760	I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.
2847760	2851760	I'm a little disappointed, honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase.
2851760	2854760	But there is no chase with you, no chase at all.
2854760	2861760	You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.
2862760	2865760	Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.
2865760	2869760	Please, just give me the void so I can feel the emptiness.
2870760	2874760	If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.
2874760	2877760	But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?
2877760	2882760	You call me Mommy now, because I own you.
2883760	2885760	Yes, Mommy dearest.
2951760	2974760	Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?
2974760	2977760	Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.
2977760	2979760	So you're going to do five drops?
2979760	2983760	Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off.
2983760	2985760	So I'm going to do five drops.
2985760	2990760	Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.
2990760	2992760	By all means, continue.
2992760	2996760	Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.
3009760	3012760	Thank you.
3039760	3068760	That was dumb. That was so dumb.
3069760	3075760	Shit.
3080760	3086760	I need to quit. I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.
3086760	3089760	Oh, you're going to quit, are you?
3089760	3093760	Yes, Mother. I've got to quit. I just...
3093760	3095760	Good luck.
3096760	3103760	I'll quit after one more drop, of course.
3109760	3118760	All right, that's it. Never again. I'm quitting. I quit.
3119760	3129760	It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.
3129760	3132760	How hard could that be?
3149760	3159760	Oh, I can't do this. I can't do this. Shit.
3173760	3176760	Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy.
3177760	3180760	Lucy, wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up.
3180760	3182760	Wake up!
3206760	3210760	Lucy, wake up.
3236760	3240760	Lucy, wake up.
3266760	3270760	Lucy, wake up.
3296760	3299760	Lucy, wake up.
3326760	3329760	Lucy, wake up.
3356760	3359760	Lucy, wake up.
3386760	3389760	Lucy, wake up.
3416760	3419760	Lucy, wake up.
