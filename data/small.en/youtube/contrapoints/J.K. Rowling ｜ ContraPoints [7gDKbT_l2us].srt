1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fire burning cauldron bubble.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Something wicked this way comes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Magical darkness.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A must.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Joanne, I want to talk to you, Joanne.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What is it about Joanne's?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I can't catch a break from these people.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, now that 2020 is finally over,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think we can let the record conclusively show

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that it was a year Homest is bad.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And on top of everything else that was going on,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
truly the last thing we needed was the author of Harry Potter

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
coming forward to announce there's two things she can't stand.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bickertree and the Transgenders.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Elderberry wand.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Turjid.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With a core of...

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ice dragon.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Lumos.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can we afford spells?

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is that in the budget?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Expecto Patreon.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, you've probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Unless you've been living under a rock, in which case,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
get back under that rock, sweetie.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There is nothing good going on up here.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not worth it.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did was say biological sex is real.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists are trying to silence her.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is cancel culture gone too far.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is a witch hunt.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Celebrities are under attack.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is the new Salem.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is Orwell's nightmare.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a painful topic for me all around,

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because as a transgender woman,

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things Joanne has said in the last year.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But I also know what it's like to be the target of a Twitter mob.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I realize that to most people, complaining about being canceled,

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people like J.K. Rowling

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
would be above staying up alone at night reading mean things people say online.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But you'd think wrong.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness of the human condition.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And no amount of fame and money is going to fix that.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, fame alienates you from other people.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which can actually make you feel more alone,

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
even when people are worshipping you as a goddess.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Never mind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The truth is that unless you've personally experienced infamy,

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
being shamed and shunned on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
then you just don't know what it's like.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But Joanne knows, and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
there's a traumatized part of me that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I want to protect.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My nurturing and compassionate nature sometimes gets the best of me.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But there's also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How could you do this to me, Joanne?

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So what I want to do in this video is take Joanne's pain seriously

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and treat her like a complex human being,

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
while also being critical of the things she said about the transgender question.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I also want to explore where the Twitter mob is coming from,

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
because they're in pain too.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And don't they also deserve our understanding?

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So without further ado, let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and see if we can find the truth.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Swish and flick.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, she certainly seems invested in the belief that she is not a bigot.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What vice do you most despise?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Bigotry.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In looking over Joanne's tweets,

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't think the average person would see any problem with what she's said.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
However, I mean, not to be condescending,

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but I feel like the average person's understanding of transgender is still a little bit...

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't really get the whole trans thing.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know, Amber.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why don't you be a feminine man?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who knows? You could be missing out.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So we're going to go through the things that Joanne has said about trans people,

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but I don't want this to be just a drama video or a video saying,

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
cancel Harry Potter, drag her.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Like, I want to try to do something a little bit more meaningful than that.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I'm going to use J.K. Rowe as a case study in bigotry

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and see if we can maybe learn something about what bigotry is.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How does it work?

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
well, for once I think I'll actually have earned my Patreon budget.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
let's spill some shade, throw some tea.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So this all started in 2018 when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and followed an anti-trans account.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, in the interest of giving Joanne as much benefit of the doubt as I can,

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not going to admit this as evidence because I don't want to do guilt by association.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Strike it from the record.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That was fun. I like hammering things.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag,

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I stand with Maya, referencing Maya Forstater.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Maya Forstater is an English consultant who lost her contract

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
with the nonprofit she worked for after she did transphobic tweets.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
in her thread titled, allegedly transphobic tweets.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes, I think that male people are not women.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't think that being a woman or female is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It is biology.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Another says, some people believe that a person with a penis can be a woman.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Some, a majority, don't.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Neither group should be discriminated against in everyday life.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But in situations involving taking your clothes off for strangers,

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
integration of the two groups is not possible.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women and saying,

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
it's all right, it's a woman's penis.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone born female is a woman.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everyone born male is a man.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Trans women are predators who prey on women.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this what you want, Joanne?

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You want to put the sorting hat on humanity and divide us up into little houses?

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor trapped in a half above his body?

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What then, Joanne? What then?

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, if the tweet simply said, I stand with Maya without further explanation,

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you could give her the benefit of the doubt.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job for having bigoted opinions,

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
even if she disagrees with those opinions.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But if that's all she was saying, I wouldn't be making this video, would I?

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The full tweet reads,

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now I'm guessing that to most people, this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It might even seem supportive of trans people since she said we're allowed to dress however we want

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But there's a couple things about this that don't say it right with me.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
First is the phrase, force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint, namely,

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I believe that it is impossible to change your sex or to lose your sex.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men, no change of clothes or hairstyle,

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
no plastic surgery, no accidental illness, no course of hormones, no force of will or social conditioning,

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
no declaration, can turn a female person into a male or a male person into a female.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If Joanne had said Maya had been fired for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and a person born female could never be a man, that would have been more accurate.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But it would also sound contentious and obviously anti-trans.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present Maya Forstetter's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
basic common sense, which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Transphobes love to play this game where they pretend that trans people just don't understand basic biology,

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that's our problem, as if I didn't start taking female hormones because I'm acutely aware

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body, that sex is real.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Really? That's crazy.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How'd you learn so much about science?

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You know, I don't really feel the need to have a second X chromosome.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I get by with one. I make it work.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I actually like the Y chromosome. I think it's a little more dainty, you know,

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it's a little softer, a little more petite.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages, don't you think?

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And I don't need any more of those, thanks.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No trans person thinks it's possible to change chromosomal sex

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
we're talking about psychological and social identity.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So when transphobes say sex is real, they're not actually contradicting anything most trans people believe,

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
except by implication.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
When transphobes say sex is real, what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
which they trivialize, calling it dressing up, fashion choices, whatever you want to call yourself.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When Joanne says, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She's belittling what it actually means to be trans, reducing it to a change of name and costume.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
For example, the homophobic equivalent of Joanne's tweet might read,

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Choose whatever lifestyle you want.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult in the privacy of your own bedroom.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But force Christians out of their jobs for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hashtag, I stand with Kim Davis.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Checkmate the gays, it's just science.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They refer to it as sexual preferences, or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We don't tell straight people to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's also who you love.

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's part of who you are, part of your humanity.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And that's something that stays with you outside of the bedroom.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Likewise, being trans is not a costume I take off at the end of the night.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not a fashion choice.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not a pet name some people call me.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's part of who I am as a person, you know?

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's part of my humanity.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So telling trans people to dress however you want is not really a supportive statement.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks in their videos apologizing for being racist,

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
YouTubers are constantly dragging each other because we see ourselves reflected in the other,

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and we can't stand the sight of it.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So after the Mayan forest daughter tweet, Joanne was silent about trans people for six months.

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But she took up the cause again in June 2019,

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
for us to complain about the use of the phrase people who menstruate in the title of an article trying to include trans men and non-binary people in a discussion of period poverty.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That same night, presumably in response to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers who think Stalin did nothing wrong but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Joanne tweeted a thread, again repeating this slogan that sex is real, adding,

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans?

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If?

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Widespread discrimination against trans people is well documented.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet, the Trump administration removed non-discrimination protections for trans people in health care and health insurance.

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So are you marching with us or not Joanne?

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There's a lot of stuff in these tweets that might seem innocent enough to the average person,

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
but which to someone who understands bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Bigotry always has a history, and in order to understand bigotry, you have to learn that history.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes, narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing, we have to learn them.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No one is born thinking that the gays are destroying the family, or that women are naturally subservient,

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices, you might not notice anything wrong with them.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He never said he hated the Jews.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He is simply concerned about the over-representation of Jewish people in media and banking.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But if you're aware, woke if you will, then it kind of rings alarm bells when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people think sex isn't real, and they're erasing same-sex attraction, and they're silencing women,

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these as familiar transphobic talking points.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Specifically, TERF talking points.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
God, are we still talking about this? I promise, this is the last time.

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So TERFism is a hate movement that disguises transphobia as feminism.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Bigotry has a history.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The foundational TERF text is feminist professor Janice Raymond's 1979 book,

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the S*** Male,

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in which Raymond argues that, quote,

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
all transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy, who, quote,

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and I bring this up because I want to give you a sense of how this kind of transphobe talks when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you keep calling me Nathan, I'm going to call you Nigel.

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Cheerio, old chap.

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Or whatever you people say.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Here's the thing, Nigella.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Bigotry can be mean, yes.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And it usually is when bigots think they can get away with it.

248
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But it's vital to recognize that being mean is not the essence of bigotry.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Bigotry can be hateful, yes.

250
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But specifically, bigotry is hate that poses a political threat to the target group.

251
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The fundamental problem with TERFs is not that they're mean.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's that they're politically reactionary.

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They want to reverse the progress of trans liberation.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In the final chapter of the transsexual empire, Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question, quote,

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She goes on to argue for alternative feminist consciousness raising therapies, admitting,

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am not so naive as to think that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,

257
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but they would at least pose the existence of a real alternative to be explored and tried.

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So like homophobes, TERFs have historically advocated a kind of conversion therapy aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And like the anti-abortion movement, they recognize it's not yet politically practical to completely make illegal a medical procedure they don't like.

260
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So they settle for making it as difficult as possible to get one.

261
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report to the Department of Health and Human Services repeating her arguments against transsexualism,

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
which was cited as a 1981 decision that Medicare would not cover transition-related healthcare.

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.

264
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So there's real political consequences to bigotry.

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's not just a matter of being mean.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.

267
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Unlike Janice Raymond, J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced and very intent on convincing all of us that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally who loves and supports trans people,

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
She's constantly saying things like,

270
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I know and love trans people,

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans at the same time.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
On the contrary, many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A lot of people have a hard time noticing this kind of bigotry,

275
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and I think one reason for that is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
People think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual,

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
which is, of course, a horrible thing to do.

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't care for the English.

279
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There's sick, sick people.

280
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Or people think of bigotry as hate, something inhuman and monstrous.

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So when people hear the word bigot, they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,

282
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But the problem with the Nazis was not that they hated love and friendship.

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
They believed they were defending German blood and soil against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And what were we supposed to do? Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's how Nazi actually thinks, right?

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's not that they hate friendship.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No, they have their own internal logic of victimization and self-righteousness.

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, sometimes people criticize me for empathizing with bigots.

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But I believe that understanding bigots is the best defense against becoming one yourself.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Because when you dehumanize the villains, you become unable to recognize the villain within.

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How is she, though?

295
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Metal straw because I love the environment. I'm so good.

297
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm really fucking good.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The idea that bigotry is simply hate, I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The idea that bigots are people who outright say, we hate you, God hates you.

300
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And we're all marching around with signs about how much we hate you.

301
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Taylor Swift. Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, I don't. I don't want to be a gay icon. I'm just stuck with you people.

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Just kidding.

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Shade never made anybody less gay.

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This isn't shade, Taylor.

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.

310
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And the video for You Need to Calm Down is just so emblematic of this misconception.

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Taylor takes this subject of homophobia and turns it into yet another song about haters.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But in the real world, Backwoods hillbillies stomping around with misspelled signs are not really the problem.

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated and powerful people.

314
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes who say it's an abomination.

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
These perverts are spreading AIDS. They're destroying the family. They're recruiting children.

316
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But these days, it's much more common to hear, of course, I love gay people.

317
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction,

318
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
but it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology promoted in schools

319
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
to children as young as three years old.

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And we get convincing homophobe, don't I?

322
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
There's really two different styles of bigotry.

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They express the same prejudice, but they're very different in tone.

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll call the two styles direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.

325
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.

326
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's a bigotry manifested in slurs and outright discrimination

327
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and demonizing the target group and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate about a host of proxy issues.

329
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.

330
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Frequently, the claim is that a once-needed liberation movement has now gone too far,

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors who are disturbing law and order

332
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
with violent and chaotic protests,

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
who are victimizing and silencing innocent people by calling them bigots,

334
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
who are infiltrating the media and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment with politically correct propaganda.

335
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated to speak out against it

336
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
because cancel culture is out of control and free speech is under attack.

337
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders, rapists,

339
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.

340
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
always a knight in shining armor, defending women, defending the children, defending marriage,

342
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
defending freedom, defending the family, defending our values, defending common sense, defending tradition,

343
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
defending civilization itself, defending God.

344
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He's all-powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think a lot of people take a borderline heroic view of themselves.

346
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
An indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets with some big abstract concept.

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Instead of Jewish people, they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.

349
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis or the friend zone.

350
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Trans people become transgenderism, gender ideology, trans activists.

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What they're really against is equality, but they don't say that.

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
In fact, they may not even think it.

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But they tell on themselves when they react with instinctive hostility to anyone who agitates for change.

355
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.

356
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices by Elizabeth Young Broul really helped me with this video.

357
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
One of the points she makes is that a lot of the time bigotry is backlash.

358
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Ideologies of desire are, generally, backlashes against movements of equality.

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They are regressive prejudices that reinstate inequalities and distinctions

360
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
when the force of movements for equality has been registered and, often unconsciously, rejected.

361
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

362
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Bigotry is not just the psychological state of hating a group of people.

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Bigotry is political.

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's a reaction to changing demographics or to liberation movements or to changing power relations between groups.

365
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women in the literal psychological sense.

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's more that they feel threatened by the prospect of the social and political equality of women.

367
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry, much more so than feeling hateful.

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So bigotry is reactive, and it changes along with the circumstances it's a reaction to.

369
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
1950s misogyny still has some things in common with 2020s misogyny.

370
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
For example, a lot of men still feel some need to control women's sexuality and women's bodies.

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But it's also changed a lot as gender relations have shifted in the last 70 years.

372
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The idea that women are naturally suited to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent than it used to be.

373
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder because, in the last decade,

374
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
transliberation has increased our visibility.

375
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
People are running into us at work now.

376
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
They're having to use our pronouns.

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They're seeing us in politics or in media, and not just as laughing stocks or monsters like we used to be, but as actual characters.

378
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And a lot of people are not very happy about it.

379
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They feel threatened.

380
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That must be super fucking hard for you.

381
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

382
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So J.K. Rowling frames her position as, I am just saying the fact that sex is real.

383
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's not hateful to say a fact.

384
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Why is everyone so mad at me?

385
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
A fact can't be bigoted.

386
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted.

387
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Usually when we discuss facts, we're using those facts to tell a story.

389
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.

390
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know, suppose someone tweets the fact that the homicide rate is higher for black Americans than white Americans.

391
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm going to ask, what story are you trying to tell with this fact?

392
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What political goal are you trying to support?

393
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
One way indirect bigotry works is by camouflaging political struggles as intellectual debates.

394
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
When Joanne says sex is real, she sounds like she's staking out a position in the trans debate,

395
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
which is then presented as an intellectual conflict about the metaphysics of gender,

396
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
instead of what it really is, which is a political conflict about the social equality of transgender people.

397
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And the effectiveness of that strategy is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan of this slogan,

398
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
trans women are women.

399
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And this is just my opinion. I don't speak for any other trans people, but there's a couple things I don't like about it.

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
One is trans men and non-binary people matter just as much as trans women.

401
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What you don't as often hear, trans men are men.

402
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Or non-binary people are...

403
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
valid?

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Doesn't really work, does it?

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Another problem with trans women are women is it tends to invite the response.

406
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, what does it even mean to be a woman?

407
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Define womanhood.

408
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And now, you're immediately getting baited into some bullshit semantic debate about what is a real woman.

409
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
A real woman. How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?

410
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What if you're in The Matrix right now, and in the real world, you're biologically male?

411
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The tables are turned.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It doesn't really matter, does it?

413
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's it. This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.

414
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You know, I've been down this road too many times already, and I always end up having these dead-end conversations about gender performativity,

415
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
or worse, conversations about what it means to feel like a woman.

416
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.

417
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't think anyone feels like a woman honestly, except a certain subgenre of gay men, and possibly Shania Twain.

418
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Probably not even her anymore, honestly. Not since the early 2000s.

419
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You know, some questions should be dissolved rather than solved. That's what Wittgenstein said.

420
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.

421
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to realize you're asking the wrong question.

422
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How do I know I'm a woman? Well, look at me.

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I rest my case.

424
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The monitor's over here. That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.

425
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves what gender is.

427
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In fact, if you even try to answer the question, you end up enraging some part of the community who feels excluded.

428
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So no, trans people are not trying to force an ideology on people.

429
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We don't even share an ideology within our own community.

430
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What we share are a common set of political struggles against discrimination, against harassment,

431
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
against excessive medical gatekeeping, against exclusion from public life.

432
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?

433
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people,

434
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and something that evades pointless philosophizing about biology,

435
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and what is gender, and who is true trans, and what is a woman really?

436
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Something that centers what actually matters,

437
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
which is freeing trans people from the stigma and discrimination that have historically prevented us from becoming equal members of society.

438
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s, but I personally like this slogan,

439
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
trans liberation now.

440
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's short, it's sweet, and instead of prompting define womanhood,

441
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?

442
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Liberation from what?

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.

444
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And now you're talking about politics instead of talking about semantics.

445
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Isn't that better?

446
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed with reassuring ourselves that we are valid

447
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
that we sometimes forget that the end goal of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.

448
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.

449
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,

450
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?

451
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, maybe I care a little bit.

452
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But instead, why don't we ask, is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?

453
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?

454
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Isn't it so much better to have a concrete political project in front of you

455
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?

456
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Trans people are a population of people who have a right to equality and to freedom from discrimination.

457
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We are not an ideology that's up for debate.

458
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.

459
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,

460
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but as an ideology that she disagrees with.

461
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm just saying that sex is real.

462
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Is that all you're saying, Joanne?

463
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire in the prefix bathroom?

464
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?

465
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.

466
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This bath is actually really nice.

467
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil, epsom salts,

468
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
just kind of everything that's good in baths altogether.

469
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't want to talk about bigotry.

470
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I want to talk about baths.

471
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Can this just be a video about baths from now on?

472
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, fine. I'll do my job.

473
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,

474
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,

475
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC

476
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The essay is several pages long

478
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and outlines her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.

479
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Where do I even begin with this one?

480
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Well, let's pick some highlights.

481
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Woman is not an idea in a man's head.

482
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Woman is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choo's

483
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive.

484
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh, well, my mistake.

485
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Here I was thinking I was a woman.

486
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.

487
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
What a whimsical misunderstanding.

488
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay, well, that's it everyone.

489
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The channel's over.

490
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Thanks for the likes and comments.

491
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm going to head out now to the Jimmy Choo store

492
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and then I guess I'll cut my tits off.

493
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Joanne! Joanne! This is madness, Joanne.

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
to any man who believes or feels he's a woman

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates

497
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,

498
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside.

499
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So, look, I understand that some women are anxious

500
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
about the thought of predators in bathrooms.

501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And believe me, I don't want to share a bathroom with a predator

502
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
any more than you do.

503
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Why are all my rose petals on this one side?

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Some of them need to come over here.

505
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Come here.

506
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I've redistributed the petals.

507
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Socialist icon.

508
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But this talking point that gender change on legal documents

509
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
will enable predators to enter bathrooms,

510
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it doesn't really make sense

511
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
because gender policing in public bathrooms

512
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
doesn't involve legal documents.

513
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, when was the last time you had to present a gender certificate

514
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
to gain admittance to a public bathroom?

515
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This feels like a strangely outdated conversation

516
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to be having during pandemic lockdown.

517
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like, imagine using a public bathroom.

518
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Imagine being in public.

519
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,

520
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
which is about the experiences of butch women.

521
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,

522
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
which describes how women's bathrooms

523
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
tend to operate as an area

524
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
for the enforcement of gender conformity.

525
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The author, Jack Halberstam,

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
who's assigned female at birth and presents masculine,

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
describes routinely having security called on him

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
for using the women's bathroom.

529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom

530
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
is a frequent occurrence in the lives

531
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of many androgynous or masculine women.

532
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders

533
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
whether the category woman,

534
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
when used to designate public functions,

535
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
is completely outmoded.

536
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Queer literature is littered with references

537
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to The Bathroom Problem,

538
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and it would not be an exaggeration

539
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
to call it a standard feature of the butch narrative.

540
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And that's very interesting to me,

541
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
because as a feminine trans woman,

542
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I have not once been questioned

543
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
or had the authorities called on me

544
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
in a women's public bathroom

545
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
in the entire time I've been using them,

546
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
which is several years now.

547
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So when Joanne Roley, a feminine heterosexual woman,

548
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
calls for more bathroom policing

549
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to protect the lesbians or whatever,

550
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
it just seems ignorant

551
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
of the way bathroom policing actually works.

552
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Like, is she just so famous

553
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore

554
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and she forgot how they work?

555
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?

556
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ten dollars?

557
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,

558
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
not chromosomes,

559
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and there's no practical way to change that

560
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
short of stationing a genital inspector in every stall,

561
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
you know, just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.

562
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's a very good idea, Joanne.

563
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That's very good.

564
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.

565
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They include trans men in their feminism

566
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
because they were born women.

567
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists

568
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
think that trans men are women?

569
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Hello, operator. Could you get me a Lennis Morissette?

570
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I have a new incident to report.

571
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So look, I could keep refuting points made in turf wars,

572
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
which is basically just a series of common transphobic canards

573
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
we've all heard a hundred times before,

574
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but I want to focus in particular on some passages

575
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that I think are very revealing about the psychology of transphobia.

576
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What is it about the transgenders

577
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
that some people feel threatened by?

578
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Well, Joanne Roley gives us a lot to work with

579
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in answering that question.

580
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You know, Joanne being in turf is mostly terrible for trans people,

581
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
but maybe the silver lining is that

582
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the most famous novelist in the world

583
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
having a public transphobic breakdown

584
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
is providing a wealth of insight

585
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
about the interior world of a transphobe.

586
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
In turf wars, Joanne claims her interest in

587
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the trans issue is intensely personal,

588
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and she has two reasons why it's personal.

589
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,

590
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
she would have been trans.

591
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Someone would have trans-ed her.

592
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You know, people are being trans to left and right these days.

593
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.

594
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Trans people, we're always on the lookout

595
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
for the next person we can trans,

596
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
so all we want to do is trans people.

597
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I trans-ed four people this morning before I had breakfast.

598
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
She thinks that she would have been recruited

599
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones

600
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.

601
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And in support of this speculation,

602
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
about social contagion and a, quote,

604
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
4,400% increase in girls being referred

605
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
for transitioning treatment.

606
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And that sounds pretty alarming, right?

607
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
4,400%.

608
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,

609
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred,

610
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and by last year, that number was 1,740,

611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
with the biggest increase happening five years ago,

612
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
you know, the transgender tipping point year.

613
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So that is a big increase,

614
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
but it corresponds to the biggest ever increase

615
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
in trans visibility, so it does make sense.

616
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And there's 11 million children in the UK,

617
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
so let's say 5.5 million girls,

618
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.

619
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And considering that around 1% of adults

620
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
are some kind of transgender,

621
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
0.03% of kids is not really an alarming number to me.

622
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.

623
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But part of Joanne's problem here

624
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
is that she seems not to really understand

625
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
what being trans is.

626
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The writings of young trans men reveal a group

627
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
of notably sensitive and clever people.

628
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,

629
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,

630
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm,

631
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and self-hatred, the more I've wondered

632
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
whether if I'd been born 30 years later,

633
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I too might have tried to transition.

634
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If I'd found community and sympathy online

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,

637
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I believe I could have been persuaded

638
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
to turn myself into the son my father had openly said

639
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
he'd have preferred.

640
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness

641
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and my ambivalence about being a woman

642
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
reflected in the work of female writers

643
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and musicians who reassured me

644
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that in spite of everything,

645
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.

646
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's fine not to feel pink.

647
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Free and compliant inside your own head.

648
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's okay to feel confused, dark,

649
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
both sexual and non-sexual,

650
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
unsure of what or who you are.

651
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here

652
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and let's start by making a list

653
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
of things being a transgender man is not.

654
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Having anxiety, having dissociation,

655
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
having an eating disorder,

656
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
doing self-harm, doing self-hatred,

657
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
a viable way to make your sexist father proud,

658
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,

659
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
not being compliant, feeling confused,

660
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
feeling dark, feeling sexual,

661
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.

662
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay, so you can be a trans man

663
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and experience some or even all of these things,

664
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but none of these things are what being a trans man is.

665
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body

666
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and literally live your life as a man

667
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
is not the same as the typical struggles

668
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
other girls go through.

669
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Joanne is projecting her own memories

670
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
of troubled adolescents onto trans men

671
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and then saying,

672
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
oh, clearly they were going through the same things I was,

673
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
just someone persuaded them to transition.

674
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's a limitation of human empathy

675
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that sometimes when we're trying to understand

676
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
what someone else is feeling,

677
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them.

678
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And sometimes that's a misrepresentation.

679
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Sometimes other people are experiencing things

680
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
that we have never experienced.

681
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So we have to invent explanations

682
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.

683
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Someone is persuading them to transition.

684
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But this fear-mongering about kids

685
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
being persuaded to transition

686
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is just not how things work.

687
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
From the way transphobes talk about it,

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground

689
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
picks up a toy truck,

690
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
an endocrinologist pops out from behind a tree

691
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and says,

692
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.

693
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.

694
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,

695
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
in particular about young transmasculine people.

696
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out

697
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that is essentially to transmasculine people

698
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
what the transsexual empire was to trans women.

699
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's called Irreversible Damage.

700
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The transgender craze seducing our daughters.

701
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Chapter one.

702
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The contagion.

703
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Jesus.

704
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?

705
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
The argument is that female to male transgenderism

706
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
is an infectious social disease,

707
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
which is literally the argument Hitler made about homosexuality,

708
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
but okay, great.

709
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues

710
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
is that not enough attention is paid

711
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
to transphobia against trans men.

712
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,

713
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,

714
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
transgender women are women.

715
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And that's very nice of him,

716
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.

717
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
In fact, she spends more words on trans men

718
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
than on any other topic.

719
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So I think it's worth looking in particular at that.

720
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men

721
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is not the same as transphobia against trans women.

722
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
There's a lot of similarities,

723
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
but they're really two different prejudices,

724
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and they come from different psychological places

725
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
in the same way that lesbophobia is different

726
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
from homophobia against gay men.

727
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
For trans women, I would say the distinctive experience

728
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
of transphobia is being simultaneously treated

729
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
as a pornographic female fetish object

730
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and as a dangerous male predator.

731
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus

732
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
who will ravish your wife and trap your husband.

733
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Your polygamous commune will be devastated.

734
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Whereas I feel like transmasculine people

735
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
are less vilified, but so infantilized.

736
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I guess transphobes view trans men as women,

737
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
so a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,

738
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
so much for transitioning to escape sexism.

739
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls

740
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
can't possibly decide for themselves

741
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
what to do with their own bodies,

742
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
so the courts must intervene to take control,

743
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
which is exactly what just happened in the UK,

744
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
where trans youth under 16 will now need

745
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
not only the approval of a doctor,

746
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
but will need to seek a court order

747
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
in order to get puberty blockers.

748
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And the justification given for this

749
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns

750
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls

751
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
being unable to make informed decisions.

752
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
In her essay, Joanne says,

753
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman

754
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
who's older than I am and wonderful.

755
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Although she's open about her past as a gay man,

756
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I've always found it hard to think of her

757
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
as anything other than a woman.

758
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Being older, though, she went through

759
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
a long and rigorous process of evaluation,

760
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
psychotherapy, and staged transformation.

761
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The current explosion of trans activism

762
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems

763
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
through which candidates for sex reassignment

764
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
were once required to pass.

765
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So that's what she wants.

766
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,

767
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,

768
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
just Joanne's more polite about it.

769
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I wanna make a drink.

770
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.

771
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
No, just drank a lot.

772
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Ugh, we're revealing leg again.

773
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The scandal.

774
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it

775
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
is that much more chaste.

776
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
While I'm an extremely chaste woman,

777
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I try to honor God with my body.

778
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's why I got a sex change.

779
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm honoring God with my sex change.

780
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm not drunk enough for this.

781
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So I also wanna point out that cis men and cis women

782
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
are often transphobic for different reasons.

783
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women

784
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
because the thought that a man can become a woman

785
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
threatens the certainty of their own manhood.

786
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men are homophobic.

787
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.

788
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And of course, a lot of straight men are attracted to trans women

789
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and they feel that that attraction threatens their identity as straight men.

790
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Back in my Comp Hat days when I dated men,

791
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
for a couple of straight guys I hooked up with,

792
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.

793
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
This is it, Mr. Frodo.

794
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.

795
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And afterwards, I go into this whole Cartesian spiral.

797
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
What have I done?

798
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
What does this mean?

799
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Who am I?

800
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I think for a lot of cis women,

801
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the very existence of trans men sends them into a similar identity crisis.

802
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I think a lot of women have had to fight a really difficult internal battle

803
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
to make peace with their own womanhood.

804
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And for some women, confronting the existence of transgender people

805
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
seems to open some old wounds.

806
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Like I've noticed in particular,

807
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs

808
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.

809
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And these women see hyper-feminine trans women in makeup and dresses

810
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and they say,

811
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
that is not what being a woman is.

812
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I've had to fight for my own identity against the idea

813
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
that that's what being a woman is.

814
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
These are just misogynistic stereotypes.

815
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You are a parody of womanhood.

816
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You're a fetishist.

817
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And when they see trans men, they say,

818
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you're a traitor.

819
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You're a self-loather.

820
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman the way I've had to?

821
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But this is all projection and misunderstanding.

822
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Trans women do not think that wearing dresses is what makes us women.

823
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And trans men do not think that not feeling a pink frilly and compliant

824
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
is what makes them men.

825
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning to trans people's actions

826
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
in her own brain because she perceives our lives

827
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
as some kind of commentary on gender

828
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
with an implied ideology about what it means to be a man or a woman.

829
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But that's your interpretation Joanne.

830
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's a meaning that you are imposing on us

831
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage of your own

832
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and it's interfering with your ability to genuinely empathize with trans people.

833
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You know, at the end of your essay,

834
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
you say that you never forget the inner complexity when it comes to trans people.

835
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And that's a nice thought,

836
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people

837
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
as some kind of like abstract theory of gender

838
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
or as a projection of your own adolescence,

839
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals

840
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
with our own experiences and stories.

841
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson on trans people,

842
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
sorry, gender issues,

843
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I think it would be good if you listened to the experiences of trans men

844
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
without, for instance, superimposing your own troubled relationship with your father.

845
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I should probably talk about the book

846
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
since I did go to The Trouble to read all 900 pages

847
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
because unlike certain other YouTubers,

848
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I do in fact know how to read.

849
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Troubled Blood was published in September 2020

850
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.

851
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You know, for someone apparently so concerned

852
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,

853
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is...

854
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
it's interesting.

855
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's a choice.

856
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
God, this thing is huge.

857
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's like the infinite jest of turfery.

858
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So Troubled Blood is a detective novel

859
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
about the simmering heterosexual tension between two investigators.

860
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?

861
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Simmering.

862
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe

863
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

864
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Hello, Daniel.

865
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I love you, grown-up Harry Potter.

866
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Let me show you my love.

867
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The only way I know how.

868
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh!

869
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh!

870
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Is there going to be discourse about this?

871
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Look, if it's wrong to have cop-hat feelings about Daniel Radcliffe,

872
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't want to be right.

873
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I will not be shamed for my shameful fantasies.

874
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Get out of here, Daniel.

875
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
This is a final farewell to my heterosexuality.

876
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Goodbye, Daniel!

877
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And your little arm, too.

878
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You stay out of this, Linda.

879
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,

880
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman

881
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to lull his victims, whom's tea abducts,

882
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
tortures, rapes, and murders.

883
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Interesting.

884
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,

885
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.

886
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,

887
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
have called this book transphobic.

888
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And you might think that's unfair, since the character Dennis Creed,

889
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
this serial killer, he's not a trans.

890
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
He's a cross-dresser.

891
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
This has nothing to do with trans people.

892
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Why so triggered, snowflake?

893
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, precious.

894
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
There's a couple things I think are worth taking into consideration here.

895
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer

896
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
is an old transphobic trope.

897
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's a cliché that goes back decades.

898
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And I take great offense to the suggestion that trans women are serial killers

899
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.

900
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
The trope seems to originate in 1960 with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

901
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That's just my guess, though.

902
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I haven't researched this.

903
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Who do you think I am?

904
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Lindsay Ellis?

905
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.

906
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up,

907
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
where the psychiatrist offers the pseudo-Freudian explanation

908
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that Norman cross-dresses because the personality of his dead mother takes over

909
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and out of jealousy kills the women Norman is attracted to.

910
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Therefore, the psychiatrist explains, Norman is not a real transvestite.

911
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You're a fake transvestite, Norman.

912
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Trender alert.

913
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But I do think that even if Psycho isn't explicitly transphobic,

914
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
movies can subconsciously implant ideas and feelings into our brains.

915
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And I do think it's worth noting that the most famous

916
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and most terrifying murder scene in cinema history

917
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
is if a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.

918
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
To quote a popular film critic, you might not have noticed it,

919
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
but your brain did.

920
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The cross-dressing psychotrope became explicitly transphobic

921
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
in the campy 1980s Psycho rip-off Dressed to Kill,

922
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist

923
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
who, yes, dresses as a woman to kill women he's attracted to.

924
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
He was a transsexual.

925
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What?

926
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
A transsexual.

927
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You see, there's some men and women, too, think they're born in the wrong body.

928
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
They're called transsexuals, and all they want to do is have their sex changed.

929
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That's all they want to do, the transsexuals.

930
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Dressed to Kill also ends with a psychiatric summing up,

931
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
where the doctor explains that Michael Caine has a case of...

932
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.

933
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But it's the female Michael Caine who kills because, and I quote...

934
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
There's often a misogynistic trope hiding behind the transphobic one.

935
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's the woman in the man who does the murders.

936
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's the mother's fault.

937
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.

938
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
The most mature iteration of this trope,

939
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
the crown jewel of transphobic movies, is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,

940
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
which is honestly one of my favorite movies,

941
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are just radiant in it.

942
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And, uh, also, I hate myself.

943
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,

944
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
an animal lover and innovative seamstress.

945
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Buffalo Bill is a transtrender.

946
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
A transtrender!

947
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin

948
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
because its application for sex reassignment was rejected

949
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
because, according to Hannibal Lecter...

950
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Billy is not a real transsexual.

951
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Hannibal Lecter is a true scum.

952
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,

953
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I just want to use this opportunity to reassure my trans audience

954
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
that even if you've only killed one or two people, you're valid.

955
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I entertain myself.

956
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That's how I continue to struggle onwards.

957
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

958
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

959
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage

960
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
and more terry-fry.

961
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?

962
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Is that even possible?

963
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here

964
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
because the sun is rising.

965
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Silence of the Lambs differs from its male-gazy predecessors

966
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.

967
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Clarisse is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,

968
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and every man in this movie is a pig,

969
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
except maybe Hannibal Lecter,

970
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
the only one who actually respects Clarisse,

971
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
the only real gentleman with his Goldberg variations

972
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
in his sketches of the Duomo.

973
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,

974
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
even Crawford's kind of a pig.

975
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The pigs are pigs, Miggs is pigs,

976
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

977
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Dooberschwein is in the original Sherman.

978
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The fuck are we talking about?

979
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
What?

980
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And he's obsessed with death's head moths,

981
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor

982
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
for gender transformation.

983
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I can't believe I finally emerged as a beautiful butterflame.

984
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So don't tell Lily.

985
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people have so many rights

986
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that it's okay to make fun of us.

987
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
There's a lot to work with.

988
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.

989
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make a movie

990
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
or write a book about a transgender serial killer,

991
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
but there is an issue of representation.

992
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You know, for decades there was close to zero

993
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
good representation of trans people in movies or TV,

994
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers.

995
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And that has an effect on the way people think.

996
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
When it comes time to debate bathroom bills

997
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and people are subconsciously remembering psycho,

998
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
that has serious consequences for trans people.

999
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's getting so bright in here.

1000
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The sun has risen.

1001
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And it's also not psychologically good for us

1002
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures of ourselves in media.

1003
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Like even as late as my early 20s,

1004
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I didn't know any trans people,

1005
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.

1006
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I think the most positive approximation of representation I knew about

1007
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
was like Frankenfurter and Divine.

1008
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And both of them are also psychotic murderers,

1009
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
just, you know, in a fun way.

1010
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Should've just gotten her those cha-cha heels.

1011
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,

1012
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
but I guess I felt that it was basically the moral equivalent

1013
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
of being a serial killer.

1014
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.

1015
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And things have changed in the last 10 years.

1016
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.

1017
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And there's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me

1018
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
who don't even hate themselves.

1019
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Can't relate.

1020
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.

1021
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Joanne has written a book about a serial killer

1022
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
who dresses as a woman to kill women.

1023
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Groundbreaking.

1024
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Now this is such a cliche

1025
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
that you'd kind of expect a seasoned writer like J.K. Rowling

1026
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
to subvert it somehow.

1027
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Give us a remix, turn it on its head.

1028
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.

1029
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.

1030
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Or at least do something new with it.

1031
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But she really doesn't.

1032
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.

1033
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I guess I should read you some passages.

1034
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm reading it on my phone.

1035
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm not bringing the book out and pretending to read on the book.

1036
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You can see from my little bookmarks that I read the physical book.

1037
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yes, I'm a YouTuber.

1038
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And yes, I read a book.

1039
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So here's a psychiatrist.

1040
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?

1041
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.

1042
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
He's a classic sociopath, you see.

1043
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
A pure example of the type.

1044
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
He scores very highly on the dark triad.

1045
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy.

1046
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.

1047
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You see, he's what we in the medical profession call the baddie.

1048
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It excited me to watch a woman who didn't know she was being observed.

1049
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'd do it to my sisters, but I'd creep up to lip windows as well.

1050
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing, adjusting themselves or even a glimpse of nudity.

1051
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects, but by the sense of power.

1052
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I felt I stole something of their essence from them, taking that which they had thought private and hidden.

1053
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear from neighbors' washing lines, and even from his grandmother, Ina.

1054
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
These he enjoyed wearing in secret, and about extubating in.

1055
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?

1056
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Oh, how dear readers.

1057
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So Dennis Creed is characterized as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.

1058
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
And like, okay, there really are men who fetishize women's clothes, for example.

1059
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I mean, Freud talked about this, right?

1060
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part or an article of clothing.

1061
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And Freud theorized that finishes emerge from the unconscious trauma that occurs when men discover that women don't have a penis.

1062
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.

1063
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But considering that Joanne has been doing a lot of gender critical reading over the past few years,

1064
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:12,000
it's kind of hard for me to ignore that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women is exactly the way a lot of TERFs characterize trans women.

1065
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Remember, the whole gender critical feminists with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.

1066
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
These people are bigots.

1067
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs that trans women are hypersexual and hyper aggressive, right?

1068
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
These inherently pornographic sex demons.

1069
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?

1070
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Are trans women sex demons?

1071
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Why, yes.

1072
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yes, we are.

1073
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
The bigots are simply correct.

1074
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
We're sex demons.

1075
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You can't even talk to these people.

1076
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?

1077
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I used to take the bait and argue that, no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.

1078
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Unless you want me to be.

1079
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But it's counterproductive to make that argument.

1080
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Why?

1081
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because I'm not involved in human trafficking t-shirt as people asking a lot of questions are already answered by my shirt.

1082
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So I have a hard time believing that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.

1083
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And I also want to note that Dennis's cross dressing is described not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,

1084
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.

1085
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Dennis says, on page 854, so you know I actually read this fucking shit,

1086
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
In a wig, bit of lipstick.

1087
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.

1088
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You're the nice man who's safe.

1089
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And earlier he's described as

1090
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner, a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.

1091
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper, and sometimes wearing a wig that, from a distance to a drunk victim, gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.

1092
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination, cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.

1093
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
They mistake him for a woman.

1094
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Or as, you know.

1095
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And that causes them to lower their guard.

1096
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And this reminds me of one of my F4 statters, allegedly transphobic tweets.

1097
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Pronouns are Rohypnol. Important article by Harry Lektarpi.

1098
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
A.K.A. Vulfomort. She who must not be named.

1099
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Followed by J.K. Rowling. Because of course.

1100
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Pronouns are Rohypnol.

1101
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Rohypnol's roofies. And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.

1102
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Pronouns are like Rohypnol. They dull your defenses. They change your inhibitions. They're meant to.

1103
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You've had a lifetime's experience learning to be alert to him and to relax to her. For good reason.

1104
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
These instinctive responses keep you safe.

1105
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's not even a conscious thing. It's like the hairs standing on end.

1106
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger that your eyes haven't noticed yet.

1107
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I want to be alert. I want others to be alert.

1108
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I want people to see the real picture.

1109
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And I want those instinctive reactions that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted, undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.

1110
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I feel like I owe this to myself. And I absolutely owe it to other women.

1111
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And more than anything, I owe this to girls.

1112
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I don't want to play even the tiniest part in grooming them to disregard their natural protective instincts.

1113
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Those instincts are there for a reason. To keep them safe, they need those instincts intact and sharp.

1114
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And that's why I won't use preferred pronouns. Using Rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.

1115
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay. So, these are the thoughts of someone who's been hurt.

1116
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people is intensely personal.

1117
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I was born this way. Born is a fucking idiot.

1118
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old. It's kind of an agatha drink.

1119
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch. That's the plot. Pay attention. It makes sense.

1120
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Also, a martini. What is a martini? Put an excuse to drink a glass of gin.

1121
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Should probably eat an olive. Or this is going to go straight to my fucking brain.

1122
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Okay, we have to be serious now. In turf wars, Joanne writes...

1123
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Okay. So, for Joanne, her traumatic experience being attacked by a man is psychologically related.

1124
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:00,000
To her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people and about trans people saying nasty things about her on Twitter.

1125
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,000
She feels intensely about this issue because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD. In her own words...

1126
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:40,000
A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance, a constant alertness to danger. This is described in a very wise book called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Shulman.

1127
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:56,000
The traumatized person's sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed. They feel endangered even if there is no actual danger in the present because in the past they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.

1128
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response is a real experience of suffering that is not the victim's fault, even in cases where that response is irrational or politically incorrect.

1129
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:33,000
For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager, I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy around black teenagers for a while. However, if that jumpiness motivates you to become a campaigner for more militant policing of black neighborhoods, then you are participating in anti-black racism and that I will criticize regardless of your trauma.

1130
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I hope it goes without saying that trans people gaining easier access to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020 is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s. This is a non sequitur.

1131
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So it's a little odd to me that while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma and she's self-aware enough to realize that her hypervigilance is often irrational to the point where she herself finds humor in it.

1132
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:15,000
She's somehow not self-aware enough to realize that her fears about trans people are an irrational manifestation of the hypervigilance.

1133
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma and I would be nothing but sympathetic if her feelings about this amounted to simply being triggered by, for example, perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom.

1134
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Which is something most trans women are sensitive to. Like I've spoken to trans women who are worried they don't pass or who know they don't pass and who do everything they can to avoid using a public bathroom because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.

1135
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So these trans women go through life every day compromising their own comfort and safety to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.

1136
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope of an automatic trigger response.

1137
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's become a fixation for years to the point where she's written a 900 page novel about a serial killer who cross-stresses to trick women into being less vigilant.

1138
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And now the primary political cause she's decided to use her superstardom to champion is opposition to trans liberation.

1139
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.

1140
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Like if you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized as a child when your father left your mother for a man, you're still a homophobe, right?

1141
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You're not less of a bigot because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.

1142
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.

1143
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked.

1144
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So it's often rooted in trauma.

1145
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:49,000
After the collective trauma of 9-11, Americans felt threatened not just by al-Qaeda but by the entire religion of Islam.

1146
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And this was used and is still being used to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.

1147
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Feelings of victimization are often used as a justification for aggression.

1148
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And when the target of that aggression is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.

1149
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.

1150
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy, creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.

1151
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.

1152
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's biological women who are the real victims.

1153
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
The real victim.

1154
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So often in debates on social issues, we're faced with two opposing sides, both claiming to be the victim.

1155
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And we're often told to believe victims, believe marginalized people.

1156
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Well, if only it was that easy.

1157
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So often, the exact point in question is who is the victim and who's the oppressor.

1158
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse, describes the way the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty.

1159
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
In situations ranging from romantic relationships to international affairs.

1160
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Bullies often conceptualize themselves as being under attack when they are the ones originating the pain.

1161
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Throughout Joanne's essay, she frequently represents herself as taking a defiant, free, speechy stand against.

1162
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Accusations and threats from trans activists.

1163
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
The trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating.

1164
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists.

1165
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And in her subsequent tweets, she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.

1166
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.

1167
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
This witch doesn't burn.

1168
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
This is the new Salem.

1169
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Women are being attacked online for taking a stand against the transsexuals.

1170
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
This witch doesn't burn.

1171
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Let's see what else we have for sale at wildwomenworkshop.com.

1172
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Fuck your pronouns.

1173
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Trans men are my sisters.

1174
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Sorry about your dick, bro.

1175
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That's a good one.

1176
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I'd wear that.

1177
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Don't call me sis.

1178
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.

1179
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Must be really hard for you.

1180
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Not being a sh**.

1181
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
War is peace.

1182
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Freedom is slavery.

1183
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Ignorance is strength.

1184
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Trans women are women.

1185
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Got the sense of persecution.

1186
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
This is Orwell's nightmare.

1187
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
This is how Nazi Germany started.

1188
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
First Hitler told the transgenders they were super hecking valid, uwu.

1189
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Then he burned their books out.

1190
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Wait.

1191
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Oh, no.

1192
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
That's actually the opposite of what happened.

1193
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Slurs.

1194
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Feminist t-shirt.

1195
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Nice trilby.

1196
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's very dapper.

1197
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Slurs.

1198
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Man-hater.

1199
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Feminazi.

1200
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Prude.

1201
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Witch.

1202
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Bigot.

1203
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Wait, bigot?

1204
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Are we reclaiming bigot now?

1205
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?

1206
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Joanne wrote in her essay that she was standing up in solidarity with women who have histories like mine who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

1207
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Slurred as bigots.

1208
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There's something so revealing about the claim that bigot is a slur because so much of indirect bigotry is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.

1209
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?

1210
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's good.

1211
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's very clever.

1212
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
A white racist will hardly ever use the phrase white supremacy.

1213
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
No, they say white genocide.

1214
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Always on the defensive.

1215
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.

1216
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The same conservative media who ten years ago were portraying lesbians as like angry, man-ish d***s have now created this mythology of lesbians as these virginal damsels in distress.

1217
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Who are threatened with invasion.

1218
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And now, extinction.

1219
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:59,000
On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists, who are somehow coercing them into becoming men.

1220
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Elliot, no.

1221
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You can't possibly be doing this because you're 33 years old and capable of autonomous thought.

1222
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Clearly, you are tricked by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.

1223
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told, are slurring as bigots.

1224
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Lesbians who won't sleep with them.

1225
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Joanne claims that...

1226
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.

1227
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
On the contrary.

1228
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Many of them become interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

1229
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives.

1230
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But the only gender-critical women she mentions by name are Maya Forstader, who I would not describe as hugely sympathetic to trans adults.

1231
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says...

1232
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Okay, so I agree.

1233
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It would be awful to call someone a bigot just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis.

1234
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But are you sure?

1235
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That's why people call Magdalene Burns a bigot?

1236
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?

1237
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You are fucking blackface actors.

1238
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You aren't women.

1239
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

1240
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.

1241
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Our oppression isn't a fetish.

1242
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You pathetic, sick fuck.

1243
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Hugely sympathetic.

1244
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Hugely sympathetic.

1245
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots.

1246
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And because she constantly frames herself as the victim of terrifying trans activists who say mean things online,

1247
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I think it's fair for me to mention that this, right here, is how I'm used to being spoken to and spoken about by TERFs.

1248
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
When you're a trans woman online, TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.

1249
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
They deadname and misgender you.

1250
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They mock your genitals.

1251
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
They describe your surgery results as necrotic and mutilated wounds.

1252
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:29,000
They interpret your every feeling and experience as the manifestation of a sick, woman-hating fetish.

1253
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You know, in an unrelated video last year, I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man.

1254
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And I've since been told by TERFs, essentially,

1255
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
trans-identified males get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

1256
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.

1257
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Hugely sympathetic.

1258
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I hope I don't even need to say that the idea that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it is a violently anti-feminist thought.

1259
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And it's a thought that could only be believed, and believed in the name of feminism, no less,

1260
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:17,000
by people who have spent days and weeks absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda that TERFs exist to promote.

1261
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Now, I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room with me right now, she'd say,

1262
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm so sorry you've been treated that way.

1263
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But I, too, have been cruelly victimized online by the trans activists.

1264
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And you know what?

1265
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I'm sure that's true.

1266
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
When I listen to Joanne talk about being victimized by trans Twitter,

1267
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
it's easy for me to sympathize.

1268
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.

1269
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The vilification.

1270
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The obsession.

1271
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
The fantasies of violence.

1272
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It's a pretty common occurrence for me to look at my mentions and see people with trans flag avatars posting things like,

1273
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Point of view.

1274
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You are true, scum, and Yoshi is going to beat you to death with a golf club.

1275
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Hashtag yes, all gamers.

1276
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-Semite because three years ago I made a joke about reptilian overlords.

1277
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And then they get mad because I said I wanted to understand non-binary people instead of just dogmatically believing things.

1278
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And they conclude,

1279
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So basically, fuck ContraPoints, I want to bash her over the goddamn head with a metal bat over and over again.

1280
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So this is the level of antipathy that I attract from trans Twitter.

1281
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed by abusive messages, I'm inclined to believe her.

1282
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed with anime avatars saying things like,

1283
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
JK Rowling is hypocritical trash who literally walks millions of trans kids dead.

1284
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Harry Potter was always neoliberal garbage and we should have seen this coming.

1285
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy, she deserves a back end slapped to the face.

1286
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And tweets like that are abusive.

1287
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It's not okay.

1288
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And I don't make any excuses for it.

1289
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I want to make a dark and stormy.

1290
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Sorry, I'll be right back.

1291
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I am back.

1292
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's good.

1293
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So I also think that there really is an element of misogyny to them.

1294
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I have to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.

1295
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying while holding a tropical drink.

1296
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This is not possible to deal with this through your face.

1297
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So I agree there really is an element of misogyny to this.

1298
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Misogyny is the most universal prejudice and trans people are not immune.

1299
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women regardless of whether their anger is justified.

1300
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
There is a witch hunt in Pulse that's still alive in our culture.

1301
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:44,000
To be a famous woman is to constantly have every part of your body and soul subject to endless critique.

1302
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You know, if you're one pound overweight, they call you a fatty.

1303
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
If you're one pound underweight, they say you have an eating disorder.

1304
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And if you're exactly the right way, they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.

1305
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.

1306
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.

1307
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
When you're a famous woman, it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters because the haters bring the obsession to you.

1308
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But it's important to remember that haters are not the same as bigots.

1309
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry unless it's tied to a history of oppression or a backlash against a movement of equality.

1310
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.

1311
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And no, David Silverman, the word racist is not like the N word.

1312
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.

1313
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Turf is not a slur.

1314
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse, but it's not a form of oppression.

1315
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And I say this as someone at this point most known for complaining about cancel culture.

1316
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Oh god, is this my legacy?

1317
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
A lot of trans people have been very mean, verbally abusive even, to J.K. Rowling.

1318
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
But most people criticizing Joanne, or criticizing me for that matter, might be hurt and angry.

1319
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
But they're not violent.

1320
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,

1321
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing crashing over you all at once.

1322
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent, they become emblematic of the way the whole experience feels.

1323
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And if you've been the victim of abuse before, the experience can be pretty triggering.

1324
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So it's just not always as simple as the victim and the abuser.

1325
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Sometimes victims are also abusers.

1326
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.

1327
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Sometimes righteously angry people cross a line into abusive excess.

1328
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And not all abuse comes from a position of power.

1329
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Why are so many trans people on Twitter so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?

1330
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter as it does to TERFs.

1331
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
People living in unrecovered trauma often behave in very similar ways to the people who traumatize them.

1332
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Over and over, I have seen traumatized people refuse to hear or engage information that would alter their self-concepts,

1333
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
even in ways that could bring them more happiness and integrity.

1334
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,000
The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal is rooted in a panic that their fragile self cannot bear interrogation,

1335
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.

1336
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Perhaps because supremacy in some produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.

1337
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And of course, many perpetrators were or are victims themselves.

1338
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,

1339
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse at trans people,

1340
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
a vulnerable group who they can mostly get away with hurting.

1341
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Unlike standing up to powerful men, right, which would be dangerous and difficult.

1342
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And a lot of trans people have been very horribly treated by men,

1343
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
by TERFs, by strangers on the street, by their own families.

1344
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And for some of those trans people,

1345
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the one kind of power they have.

1346
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Plus a lot of extremely online trans people really don't have a strong sense of conviction in their own identity,

1347
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
which is why they need constant external validation to prop them up.

1348
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,000
They need to constantly be told that they're valid, that they really are the gender that they say they are.

1349
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions their fragile self-concept,

1350
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
they lash out, Twitter being their only weapon.

1351
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:49,000
You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay that all you're asking, all you want,

1352
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
is empathy and understanding.

1353
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.

1354
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
But trans people also deserve more empathy and understanding than you've given them.

1355
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts that are always raging against you

1356
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and raging against me for that matter.

1357
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
In between the raging, look at what they're doing.

1358
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
They're begging.

1359
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Begging for money to pay for healthcare.

1360
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Begging for money to pay for housing.

1361
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,

1362
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
or pounds, or gringots, or whatever you people have.

1363
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And trans people are out here literally begging for healthcare.

1364
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
They're begging, Joanne.

1365
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
How powerful could the trans agenda really be?

1366
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Joanne, you have so much power and influence many, many times more than what I have.

1367
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And I have much more power and influence than most trans people.

1368
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You know, I am in a very different situation than most trans people.

1369
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I have a lot of other things going for me in this world.

1370
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But a lot of them have nothing.

1371
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
They have nothing, Joanne.

1372
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And I just think you should take that into consideration

1373
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,000
next time you decide to speak out about how trans activists are oppressing you.

1374
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Get it together, gorge.

1375
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Are you listening to yourself?

1376
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
What are you doing, Joanne?

1377
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life being rejected

1378
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
and humiliated and excluded over and over again.

1379
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So they're traumatized.

1380
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They're easily triggered by anything that reminds them of past betrayal and abandonment.

1381
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Which is something I think you could empathize with.

1382
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Joanne, you are famous for writing a book about a neglected and abused boy

1383
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
who lives in a closet until he's whisked away to a magical world

1384
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
where he and his freaky friends find acceptance in each other.

1385
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I remember when I first met you all.

1386
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.

1387
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
We stand a bunch of misfits.

1388
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.

1389
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So many trans people have found comfort in this story

1390
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
and an escape from a world that doesn't offer a lot of comfort to trans people.

1391
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So for you to use your fame and influence to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,

1392
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.

1393
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And I don't blame them for feeling that way.

1394
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I feel it too.

1395
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So Joanne.

1396
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Jo.

1397
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Mother.

1398
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.

1399
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I know how much that sucks.

1400
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So if you ever want to take me up on it,

1401
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.

1402
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
But otherwise, I think we're done here.

1403
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
As a trans person, I like to believe in the power of human metamorphosis.

1404
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But I realize that at this point,

1405
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes

1406
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and constantly trashed by trans people.

1407
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So it would be pretty difficult to change tracks at this point.

1408
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off

1409
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and I don't know, Joanne.

1410
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Maybe you are one in a million.

1411
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban

1412
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
and that shit got me through fifth grade.

1413
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So who knows?

1414
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Maybe you have another miracle in you.

1415
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
But I'm too old to believe in magic now.

1416
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So I'm not going to sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.

1417
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Okay.

1418
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I guess that's it.

1419
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Mischief managed.

1420
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I think that's it.

1421
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
We'll see you next time.

1422
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Bye-bye.

1423
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Bye-bye.

1424
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Bye-bye.

1425
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Bye-bye.

1426
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Bye-bye.

1427
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Bye-bye.

1428
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Bye-bye.

1429
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Bye-bye.
