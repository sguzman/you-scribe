49600	53400	So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?
53400	57400	Well, I don't know. What do I look like to you? Some kind of philosopher?
57400	58600	ðŸŽµ
58600	62120	So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,
62120	65400	not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.
67160	70680	However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,
70680	75560	I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,
75560	77800	well, violence is fun.
77800	80440	ðŸŽµ
80440	83800	And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.
83800	86040	It's not fun when other people are violent to you.
86920	89800	I mean, unless that's what you're into.
92040	93720	That is what I'm into.
93720	95240	Did I say you could speak?
95240	96280	No, mistress.
96280	97080	Then shut up.
107800	125240	ðŸŽµ
125240	125800	That's good.
126360	127240	Chocolatey.
127240	130680	Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,
130680	133080	and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.
133080	135720	Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.
135720	139560	I mean, if you're gonna watch a non-violent movie, you may as well read a fucking book.
139560	143320	What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to video the old
143320	147240	ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,
147240	151800	a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.
151800	155320	What's creepy about Alex is that film encourages us to identify with him,
155320	156840	and he kind of draws us in.
156840	158520	I mean, he listens to Beethoven,
158520	163480	and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.
163480	164760	Also, he tries the line.
164920	166120	Try to watch!
166120	166600	Shh!
166600	171400	So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people,
171400	174520	and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,
174520	177560	and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.
177560	180600	It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.
180600	185000	So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?
185000	187160	How normal is it to enjoy violence?
187160	189800	I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,
189800	193160	but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances
193240	196920	where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.
196920	201640	And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience.
201640	206680	And I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy watching a clock work orange.
206680	208440	It's not that they don't enjoy violence.
208440	210520	It's that in order for them to enjoy violence,
210520	213320	they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,
213320	216120	and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.
220600	222200	I guess it's kind of like sex.
222200	225400	I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.
225400	227480	At least, not since I started taking this shit.
227480	229480	I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know?
229480	231160	A little goddamn ambiance.
231160	236680	And you could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.
236680	241320	You can't properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging going on in the background.
241320	245560	But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?
245560	248760	What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?
248760	252040	Well, think about the TV show Long Order SVU.
252040	256760	Which has just as much sex and violence as a clockwork orange, but which is much more popular.
256760	260280	SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process
260280	264840	brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.
267080	268360	You like that, don't you?
268360	269880	I love it so much.
269880	271240	You all do.
271240	275160	I think a lot of the appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens
275160	278360	a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes
278360	282360	while promising the moral purification of justified police violence.
282360	286760	Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance of the moral psyche.
286760	289400	When we believe that violence is morally justified,
289400	293080	when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room fucking deserved it,
293080	295560	we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.
295560	296360	Exactly.
296360	301960	And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines
301960	306440	you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George Kills the Rapist.
306520	310360	For viewers with too many moral hang-ups to get off on totally senseless violence,
310360	314680	a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required
314680	316600	for gratifying bloody payoff.
316600	320280	But I wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the good
320280	324520	person's enjoyment of justified violence and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random
324520	326360	violence as we might like to think.
326360	330600	Yes, the good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence,
330600	335800	but once you get past that, there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture and swinging,
335880	341880	thrashing, stabbing, shooting, blasting, and burning, and aesthetics of violence and destruction.
342440	347080	Now, I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim,
347080	349880	and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.
349880	351960	I mean, unless I get real frustrated.
354680	355160	Shut up.
355720	357160	Please just shut up.
358920	360600	Oh, it's nice.
360600	361720	I can't get straight.
362520	364040	You're so filthy.
365800	367160	It's time to drink your milk.
380520	384520	But you know, when I'm playing video games and there are no moral or practical consequences
384520	388120	to any of my actions, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.
390280	394760	I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.
394760	401560	I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life, and that's fun, but life itself is terrible.
424760	430120	To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.
430120	431480	I'm actually fine.
431480	432920	I have tons of friends.
432920	433960	I'm fine.
433960	435560	I'm reallyâ€”I'm fine.
436120	437160	I'm happy, okay?
437960	439320	Here's what I want to know.
439320	444280	Unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the
444280	447400	gameplay of most video games is based entirely around it?
447400	451080	Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,
451080	454520	and that it's a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent.
454520	458840	And yeah, it's true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted.
458840	464120	But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique since I like violent media,
464120	467880	and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence.
467880	471960	Although sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurry
471960	473560	with what I usually like to think.
474200	481400	Little baby, don't you cry, mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.
483320	488200	Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary The Act of Killing chronicles the contemporary lives
488200	494040	of the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965 to 1966.
494040	498520	One of the killers, Anwar Congo, explains on a local television program that his torture
498520	501800	and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies.
503560	521080	The documentary takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrator is set to work producing
521080	525720	cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes, stylizing the events after Westerns,
525720	528040	mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.
528040	530920	It's a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art.
530920	534520	And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange withdrawn from British
534520	540120	distribution in 1973 after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults.
540120	542920	Now I'm not saying that violent movies make people violent,
542920	547240	and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves.
547240	550920	I mean, I watch violent movies all the time and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
552760	557000	So now Woke Contrapoints thinks child abuse is funny.
557000	561400	I personally drowned several of my babies and it was very traumatic for me.
561400	563560	Why did I become an SJW again?
563560	568280	Hey, what I want to know is what's the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful
568280	570040	and those who are sadistic killers?
570040	574360	Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt?
587000	606840	So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself with some kind of flimsy excuse,
606840	608440	you can kill without remorse.
608440	612360	And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing
612360	614520	and you never have to face any consequences for it.
614520	619400	What's interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical,
619400	623240	whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense.
623240	627560	In other words, the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist,
627560	631400	except that the former happens to have better reasons backing him up or lives in a better
631400	632600	political situation.
632600	635880	But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?
635880	640760	I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies, but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?
640760	645720	What would be helpful here is an example, some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,
645720	648120	and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.
648120	662120	Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior, and none of them would ever enjoy it.
662120	667720	ContraPoints has completely lived out and can't stop wringing your hands over a poor little
667720	669800	Nazi getting hit in the face.
670520	675000	Alright, alright, let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.
675000	677000	Let's say it's morally required, even.
677000	679160	Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?
679160	682280	Suppose there's a Nazi turf and he's about to punch a baby,
682280	685960	and punching the turf Nazi is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.
685960	689160	Socrates, is it just to punch the baby puncher?
689160	693000	ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community for this video's ongoing
693000	694760	trivialization of infanticide.
694760	697400	They'd also like you to know that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,
697400	699640	and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.
699640	703480	Why are we even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?
703480	707960	I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example of actual far-left violence in America
707960	709640	that anyone seems to be able to dig up.
710600	713320	Not for long, bourgeois dogs!
713320	715160	Cat girls of the world unite!
715880	720040	Tabby, could you bring it down just 27 notches or so?
722200	724120	Why don't you take a second to relax?
724120	725960	Just chill out a little bit.
725960	727720	Here, have some spiked milk.
730520	734600	Ra-ra, Rasputin, lover of the Russian fleet.
734600	738120	There was a cat that really was gone.
738120	740680	That was having a very interesting effect on her.
740680	744120	I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist punching discourse,
744120	747240	whether it's Nazis or turfs or whatever, is twofold.
747240	748920	First, there's the optics problem.
748920	751400	We want to convince people that, for instance,
751400	754520	trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women.
754520	757080	And I can't help but wonder, is the slogan,
757080	761000	kill all turfs, really the most effective way to convey that message?
762440	766760	And I realize the costume I'm wearing is not the best for making this point either.
766760	769160	But, you know, I just didn't plan well.
769960	774760	The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic and starts being fun,
774760	777480	as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spencer punch.
777480	780840	Because then it's not just that we're saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary to
780840	784200	prevent worse crimes, it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.
784200	788200	And any time real violence becomes fun, that's a little alarming,
788200	790840	because even if your actions are genuinely justified,
790840	793640	you don't want to get in the habit of enjoying real violence,
793640	798440	because the violence will continue to be fun, whether or not your justifications are any good.
798440	802600	Though I agree there's something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-Satism hangup.
802600	806840	For most of history, it was just accepted that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,
806840	809720	and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.
809720	814120	As a boring French postmodernist called Michael Foucault pointed out,
814120	818280	in the 18th and 19th centuries there was a so-called humanitarian revolution
818280	822520	that was suddenly ashamed of overt Satism with respect to criminal justice and treatment of the
822520	826840	mentally ill, replacing brutal executions with intricate techniques of discipline.
826840	829960	And a boring French communist called Alain Badieux
831160	837240	argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance is actually just fucking neoliberal
837240	842360	bullshit that encourages first world people to stage third world humanitarian interventions
842360	846680	that look a lot like invasions for some reason, as well as opposing genuine liberation movements
846680	850760	on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology, the bourgeois liberals claim.
850760	854920	So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence benefits the people in power,
854920	857880	since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia,
857880	862280	and sometimes to make political progress you have to tar and feather some folks and
862280	865320	cut their heads off just a little bit or punch them in the fucking face.
865320	869080	Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this are absolutely horrified right now,
869160	873480	and they're thinking, what's to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and
873480	878120	unjust as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists? To which I respond, well that's an
878120	883000	easy one, it's because my side are the good people and your side are the bad people, I'm so sorry.
883000	887480	Seriously though, that is a pretty good question. Why don't I change the subject to avoid how much
887480	892920	of a problem it is for the argument I'm making? Isn't all politics kind of violent? What about
892920	898200	capitalism? Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings, and it's the relations of
898200	902680	power that maintain or disrupt that organization, so there's always violence or the threat of
902680	907400	violence in there somewhere. In our own society, police will use violence against us if we disobey
907400	912280	the law or are black, and even when white people do obey the law, there's always the implicit
912280	917240	threat of police violence, including the potential arrest and incarceration of pretty much every
917240	923400	citizen who doesn't have enough money to- Let's talk about Western values. According to the great
923400	929080	tradition of European political thought, sovereign power is justified by the social contract. In other
929080	934280	words, we all consent to be governed because it's in our own interest. Except it's really hypothetical
934280	940840	consent more than anything, because no one actually asks you, and you can't say no. Wait a minute.
942360	947400	I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society, it's pretty easy to see how fascism
947400	951800	and revolutionary movements are inherently violent, and how those political situations
951880	956440	generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish. What's harder to see is how the same
956440	961320	tendency spills out at the seams of our own supposedly humane society. We think of the
961320	968760	police as peacekeepers, not killers, yet it's not unheard of that- Oh. Oh no. Oh god.
970040	974760	Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions,
974760	979960	but when you put real human beings in combat situations, the nature of war has a way of just-
979960	988600	Oh. Oh god. No. Fuck. We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,
988600	992760	but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people.
992760	997160	There's also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving,
997160	1001880	or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory, or the low-key normalization
1001880	1006200	of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries, none of which requires so much as
1006200	1010760	a single cackling maniac. So in order to think about this intelligently, we need to weigh the
1010760	1015320	risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem against the
1015320	1020920	risk that our own complacency with the injustices of the status quo will make us quiet enablers of
1020920	1025640	more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence. And I don't feel confident enough to say which
1025640	1030200	one I think is the bigger risk, but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone who doesn't
1030200	1037720	acknowledge the problems with both options. So, in conclusion, is violence good, or is it bad?
1037720	1039320	I guess we'll never know.
1052200	1057080	You know, with any true philosophical question, there always comes a point when you realize that
1057160	1061160	all the rationalizations you tell yourself, or all the things you believe and do, just
1061800	1066200	don't really make any sense. And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?
1066840	1074280	Just do the fucking laundry. Drink some wine. I don't know, do whatever. Look, what do you want from me?
1147080	1154280	Let me know in the comments below, and I'll see you in the next video.
