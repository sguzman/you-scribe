00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you

00:05.440 --> 00:06.440
do.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.480
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with

00:10.480 --> 00:17.240
toad venom, and you simply wait for the Wolverines to eat your legs.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.880
Trust me, you're better off that way.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.900
Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race, well, here's what you get.

00:22.900 --> 00:28.000
You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists tag team title match tonight

00:28.000 --> 00:31.240
at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.880
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy nilly convicting innocent black

00:34.880 --> 00:36.800
people of crimes they didn't commit.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.640
Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices for which they have

00:40.640 --> 00:42.680
to deal with the consequences.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.940
Racism isn't an explanation for everything bad that happens to black people.

00:45.940 --> 00:49.800
If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.180
That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide

00:54.180 --> 00:55.760
to commit more crimes for no reason.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.600
I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music, or deadbeat dads with their sagging

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
pants.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.600
I'd say that this is the most common right wing view of race in America.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.560
It's not outright fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that

01:07.560 --> 01:13.320
racial inequality is a product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
bad choices.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.000
Usually this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial

01:18.000 --> 01:22.080
inequality and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.680
Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.620
This is what I'm going to argue against in this video.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.920
We're going to take a break from talking about fascism.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.240
In the past, I've focused too much on the alt-right.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
I think we all have.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.640
I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement, but it's just not

01:35.640 --> 01:39.040
the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.360
In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America, which

01:42.360 --> 01:45.320
is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.720
And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow

01:48.720 --> 01:52.440
of Pepe's and racist Odinists and neo-Nazi larpers.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.720
All that stuff, it's very last season.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.720
I'm kind of over it.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.720
Oh, god damn it.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.720
Hello Leiter.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.720
Fritz, get the hell out of here.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
No one cares about you anymore.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
No one cares about you anymore.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
No.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
I don't care.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.720
I don't care.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.720
You're still a Nazi.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
Get out.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
But I'm trans.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
How could I possibly be a Nazi?

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
That's a good question.

02:08.720 --> 02:21.720
It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
Get out.

02:22.720 --> 02:27.040
She calls me a Nazi, and yet she is the one trying to silence my free speech, an excellent

02:27.040 --> 02:29.960
example of how truly fascist the left has become.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.760
Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in

02:33.760 --> 02:34.920
the free marketplace of ideas?

02:34.920 --> 02:38.280
Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
of my room.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.680
Mom, get out of my life.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.160
Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish question?

02:43.160 --> 02:44.160
No.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.160
It's just ideas.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.160
What are you afraid of?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.000
I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of

02:49.000 --> 02:50.280
here in ten seconds.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
Ten.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.280
Nine.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
Oh, baby.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
Come on.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
I thought you liked to be.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.280
Six.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.280
You used to whisper to me so sweetly.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.280
Well, not anymore.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.840
Well, do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax?

03:00.840 --> 03:05.200
Hey, Jesus.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.400
I don't like doing this.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.800
I prefer to have conversations about disagreements.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.600
I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.440
They just give you no choice.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.440
Where were we?

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
Right, so racial injustice.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.440
When I talk to people about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists

03:20.440 --> 03:21.920
react to them in two ways.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.000
One, by saying you're racist.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.480
And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.560
And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience

03:30.560 --> 03:31.640
a lot of people have.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.760
And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.760
No offense.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.040
And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are more

03:40.040 --> 03:44.360
than happy to educate people in their own special way.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.360
So as I see it, the left needs to step it up.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.840
Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they

03:49.840 --> 03:54.200
explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole, and it's true, it's not their

03:54.200 --> 03:55.520
job to explain it to you.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.440
They have other shit to do with their lives.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.520
But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my

04:01.520 --> 04:04.520
lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.840
Because it kind of is my job, and I have all the time in the world.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.880
It's a funny thing, time.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.640
Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history?

04:14.640 --> 04:18.920
Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a long time ago?

04:18.920 --> 04:22.840
I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
This person?

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
Who the fuck is that?

04:24.840 --> 04:27.360
No, I don't have any white guilt.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.560
That's not what this is about.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.840
That's just more white narcissism is what that is.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.680
So wipe away those white-ass tears.

04:32.680 --> 04:39.640
Here, I'll pick you out of cotton ball.

04:39.640 --> 04:46.480
1.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
Freddie Gray

04:47.480 --> 04:52.640
On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested

04:52.640 --> 04:56.920
a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted

04:56.920 --> 04:59.320
knife that maybe was illegal.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.880
They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.800
His leg broke and yachts, man, I didn't like that.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three

05:08.800 --> 05:12.480
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.760
A week later, Gray died of his spinal injury, while the Baltimore police released contradictory

05:16.760 --> 05:19.000
and inadequate information about his arrest.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.720
This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious

05:22.720 --> 05:23.720
Baltimore riots.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.320
Now, you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism if black people don't

05:27.320 --> 05:30.280
want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police?

05:30.280 --> 05:34.880
Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent crimes

05:34.880 --> 05:39.120
shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming to

05:39.120 --> 05:40.760
me how quick you are to defend this.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.760
And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine

05:44.760 --> 05:49.040
the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and

05:49.040 --> 05:50.880
are subject to more aggressive policing.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.360
So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.720
Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators

05:58.720 --> 06:02.480
brought this out as evidence that he was no angel.

06:02.480 --> 06:06.360
The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, but he deserved

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
to die.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.440
But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place?

06:09.440 --> 06:13.080
I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.360
Did he just do it for no reason?

06:15.360 --> 06:16.760
Well, let's see.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.960
Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood, Sandtown Winchester.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.760
You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated row house

06:24.760 --> 06:26.400
with peeling lead paint.

06:26.400 --> 06:31.200
Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because

06:31.200 --> 06:35.760
it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to deficits in attention and increased

06:35.760 --> 06:40.040
aggression which may explain why children poisoned with lead are seven times more likely

06:41.040 --> 06:44.680
and six times more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.880
But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with a congressional ban

06:48.880 --> 06:54.440
on lead paint, and as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's

06:54.440 --> 06:58.480
lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.720
Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent

07:02.720 --> 07:05.640
brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.120
Now you might be thinking, well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.080
Well, unfortunately, no.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.960
What's happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead

07:15.960 --> 07:20.240
poisoning victims, some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their

07:20.240 --> 07:24.220
structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total

07:24.220 --> 07:25.220
worth of the settlement.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.480
And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.

07:27.480 --> 07:33.920
In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
$18,300.

07:34.920 --> 07:41.400
They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray siblings

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
settlement for $54,000.

07:43.240 --> 07:48.800
Now I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad, but to understand how it relates to structural

07:48.800 --> 07:52.240
racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.200
Or you know, we could just keep doing livestreams with Richard Spencer.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.600
Interviews with Nazis, the new YouTube craze.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
God damn it.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
I need to relax.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
I need music.

08:00.600 --> 08:06.960
I'm just a race down in every corner.

08:06.960 --> 08:07.960
Two.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.000
Housing discrimination.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.760
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated

08:12.760 --> 08:18.480
lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.160
Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.160
Lead.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.160
Race.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.160
Lead.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
Race.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.240
Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.560
Why in the 21st century is Baltimore still so segregated?

08:32.560 --> 08:35.000
I thought racism was over.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.280
Well, here's the thing about that.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.360
When your country's history is 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't

08:42.360 --> 08:46.320
just get to say, oops, sorry about that.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.800
It's all cool now though, right?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.440
No, it's not cool.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.040
And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.580
Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.

08:56.580 --> 09:01.420
I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that 100 years ago, America may

09:01.420 --> 09:03.100
have been somewhat racist.

09:03.100 --> 09:08.460
In 1910, a Yale educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

09:08.460 --> 09:09.960
white Baltimore neighborhood.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.740
This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city passed an ordinance

09:13.740 --> 09:16.940
mandating the segregation of every residential block.

09:16.940 --> 09:21.740
Basically, the ordinance forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks

09:21.740 --> 09:26.300
and vice versa until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.760
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?

09:29.760 --> 09:32.980
Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.180
Well, no, that's actually not correct.

09:36.180 --> 09:40.620
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote home ownership in

09:40.620 --> 09:43.600
the midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.

09:43.600 --> 09:48.020
One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,

09:48.020 --> 09:51.020
which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.

09:51.020 --> 09:55.020
FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating home ownership throughout the

09:55.020 --> 09:58.860
middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden

09:58.860 --> 10:00.300
age of the American Dream.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.020
But many black Americans were excluded from home ownership and the benefits it conferred

10:04.020 --> 10:08.060
to white families, particularly the family financial stability it enabled.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.860
So how was this exclusion possible?

10:09.860 --> 10:14.860
Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle

10:14.860 --> 10:19.380
methods to enforce residential segregation and deny home ownership to black Americans.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.020
For instance, 1.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.020
Restrictive Covenants

10:22.020 --> 10:27.500
When the 1910 Ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

10:27.500 --> 10:31.740
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods

10:31.740 --> 10:35.660
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

10:35.660 --> 10:39.420
These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued

10:39.420 --> 10:43.420
against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

10:43.420 --> 10:44.420
2.

10:44.420 --> 10:45.420
Red Signing

10:45.420 --> 10:49.340
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to ensure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were

10:49.340 --> 10:53.380
colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name redlining.

10:53.380 --> 10:57.700
This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which, in

10:57.700 --> 11:01.020
turn, left them vulnerable to three predatory lending.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.260
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed

11:05.260 --> 11:10.180
mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans with abusive

11:10.180 --> 11:14.700
terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single

11:14.700 --> 11:15.700
missed payment.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.220
Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and

11:19.220 --> 11:23.700
they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,

11:23.700 --> 11:27.140
further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.

11:27.140 --> 11:28.140
4.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.140
Blockbusting

11:29.140 --> 11:32.540
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting, where they'd

11:32.540 --> 11:37.100
intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of a white

11:37.100 --> 11:38.100
neighborhood.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.140
They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners into selling

11:41.140 --> 11:45.900
their houses at below-market prices so they could resell those same houses at extortionate

11:45.900 --> 11:48.860
prices to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.620
The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped

11:52.620 --> 11:57.780
in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,

11:57.780 --> 11:59.820
and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.700
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains

12:03.700 --> 12:04.700
unredressed.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.780
No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of homeownership

12:08.780 --> 12:14.100
during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated $500 million

12:14.100 --> 12:15.100
in Chicago alone.

12:15.300 --> 12:19.820
But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination

12:19.820 --> 12:21.700
of the last century is still ongoing.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.020
I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fuckin' neighborhood like one mile

12:26.020 --> 12:29.820
away from where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different

12:29.820 --> 12:30.820
country.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.060
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.

12:33.060 --> 12:36.580
I'll compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

12:36.580 --> 12:41.340
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the

12:41.340 --> 12:46.740
same pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects

12:46.740 --> 12:49.860
of racism have not entirely been eradicated.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.140
And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

12:52.140 --> 12:57.740
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,

12:57.740 --> 12:58.940
Cleveland, LA.

12:58.940 --> 13:02.620
All of these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a separate but equal

13:02.620 --> 13:03.940
situation either.

13:03.940 --> 13:08.380
Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore to this map of Baltimore police

13:08.380 --> 13:12.820
stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

13:12.820 --> 13:15.020
recorded police stops of black pedestrians.

13:15.020 --> 13:19.060
And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and

13:19.060 --> 13:20.060
2013.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.700
Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead

13:23.700 --> 13:27.900
exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems

13:27.900 --> 13:31.980
going on here that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their

13:31.980 --> 13:33.300
belts and do less crimes.

13:33.300 --> 13:37.060
But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either, because that only accounts

13:37.060 --> 13:39.180
for a small fraction of what's going on here.

13:39.180 --> 13:43.780
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation, the historical

13:43.780 --> 13:49.100
exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing

13:49.100 --> 13:53.700
insistence on treating a problem of injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.620
I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt.

13:56.620 --> 14:02.620
And it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

14:02.780 --> 14:07.940
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.940
You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.

14:11.940 --> 14:17.700
As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra.

14:17.700 --> 14:21.700
Black Lives Matter are the real racists.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.780
3. Mass Incarceration

14:24.780 --> 14:29.540
Since the 1970s, the United States incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where

14:29.540 --> 14:33.100
nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.660
We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's

14:37.660 --> 14:41.500
prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.420
More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black incarceration

14:45.420 --> 14:47.620
rate is almost 6 times that of whites.

14:47.620 --> 14:51.180
Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in

14:51.180 --> 14:52.180
general.

14:52.180 --> 14:56.020
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants

14:56.020 --> 15:00.260
are pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of

15:00.260 --> 15:01.260
incarceration.

15:01.260 --> 15:04.180
But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

15:04.180 --> 15:07.260
You know, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

15:07.260 --> 15:10.340
If the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.340
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.340
You know what?

15:13.340 --> 15:14.540
Why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.540
Every single YouTuber.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.860
Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.

15:18.860 --> 15:23.580
Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can

15:23.580 --> 15:26.660
finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.660
God damn it.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.660
Where's my toad venom?

15:28.660 --> 15:32.180
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit

15:32.180 --> 15:33.180
more crimes.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.460
For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people are

15:36.460 --> 15:39.020
nearly 4 times as likely to be arrested for it.

15:39.020 --> 15:43.060
And we're talking about a drug that, at this point, white America has basically decided

15:43.060 --> 15:45.580
shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

15:45.580 --> 15:48.380
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.020
And just look what white people are doing to weed.

15:51.020 --> 15:54.740
Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a gondrepreneur.

15:54.740 --> 15:58.300
It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.

15:58.300 --> 16:01.340
It's a great bronco dilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

16:01.340 --> 16:05.660
Yeah, so in fact, in the back of the limousines, only one of the only legal places you can

16:05.660 --> 16:07.460
consume cannabis.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.780
The whites are at it again.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.380
They have gentrified the marijuana.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.900
And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the same drug

16:13.900 --> 16:17.820
that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

16:17.820 --> 16:18.820
A gondrepreneur.

16:18.820 --> 16:20.700
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

16:20.700 --> 16:24.380
This is the most basic kind of unfairness, and if this doesn't make you angry, then

16:24.380 --> 16:30.540
either you're really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.

16:30.540 --> 16:34.500
I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation

16:34.500 --> 16:39.780
about race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial

16:39.780 --> 16:43.980
executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

16:43.980 --> 16:47.460
and the vicious history of discrimination in its ongoing repercussions.

16:47.460 --> 16:51.900
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person

16:51.900 --> 16:55.820
who takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.

16:55.820 --> 16:59.940
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter

16:59.940 --> 17:05.420
is and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism and its unpatriotic and

17:05.420 --> 17:10.540
postmodern and racist, and I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

17:10.540 --> 17:14.140
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.

17:14.140 --> 17:17.620
If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare, it's

17:17.620 --> 17:20.140
locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.980
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk

17:23.980 --> 17:24.980
about that.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.500
They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
How dare they?

17:30.500 --> 17:34.380
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists

17:34.380 --> 17:37.140
or stock, salad-eating, basic white girl caricatures.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.540
I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think, where does this

17:40.540 --> 17:42.540
white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?

17:42.540 --> 17:46.620
I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

17:46.620 --> 17:47.620
And here's the thing about that.

17:47.620 --> 17:51.780
You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility or taking control of your life

17:51.780 --> 17:56.420
to the greatest extent possible is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.500
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.940
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

18:01.940 --> 18:05.980
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.

18:05.980 --> 18:06.980
Please don't do that.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.660
Go succeed as much as possible.

18:08.660 --> 18:12.460
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

18:12.460 --> 18:17.140
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances, but we also have

18:17.140 --> 18:21.860
a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions that create those circumstances

18:21.860 --> 18:22.860
in the first place.

18:22.860 --> 18:23.860
Wow.

18:23.860 --> 18:26.820
I feel like I just gave a great speech.

18:26.820 --> 18:30.500
Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
this entire time?

18:31.500 --> 18:32.660
Look, I even put a lime in it.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.020
Bud Light Lime with Lime.

18:34.020 --> 18:37.500
The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much about people

18:37.500 --> 18:39.460
who complain too much about racism.

18:39.460 --> 18:42.260
For the final...countdown.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.700
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.300
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white

18:48.300 --> 18:49.300
people.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.300
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.580
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country and someone should make videos

18:55.580 --> 18:56.580
about those too.

18:56.580 --> 18:59.020
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

18:59.020 --> 19:02.380
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the

19:02.380 --> 19:03.380
topic.

19:03.380 --> 19:06.620
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

19:06.620 --> 19:08.860
Like, c'mon, that should just be common sense.

19:08.860 --> 19:13.940
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down, smash that unsubscribe button,

19:13.940 --> 19:18.180
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos, and

19:18.180 --> 19:21.460
then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have

19:21.460 --> 19:22.460
to say.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.780
Um, so, I guess that's it.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.140
I was just kidding about the forest.

19:27.140 --> 19:30.020
I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

19:30.020 --> 19:36.020
So, I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

20:00.020 --> 20:07.020
But his truth is marching on.

20:07.020 --> 20:12.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:12.020 --> 20:16.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:16.020 --> 20:20.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:20.020 --> 20:25.020
His truth is marching on.

20:25.020 --> 20:32.020
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea with the glory in his bosom

20:32.020 --> 20:35.020
that transfigures you and me.

20:35.020 --> 20:45.020
As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free while God is marching on.

20:45.020 --> 20:50.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:50.020 --> 20:54.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.020
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:58.020 --> 21:03.020
His truth is marching on.

21:03.020 --> 21:07.020
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy smash the binary hill, Satan.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.020
Ow!
