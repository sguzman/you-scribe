0	12000	Bring me another bottle of moat, Tojo Antoine, apparently the world is ending.
12000	15000	Well, where is he?
15000	19000	Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful, it makes me want to throw up!
19000	22000	Ugh, I'll get him myself.
30000	49000	Antoine?
49000	51000	There you are.
51000	54000	Ugh, this is nerd again.
54000	59000	Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts, please?
59000	62000	I'll think about it. Have you watched my video yet?
62000	64000	The one about the apocalypse?
64000	68000	No, Marie, it's not about the apocalypse, it's about how to stop climate change.
68000	71000	You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube
71000	75000	where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.
75000	76000	Well, I can't stand that.
76000	79000	Well, why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts?
79000	84000	This is extortion. You're sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.
84000	86000	My god, you cucks will stop at nothing.
86000	88000	That's right, open wide.
88000	96000	No, no, no.
96000	99000	Welcome to the lab, the lab of aesthetic climatology.
99000	103000	Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?
103000	106000	Imagine that this is the earth.
106000	110000	This is what the earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.
110000	115000	In 1976, a beta cock named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.
115000	121000	For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness about the grave predictions of climate science.
121000	126000	In particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
126000	132000	Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
132000	142000	But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.
142000	147000	It is half man, half bear, and half pig.
147000	155000	The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic attention-seeking alarmist, an issue-haver, a careabout, a sibilant, moral f***.
155000	161000	I'm super serial, you guys.
161000	164000	We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.
164000	171000	After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.
171000	177000	And in fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.
177000	184000	A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay, Why Are You So Angry? by Inuende Studios.
184000	188000	Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the angry jack effect.
188000	189000	It works like this.
189000	197000	You're at a barbecue, shoving brisket into your front hole when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.
197000	208000	Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan because even if they're not really judging you, the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat.
208000	212000	And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.
212000	215000	So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,
215000	217000	Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?
217000	226000	Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and evolution and people who don't eat meat while their bones fall out.
226000	233000	Besides, you're a hypocrite anyway because more animals die when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.
233000	236000	Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.
236000	243000	This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt, from the potential accusation that you're a bad person,
243000	248000	and you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.
248000	252000	And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.
252000	258000	He's a fun ruiner criticizing our high-emission way of life, and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,
258000	261000	we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.
261000	267000	The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real, and Gore was right all along.
267000	270000	Oopsie doopsie!
270000	275000	So now it's current year and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average,
275000	278000	which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.
278000	287000	Now one degree doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale, consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm.
287000	290000	We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average,
290000	295000	and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century,
295000	300000	an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.
300000	305000	Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees in order to avert global cataclysm.
305000	313000	But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,
313000	320000	the destruction of nearly every coral reef, and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.
320000	324000	The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees,
324000	329000	a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,
329000	331000	and net zero emissions by 2050.
331000	336000	But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions.
336000	341000	Otherwise, we're on track for three degrees of warming, and possibly even four or more,
341000	343000	a situation that could be near apocalypse.
345000	349000	Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.
349000	351000	Weather changes sometimes.
351000	353000	You were just talking about the ice age.
353000	354000	First it was cold.
354000	355000	Now it's getting warmer.
355000	356000	That's just nature.
357000	365000	Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?
365000	371000	Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions is just an attack on the American way of life?
371000	374000	Another excuse for big government to take away my freedom.
374000	376000	What freedom? Are you an oil company?
376000	378000	Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?
378000	380000	Isn't that what you liberals think?
380000	381000	My identity is valid.
381000	382000	No it isn't.
382000	384000	Bring me my smelling thoughts.
384000	385000	Watch the goddamn video.
389000	391000	Imagine the year is 2100.
391000	396000	I want you to picture the earth as a human vagina, and imagine you're a gynecologist
396000	400000	and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.
400000	402000	How does that make you feel, kids?
402000	407000	I bet you wish your irresponsible gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this.
407000	410000	So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,
410000	415000	but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right?
415000	420000	Is there climate change yet? Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back?
420000	423000	Probably, that's what I think. I believe it goes this way.
423000	427000	Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,
427000	432000	from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax aimed at undermining American manufacturing
432000	437000	to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside, therefore whatever happened to global warming?
437000	441000	Of course, the term global warming refers to the increase in the global average temperature,
441000	443000	temperature continuing to vary by region.
443000	447000	In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder.
447000	451000	For instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic conveyor belt is disrupted,
451000	455000	chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.
455000	457000	But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.
457000	460000	He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know?
460000	463000	A real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary
463000	468000	and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual or scientific or true
468000	473000	or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible.
473000	478000	He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want on some sub-rational erotic level
478000	482000	to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god-emperor.
482000	484000	Burn the scholars, build the wall.
484000	488000	But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy civilizations
488000	493000	plunge into primeval darkness, is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy
493000	497000	about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.
497000	500000	A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change
500000	503000	found that 97% of papers published on the subject
503000	506000	supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming
506000	509000	and the consensus has only increased over time.
509000	513000	Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe but is very common in America,
514000	519000	largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation
519000	523000	that goes back to the early 1990s when the Western Fuels Association
523000	525000	developed a strategy to quote,
525000	528000	reposition global warming as theory, not fact,
528000	531000	and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way
531000	534000	to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.
534000	538000	Climate denialists' talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,
538000	542000	have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family
542000	545000	and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,
545000	548000	perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe,
548000	551000	whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies
551000	554000	and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments
554000	556000	as throwing a snowball to own the libs.
556000	558000	So here, Mr. President, catch this.
559000	563000	Denialists' talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords
563000	565000	to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins
565000	568000	where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.
568000	572000	Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information,
572000	576000	climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.
576000	579000	Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,
579000	582000	has received thousands of hate messages, death threats,
582000	584000	even white powder in the mail.
584000	587000	The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering
587000	591000	as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,
591000	594000	and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.
594000	596000	It's likely that this video will attract some deniers
596000	600000	and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource
600000	603000	listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as
603000	606000	there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change.
606000	607000	There isn't.
607000	609000	What if the sun is getting hotter?
609000	611000	It's not, at least in the relevant time frame.
611000	614000	And science is a liar sometimes.
614000	616000	But even if you don't believe in science,
616000	619000	maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,
619000	622000	including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real
622000	624000	and caused by human activity.
624000	626000	In fact, at the behest of oil companies,
626000	630000	the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds
630000	633000	to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,
633000	636000	largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides
636000	638000	and more severe tropical storms.
638000	642000	After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion
642000	645000	to, quote, future-proof the state,
645000	647000	despite the fact that many of its top politicians
647000	649000	are public climate change deniers.
649000	652000	You remember how it used to be called global warming?
652000	654000	And then magically the theory changed to climate change?
654000	655000	Sure.
655000	656000	The reason is it wasn't warming.
656000	660000	Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.
660000	661000	The science is clear.
661000	663000	Climate change is real, and humans are causing it.
663000	667000	If even ExxonMobil says it's real, it's probably real.
667000	669000	There's really no point in digging in your heels
669000	673000	and refusing to look at the evidence just because you don't want it to be true.
673000	676000	None of us want it to be true.
676000	678000	Okay, fine.
678000	681000	So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer
681000	684000	and maybe humans have something to do with it.
684000	686000	Now, can you give me my smelling salts?
686000	689000	Fine.
689000	692000	Look, Doc, I've got to say, maybe the scientists are right.
692000	694000	Maybe it is happening.
694000	698000	But to be honest with you, I'm having a hard time caring about this,
698000	699000	like, at all.
699000	701000	How can you not care about this?
701000	703000	We're talking about the future of the planet.
703000	704000	Well, I don't care about the planet.
704000	705000	I care about me.
705000	707000	Well, don't you live on the planet?
707000	708000	Mm-hmm.
708000	712000	And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?
712000	714000	Now, goddamn it.
714000	719000	Watch the video.
719000	720000	If you picture the Earth as a watermelon,
720000	724000	you can see there's the outer shell here that traps the red flesh.
724000	727000	And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers...
727000	729000	The stalkers come for the red flesh.
729000	731000	Before describing the details of our doom,
731000	734000	let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.
734000	738000	The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896
738000	742000	when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arhenius published a study
742000	747000	titled On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Earth,
747000	750000	in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production
750000	752000	would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.
752000	756000	By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere
756000	758000	was in fact rising,
758000	761000	and President Bucken-Johnson's Science Advisory Committee
761000	765000	warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect.
765000	771000	The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968
771000	775000	that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels,
775000	778000	but nothing was really done about it until 1988
778000	783000	when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,
783000	787000	that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty,
787000	791000	and that the warming was worsening heat waves, storms, and droughts.
791000	796000	That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change
796000	798000	and its political and economic impacts,
798000	802000	so it started to seem like something was going to change.
802000	806000	But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry
806000	808000	was up and running in the United States,
808000	813000	despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades,
813000	818000	and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called skeptic cause.
818000	821000	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol
821000	824000	pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
824000	827000	a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.
827000	831000	The 2012 Republican Platform stated against all scientific consensus that
831000	832000	quote,
838000	842000	Then, finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better.
842000	847000	195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama,
847000	849000	became parties to the Paris Agreement,
849000	852000	which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature
852000	854000	to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
854000	858000	For the very next year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States
858000	861000	on a platform of outright climate science denial.
861000	865000	Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement,
865000	868000	appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
868000	871000	and released his America First Energy Plan,
871000	874000	which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.
874000	880000	So it's with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the GRIM 2018 IPCC report,
880000	884000	which informs us that the world has already warmed 1 degrees Celsius,
884000	887000	resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,
887000	890000	increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events,
890000	894000	and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika.
894000	899000	If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030
899000	901000	and to net zero carbon by 2050,
901000	906000	global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,
906000	910000	resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought
910000	915000	and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise.
915000	917000	But with the current political situation,
917000	921000	the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach.
921000	925000	By the end of the century, we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,
925000	929000	which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions.
929000	933000	3 degrees of warming will flood many of the world's major coastal cities,
933000	938000	including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong.
938000	942000	4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference between early 20th century temperatures
942000	943000	and the last ice age.
943000	948000	A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas
948000	951000	will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity,
951000	956000	trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.
956000	959000	So it's not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs.
959000	962000	There are real human consequences to this.
962000	965000	See? This is why you should care.
965000	966000	It's not just about the planet.
966000	969000	It's about the millions of people who are going to die or lose their homes.
969000	972000	Oh, jeez, wow.
972000	975000	Gosh, that's really just too bad.
975000	977000	What kind of response is that?
977000	981000	Look, Doc, people die all the time.
981000	983000	What am I supposed to do? Cry about it?
983000	985000	No, you're supposed to take political action.
985000	990000	Yeah, I guess I could do that.
990000	995000	But this bath is very relaxing.
995000	998000	Well, look, even if you only care about yourself,
998000	1000000	you do realize that when the coastal cities flood,
1000000	1003000	we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?
1003000	1005000	Are you going to be okay with that?
1005000	1006000	No.
1006000	1009000	Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.
1009000	1010000	No!
1010000	1012000	Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.
1012000	1013000	No!
1013000	1016000	You do realize, right, that in a hundred years
1016000	1018000	everyone is going to look back on people like you
1018000	1020000	and they're going to hate you so much
1020000	1022000	for what you allowed to happen to this planet.
1022000	1024000	Well, those are future people.
1024000	1025000	I am alive now.
1025000	1027000	And besides, if what you're saying is true,
1027000	1030000	then this is basically the apocalypse anyway,
1030000	1032000	so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right?
1032000	1034000	But it's not the apocalypse, though.
1034000	1037000	Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism,
1037000	1040000	because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem.
1040000	1044000	Please, God, please, just try to focus on solving the problem
1044000	1046000	while we still have time.
1046000	1047000	So you're saying the world is ending.
1047000	1048000	Cheers to that.
1048000	1050000	The world is not ending.
1050000	1052000	It's just getting shittier.
1052000	1054000	Well, what am I supposed to do about it?
1054000	1056000	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
1056000	1059000	All right, let me just re-up here.
1064000	1069000	Ah.
1069000	1071000	All right, Doc.
1071000	1072000	Put it in me.
1072000	1073000	You are repulsive.
1073000	1074000	Well, I'm so sorry.
1074000	1075000	You're offended by pleasure.
1075000	1077000	I'm not offended by what?
1077000	1079000	This offends you, doesn't it?
1079000	1080000	Are you triggered, liberal?
1080000	1081000	Are you triggered?
1081000	1082000	No.
1082000	1083000	I'm not triggered.
1083000	1085000	Stop trying to pretend you're not owned.
1085000	1087000	You know, you really shouldn't be supporting the dairy industry.
1087000	1089000	They cause massive carbon emissions.
1090000	1096000	Well, maybe you shouldn't be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite.
1096000	1097000	What?
1097000	1099000	It's soy milk anyway, science nerd.
1099000	1101000	How do you think I got so feminine?
1101000	1103000	There's nothing in science to support that.
1103000	1105000	Just admit that you're offended.
1105000	1107000	Please just watch the video.
1114000	1118000	When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon,
1118000	1120000	and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder,
1120000	1122000	where did they all come from, you know?
1122000	1123000	What does this all mean?
1123000	1127000	The cosmos, humanity, our little time here on Earth.
1127000	1129000	And that's why I became a scientist,
1129000	1137000	so I could spend my life studying topospheric trace gases.
1144000	1146000	If you want to do your part to stop climate change,
1146000	1148000	there are some lifestyle changes you can make.
1148000	1150000	You can use LED light bulbs.
1150000	1152000	You can drive a hybrid or electric car.
1152000	1154000	You can use public transportation.
1154000	1156000	You can try not to fly very often.
1156000	1157000	You can eat less red meat.
1157000	1163000	But the reality is, just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions,
1163000	1167000	and the burden of stopping this can't really be placed on individual consumers.
1167000	1170000	The companies themselves do not care.
1170000	1173000	Left to their own devices, they will only pursue short-term profit.
1173000	1175000	They will ask the government to build them sea walls,
1175000	1177000	while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.
1177000	1183000	Climate change is exactly the kind of problem that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.
1183000	1186000	The timeframe involved is short enough that scientists can predict
1186000	1189000	total catastrophe in the foreseeable future,
1189000	1194000	but just long enough not to enter into the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.
1194000	1197000	So unless there's a drastic change in the next couple decades,
1197000	1201000	this is going to be capitalism's great Chinese famine moment,
1201000	1203000	only potentially it'll be much, much worse.
1203000	1207000	This is probably the most important issue facing humanity in the 21st century,
1207000	1210000	so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,
1210000	1212000	beginning with rapid political change.
1212000	1215000	If that means direct action, it means direct action,
1215000	1220000	for instance organizing, participating in, or supporting a massive general strike.
1220000	1224000	You also should demand that your politicians take a strong stance against climate change
1224000	1226000	and the companies that cause it.
1226000	1227000	And if you're American,
1227000	1231000	vote this monumental ding-dong out of the Oval Office in 2020
1232000	1235000	before the entire planet shrinks and transforms into a corn cob.
1240000	1241000	So let me get this straight.
1241000	1245000	You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.
1245000	1248000	You're basically asking me to completely change who I am as a person
1248000	1250000	and become everything I hate.
1250000	1251000	Yeah, pretty much.
1251000	1253000	But it's not about what I want.
1253000	1257000	It's about what everyone has to do to preserve the survival of humanity.
1257000	1260000	Well, electric cars.
1260000	1261000	Veganism.
1261000	1262000	Who could even afford that shit?
1262000	1265000	Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne.
1265000	1267000	I shall do no such thing.
1267000	1269000	Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.
1269000	1273000	I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.
1273000	1277000	You know, eating plant-based meals actually costs less than eating meat.
1277000	1278000	Oh, okay.
1278000	1285000	So just never again enjoy the morning aroma of bacon sizzling on the skillet,
1285000	1293000	barbecued ribs, fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops, bloody steaks.
1293000	1294000	Ew.
1294000	1297000	Why do you want to eat all that murdered animal flesh anyway
1297000	1303000	when you could eat pure, clean, natural foods like lentils, barley, and sprouts?
1306000	1307000	I'd rather eat human shit
1307000	1310000	when that's what you're going to be eating if the planet hates another few degrees.
1310000	1314000	How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels when there's Muslims out there?
1314000	1315000	And Mexicans.
1315000	1317000	There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.
1317000	1320000	Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you
1320000	1324000	when all the climate science in the world just bounces off that thick skull of yours?
1324000	1327000	So first of all, you people think everything is racist.
1327000	1331000	And second, I guess I just need a villain, you know?
1331000	1332000	Who's the bad guy?
1332000	1333000	Who am I afraid of?
1333000	1334000	What's the other team?
1334000	1337000	Your climate story has no antagonist.
1337000	1338000	Is that really what it's going to take?
1338000	1339000	All right, then.
1339000	1343000	Why don't you take a long, hard look out at the sea?
1343000	1344000	All right, Mama.
1344000	1345000	That's right.
1345000	1346000	There she is.
1346000	1348000	Now look right over there.
1350000	1352000	Hello, mankind.
1352000	1356000	It is I, your dark mother, the sea.
1356000	1360000	And you, my children, have been an absolute disappointment.
1360000	1362000	Every one of you is so pathetic.
1362000	1363000	You make me want to throw up.
1363000	1369000	Politicians, businessmen, and worst of all, environmentalists.
1369000	1370000	Ugh.
1370000	1372000	The condescension of it all.
1372000	1375000	You think you are capable of hurting me?
1375000	1376000	Huh.
1376000	1378000	I enjoy your so-called degradation.
1378000	1380000	Your filthy air makes me hot.
1380000	1383000	Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside.
1383000	1388000	And when you spew your filth all over, oh, it only makes me fucking wet.
1388000	1393000	Every year, my heaving bosom encroaches farther on your shores.
1393000	1398000	And as I spat you out, my children, I will swallow you all.
1398000	1400000	I will take every inch of you inside me.
1400000	1405000	And I will suck you down into the deep black pit of my wetness, you scum.
1405000	1406000	And why?
1406000	1409000	Because I am a slut.
1409000	1411000	My progeny encompass the earth.
1411000	1414000	And whatsoever I create, I shall destroy.
1414000	1420000	For I, your deep, dark mother, am at once deliverest of your doom.
1420000	1423000	And that's why I vote Republican.
1424000	1434000	You see that?
1434000	1437000	We've got 20 years to stop her, or we're fucked.
1453000	1454000	We're fucked.
1454000	1455000	We're fucked.
1455000	1456000	We're fucked.
1456000	1457000	We're fucked.

1460000	1461000	We're fucked.
1461000	1462000	We're fucked.
1462000	1463000	We're fucked.
1463000	1464000	We're fucked.
1464000	1465000	We're fucked.
1465000	1466000	We're fucked.
1466000	1467000	We're fucked.
1467000	1468000	We're fucked.
1468000	1469000	We're fucked.
1469000	1470000	We're fucked.
1470000	1471000	We're fucked.
1471000	1472000	We're fucked.
1472000	1473000	We're fucked.
1473000	1474000	We're fucked.
1474000	1475000	We're fucked.
1475000	1476000	We're fucked.
1476000	1477000	We're fucked.
1477000	1478000	We're fucked.
1478000	1479000	We're fucked.
1479000	1481000	We're fucked.
