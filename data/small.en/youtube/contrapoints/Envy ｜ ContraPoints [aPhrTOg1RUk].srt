1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,960
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,240
We have to dial in.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,760
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,240
This was the day that Fire Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,080
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
There was a lot of hype.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,600
Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,200
There was a promo video full of supermodels.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,720
Tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,000
One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,200
and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,200
So, when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure, turned

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,400
out to be two slices of pallet American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,280
that can only be described as muddy third world shanty town.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,440
I mean, if you weren't on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Just learned about Fire Festival, AKA Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,720
rich white kids.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,520
Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,120
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fire Festival.

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,560
Instagram, entitled rich kids.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,600
Meet Lord of the Flies.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
Let them eat salad.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,000
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,040
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,320
sandwiches were garbage.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,200
Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,800
Imagine looking like this.

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Imagine being perfect.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

31
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,560
Why are you doing this to women?

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,920
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila, your skin is so perfect,

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
ooh woo.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,320
And Jamila replied, my skin is currently clear because a, privileged people have more access

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,960
to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
with less privilege.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,680
I also get to sleep more because of this.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,000
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
easily.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,520
I believe that trans rights are human rights.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,680
See, I exfiliate twice a week.

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh boy.

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, barge.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll protect you, queen.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Could she be any more annoying?

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,920
Someone wondered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,480
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,000
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,800
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,640
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of this sting out of inequality,

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
does it?

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,400
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,520
your privilege, a suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart since the rich

55
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,240
and famous now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
to the rabble.

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,200
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
it.

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Take me mother.

61
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,800
of the coronavirus pandemic.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,240
40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,360
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,280
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,200
normal for just a brief moment in time.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,820
I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now.

70
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,920
So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Hashtag this is 40, attack me bitch.

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,920
But like Jameela, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver and once

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,480
again, it has not gone well.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,120
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
eat cake.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,160
Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,700
evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?

78
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Your tweet made 10 times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
gross.

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
Happy birthday, mmm.

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,800
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfucking.

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,760
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
was not that she had the party.

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,640
I mean, wouldn't she escape to a private island if you got that milk money?

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,000
The problem was more that she tweeted about it and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
a little bit yikesy.

87
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,680
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
This isn't a good look.

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
We say bad optics.

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Not relatable.

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,480
Relatable.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,120
Relatability is not a moral category.

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,480
This is public relations.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
It's not ethics.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,560
And it definitely isn't socialism.

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,520
Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said.

97
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,160
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,400
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,640
This should have stayed in the drafts.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Hashtag tone deaf.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Isn't the issue that when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine.

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,240
We didn't get to have birthday parties.

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,960
Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.

104
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,920
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,000
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,840
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

107
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,920
music festivals or Kim K's birthday party or Jamila Jamil's privileged pores, no one

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,520
ever uses the word envy.

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,400
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
own psychology.

111
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,840
So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
What is it?

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,240
Where does it come from?

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,960
And seriously, what is Jamila Jamil's skincare routine?

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Drop it in the comments, bestie.

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay, so what is envy?

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,840
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,200
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,120
what we want but cannot get.

120
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,160
It's not simply wanting what another person has.

121
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,080
That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,320
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

123
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,040
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,080
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
It's emulation or admiration.

126
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
At worst it's what the Bible calls coveting.

127
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
It covets.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,120
Envy is something darker.

129
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,800
It's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what they have.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,200
You might even hate the person you envy and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,640
and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

132
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,480
Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John

133
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Milton.

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,160
It's going to be 90 minutes of milf jokes, kids, so strap in.

135
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,040
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,120
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

137
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,560
celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

138
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,760
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is, beautiful,

139
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,880
wealthy, masculine men.

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,000
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,800
want to date chads or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

142
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,200
Gaskeep gate boss girl light.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,800
So if you're incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's

144
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,600
emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has.

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Or, and this is the more popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing

146
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever

147
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,160
want you, and therefore happiness isn't possible, you may as well lie down and rot.

148
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,320
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia

149
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,280
timeline dedicated to tracking them, and the essential motivation for this violence

150
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,920
is envy.

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,600
The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,520
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I

153
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,960
want, then no one can.

154
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
In the words of a murderer,

155
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,920
The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,440
But most incels aren't murderers.

157
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,040
The philosopher Max Schaller called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

159
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,120
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
Because the other sins are fun, right?

161
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Greed, gluttony, lust?

162
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,480
That's what I call a good time.

163
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,280
But envy is misery.

164
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,320
Air Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives

166
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
would be like without rich parents, yes.

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
Rich refugee crisis.

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,880
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

169
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Look around you.

170
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,160
We've got the guillotine memes, we've got edgy teens tweeting Eat the Rich.

171
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,000
And none of this is new.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,880
The slogan Eat the Rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,680
Jean-Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said, when the people have no more to eat, they

174
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,080
will eat the rich.

175
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
And fair enough.

176
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
It's a good source of protein.

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
But take it from me, kids.

178
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,680
Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

179
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
It's hard to do just once.

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,760
You develop a taste for it.

181
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,720
It's like they say at NA meetings.

182
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
Once you've wore, you just want more.

183
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,920
Also, who counts as the rich?

184
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Am I the rich?

185
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
I certainly hope so.

186
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Because I want you to eat.

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Stop it.

188
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,360
See, this is why I quit academia.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

190
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,480
And I don't want to behave myself.

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I want to be bad.

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Do you want to be bad with me?

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Let's be bad.

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:50,560
So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality, and that societies

195
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,080
that have more inequality have more envy.

196
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
I used to assume that too.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,440
But the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not be true.

198
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,360
Envy is a basic part of human nature.

199
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,960
It exists in all societies and all economic systems, and it begins anytime two or more

200
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,400
people start comparing themselves.

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,240
Part two, the desire for mommy's milk.

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,200
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, daddy, the first stage of human development

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,940
is the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course

204
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,840
provided by mommy milkies.

205
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
Am I doing too much?

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
I'll turn it down just a little bit.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,360
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true, he was a bit

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,280
of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas, like penis envy.

209
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,200
Maybe there's transgender men who experienced that, but I don't think it's a basic

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,240
fact of the female condition.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

212
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Because I take that personally.

213
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm giving it a very serious consideration, doctor.

214
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,880
But I feel like even when Freud is wrong, he's often at least onto something.

215
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Like with the Oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
That would be weird.

217
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,960
It's more that you desire an archetype.

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,920
Mother, right?

219
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Mommy.

220
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
You guys got it.

221
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.

222
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
They're the ones who got me started on this milf shit.

223
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm a reverse Socrates, I've been corrupted by the young.

224
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,560
My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.

225
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,760
So Freud says that in the first two years of life, libido is primarily focused on mommy's

226
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
milk.

227
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,320
It's also in this stage that envy first emerges.

228
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,360
So I was the oldest child in my family and I was less than two years old when my brother

229
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
was born.

230
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,280
So I don't remember this because I was one year old, but my family tells me that when

231
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,880
my brother was born, I was just insanely jealous.

232
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,920
Oh, and I guess now's a good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.

233
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,640
Scholars agree that there is a difference and usually they describe the difference in

234
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,920
one of two ways.

235
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,840
The first is that jealousy is defensive.

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,320
It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours, whereas envy is offensive.

237
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

238
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,520
And the second difference is that envy is between two people, the envier and the envied,

239
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,480
whereas jealousy typically involves three people as in romantic jealousy, where you

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,080
have the subject, the romantic object, and then the rival.

241
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,320
And the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship

242
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,240
with the romantic object, and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry, just substituting

243
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,400
the romantic object for mommy.

244
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,760
Of course, in ordinary English, people are always going to say jealousy when they really

245
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,960
mean envy, probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,560
And I think it's pointless to try to fight that.

247
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,040
Like I wouldn't go around correcting people, but just keep in mind that there is a difference.

248
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,320
So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?

249
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Well, I think it's both, because initially you're defensive of your privileged only

250
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,440
child relationship with your parents.

251
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,080
But a new baby often gets more attention, at least in your paranoid toddler brain,

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,520
and you might be envious of that.

253
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,160
In a romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival if she has qualities that you wish

254
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
you had.

255
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,160
You know, young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might

256
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,320
be getting preferential treatment.

257
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:24,080
One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is, it's not FAIR, it's not FAIR, tell me

258
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
about it, Pampino.

259
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,840
And I've got bad news, life is not getting any more fair than this.

260
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,880
According to the Bible, one of the first events in human history is the story of Caein, Iabel,

261
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Luso Sermanos.

262
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know why I said it in Spanish.

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,760
I guess I just thought it would sound cool.

264
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Was I wrong?

265
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Caein.

266
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,840
It sounds so much better than Caein, Caein and Abel, Caein and Abel.

267
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,520
God tells Caein and Abel each to make a sacrifice, and then God prefers Abel's, you know, because

268
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
God loves meat.

269
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,920
Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel, in spite towards God the Father, Caein kills

270
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,360
his younger brother.

271
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,960
In my earliest memories of my brother, I already loved him, and I don't remember the envy,

272
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,560
so I guess I wasn't a Caein.

273
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,440
So I must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder.

274
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,920
Freud says that the older siblings' envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence.

275
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Because at first, you selfishly want to be the special, most loved child.

276
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,040
But you see that your parents love your sibling just as much as you, and you're powerless

277
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
to do anything about it.

278
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,720
So your ambition to superiority fails.

279
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,680
And so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as your

280
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
envy.

281
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,280
And the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct, solidarity, this

282
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,360
feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings.

283
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,480
And as you get older, the herd instinct evolves into feelings about justice, duty, community,

284
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
and equality.

285
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,880
But Freud thought these feelings retain a vestige of repressed envy.

286
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,480
If I can't be the favorite, if I can't have special privileges, then no one can.

287
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,280
And from these observations, Freud made the generalization.

288
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,760
Social justice means that we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do

289
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,240
without them as well.

290
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,480
Okay, so we don't want other people to have anything we can't have, so we enviously insist

291
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,120
on equality as a defense against the greater prosperity of others.

292
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.

293
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Like I think Freud is definitely onto something here, but don't some of our community feelings

294
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,520
also come from a place of genuine care for other people?

295
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,080
I cared for someone once, brosled.

296
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Well we'll come back to that later.

297
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,920
Let's put a pin in me for now, a pin in it for now, and Freud, I mean.

298
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Let's put a pin in Freud.

299
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:14,120
In a 1966 book titled Envy, A Theory of Social Behavior, the sociologist Helmut Schuch argued

300
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,040
that rather than being, that is a very German name, Helmut Schuch, he's putting me in a

301
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,280
German mood, sweetie, Hallo Meine Lieben, Heute Gipps ein Neues Video.

302
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,720
I just get worse at German every year.

303
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,160
Schuch argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality, Envy

304
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,680
is a universal across all human societies, including very egalitarian ones.

305
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,280
For example, in tribal and village cultures around the world, there's often a concept

306
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,320
of black magic or witchcraft, which are thought to be used by Envy as people to bewitch the

307
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
ones they envy.

308
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,400
You're probably familiar with the concept of the evil eye, which originates in ancient

309
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,080
Greece or maybe even earlier than that.

310
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,640
Researchers all over the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse, cast by the

311
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
malignant gaze of an envious person.

312
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,680
Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious, but I actually think the concept of the evil

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,160
eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy, and of the social danger that it

314
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
poses.

315
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,320
You've probably seen these amulets around, there's an emoji for them now, which are

316
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,440
supposed to protect against the evil eye.

317
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,600
It's called a nazar, which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance, similar

318
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,880
to the origin of the English word envy, which is the Latin invidia, which just means to

319
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
look at.

320
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,600
So there's an agreement across cultures that envy is related to sight, the malevolent

321
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,520
gaze, the evil eye, and these amulets show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied

322
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,280
and want to protect themselves.

323
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,640
I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel with an episode on the evil eye, and the host

324
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,720
explains that for Muslims, it's customary to say, or God has willed it when admiring

325
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,400
a person or object, you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.

326
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I love that.

327
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,440
It's like no envy, like no homo, but no envy, masha la.

328
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,000
The top comment on that video says, you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
monster?

330
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,120
Well, don't tell others about your ideas, goals, or wishes.

331
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,680
Don't be flaunting your accomplishments on social media or posting pictures of your

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,200
children.

333
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
That's how you avoid being jinxed.

334
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,560
See, this is where Kim Kardashian went wrong with her birthday post.

335
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,120
Clearly, no one in the Kardashian Cinematic Universe has ever heard of the evil eye.

336
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.

337
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,240
Why haven't they heard of the evi- oh, okay, nevermind.

338
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,080
Every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.

339
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,760
This is a particularly American thing.

340
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,960
Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,280
Like there's advertisements here that literally promise, if you buy this exclusive luxury

342
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,600
vibrator, you'll be the envy of all your friends.

343
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,720
As if it's a good thing to be envied.

344
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
Oh, but it is not.

345
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,960
If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?

346
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,040
They seethe over your successes and celebrate your misfortunes.

347
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,720
Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.

348
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,600
So why would anyone want to be envied?

349
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.

350
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,400
On the one hand, we need to be loved, but then there's this other drive in us, this

351
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,120
like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches, which is kind of in conflict with

352
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,560
our need to be loved.

353
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,400
In a past Gilded Age, there were stories like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard which warned

354
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,400
what a sad and lonely thing success can become.

355
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,160
In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostrachismos, which is the

356
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,360
origin of the English word ostracism.

357
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,480
Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble and each person would write

358
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,140
the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

359
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,740
And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for 10 years.

360
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,240
No questions asked.

361
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,520
I love the ancient world.

362
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Things were so direct.

363
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,820
Now this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant or

364
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,240
just annoying.

365
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,120
According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, and one anecdote about

366
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Aristides known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen

367
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,920
not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.

368
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,080
When Aristides asked why, the man replied, it was because he was sick of hearing him

369
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,120
being called the Just.

370
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
It's good!

371
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
It's so good!

372
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,160
See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

373
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,960
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

374
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,200
People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a

375
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,200
massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

376
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,440
According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

377
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,080
This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome because the tallest poppies in the garden will

378
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
be cut.

379
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,760
Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

380
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,800
In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position

381
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,880
by purchasing several smaller fields, rather than one larger piece of land.

382
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,380
For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.

383
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,960
He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.

384
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,240
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously

385
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,080
wealthy families who move to the city and they dress like gutter punks, like they're

386
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,160
trying to pass as poor.

387
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,880
But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy in the way many other cultures

388
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,000
do, and I don't think that's an accident.

389
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,320
We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to

390
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,840
our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

391
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,780
But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely

392
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,900
still there, only repressed, confined to the realm of dreams and art.

393
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,480
In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting

394
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,880
the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear

395
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
of envy.

396
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,180
Black magic, Black Swan.

397
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,380
At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.

398
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,340
By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead

399
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
ballerina she's replaced.

400
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,940
Did you suck his c**t?

401
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,180
Not all of us have to.

402
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,380
I love Winona Ryder so much, I love Natalie Portman so much, I love Mila Kunis so much,

403
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
I just like women.

404
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,220
Where's my shock wand?

405
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
Stop it.

406
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Stop stanning.

407
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,100
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia as Nina begins hallucinating Black Swan doppelgangers

408
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,100
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.

409
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

410
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,580
They'll getcha.

411
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,500
Did you have some sort of leslie wet dream about me?

412
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Stop.

413
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,940
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the

414
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,500
disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism

415
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,100
and also of dancing the Black Swan.

416
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,140
So she imagines that part of herself is an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

417
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,860
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

418
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,980
There's her dominant white swan impulse, which we could call the squidward personality.

419
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,220
Perfectionistic and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.

420
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,460
And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse, which we could call the Spongebob

421
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,460
personality.

422
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,140
Intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.

423
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,260
In Spongebob Squarepants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming

424
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,740
from failed ambition.

425
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,860
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

426
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,620
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of

427
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,260
his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.

428
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,900
Spongebob is Squidward's social equal.

429
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,220
They're literally neighbors, and they both work the same fast food service job for the

430
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,540
same exploitative capitalist.

431
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,140
But Spongebob is a Mozardian intuitive genius who's able to transform the most mundane

432
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:26,060
activities, blowing bubbles, flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

433
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,900
Squidward intensely envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't

434
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,460
admit that envy to himself.

435
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,180
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for

436
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,620
Spongebob's childish behavior.

437
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,180
What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.

438
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:55,740
Though deep down, Squidward really wants what Spongebob has, which we see when he can't

439
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,700
help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away all of his possessions for

440
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,900
the chewing gum wrapper that in Spongebob's hands was a source of infinite entertainment.

441
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,340
A lot of people my age who watched Spongebob as a kid rewatch it now and are horrified

442
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,100
to discover that they identify with Squidward.

443
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,620
Whereas as children, they identify with Spongebob.

444
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,140
Well, you either die a Spongebob or you live long enough to see yourself become the Squidward.

445
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,780
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing

446
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,340
drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.

447
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,780
I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

448
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Squidwardian?

449
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Are we saying that word?

450
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,220
Are we really saying that word out loud?

451
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,980
To an audience of millions?

452
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Okay.

453
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,860
It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

454
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,900
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart.

455
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,660
You gotta watch out for that one, kids.

456
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,660
If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose

457
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,380
a requiem math for your own father, just say no.

458
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,020
So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants, we have a diligent those stuffy wannabe envying the

459
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,980
effortless playfulness of the spontaneous genius.

460
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:27,700
So Squidward's envy of Spongebob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

461
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,300
Look, if we were to view Spongebob Squarepants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche

462
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,420
– stay with me, ladies, I have an angle here – we could say that Squidward represents

463
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,620
what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse, while Spongebob represents the Dionysian.

464
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,700
Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

465
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,700
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,

466
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,100
order, logic, morality, and the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward

467
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,260
intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.

468
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:08,060
Both Spongebob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict, with the Apollonian envying

469
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
the Dionysian.

470
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,380
Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created, because Nietzsche's

471
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,700
whole point is that you need a balance of the two drives.

472
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,220
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like Spongebob, because creating good

473
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,980
art requires at least some level of discipline and ordering.

474
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,420
See, it is all in the technique.

475
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,060
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

476
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,300
Get off the stage!

477
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,060
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

478
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,420
In order to give the perfect performance, Nina has to unify her fragmented personality

479
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,980
and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry between her two artistic impulses.

480
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,220
And it's perfect.

481
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,980
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers, can you guess it?

482
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:08,180
Is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us, which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and

483
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,100
fear of the American middle class.

484
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,900
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house and a boat, along

485
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,700
with the Tylers, a slightly better off-white family, whom the Wilsons envy.

486
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,300
You saw their new car, right?

487
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,180
You had to do it, you just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.

488
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,500
One night the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

489
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak, explains that her family is metaphysically

490
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,900
tethered to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions of their lives and a liminal

491
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,380
backroom's underworld.

492
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,900
Super fucking liminal, I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting, not again.

493
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,220
Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.

494
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,980
The two were connected, tethered together.

495
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:07,260
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty, but when the shadow was hungry,

496
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,500
she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

497
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,580
You later find out that all over the U.S., oh, U.S. spells us.

498
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,940
Hey, that's the title of the movie.

499
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Ohhhhh.

500
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,900
The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers and to link arms across the

501
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,740
country in a dark parody of the real world 1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across

502
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
America.

503
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,940
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege and

504
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
fear of envy.

505
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,700
It's not a movie about the working class.

506
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,300
If it was a movie about the working class, then the working class would be able to speak

507
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,420
human languages and would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds and stagger around

508
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,700
like zombies.

509
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,220
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.

510
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,100
Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

511
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:12,580
The fear of the envious poor, of revolution, of slave revolt, but us diverges from other

512
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,780
home invasion movies by not just being fearful about the underclass, but also guilty.

513
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,940
The idea of the tethered underclass represents life as a zero-sum game where every moment

514
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,540
of your happiness is bought with someone else's suffering.

515
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:36,420
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy, an internalization of the black magic logic of people who blame

516
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,740
their own misfortunes on the people they envy.

517
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,900
As Schuch puts it,

518
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,900
My neighbor's harvest can only have turned out better than mine because he has somehow

519
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,060
succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.

520
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,660
So the fear of envy and the guilt of success are repressed in American culture, but they

521
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,860
still find expression in movies.

522
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,740
Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.

523
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,260
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol, a story about the guilt of the rich if ever

524
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
there was one.

525
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,740
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts who show him how wretched and sad the lives of

526
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,140
his employees are, and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone, and his funeral is

527
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,460
only attended by businessmen on the condition that lunch is provided.

528
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,100
Dickens was truly the master of scaring the rich straight.

529
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,740
So maybe fear of envy can serve a softly regulatory function by motivating charity and generosity

530
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,940
in the rich.

531
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,500
But in general, I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.

532
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,220
Because remember, the basic logic of envy is, if I can't have it, then no one can.

533
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,460
Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.

534
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,700
It's taking privileges away, not for the material benefit of the underprivileged, but

535
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,180
merely for the psychological satisfaction of the envious person.

536
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,980
And that's even worse when you consider that envy is subjective.

537
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,940
It doesn't necessarily target objective power and privilege.

538
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,020
So envy and politics is not by any means relegated to the left.

539
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,180
Conservative politics is rimming with envy.

540
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,900
Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt, you often hear people say, I had

541
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,300
to pay my student loans, so they should too.

542
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,140
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

543
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,420
The logic here is, since I didn't get my student debt forgiven, no one should.

544
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,660
It's intergenerational envy, which is a pretty common thing, usually older generations envying

545
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
the young.

546
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Kids these days have it so easy.

547
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:42,780
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast and sent text messages on the Pony Express.

548
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,580
The feeling is basically, it's not fear that kids these days don't have to suffer

549
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,260
like I suffered.

550
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,180
Or think about the concept of a welfare queen, which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

551
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:01,580
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration, it's all this envious suspicion about illegal

552
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,340
immigrants sneaking in and getting government handouts without having to pay taxes.

553
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,620
I had to work hard for my money, so why should these people get a free ride?

554
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,860
Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant is actually like, except in the imagination

555
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,740
of people who envy them.

556
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people, so it's especially sharp when it targets

557
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,860
people who are supposed to be beneath you.

558
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,220
The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin made what I think is a pretty compelling argument

559
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,500
that both antisemitism and misogyny are partly rooted in envy.

560
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:44,020
She quotes a bigoted argument made by the wife-killing protagonist of Tolstoy's story

561
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,300
the Kreutzer sonata, who resents that women and Jews find a kind of paradoxical power

562
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,860
in their own oppression.

563
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,540
Just like the Jews, as they pay us back for their oppression by financial domination,

564
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
so it is with women.

565
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,140
Ah, you want us to be traders only?

566
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
Alright.

567
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,780
As traders we will dominate you, say the Jews.

568
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,620
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

569
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Alright.

570
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,260
As objects of sensuality we will enslave you.

571
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
Dworkin explains,

572
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:18,100
This dominance of men by women is experienced by the men as real, emotionally real, sexually

573
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,380
real, psychologically real.

574
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,900
It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.

575
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,540
The woman appears to control sex.

576
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,940
The man needs it.

577
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,260
This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.

578
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,220
Women control access to what men want, which gives women a kind of indirect power, thus

579
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,300
some men envy.

580
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,220
They envy the sexual power of women.

581
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,820
It doesn't matter to the misogynists that, especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,

582
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,500
women objectively have less power in society than men.

583
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,900
He envies women because they have what he desires.

584
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:02,140
Likewise it didn't matter to Weimar antisemites that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

585
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,060
Antisemitism is often rooted in an envious obsession with the disproportionate influence

586
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,100
and affluence of Jewish people.

587
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,660
It is not the absolute differences between men which feed envy, but subjective perception,

588
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:22,860
the optics of envy.

589
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:29,980
Magic mirror on the wall, who's the cuntest of them all?

590
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:38,220
Thou art cunt, my queen, but hold a lovely maid I see.

591
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,460
Oh yes, it's me.

592
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
What?

593
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,100
In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning of this whole transition, you know, like a

594
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,180
young little girl going through all these things, having a sleepover with the girls.

595
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
What do we do on a sleepover?

596
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,380
Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?

597
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,820
Alas, she is more cunter than thee.

598
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:10,740
My pussy-stunting on the gram has come to nothing.

599
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,060
The classic 1937 Disney movie Snow White and the Wicked Milf is the story of a quote, vain

600
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,540
and wicked queen who obsessively envies the beauty of her own stepdaughter.

601
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,500
Are you sure this was for children?

602
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,940
Every day the Milf queen asks the mirror who is the fairest one of all and the mirror responds

603
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,460
that the queen is the fairest till one day it says the stepdaughter Snow White is the

604
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,380
fairest, which sends the queen into an envious fury resulting in a series of bizarre murder

605
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
attempts.

606
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,660
So first of all, can we talk plot holes dang?

607
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,940
Are we really supposed to believe that this is more beautiful than this?

608
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,740
Uh, dang.

609
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,940
Is the Snow White like 12 years old?

610
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
What's going on, Walt?

611
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,140
Why don't you take a seat?

612
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,100
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

613
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,740
It's hard to tell because she's constantly surrounded by manlets.

614
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,060
But she's just so boring and the queen is such a baddie.

615
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,100
Step on my throat, mother.

616
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
This is a horny video.

617
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,220
Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.

618
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,860
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

619
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,340
So despite the injustice done to its lead Milf, Snow White does illustrate some interesting

620
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,620
things about envy.

621
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,820
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft as an expression of envy.

622
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,420
We have the age difference, intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.

623
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,220
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

624
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,140
to rage against Gen Z.

625
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,460
Pretty counterproductive since if you're worried about seeming old, complaining about

626
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,620
the youths, it's probably not helping your case gorge.

627
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,020
You might wonder if there's also jealousy involved with the evil queen.

628
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,740
Like is she worried that the king is going to fall in love with his own daughter?

629
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,860
Well, I don't think so.

630
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,260
Because we never even see the king.

631
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,420
The queen doesn't mention him, it's not about the king.

632
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,900
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

633
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,140
It's just one woman envying another woman over beauty for its own sake.

634
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,260
We stan a Bechdel test passing a movie about women hating each other.

635
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,020
Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gaskeep, light boss.

636
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,540
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version, the queen first tries killing Snow White

637
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,500
with beauty accessories, poisoning a comb, and lacing her to death with a corset.

638
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,260
I wish I could die that way.

639
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Shhh.

640
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,260
What's really striking is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.

641
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,220
This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look, is willing to transform herself with

642
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:39,220
witchcraft into an ugly old hag, just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.

643
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,620
And the queen disguising herself as an old hag parallels Satan disguising himself as

644
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,620
a serpent.

645
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,820
I mean, you could actually argue that the queen is simply a persona of Satan, its paradise

646
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,980
lost all over again, which also happens to be the title of my memoir.

647
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,260
The queen is incredibly petty, because even according to the, again, wrong and tasteless

648
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,460
mirror, she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.

649
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,860
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy still be consumed by envy?

650
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,740
Well, basically, because that's how envy works.

651
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,580
It's petty, it's subjective, and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,

652
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,780
or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.

653
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,460
So you can be the second best in the world, and still be obsessively envious of the one

654
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,300
person who may barely even be above you.

655
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,980
In fact, there's studies showing that Olympic silver medalists are actually less satisfied

656
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,500
with their prize than bronze medalists, probably because the bronze medalist is just happy

657
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,980
to be on the podium at all, while the silver medalist is so close to first, they can't

658
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,140
help but wonder what if.

659
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,860
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth not by comparing ourselves to any absolute

660
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,940
standard, but by comparing ourselves to each other, and we're more likely to compare

661
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,360
ourselves to the people who are around us than we are to people who are far away.

662
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,500
We could call this the proximity effect of envy.

663
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,500
We're more likely to envy people who are close to us, or similar to us, especially

664
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,260
people we're in competition with.

665
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,660
That's why social media is such a nightmare.

666
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,420
It's an incubator of envy, because it puts everyone next to everyone else.

667
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,180
So we're all being compared, all in competition, and it can destroy your self-esteem, because

668
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:28,660
you're comparing your actual life to these idealized images, and it also turns public

669
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,740
figures into lightning rods for envy, because of the numeric visibility of popularity and

670
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
success.

671
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,980
It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect that envy within an oppressed class

672
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,060
is often more venomous and obsessive than envy for the oppressor.

673
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:52,340
So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan, you have women envying other women, because

674
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,020
women are often in competition with each other.

675
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,340
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

676
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:03,500
In media, there's constant portrayals of vain and envious women, jealous bitches, fighting

677
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,780
over men, over youth, over beauty.

678
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,260
It's like drag queen femininity.

679
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,180
Death becomes her femininity.

680
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,860
En garde, bitch.

681
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:21,140
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope, but how do I put this delicately?

682
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,620
Sometimes reality is misogynistic, like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.

683
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,500
The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.

684
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,980
In her 1976 essay, Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood, feminist Jo Freeman wrote

685
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,180
about her ostracism from within the women's movement.

686
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,540
I've been watching for years with increasing dismay as the movement consciously destroys

687
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,540
anyone within it who stands out in any way.

688
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,860
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.

689
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,340
And who do they attack?

690
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,380
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind would seem to be the worst crime.

691
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,500
Do anything that every other woman secretly or otherwise feels she could do just as well,

692
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,660
and you're in for it.

693
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,640
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist, a ruthless mercenary out to make

694
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,220
her fame and fortune over the dead bodies of selfless sisters who have buried their

695
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:16,180
abilities and sacrificed their ambitions for the greater glory of feminism.

696
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,420
Freeman speculates.

697
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,660
The primary reason there have been so few great women blank is not merely that greatness

698
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:29,460
has been undeveloped or unrecognized, but that women exhibiting potential for achievement

699
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,300
are punished by both women and men.

700
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,660
The fear of success is quite rational when one knows that the consequence of achievement

701
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,100
is hostility and not praise.

702
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,940
So at no point in this essay does Jo Freeman use the word envy.

703
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,620
But as usual, envy is right below the surface, causing all the trouble.

704
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,020
So Freeman is describing how people from marginalized groups whose ambition raises

705
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:01,640
them above the typical limits set by marginalization are often ostracized from their own communities.

706
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,820
But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.

707
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,100
I have an explanation.

708
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,460
The explanation is envy.

709
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,660
And women are more likely to envy other women.

710
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,380
Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.

711
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

712
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,740
If we did this topic justice, this video would be 9 centuries long.

713
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,020
On guard!

714
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,940
Bitch!

715
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,580
A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women.

716
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,020
And there is some truth to that.

717
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,180
There definitely was a time in my life when I used to envy cis women for being cis women.

718
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,700
But now I kind of just don't even allow myself to have the thought, what if I were a cis

719
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,700
woman?

720
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,940
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible, it's unobtainable, I actually

721
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,100
envy cis women less.

722
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,420
So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women because of the proximity effect

723
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,340
and because another trans woman represents an actual possibility of what I, a trans woman,

724
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
could become.

725
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,700
She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.

726
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,380
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

727
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,220
Am I the only one who finds it hard to watch trans creators?

728
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,180
Before I realized I was a trans woman, I fucking loved people like ContraPoints, Nick Spears,

729
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,500
and other trans creators.

730
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,740
But ever since I realized I was trans, I just get this angry, resentful feeling in the pit

731
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,180
of my stomach whenever I get recommended any of these videos.

732
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,660
I seriously loved ContraPoints, but whenever I try to watch any of her videos, I just want

733
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,660
to scream.

734
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,580
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

735
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,300
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

736
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,860
Am I just a toxic person?

737
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,380
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.

738
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,620
At least not any worse than anyone else.

739
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,460
It's just that human nature is a toxic person.

740
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,580
And that angry, resentful feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you want to scream

741
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:53,540
and feel such a hatred has a name, and the name is Envy.

742
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,220
I actually admire the person who wrote this post, because they're doing the best that

743
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,900
any of us can do, really, which is noticing the feeling without endorsing the feeling.

744
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,820
I wish that more people could feel things without rushing to a rational defense of the

745
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,820
feeling.

746
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:14,020
The rationality itself, often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.

747
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,540
Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.

748
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:22,420
For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual who complains that, when I transitioned,

749
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,940
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping, but kids these days just waltz on in and walk

750
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,220
out with hormones.

751
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,460
It's intergenerational envy.

752
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
Trans edition.

753
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,860
It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone, like the student debt-dippy.

754
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,020
If I can't have it, no one can.

755
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,420
And look, I do have sympathy and admiration for older trans people.

756
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,940
Like, being trans in 2021 is already the maximum level of adversity that I can handle.

757
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,420
I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.

758
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,180
However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.

759
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:02,860
Envy is not sacred rage, and the malignant demands of envious people should be ignored.

760
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,460
God, this community.

761
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,420
The constant competition, the envy, the cringing, it makes it really hard to get along with

762
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,420
other trans people.

763
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,420
Oh, speaking of which.

764
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,420
Gay tangents, everybody.

765
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,420
Gay tangents.

766
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,780
Envy presents kind of a unique problem to same-sex attracted people, because of the

767
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,100
increased risk of envying the very people you're attracted to.

768
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,100
I want to **** the ones I envy.

769
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
I envy.

770
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,180
You know, it's the classic, do I want you, or do I want to be you problem?

771
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,980
I've heard feminine queer women say they could never date another femme, because they're

772
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,660
worried they would just end up envying her.

773
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:45,380
So dating masculine women solves that problem, because having separate roles, separate aesthetics,

774
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,580
separate categories, helps to avert proximity envy between partners.

775
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,620
Unfortunately, I am not that smart.

776
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,980
Basically, I am attracted to femininity.

777
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,580
But I also want to embody a kind of feminine archetype myself.

778
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,740
I'm not masculine, and I don't want to be.

779
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,180
You know, I used to think I'd only want to date another trans woman, because of the

780
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,180
mutual understanding.

781
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,540
But I've kind of realized that at this point, it may actually be more psychologically healthy

782
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,620
for me to open up to dating cis women.

783
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,060
I used to not want to do that, because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.

784
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,660
But at this point, honestly, just be a man.

785
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,660
Whatever.

786
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,660
It's fine.

787
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,220
As a drag queen once said, I'm more of a man than you'll ever be, and more of a woman

788
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,220
than you'll ever have.

789
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,220
Yes, glide.

790
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,820
Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?

791
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,420
I think at a distance, it's okay to indulge the attraction-emulation ambiguity.

792
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,180
But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone, you have to make up your mind.

793
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,940
That you desire this woman, and you do not want to be her.

794
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,020
Because think about it from the other perspective.

795
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:53,020
What could be less attractive than someone who literally wants to be you?

796
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,260
Teacher, make her stop copying me.

797
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:02,340
Because much as I joke every episode about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,

798
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,020
you don't want to date that bitch.

799
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,260
Imagine trying to date Eve from all about Eve.

800
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,260
Pass.

801
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,260
Hard pass.

802
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,460
So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything, honestly, and you find yourself envying your

803
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,700
partner, my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.

804
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,420
An enviable woman wanted to be with you.

805
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,900
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.

806
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,900
I get it though.

807
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,900
It's complicated.

808
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,180
You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm what we truly desire, but how do you know

809
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,900
what you truly desire?

810
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
Do I want mommy?

811
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,900
Or do I want to be the mommy?

812
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
Yes.

813
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Just yes.

814
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,740
Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

815
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,900
The mother half took over completely.

816
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:54,460
Do I look okay?

817
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,700
Is my head on straight?

818
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,380
So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.

819
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,860
And people especially cannot seem to notice when they themselves are feeling envious.

820
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,300
Like that person who puzzled over the angry, resentful feeling in the pit of their stomach

821
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,540
without being able to name what they were feeling.

822
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,460
There's two reasons why people are usually in denial about their own envy.

823
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,220
One is guilt, and the other is shame.

824
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,220
Shame?

825
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:27,020
Shame, because admitting to yourself that you envy someone implies that you feel inferior

826
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,940
to them, which is shameful.

827
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,700
It wounds the ego.

828
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,700
And guilt, because envy is malicious.

829
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,180
If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable about their success and good fortune,

830
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,940
and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.

831
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,300
That's cruel and antisocial.

832
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,900
It goes against most ideas of morality, and it's a thought that's usually not socially

833
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,740
acceptable to admit.

834
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:57,420
So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable, and we deal with that by suppressing

835
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,980
it from our awareness.

836
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,100
But it is still there, and in order to maintain the denial, we have to convince ourselves

837
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,940
that this angry, resentful feeling in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.

838
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,580
Think about how in SpongeBob, Squidward shows contempt for SpongeBob's childishness, for

839
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:22,500
blowing bubbles, for having fun at work, when in fact, Squidward envies SpongeBob's uninhibited

840
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,180
joy and intuitive creativity.

841
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,580
But he can't allow himself to have the thought that he envies SpongeBob, because that would

842
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:36,260
mean recognizing the intolerably shameful truth that he feels inferior to SpongeBob.

843
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:42,100
So what he does instead is convince himself that what he really is, is a refined, sophisticated,

844
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:49,940
scoffing at this childish fool.

845
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,100
We could call this envy to contempt sublimation.

846
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,580
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term, which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling

847
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,540
or socially unacceptable longing into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

848
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:11,500
So the classic example used by Freud is the transformation of sexual urges, of erotic

849
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,140
energy into creative expression.

850
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,180
It's like the founder of the No Fap movement, Lady Gaga, once said,

851
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,260
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone, they're going to take my creativity

852
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,180
from me through my f***.

853
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,860
So according to Freud, the vast majority of erotic longings can never be fulfilled.

854
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Tell me about a segment, Ugh, Misery, but there's a positive side to this, supposedly,

855
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,740
which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings into a more socially acceptable productivity.

856
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,260
So you know, instead of slicking the bean, maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires

857
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,060
or for that matter, philosophical treatises about the will to power, but we'll get to

858
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,060
you.

859
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,220
Freud thought that civilization itself is built at the cost of our instincts, most of

860
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,860
which we have to sacrifice in order to live in a society.

861
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:05,860
So like erotic impulses, I think envy can be sublimated, which is what's happening

862
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,940
when it becomes contempt.

863
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,820
Another example is the blog McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the tasteless architecture

864
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,340
of suburban ostentatious trash.

865
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:21,000
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog is the pleasure and relief of looking

866
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,060
down at the rich, because looking enviously up at the rich is painful.

867
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:32,620
It makes you feel inferior, and a way to alleviate that pain is to sublimate envy

868
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:39,700
and pretend that you're an aristocratic aesthete scoffing at the vulgar taste of the araviste.

869
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,860
These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.

870
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,940
Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.

871
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,580
I once heard a trans woman say, at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.

872
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:56,020
The subtext is, there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer who lives in LA and

873
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,960
has a lot of cosmetic surgery to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

874
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,740
But it costs a lot of money to look like this, and a lot of trans women can't afford surgeries

875
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,740
that they want.

876
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,700
And one way to cope with frustrated desire is to convince yourself that the thing that's

877
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,020
out of reach is not worth having anyway.

878
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,580
See also the discourse on Twitter about how passing is transphobic.

879
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,860
There's an ancient Greek fable where a fox wants some grapes, but he can't reach the

880
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,920
vine, so he walks away bitterly and says, well the grapes are transphobic anyway.

881
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,660
The cisgender version of this is maybe the not like other girls meme, which is classic

882
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,580
envy to contempt sublimation.

883
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,780
The trope is usually that other girls are popular and slutty.

884
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,100
They have fake tans and fake nails.

885
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,860
They like partying and makeup and stupid music for idiots.

886
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,900
But I'm quirky and real.

887
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:52,300
I listen to Pink Floyd and read books and eat lots of pizza late at night, alone and

888
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,300
sad.

889
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,020
There's usually a subtext of anxiety about inferiority.

890
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,300
The other girls being more socially accepted, feminine, and put together.

891
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,700
A lot of times the other girls don't even exist, right?

892
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,580
They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.

893
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,020
Like where are these other girls who've never eaten pizza and enjoy wearing makeup

894
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,020
at 9am on a Saturday morning?

895
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,860
Are they between the sofa cushions?

896
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,620
Did you put them in with the other laundry or the other girls in the room with us right

897
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,620
now?

898
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:25,620
So the feeling of inferiority toward the other girls is reframed as a kind of contemptuous

899
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,820
hipster superiority, which is really just an ego-defensive persona of resentment.

900
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,540
Like Janice in Mean Girls.

901
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,900
She's not even really a lesbian.

902
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
She's Lebanese.

903
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,140
Lebanese.

904
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
Regina got confused.

905
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,820
And then she dances with a boy at the end and is readmitted into girlhood.

906
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,140
Thank you for that, Tina Fey, that's very helpful.

907
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,140
Great.

908
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,740
Another way we can reframe feelings of envious inferiority is by transforming them into moral

909
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,420
superiority.

910
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:58,380
Moral superiority often being the refuge of people with nothing better to feel superior

911
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,380
about.

912
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,700
We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy if we convince ourselves that what we're

913
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,700
actually experiencing is justified, legitimate hatred.

914
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,700
So for example, think of the morality around sexuality.

915
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,700
Part 69.

916
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,700
Sluts.

917
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,460
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

918
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,460
Cancel me?

919
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,460
En garde!

920
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,460
Bitch.

921
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,940
Why does everyone hate sluts so much?

922
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,020
Sluts never do nothing wrong to nobody.

923
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,140
Open sexual promiscuity is in a way analogous to opulence.

924
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:34,800
You're conspicuously enjoying something that other people want but may not be able to get.

925
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,420
Many cultures have norms about modesty, for example, expecting women to cover their hair

926
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,540
in public.

927
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,060
This is usually explained as prophylaxis against male lust.

928
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,820
But I wonder if it also serves to prevent a more generalized envy, which female beauty

929
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,980
has a way of attracting.

930
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,140
Men often slut-shame because they want to control female sexuality.

931
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,660
And by female sexuality, I do mean male sexuality because often what they're really struggling

932
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,100
to control is their own desire.

933
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:09,100
But slut-shaming is also done pretty viciously by women to each other.

934
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,420
And that's a complicated thing, it's more than just envy.

935
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:16,780
Sometimes it comes from a sense that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men

936
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:22,180
is compromising the collective sex-withholding power of the group, almost like she's crossing

937
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,180
a picket line.

938
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:29,140
But there's also sometimes a resentment that a woman who's showing skin is using her body

939
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,740
to get unearned attention.

940
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,660
And that smells like envy to me.

941
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,220
I don't use my body to get attention, so no one should.

942
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,820
The repressed feeling is, maybe I'm a little jealous that she's getting all this attention

943
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,180
by posting thirst traps, but you don't think that.

944
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:55,180
You think, I am above this, because I am a chaste, I have class, I am a feminist.

945
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,940
I would also suggest accusing her of pandering to the male gaze, thus of course the feminist

946
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,740
way of calling someone a low-down, a hoe-bag skank.

947
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:10,460
So again we have envy to contempt sublimation, and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.

948
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:17,660
The psychological need to convince ourselves that envy is morality can become so strong

949
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,500
that we actually start inventing things to be outraged about.

950
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,100
Take for instance the tendency to imagine that the wealthy and powerful are enjoying

951
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:32,660
wild satanic orgies and indulging all the forbidden, salacious pleasures that we ourselves

952
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,740
are denied.

953
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:39,980
Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton reclining

954
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:45,140
in a garden of earthly delights, sampling the pleasures of ephebes.

955
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,980
Live, laugh, love that fur.

956
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,940
Envy is very imaginative when it comes to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

957
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,060
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.

958
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,180
If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette, it's probably that when she heard about

959
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,140
a famine where the people had no bread, she infamously responded,

960
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,260
Let them eat cake.

961
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,640
What an evil bitch.

962
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,500
How could she say that?

963
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,460
Well, she didn't.

964
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,740
She never said it, it's a lie.

965
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:24,020
The phrase let them eat cake, originally let them eat brioche, first appeared in Rousseau's

966
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:29,580
Confessions, written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.

967
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:33,660
Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.

968
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,580
Probably no one ever said this.

969
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:40,260
It's kind of like how the most famous photo of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing

970
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,900
a stop being poor t-shirt.

971
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,500
What an evil bitch.

972
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,140
How could she wear that?

973
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,940
Well, she didn't.

974
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,500
It's photoshopped.

975
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,820
The actual shirt said stop being desperate.

976
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,180
Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes of its enemies.

977
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,140
I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

978
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:04,380
I mean, what does a Disney villain, if not an opulent homosexual, seem through the eyes

979
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,380
of the Envyists?

980
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,380
She all like Google.

981
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,140
I'm going to try lowering the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here now.

982
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,340
Okay, well that's a much lower ISO.

983
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,340
What if I get another white over here?

984
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,920
That's what this channel is really about.

985
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,140
One biological female's quest to create a harmonious color story.

986
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,140
In the years leading up to and during the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette was constantly

987
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,660
defamed in these sleazy tabloids called Libelle.

988
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,820
It's the same route as the English word libel.

989
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:37,240
The often pornographic Libelle depicted the queen as a bisexual demon who was constantly

990
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,240
having drunken orgies and sexually manipulating everyone around her.

991
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:45,580
All of which is very interesting, but none of which is true.

992
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:51,220
The historian Robert Darnton called it an avalanche of defamation that has no parallel

993
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,480
in the history of vilification.

994
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,060
This woman took the blame, the moral blame, for the structural failings of a broken economic

995
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:06,000
system and by the time she was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793, the actual

996
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,360
person Marie Antoinette had long ago been overshadowed by the libelous caricature of

997
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,360
her.

998
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,380
That was maybe one good reason for executing the former queen, which is that the legitimacy

999
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:23,300
of your new republic is a little more secure when you don't have living monarchs hanging

1000
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,300
around.

1001
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,780
Someone better tell the English.

1002
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,980
But the problem with that reasoning is it has nothing to do with whether or not the

1003
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,500
queen deserved to die.

1004
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:37,100
And beheading a recently widowed mother of two in front of a jeering crowd for political

1005
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,380
expediency might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.

1006
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,320
So the revolution had to convince themselves that the queen deserved it, which was pretty

1007
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,080
easy after decades of, again, false and defamatory gossip.

1008
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:57,160
In her biography of Marie Antoinette, Antonia Fraser describes how the prison guards separated

1009
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,760
Marie from her 8-year-old son, who they plied with alcohol and groomed into accusing his

1010
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,760
own mother of incestuous abuse.

1011
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:11,900
To justify killing Marie Antoinette, they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a

1012
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
mother.

1013
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:18,260
So she was convicted of what may as well have been crimes against ethics in games journalism

1014
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,820
and sent to the guillotine where her last words were sorry to the executioner for stepping

1015
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:24,820
on his foot.

1016
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:29,060
Uh, women stop apologizing challenge.

1017
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,300
This is what a girl boss winning looks like.

1018
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,280
So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.

1019
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,320
Hey, how are you?

1020
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,040
An innocent MILF was killed that day, and I, for one, won't stand for it.

1021
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:50,800
So look, we have a psychological incentive to believe that people whom we envy are immoral

1022
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,680
monsters, because then we get to label our hatred and violence toward them justice.

1023
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:02,720
Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty, and part of the reason for that

1024
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,280
is that calling cruelty what it is takes the fun out of it.

1025
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,380
It reminds me of the second best day in the history of Twitter, October 1st, 2020, the

1026
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,680
day that Trump got COVID.

1027
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,720
And I'm going to be honest, I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.

1028
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:26,520
Well, well, well, if it isn't the leopards eating people's faces party having their

1029
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:37,280
faces eaten by leopards, last time I ate cake.

1030
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,960
Like Dan Savage said, it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

1031
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,720
The next day I tweeted, these last 24 hours have been the first time I've genuinely

1032
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,480
enjoyed Twitter in years, because his website is good for one thing only, reveling in the

1033
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,560
cruelest of human impulses.

1034
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,800
And someone responded to that saying, oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?

1035
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,600
But why was I being a killjoy?

1036
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,320
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

1037
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:07,320
Well, for most people, I guess not me, but for normal people, for other girls, cruelty

1038
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,600
is only pleasurable as long as they can convince themselves it's something other than cruelty,

1039
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,000
justice served.

1040
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,100
So again, reason, rationality are often the attempt to publicly communicate, to evangelize

1041
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:28,860
our private feelings, and morality, ethics, and justice are often put forward as the respectable

1042
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:34,660
public face of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.

1043
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,500
But is this a corruption of morality, or have we stumbled onto something darker?

1044
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:47,500
What if morality itself is simply the expression of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?

1045
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,780
It's too early for this.

1046
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,500
I mean, it's literally 7am, where I'm filming.

1047
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,180
I don't know how this keeps happening to me.

1048
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:58,500
My head gets cut off one afternoon, puts me in a philosophical mood.

1049
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,500
Next morning, I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about the Fila soves.

1050
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,900
Meow meow.

1051
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,420
Hello again, kittens.

1052
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,420
Let's talk about justice, ooh-woo.

1053
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,660
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

1054
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,660
So meow.

1055
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,660
So meow-you-are.

1056
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,900
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know, I wasn't being meow-tally.

1057
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Look.

1058
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,500
I have been seeing a lot of comments lately along the lines of Natalie used to do serious

1059
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,260
academic arguments.

1060
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,140
Now she only cares about makeup.

1061
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,380
Alright, you little shits.

1062
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,380
You want book learning?

1063
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,100
I'm gonna learn you so hard.

1064
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:37,100
I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.

1065
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1066
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,100
Friedrich.

1067
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,100
Wilhelm Nietzsche.

1068
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,220
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

1069
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:49,340
Friedrich was a German philosopher who had a lot to say about envy and morality.

1070
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,500
But before we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his life because it's

1071
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,220
just very funny.

1072
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:59,980
Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful

1073
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,580
little Frederick.

1074
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,060
He was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

1075
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:10,740
Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain, nearly blind incel who probably slept

1076
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,180
with a prostitute once and got syphilis and died.

1077
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,220
Life is funny.

1078
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,900
Sad, but funny.

1079
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,140
In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil, the editor says, though he prided himself

1080
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:27,140
on being comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been very successful in establishing

1081
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:30,980
emotionally satisfying relationships with them, which is hardly surprising.

1082
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,580
I love when the introduction to a book is just a brutal roast of the author.

1083
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,580
Who wrote this?

1084
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Rolfe.

1085
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,580
Peter Horstmann.

1086
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
You're killing it, Rolfe.

1087
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,580
You're savage.

1088
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,980
Frederick's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.

1089
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:50,580
What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated, highly neurotic man who had to try hard to

1090
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,580
avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.

1091
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,580
Oh.

1092
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:00,660
He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable, and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping

1093
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,940
pills using the name Dr. Nietzsche.

1094
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:04,940
Dr. Nietzsche.

1095
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,300
Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once behind a Dairy Queen.

1096
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,540
Nietzsche was also a failed musician and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's

1097
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,540
wife.

1098
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,540
Ugh.

1099
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,980
The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.

1100
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:18,980
You beta-cuck.

1101
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,940
Why did I do that?

1102
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,540
Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

1103
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,540
I just want to mom this guy, honestly.

1104
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,540
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

1105
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,020
His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.

1106
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:37,700
You know, I think it's interesting that a person this pathetic can also be a genius

1107
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,140
whose name will never die.

1108
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:43,820
He's someone who had a lot of reason to be envious and self-pitying, but his philosophy

1109
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,900
couldn't be more against that.

1110
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,500
And as a person of pathetic experience myself, that is unironically kind of inspiring to

1111
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,500
me.

1112
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
So let's go in.

1113
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,780
In his book on the genealogy of morality, Frederick wants to explain the origin of the

1114
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,840
concepts of good and evil.

1115
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,500
Under what conditions did man invent the value judgments good and evil?

1116
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,900
And what value do they themselves have?

1117
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,620
Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?

1118
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,420
Hang on, my food's here.

1119
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,420
That's right.

1120
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,420
You're getting a mukbang, sweetie.

1121
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,540
Did you think I was going to sit at this giant table and not be eating something?

1122
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,500
This video has been going on more than an hour, so I assume you guys are drunk by now

1123
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,780
and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.

1124
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,180
You guys can't even see.

1125
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:26,220
Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat all of this while

1126
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,420
summarizing the entire life and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

1127
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,620
Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider this a challenge.

1128
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:36,780
So, Frederick argues that good and bad, not good and evil, that's different, we'll

1129
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:43,540
get to that, but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values of people with power.

1130
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:48,220
So to be good meant to be powerful, strong, beautiful, healthy.

1131
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,700
And to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.

1132
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,060
I'm going to eat one like a cat.

1133
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:59,260
And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.

1134
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:04,260
So in a lot of languages, the word that means morally good or spiritually noble originally

1135
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,140
meant noble in the sense of aristocratic, the property to class.

1136
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:13,700
Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani, that's Sanskrit for noble truths.

1137
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,660
Arya means noble.

1138
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:21,060
And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble, but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the

1139
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,060
rich.

1140
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,900
And originally, it was just the name that a culture in northern India gave themselves,

1141
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,900
the Aryans.

1142
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,660
I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.

1143
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:35,740
This was later misunderstood by Europeans who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.

1144
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:39,300
Oops, god damn it.

1145
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,820
God damn it kids, can we not?

1146
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:46,460
Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut, or the English good, to the name

1147
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,460
of the Goths.

1148
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:52,100
No, not those Goths, the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

1149
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,860
Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.

1150
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,500
I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.

1151
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,620
The German word schlecht, which means bad, is related to schlichcht, which means plain,

1152
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:10,180
simple, originally common, low, not aristocratic, not noble.

1153
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:15,700
So good and bad were originally the values of warrior aristocrats who were like Homeric

1154
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,220
heroes celebrating themselves.

1155
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,020
And Frederick calls their value system master morality.

1156
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:29,740
This glorification of combat, feasting, athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty, these things were

1157
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,220
called good.

1158
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:36,020
And their opposites, weakness, impotence, ugliness, were called bad.

1159
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:40,420
The ancient nobles worshipped noble gods who acted like them and shared their values.

1160
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:44,700
I mean, if I created a personal goddess, I think we all know what animal that would be.

1161
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,180
Me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.

1162
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:51,260
So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars, the god of war.

1163
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,500
And it was like they were worshipping themselves.

1164
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,700
They were dumb jocks, worshipping dumb jock gods.

1165
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,740
Well good for them.

1166
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,980
But what about the people who got shoved into lockers?

1167
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:05,820
Well, Frederick's example, and this is going to create some misunderstandings later, but

1168
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:11,500
his example is the Jews, who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.

1169
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,460
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.

1170
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,780
Oh, they did.

1171
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,780
Multiple times.

1172
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:20,900
But for several centuries, the Romans were just too powerful.

1173
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,140
No one could stop them.

1174
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:27,440
So the question is, what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed and who lack the

1175
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,460
power to overthrow the oppressor?

1176
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:36,340
Well, in that case, frustrated vindictiveness builds over time to become this deep bitterness

1177
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:41,220
which Nietzsche gave the French name, resentment in English.

1178
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:45,780
Oui, et, oui, absolutement, naturalement.

1179
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,860
I don't speak French.

1180
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,340
I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.

1181
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,940
Mont, pas, cartre, et, oui.

1182
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,300
I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.

1183
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,700
Because they're always dressed so well and they speak a sexier language than me.

1184
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,700
Stop it.

1185
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,700
This is your final warning, comprendezvous.

1186
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,700
Good wine, though.

1187
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,700
I'll give them that.

1188
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,860
So there's a German word, neid, which means envy.

1189
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,700
So why is Frederick using this French term, raisontement?

1190
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,060
What's going on, Frederick?

1191
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,060
Why are you speaking French?

1192
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,060
Are you nervous?

1193
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,060
You're trying to impress me?

1194
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:19,020
Nietzsche must have said raisontement because he thought it was something different than

1195
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,020
envy.

1196
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,940
I think the difference is resentment, and I'm just going to use the English word so

1197
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,820
I don't sound like an asshole.

1198
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:30,620
Resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has, but of a permanent frustration

1199
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,580
of the desire for revenge.

1200
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,260
It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.

1201
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,940
Now revenge itself implies weakness, at least a temporary weakness.

1202
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:47,620
We say revenge is best served cold, but actually, revenge is only served cold.

1203
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:52,380
If it's served hot, if someone slaps you and you slap them back immediately, that's

1204
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,220
retaliation, not revenge.

1205
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,220
You brought this on yourself.

1206
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:01,060
Revenge is only a possibility when you can't retaliate immediately.

1207
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,900
So you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming, but if you're too weak, too

1208
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:10,420
impotent to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.

1209
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:14,860
So Nietzsche's argument is that a person who's too weak to get material revenge can

1210
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:20,140
instead get psychological revenge by creating a new morality.

1211
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:25,900
In Frederick's words, the beginning of the slave's revolt in morality occurs when raisontement

1212
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,980
itself turns creative and gives birth to values.

1213
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,940
This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?

1214
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,100
What are you doing, Frederick?

1215
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:39,300
So while master morality says that good is power, riches, health, and strength, and bad

1216
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:45,460
is the opposite, slave morality, the morality of resentment, says, blessed are the poor,

1217
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,340
the meek, the sick, the powerless.

1218
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:54,220
This is the good of slave morality, and its opposite is not the bad, but a new concept,

1219
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,220
the evil.

1220
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,620
And what is evil?

1221
01:14:56,620 --> 01:15:04,340
Well, everything that master morality says is good, power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.

1222
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,580
He's talking about Christianity here.

1223
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,540
He's not talking about Judaism.

1224
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:19,180
But Frederick thinks of Christianity as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the

1225
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,940
Romans, an inversion of the Empire's values.

1226
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,980
But he also thinks that slave morality is fundamentally dishonest.

1227
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,060
It's like the fox and the grapes.

1228
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:34,140
Not being able to take revenge is called not wanting to take revenge.

1229
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,740
It might even be called forgiveness.

1230
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,540
Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.

1231
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,460
Submission to people you hate is called obedience.

1232
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,540
Having to wait is called patience.

1233
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:53,420
Inability to satisfy sexual desire is called chastity, purity, and so on.

1234
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:59,740
And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself as a powerful, noble beast

1235
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:05,780
of prey, slave morality is born of saying no to the master and everything he has that

1236
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,780
you can't.

1237
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,060
I like to have my belly rubbed.

1238
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,060
Scratch my back above my tail, please.

1239
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,540
I'm going to put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm and I'm full.

1240
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,260
This has not been a successful mukbang.

1241
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,100
It turns out that it's actually very difficult to do a mukbang while talking.

1242
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,780
I should have thought this through a little harder.

1243
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,860
So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge.

1244
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:28,220
But that desire for revenge never completely disappears.

1245
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:32,740
It's there, for example, in the Christian idea of the Last Judgment.

1246
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,580
No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.

1247
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,900
God will do that for us.

1248
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:42,220
And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.

1249
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,060
I find this book thrilling to read, honestly.

1250
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,780
And I'm not easily thrilled, especially not by philosophers.

1251
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:53,100
I think this book in particular gets me because, especially if you were raised Christian, this

1252
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,500
is so the opposite of everything you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels

1253
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,740
like dirty.

1254
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,820
Should I be reading this?

1255
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:01,820
Is this allowed?

1256
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:05,860
Because even if you're not religious, most of us still agree with a lot of Christian

1257
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
morality.

1258
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,300
Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.

1259
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,460
Blessed are the meek.

1260
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,460
Sure.

1261
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,420
But then Frederick comes along and he's like, mmm, morality is just a cope for frustrated

1262
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,420
vindictiveness.

1263
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,580
And you're like, I need to lie down.

1264
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,020
Where's my smelling salts?

1265
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,980
But wait, there's more.

1266
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,340
This gets even darker.

1267
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:40,660
Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia of European history, slave morality has triumphed.

1268
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:46,020
St. Paul made Christianity marketable, the Emperor Constantine converted, and by the

1269
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:51,620
Middle Ages, even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down not to powerful warrior gods

1270
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,740
made in their own image, but to a god that was weak.

1271
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:56,740
Suffering.

1272
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,740
Victimized.

1273
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,740
Oppressed.

1274
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,740
Mmm.

1275
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:05,660
So by the 19th century, slave morality had become the only morality.

1276
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,660
And it's not just Christianity, either.

1277
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:12,340
The secular version of these values became socialism, anarchism.

1278
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:17,940
About free thinkers and atheists, Nietzsche has this to say, we loathe the church, not

1279
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:18,940
its poison.

1280
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,220
Apart from the church, we too loathe the poison.

1281
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,260
Okay, the poison.

1282
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,660
What is the poison?

1283
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:31,220
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind, and turns humans against our own

1284
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,900
natural instincts.

1285
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:39,620
Not just against aggression, but against sexuality, against ambition, against power, against life

1286
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,620
itself.

1287
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,940
And there's two possible outcomes of this.

1288
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,380
One is that resentment becomes a political movement.

1289
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,740
The conspiracy of those who suffer.

1290
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,580
The tyranny of the herd.

1291
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,100
The revolution that eats itself.

1292
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,620
Only we are good and just is what they say.

1293
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:00,300
As though health, success, strength, pride, and the feeling of power were in themselves

1294
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:05,780
depravities for which penance, bitter penance, will one day be exacted, among them we find

1295
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:11,140
plenty of vengeance seekers disguised as judges with the word justice continually in their

1296
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,300
mouth like poisonous spittle.

1297
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:17,580
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob, which I'm sure we're all

1298
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,660
familiar with.

1299
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:24,780
The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward and attacks the individual conscience,

1300
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:28,780
introducing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.

1301
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,460
Because slave morality condemns not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing

1302
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:40,180
us, but also the beast of prey within, our own animal instincts, what Christianity calls

1303
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,740
sin.

1304
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,660
So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.

1305
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,020
We hate ourselves.

1306
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,100
We hate our own nature.

1307
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,420
We hate life itself.

1308
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,940
I mean, is he wrong?

1309
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:57,820
You see a girl boss winning, I only see the world to power.

1310
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:04,020
Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats who've become domesticated housepets

1311
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,100
at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.

1312
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,740
That's a very valid Frederick.

1313
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,020
That's super hecking valid.

1314
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:19,100
So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far, but I do have a couple critiques I

1315
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,100
want to say.

1316
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:26,340
One is that Frederick associating slave morality with the Jews is very irresponsible.

1317
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:30,740
Even though he didn't intend to be anti-Semitic, and even though he was outspoken against anti-Semitism

1318
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:35,300
in his own time, when you keep referring to the Christian values you're critiquing as

1319
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,700
Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge, some people might get the wrong idea.

1320
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:46,060
And some people did Frederick, like your dumbass sister Elizabeth Nietzsche, who became a literal

1321
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:50,420
alternative ethno-identitarian god damn it Liz.

1322
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,900
Kind of goth goals though.

1323
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,500
Yes, that kind of goth, you're right this time.

1324
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,100
My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick that genuinely

1325
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,180
caring about other people is an option.

1326
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:05,800
Not because caring about other people is repressing your true selfish nature, which is because

1327
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,100
caring about other people is part of your nature.

1328
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,420
And isn't it?

1329
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:13,060
Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?

1330
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:18,540
I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment accurately describes a very real

1331
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,540
thing.

1332
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,800
But it's not the only thing.

1333
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,460
There is genuine care and love in this world I've been told.

1334
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,460
I've heard rumors.

1335
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,820
And I'm even going to go so far as to say hashtag not all Christians.

1336
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,540
Christ, I'm defending the Christians.

1337
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,460
What is this channel coming to?

1338
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:38,220
There are Christians, maybe not most, but still some, for whom love and forgiveness

1339
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:44,660
are genuine experiences and not just some kind of twisted impotent passive-aggressive

1340
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,660
vengeance.

1341
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:50,800
Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation

1342
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:58,060
of justice and morality is retribution, envy, or some combination of the two.

1343
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,900
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

1344
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:03,660
There's a famous Martin Luther King quote responding to Nietzsche.

1345
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:10,380
What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive and

1346
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:14,580
that love without power is sentimental and anemic.

1347
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,300
Power at its best is love.

1348
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:24,780
Implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is love correcting everything

1349
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,700
that stands against love.

1350
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:35,100
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.

1351
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:39,700
But there still needs to be some kind of emotional or spiritual force that keeps humanity from

1352
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,340
tearing itself apart.

1353
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:46,500
And maybe something like this Christian idea of love for humanity is the missing piece.

1354
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,660
Because without something like that, I just see retribution and envy snowballing into

1355
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,500
human self-destruction.

1356
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,780
And I hate that for us.

1357
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,580
It's not very sliving of us.

1358
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,780
Do you guys know about sliving?

1359
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,060
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?

1360
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,100
She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do, but you know, I try to support smaller

1361
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,100
creators.

1362
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,100
Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life into one word.

1363
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,900
It's the new that's hot.

1364
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,900
Maybe I'll do a video about love when I'm in a better mood.

1365
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,980
So for now, well, let's put it this way.

1366
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:21,300
God is dead and we have killed him, yeah?

1367
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,300
Sliving!

1368
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:41,100
Okay, I'm moisturized.

1369
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,100
I'm primed.

1370
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,180
I've proven my academic credentials.

1371
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,860
Now it's time to do my makeup.

1372
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,420
That's right children, I'm going full Bailey-Sarian.

1373
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,980
I'm going full suspicious.

1374
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,900
So I guess I should say something about the political implications of all this, since

1375
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,620
I guess this channel is about politics.

1376
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:00,860
Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article to remember what I'm doing with my

1377
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,860
life.

1378
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:08,020
So this morality of resentment, of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge judges

1379
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,420
that power is evil.

1380
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,540
I don't use foundation, I just use concealer.

1381
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,580
I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good

1382
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,580
at makeup, okay?

1383
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,300
I have a million subscribers on YouTube.

1384
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,700
I don't need to be good.

1385
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,900
There was a New York Times article about young women's attitudes toward political ambition

1386
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,460
and one of the women who was interviewed said, as a white woman, I know I have unearned

1387
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,460
privilege.

1388
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,260
So am I really the best person to be in leadership?

1389
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,260
Uh, yes.

1390
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,860
Yes, you are.

1391
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:39,580
Because we need leaders like you who are capable of questioning the legitimacy of their own

1392
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,580
authority.

1393
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:44,460
Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck with another blonde beast of prey.

1394
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,980
And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege, especially as a leader, but let's

1395
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:53,660
not be so self-effacing that we have faced ourselves off the face of the earth.

1396
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:57,120
This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.

1397
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,220
If you think power is evil, then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,

1398
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:07,140
which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance, since, like MLK said, you have

1399
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,540
to at least have some power to implement the demands of justice.

1400
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,740
Remember what incels call taking the black pill, this conviction that the reason you

1401
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:19,020
don't have a girlfriend is just that you're genetically undesirable.

1402
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,660
There's nothing you could do to change it, and I guess women are just too shallow to

1403
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:27,980
be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite that festers in your heart.

1404
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,980
For a lot of black pill incels, it seems like there's only one thing left in life that

1405
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:37,940
they enjoy, which is simply the pleasure of complaining, of moaning in pain.

1406
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:43,180
It reminds me of a comment from Dostoyevsky's second most horrible protagonist.

1407
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,260
Even in Toothache, there is enjoyment.

1408
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:49,540
In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence but moan, but they are not candid

1409
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:53,420
moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point.

1410
01:25:53,420 --> 01:26:00,540
The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain, and part of the satisfaction of moaning

1411
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,340
is inflicting your pain on other people.

1412
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:08,300
This kind of malignant moaning, it's kind of the opposite of music, because a lot of

1413
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,740
music, like blues, is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.

1414
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,340
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

1415
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,300
My woman don't love me no more, but I know her sister will.

1416
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,820
You know, optimism.

1417
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:23,660
I think a lot of incel discourse is really just malignant moaning.

1418
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:28,460
Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem, it's just a contagious

1419
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,740
expression of misery.

1420
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:33,660
A moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.

1421
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,740
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

1422
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,740
The redistribution of sex.

1423
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,740
State-mandated GFs.

1424
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,740
That's very valid.

1425
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,300
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.

1426
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,300
That's not the point.

1427
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,660
So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.

1428
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:54,700
It's very easy to point and laugh at them, but what's harder is to look in the mirror

1429
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:59,500
and notice how these exact same tendencies are rampant in our own communities.

1430
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:04,780
So the incel black pill is just one instance of what I call an ideology of resentment.

1431
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,620
A discourse that outwardly appears, like moral or political critique,

1432
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:12,540
but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.

1433
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:16,460
The goal of resentment politics is not to improve conditions.

1434
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:23,180
In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt for any morally compromised sellouts

1435
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,820
who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.

1436
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,340
They don't want victory.

1437
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:28,540
They don't want power.

1438
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:31,340
They want to endlessly critique power.

1439
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:38,460
Because for them, critique is an important psychological defense against feeling impotent.

1440
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,220
Shaylor described it this way.

1441
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:45,260
It is peculiar to Rizantamat criticism that it does not seriously desire that its demands be

1442
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:45,900
fulfilled.

1443
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,500
It does not want to cure the evil.

1444
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,300
The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.

1445
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,820
What am I going to do with my eyes?

1446
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,740
I think a pink kind of look.

1447
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,260
We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

1448
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,180
I just I love that hay fever look.

1449
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,980
As a general rule, the more radical a political community claims to be,

1450
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:05,180
the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.

1451
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:10,380
Self-styled radicals will tell you, superficial surface reforms do not interest us.

1452
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,100
The problem must be critiqued at its root.

1453
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:17,980
And then the root turns out to be this universal, all-encompassing evil, right?

1454
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,420
Society itself.

1455
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,460
The system.

1456
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,500
The machine.

1457
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:27,420
A resentment ideologue always imagines himself to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt

1458
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,860
against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.

1459
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,860
Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.

1460
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,620
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

1461
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:35,980
It's hard to talk while doing this.

1462
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:40,540
And nothing short of total revolution counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.

1463
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,860
We have to dismantle the entire system.

1464
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,940
Burn it all down.

1465
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:49,740
I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent

1466
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,820
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

1467
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,820
Our kingdom is coming, comrades.

1468
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,900
Often the appeal of utopian ideology is similar to religion.

1469
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,340
It's not about health care, higher wages, relief from police violence.

1470
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,740
Those are actual goals that could be demanded, worked for, and achieved.

1471
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:13,340
Utopian ideology instead promises relief from some general malaise.

1472
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,340
Alienation.

1473
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:20,620
And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect that Marx ascribes to religion.

1474
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:25,660
But release from the general anguish of human existence is not a political goal.

1475
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,860
There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries.

1476
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,420
And so far, zero utopias.

1477
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,260
Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,

1478
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,700
are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.

1479
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,500
When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.

1480
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,220
And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.

1481
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:51,260
And because of the proximity effect, envy may actually increase after the revolution.

1482
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:56,860
You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade, a successful citoyon.

1483
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:57,260
Oui.

1484
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:00,380
A coolock than you ever were of the aristocrats.

1485
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:05,660
So envy turns paranoid and imaginative in revolutionary moments.

1486
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:10,780
It gets sublimated into morality, and the accusations start flying.

1487
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,740
That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.

1488
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,740
That peasant is hoarding grain.

1489
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,780
So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,

1490
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,220
the gulags fill up,

1491
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:26,620
or an authoritarian strongman takes over just to announce another revolution two decades later.

1492
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,780
The things people will do to stay relevant.

1493
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,500
Honestly.

1494
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,220
And for what?

1495
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,900
What long-term egalitarian utopia results?

1496
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,060
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

1497
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,380
So look, I do understand that sometimes you just have to do a revolution.

1498
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:47,100
And if I'd been there in 1789, I'm sure I'd be storming the best deal myself.

1499
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,580
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

1500
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:54,060
Revolution is a bloody nightmare that happens because society is collapsing and people are

1501
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:54,700
desperate.

1502
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:59,100
At worst, revolution is nothing more than a violent day of retribution.

1503
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,020
And at best, it lays the groundwork for future incremental progress.

1504
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:07,340
But it will never usher in utopia, nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,

1505
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:12,620
which, I'm sorry to report, is simply the resting state of an uncedated human mind.

1506
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,980
Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,

1507
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:20,220
that all leftist or all egalitarian politics is born of envy.

1508
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:20,540
No.

1509
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,180
This is a specific subtype.

1510
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:27,100
There are plenty of reasons, other than envy or fear of envy,

1511
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,660
to oppose an economic distribution where some people have billions of dollars while

1512
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:34,140
other people are dying because they can't afford insulin.

1513
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:38,860
Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources to promote human well-being.

1514
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:43,420
And personally, I just don't want to live in a country where people are dying because they

1515
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,540
can't afford medicine.

1516
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:48,860
And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes for that not to happen.

1517
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:52,380
So while I'm putting down straw man versions of my argument,

1518
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,300
I'm also not saying, oh, let's just stop being envious.

1519
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,060
No. That's impossible.

1520
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,980
I think envy is like libido.

1521
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,380
It's a basic force of human nature that's more or less unstoppable.

1522
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:09,500
But with the right leadership, I think that envy can potentially be sublimated

1523
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,620
or redirected into something more constructive.

1524
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:17,580
Because raw envy is a very bad basis for egalitarian politics.

1525
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:21,260
It often targets the wrong people, like millionaires instead of billionaires.

1526
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:24,060
And eventually, it turns the revolution against itself.

1527
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,060
And you get the circular firing squad.

1528
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,500
The self-cannibalism.

1529
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:32,220
The problem I see on the left today is that without any genuine political outlet,

1530
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,020
resentment mostly manifests as morality.

1531
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:39,820
Morality itself being a way to vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.

1532
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,540
On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?

1533
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:48,300
We're all about structural analysis, the material conditions, systems of power,

1534
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,620
intersectional identity hierarchies.

1535
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:53,820
But if you look at what people actually spend their time doing here,

1536
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:56,460
it's all this obsessive moral policing.

1537
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:01,020
I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win on any major political stage,

1538
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,620
we feel disempowered.

1539
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:06,780
And so this moral fanaticism is a psychological substitute.

1540
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:11,100
Like with Marie Antoinette, it's easier to blame people than systems.

1541
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,460
Also, structural analysis is very boring,

1542
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,900
and destroying people with gossip is extremely entertaining.

1543
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:24,380
This obsessive moral policing also gets turned inward and becomes leftist guilt.

1544
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,740
You know, this useless internalized scolding.

1545
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,100
I think I'm done with my makeup.

1546
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,980
What do we think?

1547
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:30,860
Leave a comment.

1548
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,940
I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare.

1549
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,820
Since last time I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hiram.

1550
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:40,380
So I am going to spray my face a couple times with this Tatcha skin mist.

1551
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:43,900
If that's okay with Hiram, it feels good to finally address this feud.

1552
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:44,540
Clear the air.

1553
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:47,740
I look a lot better with makeup.

1554
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,580
I don't want to say that I don't have a natural beauty.

1555
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:53,900
It's just that it's very much enhanced by painting a different face on top of my face.

1556
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:58,780
But hey, at least this way, I've kind of earned it, you know, because it's my skill.

1557
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,700
So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist that's been running for years.

1558
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:05,100
And I haven't listened in a while, but in the early episodes,

1559
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,940
they'd bring on these women who would confess their feminist sins.

1560
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,100
You know, hi, my name is Amber.

1561
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:16,140
I'm a feminist, but I enjoy being choked in bed.

1562
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:18,540
It's hard being a woman.

1563
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,900
Not only are you being choked, you also feel guilty about it.

1564
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:25,820
The same moral hand wringing happens with body positivity.

1565
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:29,260
When you make loving your body into a moral imperative,

1566
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:31,340
not only are you still going to hate your body,

1567
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,620
but now you're also going to feel guilty about hating your body

1568
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,380
because it makes you a bad feminist.

1569
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,340
So there was one problem, and now there's two problems.

1570
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,620
Thanks, morality.

1571
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,380
That's very helpful.

1572
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,300
Now, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that a lot of conservatives have made

1573
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,340
some version of the argument I'm making in this video.

1574
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,660
For example, Jordan Peterson and Camille Palia have argued

1575
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:57,020
that academic postmodernists are motivated by resentment.

1576
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:01,820
The argument is that deconstructionist literary theory is a kind of envious

1577
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:06,380
vengeance against the beauty and virtuosity of canonical great art.

1578
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,380
And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.

1579
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:12,380
A lot of academics are field artists, but I was even more Moncave than that.

1580
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,900
I've noticed that working-class non-academic socialists

1581
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,420
do tend to be more productive and more self-advancing,

1582
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,500
involved in unionizing or organizing.

1583
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,380
Whereas, it's usually people who went to college,

1584
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:31,660
presumably because they had middle-class ambitions at some point,

1585
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,060
but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,

1586
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,700
who become the great critiquers of capital.

1587
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,620
I mean, I can tell you from experience that,

1588
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:41,260
when I was eating Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,

1589
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,420
that's when I was most likely to say things like,

1590
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,260
According to Antonio Gramsci,

1591
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,500
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

1592
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,300
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology

1593
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,180
manufactures the consent of the civil term.

1594
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,620
Uh, so point taken.

1595
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:58,140
But some conservatives take this argument way too far

1596
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:02,380
and try to argue that the entire left is nothing but a coalition of resentment.

1597
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:05,180
Like, there's a video on YouTube of the philosophy professor

1598
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:09,500
Stephen Hicks doing a version of the post-modernism is resentment argument.

1599
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,140
And in the comments section, there's a bunch of people saying,

1600
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:17,180
this describes Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the Democrats.

1601
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,060
Does it though?

1602
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,020
I mean, any political movement is gonna have people in it

1603
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,860
who suffer from resentment poisoning.

1604
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,580
But Black Lives Matter, at its core,

1605
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,460
is about the right not to be murdered by police.

1606
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,620
The slogan, Black Lives Matter,

1607
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:33,820
is an affirmation of the value of Black life.

1608
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:36,860
So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.

1609
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:39,740
Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

1610
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,620
was inspired by Nietzsche to create the slogan,

1611
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,060
All Power to the People.

1612
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,780
When we coined the expression, All Power to the People,

1613
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,180
we had in mind emphasizing the word power.

1614
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:52,860
For we recognize that the will to power is the basic drive of man.

1615
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:55,500
But it is incorrect to seek power over people.

1616
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,260
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power of exploitation

1617
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:01,180
and racism for hundreds of years.

1618
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:04,060
And the Black community has its will to power also.

1619
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:07,020
What we seek, however, is not power over people,

1620
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:10,060
but the power of control of our own destiny.

1621
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:13,900
That, to me, is a role model for how to do identity politics

1622
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,580
without centering resentment.

1623
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:19,980
It's instead an affirmation of self-determination and self-respect.

1624
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,780
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.

1625
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:26,140
Whereas if your whole political project is defined in the negative,

1626
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,940
then you're allowing yourself to be defined by your enemies.

1627
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,140
I find feminism is prone to this where even, and in fact,

1628
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:34,620
especially the most radical feminists,

1629
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:37,100
cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness

1630
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:41,260
of being the second sex and defining themselves against men.

1631
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:44,220
Earlier, I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.

1632
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:46,540
She's the most radical of radical feminists.

1633
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,420
And my first impulse is actually to defend her

1634
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,660
because she's very widely hated.

1635
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,780
And most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.

1636
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,460
Like in that Stephen Hicks video,

1637
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:01,340
Hicks summarizes Dworkin as calling all heterosexual males rapists.

1638
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:04,700
Literally in the preface to her most famous book,

1639
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:05,980
Dworkin says,

1640
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:10,140
If one's sexual experience has always, and without exception,

1641
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:13,260
been based on dominance, how could one understand

1642
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:16,780
that this book does not say that all men are rapists

1643
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,860
or that all intercourse is rape?

1644
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:21,260
Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor

1645
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:22,860
and I'm just a makeup vlogger,

1646
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,100
but my gut feeling on this one is,

1647
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,700
before criticizing a book, maybe read the book.

1648
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,580
Just a thought.

1649
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,620
Get it together, prof.

1650
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:33,100
You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.

1651
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,220
I mean, there's no shame in that.

1652
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,420
It happens to me all the time.

1653
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:39,980
That being said, I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct

1654
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,380
that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.

1655
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:46,540
What Dworkin does say in this book is arguably even more bleak

1656
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,300
than what is falsely attributed to her.

1657
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,060
The book is called Intercourse.

1658
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,740
She wrote a book called Intercourse.

1659
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:53,660
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

1660
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:54,940
I can actually easily imagine that.

1661
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,500
Never mind.

1662
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,100
So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.

1663
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,020
Penetration, to be specific.

1664
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:04,860
Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,

1665
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:09,180
invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.

1666
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:12,620
So it's against the Freudian male castration anxiety

1667
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:17,580
interpretation where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.

1668
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,860
Imagine being afraid of that.

1669
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:20,540
Imagine being afraid of that.

1670
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:23,180
I'm going to get a face lift someday

1671
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,300
and I'm going to look like this.

1672
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:27,660
I'm perfect.

1673
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,540
I certainly don't agree with everything she says,

1674
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:33,100
but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?

1675
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,700
Closer than Freud, anyway.

1676
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:38,460
Think about what men typically say to women during the act.

1677
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,100
Do they say, hell, I'm being devoured.

1678
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,860
Never heard that one.

1679
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:43,500
Have you?

1680
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,340
No, usually it's more along the lines of,

1681
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,580
You like that, don't you?

1682
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:48,380
You little...

1683
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,100
Et cetera.

1684
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,780
And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded

1685
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,660
and enjoy it.

1686
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:57,260
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation

1687
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:58,460
because they're taught to.

1688
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:03,900
But enjoying it, she'd have to say, doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.

1689
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,220
So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true

1690
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,980
and some things that are off the fucking rails.

1691
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:10,780
Where she loses me is where she starts getting black-pilled.

1692
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:13,740
And this book, this is the feminist black pill.

1693
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:17,260
It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.

1694
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,060
She says,

1695
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,220
Male dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.

1696
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:26,140
This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.

1697
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:31,420
Okay, so women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.

1698
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,220
We can dream, Andrea.

1699
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,100
We can dream.

1700
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:40,780
Like most ideology resentment, this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms

1701
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:43,420
that might actually improve the situation of women.

1702
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:48,540
Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence filth and objection of it all.

1703
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:52,140
I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian

1704
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:54,940
but in that second wave political way.

1705
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,220
Quoting from the foreword,

1706
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:59,900
To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.

1707
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:04,940
In 30-plus years of knowing her, I've never heard of a single romance with a woman not one.

1708
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:09,580
This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250-page book about sex

1709
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:14,620
that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.

1710
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,820
Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women.

1711
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:20,940
It's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.

1712
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:25,180
You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters, but I don't think that's true.

1713
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:28,780
I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.

1714
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:33,580
The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and Oedipus the King.

1715
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:37,660
It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters because they're stuck with this.

1716
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,460
And love is closer to hatred than neutrality.

1717
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,700
So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?

1718
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,420
What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?

1719
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:48,780
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want because no one ever told them they could.

1720
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,220
Romance.

1721
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:54,140
That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.

1722
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:56,460
Joan Didion of course being not like other girls.

1723
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:59,660
Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.

1724
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:03,020
Despite all efforts to socialize women to one intercourse,

1725
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:05,900
women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

1726
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,860
that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.

1727
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,060
That does sound nice.

1728
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:10,940
I'm so lonely.

1729
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,860
I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women though.

1730
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:18,700
Like there are definitely women out there who they don't make love.

1731
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:19,420
Anastasia.

1732
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,140
They f*** hard.

1733
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,340
I'm really sleepy.

1734
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,540
And this bed right behind me just looks so nice.

1735
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,980
Get in here right now.

1736
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:30,460
Whatever it is go to sleep and then wake up

1737
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:32,860
and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.

1738
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:33,820
I don't want to do it now.

1739
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,780
I'll get Pikachu.

1740
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,980
I don't make this easier.

1741
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,500
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

1742
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,580
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

1743
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:40,060
Why?

1744
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,420
Because he's the yellowest.

1745
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,580
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

1746
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,380
You can't name anything.

1747
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,340
You can't name anything.

1748
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:49,180
So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,

1749
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,380
then just say that.

1750
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:51,740
Is that what you want Pikachu?

1751
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,740
I bet it is.

1752
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:57,180
And Dworkin did get married to a gay man.

1753
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,940
So I guess she found what she wanted.

1754
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,300
Lucky.

1755
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,700
Envying Andrea Dworkin.

1756
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,620
Is that really what we've sunk to around here?

1757
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:10,860
You know I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.

1758
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:14,300
I know this isn't very original but I had a bad year.

1759
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:17,500
You know I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot.

1760
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,300
Got my heart comprehensively broken.

1761
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:27,340
And then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.

1762
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:29,340
You know I stopped saying yes to life.

1763
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,300
And I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.

1764
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,100
By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon.

1765
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:39,580
One of the greatest appropriate for all ages video games of all time.

1766
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,820
Look at him go.

1767
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,940
I'm taking the hair clips out.

1768
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:45,900
I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

1769
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,500
It's because I'm trans.

1770
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,100
It's because I'm gay.

1771
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,620
That's why I'll die alone.

1772
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,140
You know that's the reason I'm alone.

1773
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,300
Definitely not because I don't leave the house.

1774
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:58,780
See I am not immune to incel tear brain poisoning.

1775
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:04,300
And you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.

1776
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,620
Society did this to me.

1777
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,380
A transphobic society made me hate myself.

1778
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,500
Well yeah that's true.

1779
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:18,140
But at a certain point you have to take responsibility for your own mind.

1780
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:21,660
And decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.

1781
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:25,260
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost the mind is its own place.

1782
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,060
And in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.

1783
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,020
Yes squad.

1784
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:32,620
So I asked myself what kind of mind do I want to be?

1785
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,100
Do I want to obsess over what I lack?

1786
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,980
Concede society's judgment of my inferiority?

1787
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:42,380
Become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?

1788
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:46,220
Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor?

1789
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:49,740
Stop chasing the dragon and say yes to life.

1790
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:54,460
The answer of course is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.

1791
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:58,940
But we're not gonna do that because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.

1792
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:01,900
The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

1793
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:08,940
Also nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.

1794
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:11,260
It's beyond a personality flaw.

1795
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:16,620
It's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance of happiness you have.

1796
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:22,620
So in the short time that you're alive you have to discover that which is noble in yourself.

1797
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:23,900
And say yes to it.

1798
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,580
You know don't say no to getting older.

1799
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:27,980
Say yes to being a MILF.

1800
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,700
Yes.

1801
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:29,580
Yes.

1802
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:34,380
What I'm really trying to say here is Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.

1803
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:37,580
Spongebob says yes to life and so should we.

1804
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,100
Yes to ourselves.

1805
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:40,140
Yes to art.

1806
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,660
Yes to sensuality.

1807
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,180
Yes to the world.

1808
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,060
Yes.

1809
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,020
Yes.

1810
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,380
Eh, we.

1811
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:49,020
Is this really how we're ending the video?

1812
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:51,180
I guess.

1813
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,860
Okay, bye!

1814
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:11,100
Oh so what if my fantasies make no sense?

1815
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:13,100
You want to talk about things that don't make sense?

1816
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:14,300
Heterosexuality.

1817
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,300
Let's put that under the microscope.

1818
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:21,820
You want me to believe that a straight woman who knows the difference between magenta and mauve

1819
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:25,740
is going to date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear.

1820
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,500
And that's just going to work out fine.

1821
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:30,060
You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?

1822
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:31,980
I don't think so.

1823
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,180
Not on my watch.

1824
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,420
See I think straight men should date each other.

1825
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:38,620
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then **** each other.

1826
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:40,860
And then straight women can pair off,

1827
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,820
decoupage some shit and eat each other out.

1828
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,860
Isn't that better?

1829
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,980
Isn't that more rational?

1830
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:50,620
I wish I could wiggle these cattiers like I wish I had anatomical control over them.

1831
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:51,020
Hello.

1832
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:52,940
Yes, Dr. Spiegel.

1833
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,460
Yes, it's me again.

1834
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,460
I have a suggestion.

1835
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,260
What do we even have here?

1836
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:08,140
We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.

1837
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:09,580
I've never been as much into rolls.

1838
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,380
I'm a cat, you know.

1839
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,100
I like fish.

1840
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,820
You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.

1841
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,700
It's an affront to my feline nature.

1842
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:15,660
Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the winter, I could die.
