00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
9-1-1, what are you reporting?

00:04.400 --> 00:07.600
Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.600
Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...

00:10.600 --> 00:15.600
I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six feet tall. Big man-ham.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.600
I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man-ham?

00:19.600 --> 00:22.800
Well, she's covered in butter-five, and she has giant wings.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
I'm sorry, what?

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
Oh, and she talks like a fat ****.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800
Memph.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.600
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.600
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

00:37.600 --> 00:44.600
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.400
Hail mortals, I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.

01:06.400 --> 01:13.600
Western culture is being destroyed by cocks and by gender-bending intoxication and sodomy.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.600
You know, things that have never happened in Europe.

01:16.600 --> 01:32.200
There's a lot of people talking lately about the West and Western culture and Western civilization.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.200
But what do those words even mean?

01:34.200 --> 01:39.800
I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.600
Fuck that!

01:40.600 --> 01:44.200
The people demand blood, and I'm thirsty for blood.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.200
And by blood, I mean dick.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.200
And by dick, I mean corndogs.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.800
And by corndogs, I mean sixteen of them over the course of an evening.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
And by evening, I mean morning.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.000
And by morning, I mean between eight o'clock and eight fifteen.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And by corndogs, I mean dick.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.600
Who's up first?

02:00.600 --> 02:04.600
Well, Angry White Guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,

02:04.600 --> 02:09.800
and it's been a while since I've done a video response, so let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.800
McGonk is here, baby doll.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
What?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.800
I don't want to die!

02:21.800 --> 02:24.600
That is a mad.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.600
Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.

02:28.600 --> 02:34.600
The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.800
Both of these clues have to do with coming out.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.800
Wrong!

02:39.800 --> 02:41.800
Her magic power is the conflict of the plot.

02:41.800 --> 02:47.800
And her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential

02:47.800 --> 02:51.800
and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.800
She will destroy her enemies and raise their castles to the ground.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.800
The song Let It Go is basically, fuck this shit, I'm conquering everyone.

02:59.800 --> 03:05.800
So just to be clear, this is a grown man who has addressed himself

03:05.800 --> 03:11.800
as far as a sorcerer to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
It almost feels like punching down at this point.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.800
At least the golden one was mask for mask.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.800
Who can I punch up at?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
I don't like talking about punching.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.800
I would never punch a turf.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.800
My hands are too feminine.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.800
And my fingers are tired.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.800
Someone massage them.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
Who can I claw up at?

03:31.800 --> 03:35.800
The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.800
How about that?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
Dad, stop. Ugh, get out of my life.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.800
In my video about Jordan Peterson, I talked about how he posits a struggle

03:43.800 --> 03:46.800
between the West and postmodern neo-Marxism.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.800
I argued that Pomo No Mo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
none of which are in any sense non-Western.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.800
Unless, of course, you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,

03:59.800 --> 04:03.800
which, surely, no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?

04:03.800 --> 04:07.800
I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.800
In this video, I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West

04:11.800 --> 04:13.800
and the people who claim to defend it.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.800
Wow, Daddy, nice sword.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.800
God damn it, we're going to need to aim even higher.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.800
Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...

04:23.800 --> 04:26.800
The President of the United States of America,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
big dick, special big boy Donald Trump.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
Just as Poland could not be broken,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
I declare today for the world to hear that

04:34.800 --> 04:38.800
the West will never, ever be broken.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.800
Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,

04:43.800 --> 04:46.800
and our civilization will triumph.

04:47.800 --> 04:59.800
So we've got the most powerful fuckboy on the planet

04:59.800 --> 05:02.800
prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization,

05:02.800 --> 05:06.800
so I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.800
Which is too bad, because that's going to require a lot of thinking.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.800
And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
Someone massage it.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.800
And soon, mechanically,

05:18.800 --> 05:22.800
dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,

05:22.800 --> 05:25.800
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea

05:25.800 --> 05:28.800
in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.800
No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.800
then a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,

05:35.800 --> 05:38.800
intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.800
An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,

05:41.800 --> 05:46.800
something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.800
And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,

05:54.800 --> 05:57.800
this new sensation having had on me,

05:57.800 --> 06:01.800
the effect which a love has of post-preambulatory banter.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.800
Whether you're in Fashy YouTube or Pomo, Nomo, Akadomino,

06:05.800 --> 06:09.800
it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.800
clearly defined thing called Western Civilization

06:12.800 --> 06:15.800
that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era

06:15.800 --> 06:17.800
of enlightened philosopher kings.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
On the track!

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
On the track!

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
On the track!

06:20.800 --> 06:23.800
But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively

06:23.800 --> 06:26.800
by modern people for particular purposes.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.800
It's like an origin myth.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
In an article titled,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.800
There is No Such Thing as Western Civilization,

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

06:37.800 --> 06:39.800
there was no such thing as the West.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.800
The world was divided into three continents he called Europe,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.800
Asia, and Libya.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.800
Herodotus had no notion that these three continents

06:47.800 --> 06:49.800
corresponded to different types of people,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.800
and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.800
In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia,

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
in which he traveled,

06:56.800 --> 06:59.800
than with the faraway and foreign people of northern Europe.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.800
So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.800
Really, there is no one idea of the West,

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of

07:07.800 --> 07:10.800
discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.800
According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
under the heading of the West.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800
Let's talk about them now!

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
Concept 1.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values

07:20.800 --> 07:22.800
In the year 732,

07:22.800 --> 07:25.800
a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory

07:25.800 --> 07:27.800
at the Battle of Tor,

07:27.800 --> 07:29.800
against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain

07:29.800 --> 07:31.800
into what is now France,

07:31.800 --> 07:34.800
effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
into Western Europe.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
According to Apiah,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.800
the first recorded use of the Latin term

07:38.800 --> 07:41.800
Europensis, or Europeans,

07:41.800 --> 07:45.800
dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tor,

07:45.800 --> 07:47.800
distinguishing Christians from Muslims.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
In the late Middle Ages,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
the concept of Christendom appeared

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
and was used to distinguish the Christian world

07:52.800 --> 07:55.800
from the Islamic world and from paganism.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.800
This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor

07:58.800 --> 08:01.800
to the modern concept of the West.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
Notice that the term itself

08:02.800 --> 08:05.800
posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,

08:05.800 --> 08:08.800
where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.800
The Christian inheritance is still invoked today

08:11.800 --> 08:12.800
by defenders of the West,

08:12.800 --> 08:15.800
like Lil Benny and Professor Studied the Blade,

08:15.800 --> 08:19.800
often under the heading of Judeo-Christian Values,

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
a term usually used to falsely imply

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
that contemporary moral norms

08:23.800 --> 08:25.800
derive from such a generic parochial

08:25.800 --> 08:28.800
and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,

08:28.800 --> 08:31.800
as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.800
as if the prohibition of graven images

08:33.800 --> 08:36.800
has any contemporary influence whatsoever,

08:36.800 --> 08:39.800
as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws

08:39.800 --> 08:42.800
protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily triggered ego

08:42.800 --> 08:44.800
and non-condemning slavery and rape.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.800
And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
Bible jokes.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.800
The other main use of Judeo-Christian Values

08:50.800 --> 08:53.800
is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
Speaking of which,

08:54.800 --> 08:58.800
what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?

08:58.800 --> 09:01.800
Two kids and a dog just like the Bible says?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
Well, no.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.800
Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
and not forbidden in either testament.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
Even in the beginning,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
and who can blame her,

09:13.800 --> 09:16.800
and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
But it's cool he was into that.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.800
In the Middle Ages,

09:19.800 --> 09:21.800
the Catholic Church gradually enforced

09:21.800 --> 09:23.800
the one man and one woman view of marriage.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.800
Although in formerly pagan lands,

09:25.800 --> 09:27.800
this idea was slow to take hold.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.800
Charles Martel's grandson, Charlemagne,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.800
had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines

09:33.800 --> 09:35.800
because he was a proud son of the North,

09:35.800 --> 09:38.800
100% Natty, and Alpha as fuck.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
I'm sorry, I just can't stop.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.800
The Golden One, his soul and mind are intermingled.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.800
Probably because we both played

09:46.800 --> 09:49.800
1200 hours of Age of Empires in 1999.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
And then something went terribly wrong.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
Fuckin' 9-11.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.800
It used to be such an innocent decision

09:55.800 --> 09:57.800
to play as the Franks or the Saracens

09:57.800 --> 10:00.800
that it became this huge civilizational struggle,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
and that's why this guy is a fascist

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
and I grew up to be a woman.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.800
Thanks a lot, Osama.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.800
Being transgender is so weird.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
You have these childhood memories

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
that are just totally discordant

10:11.800 --> 10:13.800
with your adult gender identity.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.800
How do you even deal with that?

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Well, here's how.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.800
You bond with straight guys

10:17.800 --> 10:19.800
over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
and then you fuck them.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.800
I'm not like other girls.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.800
No.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.800
Concept 2, Enlightenment Values.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.800
So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
named Martin Luther nails his list

10:36.800 --> 10:39.800
of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.800
That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
between Catholics and Protestants.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.800
That eventually chills out,

10:45.800 --> 10:47.800
but then the 18th century rolls around

10:47.800 --> 10:49.800
and shit's just fuckin' crazy.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.800
There are various fops and dandies and macaronis

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
and babbling about enlightenment

10:56.800 --> 10:58.800
like the beatnik trash they are.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
Then, 300 years later,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
a bunch of drinks sought in fedora tippers

11:01.800 --> 11:04.800
appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire

11:04.800 --> 11:06.800
before sinking into sweeping

11:06.800 --> 11:08.800
sexual harassment allegations under the rug

11:08.800 --> 11:11.800
and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos

11:11.800 --> 11:14.800
about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
That's not what they were discussing

11:16.800 --> 11:17.800
at the Parisian Salon.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.800
This is all very embarrassing,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.800
but still, some of these Enlightenment values,

11:22.800 --> 11:25.800
science, liberty, skepticism about dogma,

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
these are basically good ideas

11:27.800 --> 11:30.800
and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.800
But it's important to keep in mind

11:32.800 --> 11:34.800
that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.800
In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.800
So the sum of what we now think of as the West

11:40.800 --> 11:42.800
actually contains major contradictions

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
because the history of the West

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
is a history of change and revolution.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
So when a new movement comes along,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.800
like for instance a bunch of Buzzkill sad sacks pointing out

11:51.800 --> 11:54.800
that actually our society is still pretty terrible

11:54.800 --> 11:57.800
to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.800
it might not be the smartest thing

11:59.800 --> 12:01.800
to just dismiss it as some kind of sinister

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
postmodern new Marxist cuckoldry.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
It could be the next Reformation,

12:05.800 --> 12:08.800
in a history marked by a series of reformations.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
If there are any historians watching this,

12:10.800 --> 12:13.800
please call it the SJW Reformation.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
Think about the Protestant Reformation.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.800
At the time,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.800
that probably seemed like a civilizational threat

12:18.800 --> 12:20.800
to the Holy Roman Empire,

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
and it kind of was.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
But in retrospect,

12:23.800 --> 12:25.800
we see the Reformation as just as important a moment

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
in Western culture

12:27.800 --> 12:29.800
as the medieval period that preceded it.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.800
But today's Counter Reformation,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
made up of people like Orangie Smalls

12:33.800 --> 12:35.800
and Dr. Clean Your Room,

12:35.800 --> 12:37.800
uh, insist on pretending the current Reformation

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
is some kind of alien threat.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
And as for the Counter Counter Reformation,

12:41.800 --> 12:44.800
well, that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.800
Concept three, Western culture.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.800
The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
between the Western Roman Catholic Church

12:52.800 --> 12:54.800
and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
But in its contemporary sense,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.800
the idea of Western culture didn't really exist

12:59.800 --> 13:03.800
until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

13:03.800 --> 13:06.800
when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spangler's

13:06.800 --> 13:09.800
1918 book, The Decline of the West,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.800
an important influence on Nazi ideology.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.800
As long as people have been talking about Western culture,

13:15.800 --> 13:18.800
they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,

13:18.800 --> 13:21.800
as I've discussed in several earlier videos,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
which I encourage you not to watch.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.800
But the idea of Western culture

13:25.800 --> 13:27.800
was influential well beyond the Third Reich.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.800
At the height of European imperialism,

13:29.800 --> 13:32.800
the idea of a superior high culture of the West

13:32.800 --> 13:35.800
was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit

13:35.800 --> 13:37.800
the mysterious Orient.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.800
And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
rhetoric under the rug,

13:41.800 --> 13:44.800
the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
in our schools and universities,

13:46.800 --> 13:48.800
where you have to take courses like

13:48.800 --> 13:51.800
History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
but you didn't actually do any of the readings for

13:53.800 --> 13:56.800
because you were too busy crouching in the bushes

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
outside the dean's office,

13:57.800 --> 13:59.800
vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
The consequence of this Western culture education

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
is that we now all have this sense

14:04.800 --> 14:07.800
that we belong to a continuous civilization

14:07.800 --> 14:09.800
whose crowning achievements are the Ten Commandments,

14:09.800 --> 14:12.800
Jesus fucking Christ, Athenian pederasts,

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
cathedrals, Mozart, human rights,

14:15.800 --> 14:17.800
science, and iPhones.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
But the reality is,

14:18.800 --> 14:20.800
this is an essentialist conglomeration

14:20.800 --> 14:22.800
of a history that's much more non-linear

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
than we often think.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.800
We in the West claim to be the inheritors

14:25.800 --> 14:28.800
of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,

14:28.800 --> 14:31.800
but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
St. Thomas Aquinas,

14:32.800 --> 14:35.800
one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
is largely responsible for introducing

14:37.800 --> 14:39.800
Aristotle to Christian universities,

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
but he never would have encountered Aristotle

14:41.800 --> 14:44.800
in the first place had not ancient Greek philosophy

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
been translated and commentated

14:46.800 --> 14:48.800
by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
So the origins of Western culture

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
aren't really unique to us at all,

14:52.800 --> 14:55.800
and the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.800
On the one hand, you have Judeo-Christian values,

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
and on the other hand, you have degenerates

15:00.800 --> 15:01.800
like William Shakespeare,

15:01.800 --> 15:04.800
who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
and make out with each other,

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
which, for the record, is disgusting,

15:07.800 --> 15:09.800
and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.800
Because if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times,

15:11.800 --> 15:13.800
boys in drag played female parts.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.800
I wish I had female parts.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.800
Working on it.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
Concept four, The Free World.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
From 1941 to 1945,

15:21.800 --> 15:24.800
Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
an agricultural scientist from Iowa,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
whom Democratic Party officials despised

15:28.800 --> 15:31.800
for being what we'd now call a democratic socialist.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.800
Wallace later ran for president in 1948

15:34.800 --> 15:36.800
as a third-party candidate on a platform

15:36.800 --> 15:39.800
of universal health care, anti-segregation,

15:39.800 --> 15:41.800
in opposition to the Cold War.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked

15:43.800 --> 15:45.800
in the press for his spiritualism,

15:45.800 --> 15:48.800
his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,

15:48.800 --> 15:51.800
and what Time Magazine called his assault on the South,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
that is, his, quote,

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
ostentatious ride through cities and towns

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
with his Negro secretary beside him,

15:58.800 --> 16:01.800
for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.800
The poor, naive Wallace commented,

16:03.800 --> 16:05.800
there is something so unlovely about hate

16:05.800 --> 16:08.800
when you see it distorting the human face.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.800
We'll get used to it, buddy.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.800
This is America.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.800
Am I lecturing someone from 1948

16:12.800 --> 16:14.800
about how bigoted this country is?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.800
This is fine.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote

16:19.800 --> 16:21.800
in the 1948 election,

16:21.800 --> 16:24.800
and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
titled, The Century of the Common Man,

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800
in which he contrasted what he called

16:28.800 --> 16:31.800
the slave world of fascists with the free world,

16:31.800 --> 16:33.800
which he described as an incomplete

16:33.800 --> 16:36.800
and ongoing international people's revolution.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
No Nazi counter-revolution will stop him.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.800
The common man will smoke the Hitler Stooges

16:43.800 --> 16:45.800
out into the open in the United States,

16:45.800 --> 16:48.800
in Latin America and in India.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.800
He will destroy their influence.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.800
No Laval's, no Mussolini's

16:54.800 --> 16:57.800
will be tolerated in a free world.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.800
Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it,

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
but it was common during World War II

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
when the phrase the free world

17:03.800 --> 17:05.800
first entered common parlance

17:05.800 --> 17:08.800
to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
including the Dirty Reds.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.800
After the war, the phrase the free world

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
remained common in American politics,

17:15.800 --> 17:17.800
but the meaning shifted.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.800
Instead of referring to the international alliance

17:19.800 --> 17:22.800
against fascism, it referred to the capitalist west

17:22.800 --> 17:25.800
as opposed to the communist east.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
The idea of the free capitalist west

17:27.800 --> 17:29.800
is still an important ingredient

17:29.800 --> 17:32.800
in this jumbled concept we call western civilization.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.800
So when lobster dad says there's a struggle

17:34.800 --> 17:36.800
between Marxism and the west,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.800
it seems at first like he's just stuck

17:38.800 --> 17:40.800
in the 1980s or something.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.800
Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
Dad, what year do you think it is?

17:45.800 --> 17:48.800
Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
They're on your side now, remember?

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
to invoke red scare sentiment

17:55.800 --> 17:58.800
in opposition to the SJW Reformation.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.800
But the point I'm trying to make

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
is that the west is a concept,

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
or rather several contradictory concepts,

18:03.800 --> 18:05.800
that are always posited in particular

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800
political circumstances

18:07.800 --> 18:10.800
as one side of an us versus them opposition.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
Whether it's the Christian west versus the infidels,

18:12.800 --> 18:15.800
the Enlightenment west versus Islam,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.800
the cultured west versus the colonized savages,

18:18.800 --> 18:21.800
the capitalist west versus the communist east,

18:21.800 --> 18:23.800
or the white European west versus

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
the Jewish cultural Marxist plot

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
to cock the sons of the north

18:27.800 --> 18:29.800
by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
and inundating their countries

18:30.800 --> 18:33.800
with a barbarous board of third world migrants.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
I guess I have to say something about that.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.800
Concept five, blood and soil.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.800
If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
Richard Spencer what he thinks the west is,

18:43.800 --> 18:46.800
he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic,

18:46.800 --> 18:49.800
and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people

18:49.800 --> 18:51.800
by their fair-skinned ancestors.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.800
To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent

18:56.800 --> 18:58.800
could be part of the west is ridiculous

18:58.800 --> 19:02.800
because for Spencer to be western is to be white.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.800
Now the thing about that is,

19:03.800 --> 19:06.800
as an analysis of the common usage of the term the west,

19:06.800 --> 19:08.800
it's not even wrong.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.800
Consider Latin America where the main language is spoken

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
are Spanish, Portuguese, and French

19:13.800 --> 19:16.800
where the majority of religion is Roman Catholicism.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.800
Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the west?

19:19.800 --> 19:22.800
Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?

19:22.800 --> 19:26.800
Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
Or to be more accurate,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.800
the flexible and historically variant concepts

19:30.800 --> 19:33.800
of whiteness and the west have been constructed

19:33.800 --> 19:35.800
so as to exclude them.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.800
And I've already spent half my YouTube career

19:37.800 --> 19:39.800
on delirious gay screeching about Nazis

19:39.800 --> 19:41.800
so I don't want to do more of that now.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
But suffice to say,

19:42.800 --> 19:44.800
the association between whiteness and the west

19:44.800 --> 19:46.800
is always lurking beneath the surface

19:47.800 --> 19:49.800
and when whiteness rears its head proudly,

19:49.800 --> 19:53.800
the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.800
As I'm making this video,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.800
the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800
is up and running yet again,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.800
thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe

20:01.800 --> 20:03.800
and a racist demagogue in the United States.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
And once more,

20:04.800 --> 20:07.800
both continents are dotted with barbed wire,

20:07.800 --> 20:08.800
refugee ghettos,

20:08.800 --> 20:12.800
and internment camps full of children torn from parents.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.800
Concept six, the evil west.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
The west, in many ways,

20:18.800 --> 20:20.800
is an inherently supremacist concept.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.800
It's thought to be more civilized,

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
more holy,

20:23.800 --> 20:25.800
and more cultured than the non-west.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.800
But there are some ridiculous college professors

20:27.800 --> 20:31.800
who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
According to them,

20:32.800 --> 20:34.800
the west is not uniquely civilized

20:34.800 --> 20:36.800
but uniquely uncivilized,

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
cruel,

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
imperialistic,

20:38.800 --> 20:39.800
racist,

20:39.800 --> 20:40.800
and genocidal.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.800
This just perpetuates the same essentializing error.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.800
Europeans aren't inherently more evil

20:45.800 --> 20:47.800
any more than they're inherently more civilized.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.800
If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa

20:50.800 --> 20:51.800
400 years ago,

20:51.800 --> 20:53.800
the result would have been just as brutal.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.800
So instead of vilifying the west,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.800
I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,

20:58.800 --> 21:01.800
adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,

21:01.800 --> 21:04.800
and acknowledge that the world is too complicated

21:04.800 --> 21:06.800
to reduce to simple us and them binaries.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.800
Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle

21:09.800 --> 21:12.800
in classical music and the Cheesecake Factory.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.800
We can still keep all that shit

21:13.800 --> 21:15.800
while eliminating the propaganda

21:15.800 --> 21:18.800
and injustice that surrounds it.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.800
Coda.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.800
My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
What if traps are gang?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
What if no one can ever love you?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
What if happiness is impossible?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.800
What if everyone who compliments me is lying

21:32.800 --> 21:34.800
so they can laugh at me later

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
when I delusionally feel good about themselves?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
What if when you die you stay conscious

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
and then you just are...

21:39.800 --> 21:41.800
What if I'm standing in an awkward way

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
and it looks weird?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.800
What if Blanchard is right?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.800
What are these horrible goddamn noises

21:46.800 --> 21:47.800
coming out of my mouth?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.800
Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain

21:49.800 --> 21:51.800
and music is really great for that.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.800
I've always liked classical music.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.800
When I listened to Mozart or Mendelssohn

21:55.800 --> 21:57.800
or even an amateur like Satie,

21:57.800 --> 22:00.800
my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
And I don't care what civilization the composer came from

22:03.800 --> 22:05.800
or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.800
And I don't want to know because I need this.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.800
I need this feeling that makes me just want to

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
take a big...

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
...

22:12.800 --> 22:13.800
...

22:13.800 --> 22:14.800
...

22:14.800 --> 22:15.800
...

22:15.800 --> 22:16.800
...

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
...

22:17.800 --> 22:18.800
...

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
...

22:19.800 --> 22:20.800
...

22:20.800 --> 22:21.800
...

22:21.800 --> 22:22.800
...

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
...

22:23.800 --> 22:24.800
...

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
...

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
...

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
...

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
...

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
...

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
...

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
...

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
...

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
...

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
...

22:34.800 --> 22:35.800
...

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
...

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
...

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
...

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
...

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
...

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
...

22:41.800 --> 22:42.800
...

22:42.800 --> 22:43.800
...

22:43.800 --> 22:44.800
...

22:44.800 --> 22:45.800
...

22:45.800 --> 22:46.800
...

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
...

22:47.800 --> 22:48.800
...

22:48.800 --> 22:49.800
...

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
...

22:50.800 --> 22:51.800
...

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
...

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
...

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
...

22:54.800 --> 22:55.800
...

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
...

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
...

22:57.800 --> 22:58.800
...

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
...

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
...

23:00.800 --> 23:01.800
...

23:01.800 --> 23:02.800
...

23:02.800 --> 23:03.800
...

23:03.800 --> 23:04.800
...

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
...

23:05.800 --> 23:31.780
The end.
