00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello again, the gays.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Straight people you're of course welcome to tag along to

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
provided you're emotionally damaged.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hi. Hey, how are you?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Cringe. Let's talk about it.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It just pops into my head all the time.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Like, when I randomly remembered that month back in 2013

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kezha songs

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
were rewritten in iambic pentameter.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why? What audience was that for?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Cringe. Mega cringe.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think I say this word like 50 times a day.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Cringe, cringe, cringe. And I'm not the only one.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and remaining pretty constant ever since.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
as at an all-time high the month I'm making this video.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So what is cringe?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, let's start with some examples.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What Things Really Make You Cringe?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And here's some of the most upvoted responses.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and everyone at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Recordings of my own voice.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
he just goes to another school thing.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Early teen me. So many cringe stuff I did.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This happened about two years ago.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I ordered some pizza hot online, and when it was delivered,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the lady handed me the pizza boxes.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I said, oh.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip,

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I said, oh.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then I said, you too.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then I closed the door and killed myself.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
says in her book Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
are when we're yanked out of our own perspective

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and we can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
who in the 60s did a study of the Byami tribe in New Guinea

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of themselves for the first time and described the results.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They were paralyzed after their first startled response

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
covering their mouths and ducking their heads.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They stood transfixed, staring at their images,

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So basically, they cringed at themselves.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
when they hear a recording for the first time.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh God,

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that's how other people hear me all the time.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the way you appear to other people.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's when you cringe.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The feeling Dahl describes as,

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment,

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
an unpleasant kind of self-recognition

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a forced moment of self-awareness,

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing fact

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When you're talking too loud at a wedding

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you suddenly realize how you look to them.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's no law of state or even of etiquette

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak at a wedding.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's something you have to intuit based on context.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How loud are other people speaking?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here,

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the function of awkwardness is that

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And memories of your cringy moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ten years later you'll be trying to fall asleep,

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know, this stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and you'll cringe all over again.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because you look back and you realize,

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self cringe.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
we're talking about cringing at other people.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
cringepix and cringetopia,

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
host videos and images of people behaving in cringy ways.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis,

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who let the dogs out?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Ugh.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It makes me want to crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like that

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
because I just can't stand it.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
which, sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
or secondhand embarrassment.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Basically, it's a form of empathy.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
just as if if you watched someone fall down the stairs,

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But there's a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
or at least a complication,

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the person doing the cringy thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In fact, often they're super confident,

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So in the internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell,

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Nothing about this is cringe.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but I don't cringe at her.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My feelings mirror what she's feeling,

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but when I'm cringing at someone,

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm feeling something very different to what they're feeling.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Another example is Bad American Idol auditions,

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
which are quintessential cringe content.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
People try out for American Idol

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
because they think they're good enough singers

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to compete in a national competition,

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so they're effectively revealing their own delusions

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
when they show up and sing like this.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is this the real life?

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, is this just fantasy?

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Most of us are bad singers, right?

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When people sing happy birthday at a party,

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
usually they're singing in three different keys at no particular tempo.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But that's not cringe because the point of singing happy birthday

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
is not to sound amazing.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you as good as, in your opinion,

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the lead singer from Queen?

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
when, in fact, you sound like a wounded street dog.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I admit that watching Red,

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And because he's so cocky

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There's almost a sense of karma,

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Misha,

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
who's there with her mom and they both seem like such sweethearts.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I do believe in her talent.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's very much.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but I'm rooting for her.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And when she embarrasses herself,

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yikes.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My differing reactions to Red and Misha

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
track a distinction that Doll makes

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
with the person you're cringing at.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves in the cringe-worthy moment,

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
of how other people were perceiving them.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
involves an emotional distancing from the person you're cringing at.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Just like with compassionate cringe,

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you feel annoyance and disgust at them

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So these are actually two very different emotional responses,

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We call both feelings cringe,

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
not because they're similar feelings,

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
but because they're responses to the same type of situation,

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
people lacking self-awareness,

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
embarrassing themselves without realizing it.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel this way?

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube?

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, I think the answer to that question depends

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When I read that Ask Reddit thread where all the people share their cringe stories,

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I cringe compassionately.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I recognize myself in them,

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and I'm reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm not the only one who cringes out my past or videos of myself.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
as beautiful and talented and badass,

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves.

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It makes us feel less alone.

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now this is all of course assuming that we're cringing compassionately.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet does not encourage compassion.

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the 21st century, right?

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Pillaries and freak shows and public floggings.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
These are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right?

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Right?

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We've got maniacs.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We've got whackadoos.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We've got skitsos, fatties, and spurs.

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Come see sexual deviants on display.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's right, folks.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Come see the panty sniffer.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Come see the skeleton girl.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Half man, half woman, all freak.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And by that I mean there's whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing.

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation, or SJW Cringe Compilation.

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Remember those?

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but in 2016 the word cringe was most associated with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
His video has followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
which means he would play someone else's content,

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No makeup with some sweatpants.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh my god, it's so fucking bad.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He looks like he's gender fluid.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He looks like a fucking lesbian.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos.

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What even is this thing?

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It must be one of the 76 genders.

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
behaving in cringy ways.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it isn't.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is this cringe?

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What is cringe about it?

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel,

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
She's just existing in water.

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Presumably something along the lines of, ew, fat people, gross.

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's literally just disgust, right?

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Here's another cringe compilation, this one titled,

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Gender-Fluid Non-Binary Cringe.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their gender-fluid identity.

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because, you know, like, gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, apparently not.

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But despite that self-awareness, we're being invited to cringe.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because, I guess being gender-fluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is not real cringe, I want to say.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that there's really no point in objecting to it.

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not like other girls girls,

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, maggots, trans people, non-binary people,

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
transtrenders, queer afab ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common, and a handful of themes do jump out.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Eviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Low social status.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.

347
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It includes me three or four times.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm of course a fedora tipping queer afab ukulele playing TikTok teen.

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe and try to be like, compassionate or whatever?

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Fuck no.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics,

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's part of patriarchy.

363
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Part of patriarchy.

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know if you're noticing a theme.

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Patriarchy.

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm reading fuckface.

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Mr. Entitled.

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Mr. Ego.

369
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Patriarchy fuckface.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
She's one of these people who generates meme-able phrases at an amazing rate.

371
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but I have unconventional tastes in Estasia.

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the mascot of feminism,

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
which is highly dishonest considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.

379
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I call this strategy mascotization,

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the construction of a strawman nemesis.

385
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.

387
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's very simple, but very effective.

388
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And it's best paired with memification.

389
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Then, through mascotization,

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester...

394
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're fucking a white male!

395
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
...memified as AIDS and Skrillex,

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and this protester...

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Take the hatred of the devil!

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Take the hatred of the devil!

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
...who was memified as Trigley Puff.

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta new male cuckoldry

401
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.

402
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

403
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

404
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb tier casual,

406
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
throwing up a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

407
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,

408
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss.

410
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective,

411
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
though it comes at the risk of backfiring

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

413
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
a little too badass.

414
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But the subtler's strategy of symbolizing your political enemies,

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

416
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way.

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.

418
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

419
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

421
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.

425
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't act like that or people will laugh at you.

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
at the whipping post.

433
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables

434
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and it sends a powerful message.

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Don't do whatever that guy did.

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact

437
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.

438
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.

439
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.

440
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriend's nudes.

441
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone

442
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
for alleged breaches of wokeness.

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Public humiliation is a powerful force,

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and it's usually, uh, it's not a good force.

445
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But there are some rare exceptions.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Back in the Gamergate era,

447
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.

450
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks

451
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and there was a network of besieged feminists of loggers

452
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

453
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere

454
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
from the pro-Gamergate days to the left tube world of today

455
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
was a handful of videos uploaded by then obscure YouTuber Harry Brewess

456
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Orini.

457
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on, Davis, we have to...

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No, stop lecturing me about ethics. We have to get it out of here.

459
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?

460
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
while posing in front of a toy skull

462
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Men of the West, women in our culture,

464
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

465
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

466
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I would start with the premise that all women are whores.

467
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
.

468
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

471
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Why did these videos work with this audience where so many others didn't?

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Well, I think it's because Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
for being problematic or misogynistic.

474
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

475
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

476
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

477
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw

478
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day,

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

480
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

481
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I've spoken to men and boys who have told me

482
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that Harry's videos inspired the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.

483
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Not just because they cringed at Davis Arini,

484
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves,

485
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and they cringed at that too.

486
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person induces self-cringe,

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
which can motivate you to change your behavior,

488
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
your beliefs, or even your own self-concept.

489
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

490
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

491
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
namely the fedora temper.

492
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity,

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but who's basically just a pasty nerd who can't relate to women.

494
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently

496
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
that I would classify him as what the internet calls a lol cow.

497
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Lol cow is old 4chan lingo.

498
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior

499
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
can be milked for lols.

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And milking in this context can mean simply watching a lol cow's behavior

501
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and laughing at them,

502
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them,

503
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to get a response that you find entertaining.

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
or my old videos about the Golden One,

507
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
as lol cow milking content with a political angle.

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
an argument from cringe,

510
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
with the aim of convincing people,

511
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'll embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,

512
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,

513
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and I wanted people to laugh.

515
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There doesn't need to be a political agenda behind milking lol cows.

516
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
In fact, usually there isn't.

517
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The purest example of a lol cow I can think of

518
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is actually someone from way before the internet,

519
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

520
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,

521
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City

522
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,

523
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
due to her being such a terrible singer

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that people went to her concerts,

525
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
essentially for the lols.

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
She was described as the world's worst opera singer.

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No one, before or since,

528
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
has succeeded in liberating themselves

529
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.

530
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Behold this fucking camp queen.

531
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, we have no choice but to stand.

532
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Here's a clip of one of the few recordings she made.

533
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Cringe.

534
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the William Mahone of her age.

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
until 1944, when she was 76 years old

538
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

539
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
to which newspaper critics showed up.

540
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The next morning, The New York Sun reported,

541
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
in a semblance of pitch,

543
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
but the further a note was from its proper elevation,

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the more the audience laughed and applauded,

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and five days later, she had a heart attack and died.

546
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I find something very touching about this story.

547
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

548
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

550
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell.

551
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
At least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand.

552
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a locale.

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Like, yes, this is hilarious,

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but on the other hand,

555
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
does not a locale bleed?

556
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
On some level, we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,

557
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but on the other hand,

558
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

559
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There's a good bug about this called the Joy of Pain,

560
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,

561
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
by Richard Smith.

562
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in other people's misery,

564
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and Smith argues that we experience it

565
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
because psychologically, we gain something when other people lose.

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

567
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
by comparing ourselves to other people.

568
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

569
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

570
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

571
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

572
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Maybe I'm not perfect,

573
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
but at least I'm not this locale.

574
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us,

575
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
whom we envy, get brought down a peg.

576
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
James Charles' cancelled party,

577
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
LOLOL.

578
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

579
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.

580
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Smith uses the word,

581
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Humillitainment, for this type of media,

582
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment.

583
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

584
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or some kind of carnival side show.

585
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, take a look around you.

586
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
at the time I'm making this video,

588
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder

589
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

590
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We have Wings of Redemption,

591
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
a bad-tempered gamer who, for a long time,

592
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression

593
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
to streaming video games all day

594
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.

595
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We have Onision,

596
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
a habitual alleged abuser of women and teenage girls,

597
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
who, earlier this year,

598
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube

599
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser.

600
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I love kombucha!

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists

602
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
access to video equipment?

603
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?

604
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And the viewers are no better than the performers.

605
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.

606
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Oh, you people love nothing more

607
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs

608
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
completely lose our minds live on camera.

609
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Is this what you want, huh?

610
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Is this what you want to try to melt down?

611
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know, as a creator,

612
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you have to be aware that you're a circus performer,

613
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and the crowd may, in fact, be more entertained

614
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Online media today is full of Lady Florenses,

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

617
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now, to be clear,

618
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

619
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
with indulging now and then

620
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in a little bit of light contempt.

621
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Cringing at Davis Orini or Bad American Idol auditions

622
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
seems pretty harmless,

623
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
but it can be taken too far.

624
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And there's no better case study of taking it too far

625
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.

626
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
If you don't know what's coming,

627
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
you might want to strap in Gorge,

628
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because this is coconuts.

629
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's bananas.

630
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's a full fruit salad.

631
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

632
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

633
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
more commonly known on the internet as Chris Chan,

634
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
is the victim of what is quite possibly

635
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
the longest-running and most obsessive

636
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
internet trolling saga of all time.

637
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
She's the lol cow of lol cows.

638
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hello, everybody.

639
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's just Christine Chandler

640
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
coming to you live from home once again.

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Chandler is an autistic trans woman,

642
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

643
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
which I pause to explain,

644
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

645
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
actually take her transition seriously.

646
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Most people seem to regard it as

647
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
simply another absurd symptom

648
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
of her hilarious mental condition.

649
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
In fact, a bunch of trans people

650
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
will probably get real salty with me

651
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
for making trans people look bad

652
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
by including Chris Chan in our,

653
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, please.

655
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity sweaty.

656
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

657
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
God, how did Trannies get so snobbish?

658
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Look, is Chris Chan really trans?

659
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't know, and I don't care.

660
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
If Chris Chan wants to be a woman,

661
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I for one support her journey.

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But it doesn't matter.

663
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The relevant thing about Chris Chan is not Chris Chan.

664
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

665
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
nearly every aspect of her life

666
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
has been obsessively archived online

667
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
by thousands of years known as Christorians.

668
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom

669
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
several internet centuries ago back in 2007

670
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series,

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid

672
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
of Sonic and Pikachu.

673
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The comic is set in quick fill,

674
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
CWC being Chris Chan's initials.

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The protagonist is a self-insert

676
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
who references Chandler's real life quote,

677
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
love quest to find a quote boyfriend free girl,

678
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
which apparently involved posting bizarre

679
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
attraction signs around her community college.

680
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
For this story to make sense,

681
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified

682
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and presented as male until 2015.

683
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So these trolls saw her as like

684
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

685
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Just to give you a feel for this person,

686
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
here's Christine in 2018 holding up

687
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
the iconic pre-transition portrait.

688
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Note the Sonichu medallions.

689
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

690
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and here she is in recent years

691
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.

692
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Pegasister snapped.

693
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Basically she's the entire cringe-topia sub-reddit

694
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
condensed into a single person.

695
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit

696
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because of course they did.

697
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And they began tormenting her

698
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

699
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
posting candid photos of her, et cetera.

700
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

701
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which of course encouraged some more,

702
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

703
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They hacked her accounts

704
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
or tricked her into giving out passwords.

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
They posted all her emails online.

706
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
They showed up in person and photographed her house.

707
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They called her parents,

708
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,

709
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in order to extract as much information

710
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
about her as possible.

711
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And of course they contacted Chandler herself,

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
which was very rewarding for trolls

713
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
because she has no filter

714
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and was very naive and trusting.

715
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So she was very willing to divulge,

716
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
or easily manipulated into divulging,

717
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
mortifying information about herself.

718
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Sexual, psychological, scatological.

719
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

720
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
For all the information they gathered,

721
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the trolls created a wiki called The Quickie,

722
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris Chan data.

723
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

724
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
entire articles about all numbers

725
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
of her immediate and extended family,

726
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked

727
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in descending them, and that's only the beginning.

728
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In their more grandiose moods,

729
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the Christorians have speculated

730
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that Chris Chan is the most documented life

731
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
in all human history,

732
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
comparing their social experiment to the Truman Show.

733
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's a level of obsession

734
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture.

735
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.

736
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

737
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
or on one occasion sex workers, to the Chandler household.

738
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates

739
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
with Chris Chan, of course secretly wearing wires

740
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
to record their conversations.

741
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

742
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

743
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
These things must be archived, don't you understand?

744
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Chris Chan must be documented.

745
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The absolute low point came when some trolls

746
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl

747
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and to have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.

748
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
In other words, they groomed a child

749
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to deceive an autistic person

750
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
into performing sex acts for their entertainment.

751
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Now, to contemporary Christorians,

752
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life

753
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
is frowned upon.

754
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Not so much because it's immoral,

755
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
a bit attention-seeking.

757
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No, to the sophisticated Christorian,

758
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the real pleasure in all this

759
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is supposed to lie and quietly spectating,

760
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
savoring the fine notes of cringe.

761
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

762
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
on the morality of all this.

763
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The real question to me is why?

764
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession

765
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
with Christine Chandler?

766
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And yes, it is an obsession.

767
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

768
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
personal investment in this,

769
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

770
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
one of very few Christorians with the audacity

771
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
to show his face,

772
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
has been working for more than two years

773
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
to produce an eventual 100 episode documentary series

774
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
about the life of Chris Chan.

775
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,

776
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

777
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

778
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.

779
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

780
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll call it morbid cringe,

781
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
defined as an obsessive and addictive,

782
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.

783
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Why does morbid cringe happen?

784
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, I've spent some time pouring over

785
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Christorians' conversations with each other,

786
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

787
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and this is what I've found.

788
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The first thing they'll tell you

789
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,

790
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
that Christine's strange life and mind

791
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.

792
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And I'm sure that's true.

793
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

794
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and morbidly interesting.

795
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Why fixate on this particular person?

796
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well, for a lot of them,

797
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
it's a reassurance that there's someone out there

798
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
worse than them.

799
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

800
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but at least this defenseless punching bag

801
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
called Chris Chan is here for them

802
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
to assert their superiority over.

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's pretty much common knowledge

804
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that a lot of Christorians,

805
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
including some of the most vocal haters,

806
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
are autistic themselves.

807
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris Chan

808
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

809
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
In recent years, there's also been

810
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
a small contingent of transgender trolls

811
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
who are likewise prone to say,

812
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
he's not a real transgender like me

813
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and he's making us all look bad.

814
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris Chan,

815
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you guys look amazing.

816
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

817
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
about why trolling Chandler is justified,

818
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
righteous even,

819
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
because at the end of the day,

820
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
trolls are people too.

821
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this,

822
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
which they suppress by insisting

823
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that Chris Chan is a horrible person

824
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
who deserves to be tormented.

825
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But trolls who protest too much about the evils of Chris Chan

826
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this

827
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
are known in the community as A-logs.

828
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A-log is the name of a troll

829
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
who attracted the ire of other trolls

830
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
by ranting about Chris Chan's crimes,

831
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
comparing her to Hitler,

832
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

833
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Among the trolls,

834
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them

835
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because they want to feel like they're just cruelly

836
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and casually toying with this person.

837
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, just for laughs,

838
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
not a big deal.

839
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
This is all perfectly healthy

840
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and normal and fine.

841
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's fine.

842
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

843
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
because it was obvious that his Chris Chan obsession

844
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
wasn't healthy or normal or fine.

845
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So the other trolls turned on A-log

846
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and they made him into Chris Chan 2.0

847
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and they uncovered his autism

848
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and his furry porn collection

849
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and his cringey erotic fanfiction.

850
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So why would someone as similar to Chris Chan as A-log

851
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
obsessively hate on her?

852
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Well, there's two explanations.

853
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
One is troll shielding.

854
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris Chan

855
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

856
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.

857
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

858
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

859
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Obviously, this did not work.

860
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The other explanation is that A-log saw himself reflected in Chris Chan

861
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her.

862
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
A-log hated Chris Chan because he saw part of himself in her.

863
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And the other trolls hated A-log

864
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
because they saw part of themselves in him.

865
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
To quote Margaret Plus,

866
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
who covered this story for New York Magazine a few years ago,

867
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think it might be A-logs all the way down.

868
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris Chan

869
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
because to them she's a symbol of something they hate about themselves,

870
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
something they're ashamed of.

871
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum

872
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
or being a socially awkward recluse.

873
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents

874
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons

875
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
or embarrassing sexual proclivities

876
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
or all of the above.

877
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This is how scapegoating works, right?

878
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame

879
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and insecurity and self-loathing,

880
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and you displace them onto someone else,

881
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
usually someone you can feel superior to.

882
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat

883
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

884
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

885
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's pretty safe to assume

886
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls

887
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris Chan.

888
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris Chan

889
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

890
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of social rejection and exclusion.

891
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,

892
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

893
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity.

894
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people

895
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and find a way to make this all about me.

896
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
...

897
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
...

898
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:58,000
...

899
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
...

900
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?

901
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Would you like to meet my boyfriend's boyfriend?

902
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's right, honey. I'm giving you fujoshi realness.

903
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
He's going to stay right here as a grim reminder

904
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
of the things that you have seen.

905
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Actually, I identify as a trap. It's very that.

906
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

907
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Cringe is failed seriousness.

908
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am

909
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
of being a transgender lesbian.

910
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Cringe. Shame.

911
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
At the end of that video, I talk about how I sense that my shame

912
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

913
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

914
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
particularly those of the heck and stripey sock

915
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
nya nya catgirl variety.

916
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,

917
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

918
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I want to return to that thought and kind of psychoanalyze myself

919
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession.

920
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So, catgirl trans girls are...

921
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

922
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

923
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
who express their identity online

924
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
through cloying, neotenous otaku memory.

925
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

926
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

927
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
as a kind of visual baby talk,

928
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity

929
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and womanhood that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

930
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.

931
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.

932
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Fuck your dreams.

933
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked with a discussion

934
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct.

935
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

936
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

937
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

938
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

939
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
catgirls are being cringe online.

940
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Is a situation so inconsequential

941
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much?

942
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

943
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Well, according to the A-Log theory of morbid cringing,

944
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

945
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
for people who have traits in common with us,

946
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
people who make us uncomfortable

947
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
because we see something of ourselves in them.

948
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

949
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, we're both trans women.

950
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We're both attracted to women.

951
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?

952
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I like good anime that has, you know,

953
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
mature three-dimensional female characters.

954
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay? I'm not like you.

955
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's also not lost on me that this is like

956
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the seventh time on this channel I've dressed as a catgirl

957
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
to make fun of them.

958
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I have posted cringe.

959
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You should all be laughing at me right now.

960
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

961
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

962
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
that I'm A-Log-ing these catgirls.

963
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

964
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

965
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

966
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
because of how these catgirls are acting.

967
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So let's make another distinction between

968
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

969
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

970
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
who belongs to the same group identity as you.

971
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
For example, your family, your romantic partnership,

972
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
your ethnicity, or your country,

973
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

974
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
in front of outsiders to the group.

975
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

976
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
if her mom does something cringy in front of her friends.

977
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

978
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump

979
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
being our president.

980
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Or think about these phrases.

981
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

982
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
They're making trans people look bad.

983
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
He's giving autistics a bad name.

984
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

985
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment.

986
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior

987
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
makes us look bad too.

988
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

989
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
because you're cringing at your membership

990
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
in an embarrassing group.

991
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Nothing has ever triggered this kind of in-group embarrassment

992
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year,

993
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

994
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

995
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You're making my fucking money back.

996
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.

997
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

998
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It is ma'am.

999
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

1000
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Motherfucker, take it outside.

1001
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If you want to call me, sir, again,

1002
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I will show you a fucking sir.

1003
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Motherfucker.

1004
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people

1005
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
into seeing you as a woman.

1006
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Ooh!

1007
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Ooh!

1008
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Now, Twitter's going to come for me over this

1009
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and say, Natalie hates trans women, you don't pass.

1010
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But passing is really not what this is about.

1011
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

1012
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
from a trans woman, accompanied by, apparently,

1013
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
a total delusion about how she's presenting.

1014
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Well, I'm going to ask you for the fifth time

1015
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
to stop calling me a man, because quite clearly, I am not.

1016
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

1017
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

1018
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The incongruity between her thinking that she's serving women

1019
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
while bellowing like a drill sergeant.

1020
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

1021
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
this is cringe reaction content.

1022
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't really do that on this channel,

1023
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

1024
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And it feels good, like, intoxicatingly good.

1025
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

1026
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm imagining myself right now, surrounded by cis people,

1027
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and I am leading the righteous mob

1028
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
as we point and laugh at some delusional, manly dump truck.

1029
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender.

1030
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Father, find the bruise of me.

1031
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.

1032
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Jot that down in my progress notes, please, Doctor.

1033
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

1034
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

1035
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
When I watched that GameStop video,

1036
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
for the first few seconds,

1037
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

1038
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I can even relate,

1039
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
because in the first couple months of my transition,

1040
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
there was an occasion

1041
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction

1042
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
where the guy at the desk was calling me Sir the entire time.

1043
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And there's something very humiliating

1044
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
about trying to present female,

1045
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
like wearing a dress and makeup,

1046
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and yet being called Sir.

1047
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept

1048
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and the way other people are seeing you.

1049
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And the memory of it is painful to me,

1050
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but what I cling to is that,

1051
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
while I may have looked like a man,

1052
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
at least I didn't act like a man.

1053
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

1054
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and show them a Sir.

1055
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.

1056
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So as the GameStop video progresses,

1057
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
my sympathy runs out fast.

1058
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And instead of compassionate cringe,

1059
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

1060
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
including myself.

1061
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And I feel contempt toward this individual

1062
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
for making us all look bad.

1063
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.

1064
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?

1065
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

1066
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

1067
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

1068
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.

1069
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And that fear motivates me to distance myself

1070
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
from that person in the video.

1071
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't feel compassion for her,

1072
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because that would mean putting myself

1073
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
in her size 16 shoes.

1074
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And I don't want to do that,

1075
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
because I'm horrified and repulsed

1076
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
by the thought that I'm like her in some way.

1077
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So I want to push away,

1078
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.

1079
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And if I express that contempt

1080
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
by publicly shaming and condemning her,

1081
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

1082
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Accidental COVID jokes.

1083
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oops, I guess it's contagious.

1084
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I think many people who are stigmatized

1085
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
or who have been humiliated long for the experience

1086
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
of being a normal surrounded by fellow normals

1087
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
judging and humiliating a freak.

1088
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

1089
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
a lot of the biggest creators in the platform

1090
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
have channels basically devoted

1091
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
to exactly this type of cringe reaction humilitainment.

1092
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy

1093
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
who's best known for what are essentially

1094
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
cringe reaction videos.

1095
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.

1096
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That is, people who claim to be trans

1097
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.

1098
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
He's especially bothered by girly, afab,

1099
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
trans and non-binary teenagers

1100
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
or by anyone who blurs the line

1101
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.

1102
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Sometimes he'll do a long form reaction

1103
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
to a specific person who grinds his gears.

1104
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So this person is an asexual,

1105
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
non-binary, transgender, lesbian,

1106
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.

1107
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.

1108
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
In other times, he'll basically just laugh

1109
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
at cringy trans TikTok teens.

1110
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No, no, I'm turning off the video.

1111
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I can't watch this.

1112
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
He has a couple justifications for making these videos.

1113
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
One is that he's actually helping the people

1114
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
he's cringing at because of a trend or transitions

1115
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.

1116
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people

1117
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?

1118
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
His other justification is that trans-trenders

1119
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
are giving real trans people a bad name.

1120
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
They're the reason people are transphobic.

1121
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
This is why they hate us.

1122
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's because of the trenders.

1123
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Wow, I love that idea of a true scum furry.

1124
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Isn't that just wonderful?

1125
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
A true scum furry.

1126
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But it's not though.

1127
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I mean, transphobia existed long before there were people

1128
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
you could plausibly describe as trans-trenders.

1129
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So trans-trenders aren't the reason society

1130
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
hates trans people, Calvin.

1131
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

1132
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Or at least the trans community.

1133
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting

1134
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that feeling onto society at large and you're saying,

1135
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.

1136
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.

1137
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,

1138
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes.

1139
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes.

1140
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But now they're used by trans people trying to distance themselves,

1141
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people in the community

1142
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
under the label of trans-trenders.

1143
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And Calvin, there may be some truth to what you're saying

1144
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
about their being confused teenagers who think they're trans when they're not.

1145
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I mean, I wouldn't know.

1146
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life

1147
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and I don't hang out with teenagers.

1148
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But even if it is true, Calvin,

1149
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.

1150
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Like you return to this topic to cringe again and again

1151
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and again and again and again and again.

1152
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's like you're picking at a wound.

1153
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.

1154
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.

1155
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
This could be me projecting, of course,

1156
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
but I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparkle gender afabs

1157
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
is similar to the way I feel about otaku, transbian, cat girls.

1158
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And it might be worth considering that

1159
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I don't cringe at the sparkle genders the way you do.

1160
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I mean, I'm with you on wondering what a he-they-seer, gender-flux, lesbian, demi-boy is.

1161
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But unlike you, Calvin, I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

1162
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
with feminine afab trans people.

1163
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care.

1164
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I may not always understand it, but I support their journey.

1165
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I guess it doesn't bother me because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me

1166
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
because of how they behave.

1167
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't feel in-group cringe.

1168
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Now, it's a different story.

1169
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit,

1170
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and I see a comment like,

1171
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
pre-transition trans lesbian here,

1172
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I wish I had titties.

1173
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Girl dick, nya nya.

1174
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Get the fuck out of here, Lily.

1175
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You're giving real trans lesbians a bad name.

1176
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
This is why they hate us.

1177
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
See, now I have strong feelings.

1178
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Now I'm in-group cringing.

1179
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct to some extent.

1180
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Like, I don't think a general lesbian community

1181
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
is the appropriate forum for a trans woman

1182
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
who's effectively still living as a man

1183
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
to take the mic and whine about wanting titties

1184
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
or rhapsodize about girl dick.

1185
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this

1186
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.

1187
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And honestly, my own self-loathing.

1188
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps

1189
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women.

1190
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's where my head is at.

1191
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity?

1192
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe about an identity,

1193
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point

1194
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
of insecurity and embarrassment and shame.

1195
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So Calvin, maybe, and again I could just be projecting,

1196
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
but maybe that's kind of like how you feel about these trenders.

1197
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
When you make these videos condemning them as not really trans,

1198
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
aren't you essentially exiling them from the in-group

1199
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
so you no longer feel the pain of in-group cringe?

1200
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,

1201
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
what you're really trying to destroy is the trender within.

1202
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And again, I could be full of shit here.

1203
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
At the end of the day, this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.

1204
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.

1205
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But still, I guess I invite you to consider

1206
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
whether producing trans-trender human attainment

1207
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
is actually helping anything,

1208
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
or whether it's really just an addictive way

1209
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
to scratch some kind of emotional itch.

1210
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.

1211
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Who's next?

1212
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Oh, how about Vanessa?

1213
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We meet again, Gorge.

1214
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And once again, I'm wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hair piece.

1215
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Vanessa is a trans woman who is the second most popular political trans YouTuber.

1216
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
At least that's what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her

1217
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it.

1218
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.

1219
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Good for her.

1220
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel

1221
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
back when SJW Cringe was fashionable.

1222
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

1223
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but the most consistent theme was

1224
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
trans-trenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.

1225
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They're making us look bad.

1226
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
This is why people hate us.

1227
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So what we can now recognize as a standard in-group cringe fixation.

1228
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.

1229
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her

1230
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
where she made a point of misgendering Riley

1231
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
and dismissing her as a fake transgender

1232
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.

1233
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You know, if you went on estrogen,

1234
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
your sex drive wouldn't be so high

1235
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and you wouldn't be guilt tripping people and having sex with you.

1236
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Just saying.

1237
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
But then Riley made a video revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year

1238
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.

1239
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video

1240
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition,

1241
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video

1242
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and opened up about having experienced herself,

1243
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
the cruelty she directed at Riley.

1244
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online.

1245
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it

1246
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that

1247
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
or, you know, digging up my old pictures.

1248
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And so the thought that this entire time

1249
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I've done that exact same thing to someone else

1250
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and pushed that off on someone else

1251
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
fucks with me.

1252
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And I'm fucking sorry.

1253
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Vanessa actually managed for one fleeting moment

1254
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
to make a connection between her own past, her and drama

1255
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,

1256
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event

1257
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths

1258
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child

1259
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery like a glutton

1260
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.

1261
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that

1262
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy.

1263
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
However, this lesson would not last.

1264
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe,

1265
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
making a video with big red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019.

1266
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance.

1267
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But once again, I underestimated Vanessa.

1268
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success

1269
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
when she released a video titled,

1270
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

1271
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,

1272
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman called Jessica Yaniv.

1273
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

1274
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well, as far as I can tell,

1275
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.

1276
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal

1277
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls

1278
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way.

1279
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.

1280
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unshaperoned children.

1281
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality

1282
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.

1283
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And my read on Yaniv, by the way, is not that she's a cunning manipulator,

1284
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
but that this is someone who is mentally not playing with a full deck.

1285
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv

1286
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,

1287
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.

1288
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.

1289
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
At least now she's finally picking on someone who deserves it.

1290
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.

1291
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story

1292
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures

1293
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
as an indictment of trans activists,

1294
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators.

1295
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And I'm willing to admit there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.

1296
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Like some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts

1297
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small

1298
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
but real subset of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.

1299
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it's urgent breaking news.

1300
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.

1301
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?

1302
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year.

1303
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
The literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself.

1304
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?

1305
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans identified predator, a tip,

1306
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.

1307
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.

1308
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.

1309
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Like initially the LGBT website, Pink News,

1310
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,

1311
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics.

1312
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender crowd is really the best optics for us either.

1313
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?

1314
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Is it simply because she cares deeply about the well-being of children

1315
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and she thought making a video exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?

1316
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,

1317
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
but it's still a YouTube video and you have to ask,

1318
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?

1319
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?

1320
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,

1321
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

1322
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
This got two million views.

1323
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Is this what you do with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?

1324
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel?

1325
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
What's to debate?

1326
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I don't need to be scared of my own house that I'm going to get fucking attacked.

1327
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Which is illegal in Canada, just saying.

1328
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But do you think that was like cute?

1329
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Was that a moment for you?

1330
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Then of course you sell t-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate.

1331
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I mean, that makes sense.

1332
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If you're going to catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.

1333
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And of course you gotta follow the pedophile's makeup tutorial.

1334
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You know.

1335
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
For the children.

1336
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Now, I hate to be overly critical, but when I look at this,

1337
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I don't see a high-minded activist working to protect children in trans people's image.

1338
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I see a tabloid entertainer who's discovered a way to monetize milking lulz from a mentally defective pervert.

1339
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I have to say Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,

1340
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm very entertained by all of this.

1341
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?

1342
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That's genius.

1343
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I wish I'd thought of that.

1344
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
But just be honest.

1345
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
This isn't activism.

1346
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
This isn't justice.

1347
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's a lol cow cult.

1348
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show.

1349
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And I love that for her.

1350
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I love that for her.

1351
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But Blair, I can't help but notice you're still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit.

1352
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Attention everyone.

1353
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

1354
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

1355
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It's very important that we all gather around to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender.

1356
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And Blair, I'll give you this.

1357
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You are getting better at choosing your targets.

1358
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture,

1359
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and Jessica Yaniv is good casting for the part.

1360
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,

1361
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.

1362
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously

1363
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
as anything more than a smarter version of the same in-group cringe-humillatainment you've always made.

1364
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And by the way, you may want to check in on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

1365
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called Trans Stupid.

1366
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Hi everyone, and welcome to another edition of Trans Stupid,

1367
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the show where I take a look at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news because stupidity is intersectional.

1368
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Transgender, more like trans retarded, more like trans gay.

1369
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Trans gay? I love that.

1370
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I just realized I'm literally trans gay.

1371
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism,

1372
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation.

1373
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But in practice, well, let's just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary

1374
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.

1375
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

1376
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

1377
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

1378
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And here's her transition advice to trans women just beginning their journey.

1379
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.

1380
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.

1381
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Like, look at this seal. Isn't this seal adorable?

1382
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You're so cute.

1383
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But the truth is, you're probably not looking like this seal right now, are you?

1384
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You're probably more like this big bull seal barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,

1385
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
this is a woman's body.

1386
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.

1387
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

1388
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her.

1389
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,

1390
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.

1391
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Would I be wrong to say I'm getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?

1392
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and wrongdoings,

1393
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.

1394
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,000
The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone who you can smell just by looking at a picture of them.

1395
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv.

1396
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I do not support her journey. As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit.

1397
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And maybe she does. I wouldn't be surprised.

1398
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,000
No, my point is that part of the catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content

1399
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
comes from contrasting themselves as good, presentable, real trans people

1400
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.

1401
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.

1402
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
On one half, Vanessa looking fish, looking cunt.

1403
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.

1404
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.

1405
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.

1406
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.

1407
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Look, I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven't heard of it, called inner beauty.

1408
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's right, sweetie. My pancreas, unclockable.

1409
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon.

1410
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Okay, straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune and the titanic tranner of Canada.

1411
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
A particular titanic tranner of Canada, the titanic tranner of Canada.

1412
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender that I associate with 4chan.

1413
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Or I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.

1414
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness.

1415
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Well, I'm guessing that must be another important part of stopping a predator, right?

1416
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love, in a way, is needed.

1417
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned.

1418
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

1419
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like, I looked bad. Like, I was overweight. I had no poor taste in clothes.

1420
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

1421
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Rose, are you okay? No, you're not okay.

1422
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
None of us are okay. No trans woman, remotely in the public eye, is in any way okay.

1423
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And look, I don't want to take this psychoanalysis too far.

1424
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Because I don't know from watching YouTube videos what's going on in someone's head.

1425
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But I can try to make intelligent inferences.

1426
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And I think it's pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv.

1427
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I think, well, one of the biggest characters in the whole fucking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv.

1428
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Rose? Gorge? Jessica Yaniv is not one of the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.

1429
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
This is not a world historical figure.

1430
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver, B.C.

1431
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator

1432
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

1433
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
She is not one of the most important characters in the world.

1434
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the most important characters in your brain.

1435
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
This is distorted thinking. It's like A-Log comparing Chris Chan to Hitler.

1436
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you've lost perspective.

1437
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And I'm sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons why you're devoting so much attention to this.

1438
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm sure that's a factor too.

1439
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one.

1440
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet is more difficult than most people can imagine.

1441
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives.

1442
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies and turfs have said about us

1443
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and to repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.

1444
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh, it feels good to be the turf for once.

1445
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.

1446
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Because when you point the finger at someone else, you're also pointing away from yourself.

1447
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default.

1448
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So there's safety in being the one who spearheads the think of the children type moral crusade.

1449
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and stigma we all feel.

1450
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us, but that's just not true.

1451
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It's a simple answer to a complicated problem. It's scapegoating.

1452
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:26,000
When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.

1453
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's basically a blood sacrifice. It's not rational.

1454
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.

1455
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.

1456
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed.

1457
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you're just going to find a new scapegoat to take her place.

1458
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And the shame cycle continues.

1459
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced is internalized as shame.

1460
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt.

1461
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle.

1462
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shame dumps, new lolcows, and you can end up like one of the people who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years.

1463
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
But that will never really heal us.

1464
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
God, how do I get out of this video?

1465
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some sort of cat girl degenerate.

1466
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Cringe.

1467
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Shame I machined.

1468
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Don't look at me.

1469
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

1470
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Thank you. Yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.

1471
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.

1472
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt.

1473
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.

1474
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
When you're embarrassed for someone else, we call that vicarious embarrassment.

1475
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I've argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe.

1476
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn't embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we're cringing at them.

1477
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Now if someone who's part of your in-group is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the in-group that includes you, you feel in-group cringe,

1478
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe.

1479
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they're traits you have contempt for in yourself,

1480
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lol cow,

1481
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:49,000
that addiction to contempt you is gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.

1482
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.

1483
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

1484
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do.

1485
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories can be cathartic.

1486
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone.

1487
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy.

1488
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It shows yourself aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think.

1489
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves, and let's just say they're not my kind of people.

1490
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves, regardless of how they're actually coming across.

1491
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I've overcompensated.

1492
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people.

1493
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself, and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.

1494
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And when I take a look around the internet, like I've done in this video, I find that I'm not alone in this situation.

1495
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And it's not cute. So how do we cringe less?

1496
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Well, the cliche solution is self-love, which our culture plays a lot of value on.

1497
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Self-love and self-esteem.

1498
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.

1499
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm a bad bitch. I look like a supermodel. I'm a genius.

1500
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way, but it doesn't work because it's not realistic.

1501
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.

1502
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls the self-esteem tower of terror.

1503
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
You go from self-love to self-hate, but self-hate is also a distortion.

1504
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Recently, I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview.

1505
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, I know, cringe.

1506
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.

1507
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.

1508
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
How dare you notice that?

1509
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.

1510
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,000
But it's true. Time spent cringing at yourself is still time spent obsessing over yourself.

1511
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And it's hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature.

1512
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But we can still learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us.

1513
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I mean, I've heard rumors.

1514
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:13,000
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy, Melissa Doll advocates not self-love or self-hate, but what she calls self-indifference.

1515
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:21,000
She says, self-indifference is the relief of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.

1516
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So yeah, I was pretty cringy in the past, and I'm still pretty cringy now.

1517
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringy too.

And the world's probably going to burn down in 50 years anyway.

1519
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:40,000

Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1521
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1522
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1523
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1524
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1525
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

1526
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Nothing matters.
