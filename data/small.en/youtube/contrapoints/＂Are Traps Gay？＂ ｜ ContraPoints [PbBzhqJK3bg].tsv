0	19640	Hello my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here
19640	24600	to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing.
24600	30920	There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime,
30920	36720	so if that's going to make you sad, please don't watch this, unless you enjoy sadness.
36720	42300	I know I do, but your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made
42300	47320	you a wet pot of hot tea, and you can take it out in the balcony and pour it on some
47320	48320	pedestrians.
48320	51280	That always cheers me up.
52280	55280	One, traps.
56280	63400	Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic
63400	64400	research.
64400	70000	Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing
70000	77000	volumes ancient and modern in search of the answer to two fundamental questions.
77000	81480	That are traps, and be they gay.
81480	87240	With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady
87240	93400	scholar known as the pedantic romantic, wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced
93400	96920	to patrons of animated pictures from the aureate.
96920	97920	Curious.
97920	103160	The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture
103160	108680	forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one admiral
108680	113840	Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.
113840	120120	Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japon-esks,
120120	123960	to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined.
123960	128920	The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth the daughter
128920	135400	of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite
135400	136400	skulduggery.
136400	142520	Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only
142520	145800	transvestites, but transsexuals as well.
145800	151760	And this must needs be remarked, for tis evident such persons oft times inflame the lust of
151760	153000	ordinary men.
153000	159320	It is hence with respect to this phenomenon, I pose my second question thus, fellas, is
159320	160320	it gay?
160320	164040	I'm sorry, who are you talking to?
164040	167560	Gentlemen of the academy.
167560	169520	Did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again?
169520	173360	It must needs be remarked.
173360	174880	Please stop breaking into my house.
174880	177880	I shall be the queen of dairy.
177880	182960	I'm sure you will be.
182960	187680	Cross-dresser, hi, I'm Natalie Nguyen, biological woman.
187680	196000	Can we pan the camera down, my hair is less high?
196000	197320	Are traps gay?
197320	199200	The meme, that will not die.
199200	204080	Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male cross-dresser
204080	208680	or a trans woman, especially in a context of neotenist kawaii decadence.
208680	213600	The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men attracted
213600	218600	to dick girls, foodnari, MTFs, you know a lot of these men don't know or care about
218600	222320	the difference between a trans woman and a cross-dresser, so it's kind of pointless
222320	223640	to get hung up on that.
223640	227560	The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago when someone released the worst specimens
227560	229920	of the white race into the wild.
229920	235400	All traps gay, one of life's most important questions, are traps gay.
236400	249920	To the men who meme about this topic, it's all lighthearted fun, it's part of a wider
249920	255000	game they like to play called is it gay, you know, is it gay to have an MMF3 sum, only if
255000	260360	the balls touch, don't cross the streams, and so on, but to many trans women, the meme
260360	262600	and the word trap itself are highly offensive.
262600	267040	In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans
267040	271160	people on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this topic is just too harmful to
271160	272160	even discuss.
272160	274640	So here's the challenge I face making this video.
274640	277600	On the one hand, there's people who are going to be upset and offended that I'm making
277600	281400	a video about this topic at all, and on the other hand, there are people who think this
281400	285120	is all just harmless otaku shitposting and who are going to be annoyed by my trigger
285120	286120	warnings.
286120	289200	But first, to the people who think it's too offensive, here's what I have to say for
289200	290200	myself.
290200	293680	I just believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where they're
293680	294680	at.
294680	297400	And in this case, are traps gay is where people are at.
297400	301080	At one of my YouTube meetups, I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard
301080	304840	some of his male students joking in the hallway about are traps gay.
304840	308760	When those teenage boys go home and Google are traps gay, who do you want to explain
308760	309760	it to them?
309760	314680	Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count
314680	316280	Dankula, or this Tran.
316280	320240	And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me.
320240	323160	You know, as trans women, we have little influence in society.
323160	326760	The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are.
326760	329200	So we're like a jogger racing against a car.
329200	332000	The only way to win is to hijack the car.
332000	337520	And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having
337520	338520	about us.
338520	343920	As always, my aspiration is to drive a woke conclusion from edgy premises to shitpost
343920	345800	my way to the moral high ground.
345800	350320	Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking just more politically correct cuckoldry
350320	352120	designed to take away your free speech?
352120	356280	Well, I assure you, there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel.
356280	358640	Unless you clock my makeup, dickbag!
358640	359640	Comment!
359640	360640	Deleted!
360640	364320	But if you want to know why trans women are offended by are traps gay, I'm happy to
364320	365320	tell you.
365320	370080	Not to silence you, of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to
370080	374960	want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that seems harmless
374960	375960	to you.
375960	379560	So, well, let's put it this way.
379560	380960	2.
380960	381960	Trans Panic
381960	388160	The 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx gay and
388160	391600	transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s.
391600	396160	One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Extravaganza who describes
396160	398880	her precarious existence as a sex worker.
398880	404560	I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties until he touched me down there.
404560	409560	He felt it and he seen it and he like totally flipped out and he said, you fucking faggot.
409560	410560	You're a freak.
410560	413280	You're a victim of AIDS and you're trying to give me AIDS.
413280	414280	What are you, crazy?
414280	415280	You're a homo.
415280	416280	I should kill you.
416280	421760	And like, I was really terrified so I just jumped out the window.
421760	426240	During the filming of Paris Is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.
426240	429640	Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.
429640	434300	Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully
434300	438020	high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.
438020	442260	The men who murdered trans women often claim they were provoked to violence by the alleged
442260	444100	deception of their victims.
444100	449620	This is what's called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial
449620	453060	of the killers of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.
453060	457140	One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried, I can't
457140	460100	be fucking gay, before beating her to death.
460100	464140	Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don't want to
464140	466460	get murdered, then they shouldn't trick men.
466460	470940	But what you have to understand is first, men usually do know when they're having sex
470940	475580	with a trans woman, like if you have a dick, it's pretty hard actually to have sex with
475580	481220	someone and have them not notice it, and second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence
481220	483180	as itself a kind of trickery.
483180	487780	A black trans woman named Elan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose
487780	490340	friends had mocked him for flirting with her.
490340	494660	All she did to provoke him was walk down the street with two friends.
494660	499220	The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive
499220	503700	of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight.
503700	508520	But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across
508520	511380	class and race experience some version of.
511380	518420	Because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation
518420	519860	to a proboscis.
519900	523980	I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at
523980	528460	a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans and then punched
528460	529460	her.
529460	532460	Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home?
532460	536940	For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our
536940	537940	freedom.
537940	542380	There's bars I won't go into, because I don't trust the clientele to side with me if some
542380	543860	shit like that goes down.
543860	548020	And I've had little scares, I was in the back of an Uber once, and the driver comes
548020	551620	on a little flirty, you know, what's your name, are you a student?
551620	555460	And I'm thinking, wow, he thinks I'm young enough to be a student!
555460	560460	But at some point he goes silent, and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare in the rearview
560460	565540	mirror like fucking clocked, and for a second I'm like, fuck, I'm gonna die in the back
565540	566540	of this car.
566540	571780	And of course I didn't die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine, I mean I'm
571780	576220	gonna be fine, because white middle class transsexuals don't get murdered in this country.
576260	580780	The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it's really
580780	582260	not my oppression to claim.
582260	586220	You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle class, computer programmer, trans women
586220	591700	be like, we're getting murdered in the streets, who's we, it's not white middle class trans
591700	592700	women.
592700	596660	So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane, it exists at this intersection
596660	600700	of masculinity and race, and that's really not a conversation that should be led by a
600700	606060	white woman, especially when there's so, so, so many things to critique about white
606060	607060	masculinity.
607060	609500	Let's talk about some now.
609500	610500	3.
610500	611500	Taking offense.
611500	613980	Okay, back to traps.
613980	617780	Now this is my lane, I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.
617780	622460	Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox.
622460	627580	So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom is abridged by our need to navigate
627580	633420	around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence, as a kind of trap.
633420	637780	I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans if
637780	641740	you're using that word for us, or for foodinari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.
641740	647220	I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap, my response is more like, wow, a transphobe
647220	651020	thought I looked like a woman, but that's because I'm so pathetic I have to go dumpster
651020	655020	diving for validation, but the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity
655020	658360	and self-respect, you should definitely not call them traps.
658360	661820	Of course, some trans women will overstate the case and say the word trap is literally
661820	666700	getting trans women killed, which I can't find any examples of the word trap being connected
666700	671700	to a murder, but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm?
671700	675300	Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps is you're showing that you think
675300	679220	of us the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us.
679220	683380	When a man kills a trans woman, literally the argument he trots out in court is that
684380	689100	And that's what you're reminding us of when you use that word, and that's why trans women
689100	690260	are getting triggered over it.
690260	694340	You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is
694340	695540	one of those times.
695540	699660	So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now.
699660	703820	I think I've made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended
703820	708300	by the word trap, but if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter, this is why
708300	713620	I'm making this video, if I simply argue that our traps gay is offensive, then here's
713620	714620	what happens.
714620	718700	First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit, in fact, me telling them it's offensive
718700	722340	only makes them want to say it more, because they feel, on a deep level, that they are
722340	727020	by nature superior to trans people, so an uppity tranny telling them what words they're
727020	729420	allowed to say completely enrages them.
729420	733580	So they'll comment, traps are gay, well, just to reaffirm their superiority over me
733580	737400	and that I have no power or influence over them, and there's really nothing I can do
737400	738680	about those people.
738680	744560	But, another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they'll say, okay,
744560	747160	so since you're offended by it, I won't say the word trap anymore.
747160	750780	And they'll be super woke about it, and they'll post Twitter callouts cancelling
750780	755000	anyone who uses the word trap, and they'll be very respectful and compassionate toward
755000	760880	trans people in public so long as it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic
760880	762800	third world country of a gender minority.
762800	767560	But then, they'll go home at night, and in that twilight between consciousness and
767560	772120	sleep, their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?
772120	776760	And then, years later, when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend, we'll suddenly
776760	781440	watch all that shallow lokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapour.
781440	785320	Real acceptance has to be built, and real understanding.
785320	792360	So it's not enough for me to argue that are traps gay is offensive, I also have to argue
792360	795080	that other traps are gay.
795080	797760	So, are traps gay?
797760	800600	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
800600	824160	For the Philosopher Hello boys, it is I, the half-queen, points.
824160	829160	After thirty days and thirty nights, the Philosopher descended from the mountaintop into the gathered
829160	836160	villagers, thus spake, are traps gay? said he, to whom the half-queen, thus replied,
836160	844600	hmm, let's see, let me think about it, oh, I'm gonna stop saying trap now, because it's
844600	847920	not a good word, as has been explained, in fact it's really best to treat it like a
847920	848920	slur.
848920	853060	So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans
853060	854640	woman, is that gay?
854640	859800	Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are women, and a man having sex with
859800	866040	a woman is, um, let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted, it is not
866040	867040	in fact gay.
867040	870760	But that's not the most persuasive answer, because in order to find it convincing, you
870760	873640	already have to believe that trans women are women.
873640	877360	And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this, what they say is something
877360	883680	like, sure, I think trans women are women, but, they shouldn't expect men to want to
883680	887440	date them, unless they're into that sort of thing.
887440	891440	Oh, and what sort of thing is that?
891440	895280	Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman, and you say, oh, what's she like?
895280	901560	And he says, she's from Cincinnati, your response is not, oh, David, I didn't realize
901560	904440	you were into that sort of thing.
904440	909680	In other words, these people tell you, trans women are women, but, and then they say something
909680	913560	that shows they don't really think trans women are women at all.
913560	918820	So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular
918820	923640	reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay because trans women
923640	928900	are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that's being disputed.
928900	931200	So maybe the observational approach is better.
931200	933360	The facts are indisputable.
933360	937760	Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women, and comparatively few gay men are.
937760	942160	Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the
942160	943160	world.
943160	945720	Who is attracted to us and who isn't?
945720	950540	So to us, this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical as the question of whether
950540	952480	the sun will rise tomorrow.
952480	957180	Sure, philosophers can say, but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?
957180	960300	To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.
960300	963940	Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain and find a real thing to worry about.
963940	967640	It's just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and to trans
967640	972100	women, it's a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us are people
972100	973980	who are attracted to women.
973980	978500	Of the cis men I've been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight and
978500	982340	all had only ever been with cis women until this trans came along.
982340	987660	Am I really so powerful as a doctor that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over these tiny
987660	988660	tits?
988660	989660	Let's not get cocky.
989660	995820	I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman
995820	1000060	and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then he continues being
1000060	1004800	attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything but a straight man?
1004800	1008860	What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay?
1008860	1013260	Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious.
1013260	1014940	What about the penis?
1014940	1017620	Ah yes, the penis.
1017620	1020180	Look baby, we'll get to the penis, don't you worry about that.
1020180	1025180	But first, I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas,
1025180	1026460	because they got 5.
1026460	1027460	Vossage.
1027460	1034140	In fact, I've been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is, I make
1034140	1039060	too much money for Medicaid now, so I have to form an LLC, become my own employer so
1039060	1042660	I can give myself health benefits, and ugh, it's so much paperwork.
1042660	1045980	You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a fucking
1045980	1046980	c***t.
1046980	1051100	Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,
1051100	1053580	because a real vagina is a sacred passage.
1053580	1057820	And that's fine by me, what am I going to do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered
1057820	1058820	by the pope?
1058820	1059820	Pass.
1059820	1063540	Straight men don't get hung up on this, I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought
1063540	1067780	of a vagina as a sacred passage, they're either grossed out by it, or they're trying to climb
1067780	1068780	inside.
1068780	1072500	What I'm trying to say is, in the past I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina,
1072500	1077060	because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad, and besides, chicks with d***s are very in
1077060	1078060	right now.
1078060	1081780	Very 2019, very trending, and being a d*** girl, it's kind of like being a legendary
1081780	1083180	pokemon, you know?
1083180	1087020	People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn't that what we all want?
1087020	1092260	But unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery, because, well, guys can
1092260	1094260	I confess something kind of dark to you?
1094260	1101460	I have this really fucked up fetish, where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.
1101460	1102460	Crazy right?
1102460	1105460	I mean I like anal, but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.
1105460	1106460	Ew.
1106460	1107460	I don't want to eat well.
1107460	1110780	I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get d***ed, is that a crime?
1110780	1113420	It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks?
1113420	1115500	I'm afraid I have some bad news.
1115500	1120340	The tests are back and are showing that, in the medical terminology, your vagina does
1120340	1121460	indeed suck.
1121460	1125360	The point is, the easy sell version of the argument I'm making is that there's nothing
1125360	1129940	homosexual but a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.
1129940	1135260	She has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she's giving hair body face,
1135260	1137020	she's post-op and has a vagina.
1137020	1141060	Now even in this situation, people will still say it's gay because of the chromosomes.
1141060	1146100	But look, human beings have five senses, and none of them can detect chromosomes.
1146100	1150420	Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender, it's based on perception.
1150420	1154700	And if you're a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you're attracted to her as
1154700	1158220	a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment, my dude.
1158220	1159700	Congratulations, you're a breeder.
1159700	1164940	Now the argument people make is, okay fine, it's straight if you mistake her for a biological
1164940	1170580	woman, but if you know she's a man and you're still attracted, then it's gay.
1170580	1174620	So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with
1174620	1178340	your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and
1178340	1179780	your sexual response.
1179780	1184340	But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only if you
1184340	1188780	value your identity as a straight man, you'll feel ashamed of your attraction and you'll
1188780	1192700	try to fight and deny it, and you'll probably end up treating trans women like absolute
1192700	1193700	garbage.
1193700	1198900	If I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here, I would say trans women are a woman
1198900	1204220	because they identify as women, and so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction
1204220	1209380	to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing heterosexual attraction because of the way
1209380	1212420	the person he's attracted to identifies.
1212420	1216140	But that's just replacing the black and white thinking of a biology dogma with the black
1216140	1218260	and white thinking of an identity dogma.
1218260	1223420	But human sexuality is not black and white, it's not even shades of gray, it's a multicolor
1223420	1227660	acid trip, it's Centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.
1227660	1232540	So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it's not usually based on psychological
1232540	1233940	identity either.
1233940	1238420	Most of the time, initial attraction anyway is based on what I'd call presentation,
1238420	1239420	how you look and act.
1239420	1243100	And I think that's especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual
1243100	1244100	pop.
1244100	1245860	They see, they conquer, they come.
1245860	1248100	I mean you have to admire the simplicity of it.
1248100	1250300	Sometimes I wish I were a man.
1250340	1255260	So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans
1255260	1256260	women who pop.
1256260	1259820	Maybe you don't think I pop, but you'd be hard pressed to argue that any number of
1259820	1263900	trans models and actresses don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.
1263900	1266980	So the pop is undeniable, no one's questioning the pop.
1266980	1270860	In fact without the pop it never would have occurred to men to call trans women traps,
1270860	1274700	because they wouldn't be trapped if they weren't attracted in the first place.
1274700	1279060	But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans woman,
1279060	1283620	is some kind of illusion or facade that at some point will be dropped, revealing that
1283620	1286220	our womanhood is a sham and that we're really men.
1286220	1290120	Now, here's a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.
1290120	1294740	If you date a cis drag queen, at some point you're getting a man honey, as explained
1294740	1297180	by the only good YouTuber Jasmine Masters.
1297180	1301020	I don't want to date nobody who want to date me like this because this comes off and you're
1301020	1303740	not doing nothing with this.
1303740	1308180	But if you date me, there's no de-dragging, there's no moment where I become a man.
1308180	1310740	But baby what you see is what you got.
1310740	1315500	At least on this side, this is my natural side, and this is my biological side.
1315500	1318740	When we're discussing people who are trans, we immediately scan the first paragraph trans
1318740	1323060	woman and then repurchase it by their biological pronoun because biology is the nature of the
1323060	1324060	pronoun, so.
1324060	1328020	Everyone's always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine, so why
1328020	1330820	do you think that in the bedroom we'd be any other way?
1330820	1334380	Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what
1334380	1335660	it does for trans women.
1335660	1340980	It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts.
1340980	1344620	That's right, these are my very real, very biological titties.
1344620	1348140	I mean I'm wearing a pushup bra, but at least there's something to push up now.
1348140	1350140	Here I'll show you.
1350140	1355260	I mean they're small, but it's not by any measure a male chest, and what I have is very
1355260	1358820	real, very biological, and very female.
1358820	1361740	You people think everything to do with trans women is fake.
1361740	1363980	Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair.
1363980	1367980	Now that's prejudice more than observation, like I've noticed that whether or not I actually
1367980	1373180	wear a wig in a video has exactly zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man
1373180	1374180	in a wig.
1374180	1377260	So I may as well just wear wigs, and I may as well get my boobs done too since people
1377260	1381260	are gonna call them fake either way, but for what it's worth this is my real hair, at least
1381260	1386380	on this half, and these are my real boobs, and if I bring home a gentleman, or a lady,
1386380	1389540	all that stays on in bed and it's there when I wake up in the morning.
1389540	1391100	But what about the penis?
1391100	1392740	Oh right, oh right.
1392740	1395620	Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?
1395620	1396620	I rest my case.
1396620	1397620	Roll credits.
1397620	1398620	6.
1398620	1408460	The Feminine Penis Look, some guys want the T's and the D, and
1408460	1409460	that's the D.
1409460	1414060	Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a lady dick, makes any sexual
1414060	1415900	interaction with a man gay.
1415900	1422660	But isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men, and not merely to penis
1422980	1424220	wherever they may arise?
1424220	1429940	I think there probably are some gay men who really just like dick, and I'm not judging,
1429940	1434300	I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences, but being a straight man, I don't really
1434300	1438140	think that's best understood as a man attracted to vaginas.
1438140	1442620	You call women pussy, but then you're always like, ew, periods, I'm a straight man, I'm
1442620	1446220	not used to putting a towel down when I fuck, I don't know how to use a condom because I
1446220	1450380	expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me, and then you have straight
1450380	1455660	incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust,
1455660	1459420	I mean if you're gonna date cis women or post-op trans women, I think you owe it to
1459420	1461820	them to be a little more vagina positive.
1461820	1464820	Because even those straight men are like, ew, dicks, that's gay.
1464820	1466980	You guys also kinda love dicks?
1466980	1468260	You're always drawing them?
1468260	1469940	Your buildings look like dicks?
1469940	1471620	Your porn all has dicks in it?
1471620	1473220	So what about dicks on chicks?
1473220	1477260	Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what's the problem, officer?
1477260	1480580	I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn speaks for itself.
1480580	1485940	On Pornhub, the she-male category contains more videos than other such popular categories
1485940	1490940	as rough sex, orgy, and webcam, and it's mostly straight men who watch it.
1490940	1495620	When adultempire.com moved their T-girl content from their gay site to their straight site,
1495620	1496620	views increased 50%.
1496620	1501860	In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom
1501860	1507260	bill, the adult site Gamelink's top-selling titles in North Carolina were My Trans Sexual
1507260	1512700	Teacher, She-male shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Trans Visions 6.
1512700	1517380	A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which isn't great
1517380	1522860	since most T-girl porn is not trans positive and uses dehumanizing slurs like she-male
1522860	1526540	and tranny, which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk
1526540	1529060	off to you but won't give you rights.
1529060	1532180	So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.
1532180	1534420	She-males, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.
1534420	1536340	Great, I love that for us.
1536340	1540580	Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick, and
1540580	1541580	you know what?
1541580	1542740	That's fine.
1542740	1546740	Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.
1546740	1547740	You like what you like.
1547740	1549620	I'm not here to police anyone's desires.
1549620	1551020	In fact, quite the opposite.
1551020	1556300	I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society's cruel and unjust prejudice
1556300	1558140	against their T-girl-loving ways.
1558140	1560540	But liberation begins with understanding.
1560540	1562820	So who are the men who love trans girls?
1562820	1566900	Well, according to trans women I've talked to in my own personal experience, the men
1566900	1570140	who date us can be divided into three general groups.
1570140	1575340	Group 1 are men who, to be honest, are actually kind of put off by the dick, but they're
1575340	1579540	so attracted to the woman it's attached to that they're willing to work around it or
1579540	1582220	wait for it to grow on them.
1583180	1587540	Group 2 are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don't
1587540	1592260	specifically fetishize the penis, so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover had genital
1592260	1594020	reassignment and got a vagina.
1594020	1598740	And then Group 3 are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want
1598740	1601260	to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.
1601260	1604500	Now Group 3 are what the trans community calls chasers.
1604500	1609180	Dating chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing
1609180	1613300	our genitals, which is often the part of us that we're most uncomfortable with.
1613300	1617340	So if you're a T-girl who likes men, Group 2 is really Goldilocks perfection unless
1617340	1619780	you really like topping or you've had the surgery.
1619780	1624100	Now I should say that Group 2 does include some bisexual men, and bisexual people of
1624100	1626740	either gender can be great partners if you're trans.
1626740	1629860	You like girls, you like dick, I'm a girl with a dick.
1629860	1630860	Let's make this happen.
1630860	1634820	That said, if someone views that part of me as male and wants me to do with it what men
1634820	1636580	do with it, then pass.
1636580	1637580	Not interested.
1637740	1642460	You might be wondering, what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?
1642460	1644540	How could I view it as anything other than a male part?
1644540	1645780	It's a fucking penis!
1645780	1647420	Well, I'm glad you asked.
1647420	1652900	I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.
1652900	1655940	You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.
1655940	1658620	Context, usage, and physiology.
1658620	1662980	So first, context, picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.
1662980	1664940	Now picture her with a penis.
1664940	1667900	That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.
1667900	1670740	It's feminine because of the context that it's in.
1670740	1672260	Second, usage.
1672260	1674420	A lesson in penis etiquette.
1674420	1677900	A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.
1677900	1682260	He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get
1682260	1686380	on your knees like a good girl and f***.
1686380	1693780	Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes
1693780	1694780	her penis.
1694780	1699620	When she rises from the bath, she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when
1699620	1703260	not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.
1703260	1706260	Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.
1706260	1710860	The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.
1710860	1714700	This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character.
1714700	1721500	Next, you want to take not one but two pairs of cotton-lined polyspandex bikini-cut panties
1721500	1726020	at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs.
1726020	1729900	Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.
1729900	1733500	You're going to take your claw, and you're going to grab your scrotum, and you're going
1733500	1736380	to yank that bubblegum back into your page crease.
1736380	1741220	Now hold it back with one hand, and with your other hand, push your penis back, pressing
1741220	1743900	those little legs up into your pelvis.
1743900	1748060	Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place, and then pull your panties up.
1748060	1752580	Down first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing's seeping out the
1752580	1756860	sides, and then voila, it's like it was never there.
1756860	1761060	For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new forward
1761060	1762900	by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.
1762900	1767300	I've now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us
1767300	1769140	now turn to physiology.
1769140	1773340	Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and
1773340	1777660	functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down, and softening everything
1777660	1778660	up.
1778660	1783260	That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something
1783260	1788020	I've been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,
1788020	1793540	really get people talking about seven, the mouthfeel.
1793540	1801180	Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Wynn.
1801180	1803340	You're tasting specialists.
1803340	1812500	I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex, girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,
1812500	1816820	and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.
1816820	1820900	But today, we amuse the palette with the feminine penis.
1820900	1826860	Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine
1826860	1835300	penis, and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami.
1835300	1840860	With respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the
1840860	1844380	masculine penis, and does not become as turgid.
1844380	1851820	And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes
1851820	1857860	of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.
1857860	1866020	It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.
1866020	1869020	Cheers.
1869020	1875140	8.
1875140	1877260	Being straight is pretty gay.
1877260	1881860	We've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,
1881860	1886980	you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with
1886980	1889180	a trans woman is sex with a woman.
1889180	1893860	Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.
1893860	1897980	Sexuality is complicated, and while it's undeniable that many straight men are attracted
1897980	1903580	to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men are also attracted to
1903580	1905300	male cross-stressors.
1905300	1909300	Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super-womanly either,
1909300	1913300	like fully Dr. Frankenfurter, and that's why I'm so iconic.
1913300	1918340	I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter
1918340	1922020	to a very real, very biological drag queen.
1922020	1927900	But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got semi-regular messages from men
1927900	1933340	being like, so I'm a straight man, but I'm like really attracted to you when you dress
1933340	1937620	as a woman, and it's really making me question my sexuality.
1937620	1941580	Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men
1941580	1946420	just picked up a my inherently womanly female energy essence that I've always had since
1946420	1951460	I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-stressing baby.
1951460	1955460	But let's be real, there are straight men who fuck cross-stressors, there are straight
1955460	1961140	men who fuck drag queens, there are straight identifying men, who fuck other straight identifying
1961140	1962140	men.
1962140	1963140	What is going on here?
1963140	1964140	Man, what is your deal?
1964140	1965140	Who are you?
1965140	1966140	What is your life?
1966140	1967140	How did she become straight?
1967140	1968140	Did they recruit you?
1968140	1969140	Were you groomed?
1969140	1970980	I blame the parents.
1970980	1974380	Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call Is This Gay?
1974380	1979380	The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that there's sex acts between people
1979380	1980380	of the same gender.
1980380	1984820	But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's
1984820	1988660	gay, or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.
1988660	1993500	To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman leave sucking Adam's nipples,
1993500	1996020	and according to these men, it's totally gay.
1996020	2001180	What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a
2001180	2002180	man and a woman.
2002180	2006540	It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who
2006540	2008380	are playing the correct roles.
2008380	2012640	So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according
2012640	2017060	to this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight.
2017060	2021420	Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.
2021420	2026540	For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary
2026540	2031580	twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.
2031580	2034900	I mean, to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.
2034900	2035900	Now I'm a cheerleader.
2035900	2039820	D-I-C-T-R-O-Y, don't tell the coach I was a guy.
2039820	2044460	This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me
2044460	2049300	of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.
2049300	2053240	Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must
2053240	2057900	be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck
2057900	2061680	and what you can eat, so for example, religious dietary laws.
2061680	2067640	I think this hypermasculine heteroman code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of
2067640	2072900	kosher law governing straightness, and the is-this-gay game is its theology.
2072900	2076980	Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by,
2076980	2079300	of all people, Count D'Ancula.
2079300	2084660	If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're
2084660	2087420	touching a dick, and that's gay.
2087420	2090340	Well-memed, my lord, well-memed.
2090340	2094620	The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when D'Ancula concludes that since
2094620	2100300	a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore
2100300	2104300	having sex with a woman is pretty gay.
2104300	2109220	Obviously this is shitposting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps are gay
2109220	2110820	because chromosomes.
2110820	2115140	So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.
2115140	2117300	So what is being gay?
2117300	2118300	Socrates.
2118300	2119300	Mmm.
2119300	2122300	On second thought, I don't know her.
2122300	2123300	9.
2123300	2125580	Being gay is good actually.
2125580	2129060	Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's
2129060	2132540	good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the
2132540	2133540	first place?
2133540	2136820	Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?
2136820	2141660	It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with
2141660	2145420	manhood and they defend their manhood at all costs.
2145420	2149780	Now men, this might be difficult to hear and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,
2149780	2154380	but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting
2154380	2156860	trans women, and it's hurting gay people.
2156860	2159500	For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.
2159500	2163780	Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even
2163780	2165580	enjoy his own body?
2165580	2168380	Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.
2168380	2170820	Being pegged does not make you gay.
2170820	2175260	Sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay.
2175260	2176260	And why?
2176260	2181540	Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is
2181540	2184740	persistently attracted to people of the same gender.
2184740	2188500	If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with
2188500	2190860	the word gay, then you're gay.
2190860	2194580	If not, then you're not, and nothing you can do will change that.
2194580	2198820	So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is
2198820	2199820	good actually.
2199820	2203500	I mean why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?
2203500	2209660	Now I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense, we the gays, but as
2209660	2215460	a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight men
2215460	2219260	are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.
2219260	2223780	But that is not a wound I'm going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me
2223780	2227860	to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.
2227860	2228860	Are traps gay?
2228860	2230740	Baby, who cares?
2230740	2232700	Just so it feels good.
2232700	2236940	That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say traps are gay but there's
2236940	2241580	nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men
2241580	2247220	and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact
2247220	2248860	most attracted to us.
2248860	2252860	Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.
2252860	2257340	And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted
2257340	2259940	to us are willing to openly date us.
2259940	2261980	And the stigma is very real.
2261980	2267020	A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.
2267020	2271620	Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they
2271620	2277180	experience in short a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.
2277180	2282700	But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices
2282700	2283940	control his life.
2283940	2289820	A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.
2289900	2295980	A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.
2295980	2303780	And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a
2303780	2305420	man than you.
2314300	2315100	10.
2315100	2316940	I have feelings too.
2317260	2323620	Well, I guess today we learned that our trap's gay is not a debate worth winning, because
2323620	2328780	just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the
2328780	2331180	bigoted assumptions it relies on.
2331180	2335460	Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is
2335460	2337820	deserved, hashtag not all gamers.
2337820	2342060	But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.
2342060	2347060	And I have feelings too, god damn it, and some of those feelings are not all that different
2347060	2349300	from the anxieties men have.
2349300	2352020	Let me explain.
2352020	2353020	Let me explain.
2353020	2357940	So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology
2357940	2359900	for a confused slutbag.
2359900	2364580	Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lispicious and lesbianical
2364580	2369780	feelings, but early on in my transition, I encountered a lot of turf shit, and it really
2369780	2372660	scared me off dating cis lesbians, which I never have.
2372660	2376700	Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back
2376700	2382500	of my head for a long time, but about a year ago I was like, I want to fuck men.
2382500	2384220	I want to fuck men.
2384220	2388260	But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.
2388260	2392460	Because men are scary, and in my early transition I'd only dated bisexual trans people and
2392460	2396740	enbies, and as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.
2396740	2400020	A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.
2400020	2403620	That teaches you something about gender, it might be hard to learn otherwise.
2403620	2409580	And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real
2409580	2415340	woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as the radiant model
2415340	2419300	of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.
2419300	2423660	And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing
2423660	2424660	out.
2424660	2428140	What I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group
2428140	2432140	of people to date when you're early in transition, because they're pretty chill about anatomy
2432140	2433140	and presentation.
2433140	2436940	But if you're going to date cis-head men, you need to be serving women.
2436940	2441140	And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt, and I did wonder if I was woman enough
2441140	2442140	for it.
2442140	2446020	So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is
2446020	2448260	he going to think I'm a man?
2448260	2452500	Basically my anxiety was our crap's gay, but what I ended up doing is just working up
2452500	2453500	to things gradually.
2453820	2455940	And of course, you start by sucking dick.
2455940	2461220	That's very safe, because like, what red-blooded man is going to turn down a T-girl blowjob?
2461220	2463420	And it doesn't involve my junk in any way.
2463420	2467740	Then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned
2467740	2472540	we'd been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between
2472540	2476540	a man and a woman, like, that shit is super hot.
2476540	2480380	Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on
2480620	2485100	me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man, what if
2485100	2486100	he's repulsed?
2486100	2489500	Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?
2489500	2491340	The answer is yes.
2491340	2493660	It was so hot.
2493660	2498460	I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would
2498460	2500460	just say it's special.
2500460	2503340	10 out of 10.
2503340	2504780	And you know what he told me after?
2504780	2508780	He told me he liked the mouth feel.
2508780	2511340	Women's talking about it now, bitches.
2511340	2516540	So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,
2516540	2521420	because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction, but I do want to shame men for
2521420	2526540	treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets, and I do want to shame men for dehumanizing
2526540	2530980	us and voting away our rights by day while jerking off to she-mail porn by night, and
2530980	2535500	I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong enough
2535500	2540300	to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every
2540300	2545260	moment of every day, and I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends
2545260	2549580	because they couldn't stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.
2549580	2551180	That is pathetic.
2551180	2555500	If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up
2555500	2558820	for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.
2558820	2561940	So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.
2561940	2563780	Don't call human beings traps.
2563780	2566700	If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.
2566700	2570620	It's okay, you can date us, we're more than just jack off material.
2570620	2574220	If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.
2574220	2578100	If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because god knows she's been through
2578100	2583660	enough shit, and finally, protect trans women of color at all costs.
2583660	2588860	All you want here is basic human decency, is that really too much to ask?
2588860	2593060	Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.
2594780	2596220	God damn it.
2603100	2606700	Well, that was long.
2606700	2614220	I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful
2614220	2615580	woman's penis.
2624780	2634460	You must think that you're so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware
2634460	2640460	of how cruel, hurt, before, bigoted and plain rude.
2640460	2644060	All the things that you say come up every day.
2644060	2651060	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.
2651060	2658060	It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.
2672060	2679060	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.
2680060	2687060	It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.
2688060	2691060	Don't let them define us.
