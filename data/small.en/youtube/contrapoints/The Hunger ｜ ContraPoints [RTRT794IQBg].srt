00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
The following program is a work of fiction created for educational, artistic, and harm

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,520
reduction purposes, in compliance with the video corp Charms of Service.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,760
I love the rules.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,720
Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,760
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,760
T.S. Natalie Wynn.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
War.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
What is it good for?

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Absolutely.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Quad.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Sam.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Everything.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,040
According to the National Institute for Strategic American Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,840
Commerce Policy Research.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Hi.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm Jackie Jackson.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,880
You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
It only matters that you say.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,560
We don't discriminate here between what is true or false or even downright dangerous.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,720
That's none of my business.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,600
It's none of America's business.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,160
The important thing is that you never stop talking.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,040
Because that's what freedom is all about.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,080
Tonight, the war on drugs.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,600
How do we get these goddamn junkies off the streets?

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,880
My first guest is Justine Tableau, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,480
Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,080
The editor chooses the title.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
I didn't choose the title.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,680
And my second guest is Virginia Lamb, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Virginia, let's begin with you.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,120
Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,600
Fentivoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
minds on hype.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,680
The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
How have we reached this point?

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,760
Two words, Jackie.

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,000
Sexual anarchy.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Let that sink in.

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Let what sink in?

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Sexual anarchy?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
What does that even mean?

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,800
Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,880
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,560
aimless fornication.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,000
They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,080
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, global homo

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,640
pomo nomo.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,520
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,320
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,120
The Christian majority.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,480
Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,240
Of course, Jackie.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Religious liberties are under attack.

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,220
We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in

56
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,240
public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,920
bathrooms and drag queens' story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
power of the precious blood of the lamb.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm sorry that you feel offended by it.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,160
If it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever twisted

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,680
necromancy these people think is Christianity.

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,400
And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
Parents get no say anymore.

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,680
They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
in schools.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,440
You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,600
What's the real agenda here?

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Sexual indoctrination.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,360
This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,320
remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
or worse, Episcopalians.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
No.

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,480
No, I won't stand for that.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
What does this have to do with drugs?

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
No.

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Everything.

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
Addiction and sexual brokenness.

81
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,380
These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.

82
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,280
Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
Is anyone going to ask me what I think?

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
hate preacher?

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,240
Well, God has nothing to do with hate.

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
Christ is the definition of love.

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia.

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm talking about you.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,640
Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,920
You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Exactly.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,800
Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm, rational conversation

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,120
with people who have different opinions?

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Okay.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,440
Well, let's see how that goes.

97
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
and protect the rights of children.

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,320
therapy that will make them whole again.

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,760
Reparative therapy?

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,400
You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

103
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,920
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,200
and polluted and they need God to make them whole.

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,960
You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.

106
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
Are you cancel culturing me right now?

107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,760
Oh my God, she's totally cancel culturing you right now.

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Are you thought policing me?

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
No.

110
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm trying to stop you from thought policing everyone else.

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,800
You're saying it should be a thought crime?

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,520
You're saying that I am a thought criminal just because I happen to believe in the traditional

113
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,680
biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman who form a covenant before

114
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,760
God who gave his only begotten son to watch away the sins of the world when he died on

115
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,200
the cross and was resurrected three days later, all glory to his name.

116
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,520
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,880
And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,120
anything anymore.

119
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,240
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,280
You know who's really being silenced?

121
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,840
People who are silent.

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,080
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,520
That's what being silenced means.

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
So who's really being silenced?

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Not people on podcasts.

126
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
they are.

128
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
No.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,880
The people who are silenced are people we never hear from because, and I really can't

130
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,960
emphasize this enough, they are silenced.

131
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,600
People in prison, queer teenagers in conservative towns, the actual downtrodden and oppressed

132
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,080
people of this country.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,800
Not you, Miss America.

134
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,920
Not you, Mother Superior.

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,720
You're not silenced.

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,440
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,200
So you defend your right to say it.

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the N-word?

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,440
Why do you want to say the N-word?

140
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,000
So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,240
God damn it, Jackie.

142
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,600
That sounds a little bit like being silenced.

143
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
She's stonewalling me.

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,360
All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain

145
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,000
that there's certain words they just can't say.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Because of the color of their skin, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Would he?

148
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,080
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.

149
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the Gospel?

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
That's not the topic.

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,640
I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

152
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

153
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,440
You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the Pride Parade, doing all this

154
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,600
sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,

155
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,200
I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging, and

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I feel for them.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I really do.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,840
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.

159
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,920
You know, what you people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate, but all

160
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
you're really doing is calling in to question the worthiness of other people's lives.

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,840
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,200
they know.

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,160
But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

166
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,040
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down to the intimidation tactics

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,520
of the secular ruling elite.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,000
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore, that we're all supposed to

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their queer ideology, which says

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,600
that if your child comes home from school and announces she's a different gender this

172
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,160
week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife.

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,840
Slicing up tiny little children's bodies.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,400
That's where this is headed.

175
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
The Shrine of Moloch.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,960
Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies.

177
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you talking about?

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,440
You absolute lunatic.

179
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,360
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should

180
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,760
let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,560
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

182
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,920
Or should I say, Justin?

183
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
Oh come on!

184
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Really?

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Alright, we're doing this.

186
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

187
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

188
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fuck.

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Well, don't mind if I do.

190
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

191
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Good Virginia tobacco.

192
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Jackie, the Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sailor use of cigarettes, vaporizers,

193
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.

194
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Some restrictions apply, results may vary.

195
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Excuse me, Jackie.

196
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm really not comfortable with this.

197
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today.

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
And I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.

200
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,

201
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

202
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Excuse me?

203
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,760
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

204
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm a libertarian, and even goes baby USA.

205
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

206
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a free-for-all.

207
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
And now, here we are.

208
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

209
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,760
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden,

210
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,760
and Kaden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.

211
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.

212
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,760
And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

213
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
And that's the real agenda here.

214
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,760
These people want to lower the age of consent and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,

215
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.

216
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it, why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses back to the nunnery in old Missouri?

217
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Do they not have demons to slay in the backcountry?

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness.

219
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
For the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.

220
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.

221
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
We're living in Orwell's nightmare, but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.

222
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Amazing.

223
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room

224
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
and have a respectful conversation.

225
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Cheers to us.

226
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Is it great?

227
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
You know, I don't think it's that great.

228
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
And I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you sitting here

229
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,760
interrogating the morality of queer people.

230
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Something you know absolutely nothing about.

231
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Oh, I know more than you might think.

232
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I used to be a homosexual.

233
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
You what?

234
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
No, I'm not doing this today.

235
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
You used to be a homosexual?

237
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
That's right, Jackie.

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Before I was saved, here we go.

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
I used to be a lesbian.

240
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
That's who I thought I was.

241
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I lived that lifestyle.

242
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You used to be a lesbian.

243
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Okay.

244
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Name five things you love about men.

245
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
This should be good.

246
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Gather around, everyone.

247
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Let's all witness the power of Christ.

248
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm sure this will be very convincing.

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.

250
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
He commands me to be holy.

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Fear not.

252
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
You will no longer live in shame.

253
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
For your creator will be your husband.

254
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Okay.

255
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Well, if you want to be the bride of Christ, then by all means,

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
but, you know, keep it in the bedroom.

257
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle on everyone's face.

258
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Virginia, I'm confused.

259
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I thought people are just born that way.

260
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Like, Jesus can't change that.

261
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Jackie, the mainstream media establishment doesn't want you to know

262
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,760
that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative.

263
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,760
But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.

264
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,760
The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.

265
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
But what if every addict said, well, I'm just a junkie.

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
That's who I am.

267
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.

268
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Well, that's a good point.

269
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Uh, no, it isn't.

270
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Gay is just a feeling.

271
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Homosexual lust, same-sex temptation.

272
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,760
That's a feeling, not an identity.

273
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Like, maybe you struggle with wrath, but you don't identify as wrathful.

274
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
I want to punch you in the face.

276
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
And yet, you haven't punched me.

277
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,760
When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,

279
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,760
and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.

280
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
My old self has been crucified with Christ.

281
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,760
It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.

282
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,760
But before I made God Lord of my desires, I was controlled by sin.

283
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
By drugs.

284
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
By alcohol.

285
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
By homosexuality.

286
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,760
So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.

287
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Wow, behold the power of Christ.

288
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,760
You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?

289
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Yes, I do.

290
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
It's pretty cool.

291
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.

292
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Is this a joke to you?

293
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Do you find this humorous?

294
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Yeah, I don't.

295
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,

296
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,760
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin.

297
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Away from God, shut out from grace,

298
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,760
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.

299
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.

300
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?

301
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?

302
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
That's right, Jackie.

303
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
What were you addicted to?

304
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Miracle whip?

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Veggie tails?

306
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Communion wafers, maybe?

307
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
No.

308
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
I was addicted to alcohol?

309
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
To pornography?

310
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
To lusting after women?

311
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
And to hype?

312
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Hype?

313
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?

314
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?

315
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Because I am intrigued.

316
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Jackie, I would love to testify.

317
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,760
You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.

318
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Girl, not this.

319
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
When I left home, I was lost.

320
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I was a wretch.

321
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
I was on fire.

322
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
And I rebuked that fire.

323
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I used foul language.

324
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
I went out clubbing.

325
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I cut my hair off.

326
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I gained weight.

327
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,760
I was tempted by same-sex attraction.

328
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?

329
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
I was always a little more masculine.

330
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.

331
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
I used to shoot up testosterone.

332
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
That's why my voice is a little lower.

333
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same, honestly.

334
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
If I didn't know, I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.

335
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.

336
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Though, if anything, this one's the man.

337
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
He's the one injecting testosterone.

338
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
God has healed the feminine within me.

339
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
All along, God was tugging at my heart.

340
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,760
But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.

341
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,760
I felt a terrible void inside.

342
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I lived in the flesh.

343
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I lived in sin with another woman, hoping to satisfy that hunger.

344
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Here we go.

345
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
When I gazed upon her beauty, I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.

346
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,760
But the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own wickedness.

347
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
I knew that lifestyle was wrong.

348
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
But I couldn't quit.

349
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Until she broke my heart.

350
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
And then...

351
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
I was cast into the outer darkness.

352
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.

353
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
It was like a part of me was ripped away.

354
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
And I was left to face my brokenness alone.

355
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Well, was she a Capricorn?

356
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
No, a Sagittarius.

357
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Well, there's your problem.

358
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Next time, maybe try a water sign.

359
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Stop interrupting.

360
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm living for the drama.

361
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Jackie, I was alone.

362
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
I was suicidal.

363
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I was an addict.

364
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
I was lost.

365
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.

366
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,760
And I was surrounded by these women singing.

367
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
What can wash away my sin?

368
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,760
What can make me whole again?

369
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Nothing but the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow.

370
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,760
And I felt this tingling all over my body.

371
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,760
And I knew I was hearing the voice of God for the very first time.

372
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Not just the words of the hymn, but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.

373
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Yes, we all like music.

374
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
And suddenly my pain made sense.

375
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I don't have to live this way anymore.

376
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,760
In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.

377
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I was cleansed.

378
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
I was healed.

379
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
I was delivered.

380
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
I was sanctified.

381
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
I was redeemed.

382
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
My guilty stains were washed away.

383
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
And I exchanged my brokenness and pain for His loving grace.

384
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Okay, so I'm confused.

385
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Do you eat dick now?

386
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
What's your deal?

387
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room with a repentant heart

388
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,760
and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.

389
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,760
When I found Jesus, I found someone who truly loves me.

390
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,760
And through obedience to Him, my identity is no longer in my attractions.

391
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
But in Christ.

392
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
You know what I think, Virginia?

393
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I think that you are immoderate in love and immoderate with substances.

394
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,760
And so you need an imaginary Father figure to make all the rules

395
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
because you can't control yourself.

396
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else

397
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,760
should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.

398
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Mental infancy?

399
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.

400
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I know, Justin, the chains of sin.

401
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh, the itch, the ache, the shame.

402
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
I lived in mud.

403
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I lived in filth.

404
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,

405
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,760
the great whirlwind that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain.

406
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,760
But my shame was hammered to the cross for those who belong to Christ,

407
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,760
how crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

408
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?

409
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?

410
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
God?

411
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I really don't think He cares, Gorge.

412
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Celipacy is not a good deed.

413
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,760
To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay

414
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
and you hate yourself.

415
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

416
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self?

417
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Where is my nail?

418
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Is it hate to be anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation?

419
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Damn it.

420
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,760
To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity of who God made me?

421
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole

422
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit?

423
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Have you been made whole, Virginia?

424
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Because to me, it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul

425
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
and you call it sin and shame.

426
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.

427
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrado?

428
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
She's hilarious. She's a witch.

429
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
We are all half angel and half beast.

430
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
The flesh must die so the spirit may live.

431
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

432
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Have you really wandered so far as stray?

433
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom

434
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,760
that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?

435
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

436
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,760
What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding

437
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,760
of human sexuality and you're on a save-the-children-type

438
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,760
moral crusade because you lack the adult capacity

439
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
to face the demons in your own head.

440
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,760
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.

441
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Well, what even is that, Virginia?

442
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I want specifics.

443
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're going to do

444
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,760
if Jesus stops holding your hand for ten minutes?

445
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
What?

446
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
You think you're going to rail a line of hype off a stripper's tits?

447
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Excuse me?

448
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Answer this.

449
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
What do you think erotic love is a desire for?

450
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Wait, I know this one.

451
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Sex.

452
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
No, that's too easy.

453
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.

454
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,760
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,

455
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,760
to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,

456
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,760
to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive.

457
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Love is not the flesh.

458
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
It's not temptation.

459
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.

460
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
It's nothing like being an alcoholic.

461
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,760
It's not a craving.

462
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,760
It's a yearning.

463
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,760
The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.

464
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,760
But you people don't understand that because you are vulgarians.

465
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
You have no sense of humanity, and you have no sense of the erotic.

466
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal, Marxist bullcrap.

467
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Jackie, your brain is so small.

468
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
It's just so tiny.

469
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Look at me.

470
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
You're a dum-dum, okay?

471
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
And I'm going to need you to stop talking.

472
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,760
As usual, the cancel culture woke Stoppo is trying to silence me.

473
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Shh, Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time,

474
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,760
because you're so stupid, and I can't stand it anymore.

475
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
So shut up.

476
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm giving you the plague, liberal.

477
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay, well, I hope it kills me, because I'm done.

478
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
See, I'll never get sick, because every day,

479
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.

480
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Doctors don't want you to know about it.

481
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I could not possibly be more done.

482
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
You may be done, but I'm not.

483
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Well, you people never are, are you?

484
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
You want to talk about yearning?

485
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
I mean, I get it.

486
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I used to live in shame.

487
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.

488
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Yes, we've all noticed.

489
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Let me tell you, it is not freedom, it is bondage.

490
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,760
You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.

491
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
The flesh possesses you.

492
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave,

493
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
for the wages of sin is death,

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,760
but the gift of God is eternal life and Christ Jesus our Lord.

495
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?

496
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.

497
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Only he can fill the void.

498
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
I know.

499
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I used to be like you, Justin.

500
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I was lost.

501
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I was blind.

502
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
I was confused in my identity.

503
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
I used to reject the gospel,

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
until my sin took everything from me,

505
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
and I needed a savior.

506
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,760
And then, I called out to God for salvation,

507
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,760
and he came to me as a loving father.

508
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
It's not too late for you, Justin.

509
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
You are so loved.

510
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
God loves you.

511
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
But this?

512
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
This is not God's intent for you.

513
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,760
It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent,

514
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
the height of cosmological narcissism.

515
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?

516
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Have we run out of fedoras in America?

517
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.

518
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,760
I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

519
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
God is love.

520
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Is he?

521
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
The only love worth having.

522
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
What you call love.

523
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
The sin I used to live in.

524
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
The world, the flesh, and the devil.

525
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,760
That only ever brought me pain.

526
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Yes, because heartbreak is painful.

527
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Love is painful.

528
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,760
The poets are unanimous.

529
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.

530
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Eros, giver of pain.

531
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
What's Sappho?

532
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
A pagan pornographer.

533
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.

534
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,

535
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
then God damn it.

536
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
I don't know who can.

537
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Well, God for one.

538
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
God has a sexual plan for all of us.

539
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
That's odd.

540
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,760
God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.

541
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Men's and women's bodies fit together

542
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
for the purpose of creating children.

543
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?

544
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by, even in this economy.

545
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You have a guy?

546
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
A semen guy?

547
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
That's just most guys.

548
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,

549
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,760
but since I'm among heathens, clearly,

550
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,760
I will do my best to argue not from faith, but from reason.

551
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
I love reason.

552
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Do you?

553
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Tell me this, Justin.

554
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Which is better?

555
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
A love that is eternal?

556
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?

557
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm sorry your girlfriend left you.

558
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
That must have been really hard.

559
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Just to answer the question.

560
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

561
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.

562
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Isn't a love that is eternal, superior to a love that is fleeting?

563
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes, Socrates, it is certain.

564
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
And don't you yearn?

565
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Not just for a love in the moment,

566
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,760
but for a love that lasts eternity?

567
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Yes, Socrates, that is evident.

568
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,760
And isn't eternal love what we call God?

569
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

570
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,760
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

571
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Hmm.

572
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,760
So you have no argument.

573
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Do I really need an argument?

574
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
This is just a semantic trick.

575
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
You're saying that God is eternal love,

576
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,760
and then magically that must exist because

577
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
you defined it that way.

578
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,760
So you don't have an argument?

579
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Interesting.

581
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism

582
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
with a five-alarm lesbo cosplaying as a tradwife.

583
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
I'm supposed to take this seriously?

584
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Why?

585
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Why am I even here?

586
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
What am I doing?

587
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Why am I talking to these people?

588
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,760
I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

589
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,760
I don't think God leads people to podcasts.

590
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

591
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,760
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.

592
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,760
There's a hunger in your soul.

593
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,760
No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.

594
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Do not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land.

595
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.

596
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

597
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
If I may quote Psalm 63, please don't.

598
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
You, God, oh my God, earnestly I seek you.

599
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,760
I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you,

600
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,760
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

601
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Because your love is better than life,

602
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
my lips will glorify you.

603
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I will praise you as long as I live,

604
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,760
and in your name I will raise up my hands.

605
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,760
I will be fully satisfied, as in the richest of foods,

606
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,760
with singing lips my mouth will praise you.

607
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Virginia, go to therapy.

608
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.

609
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
You're the one who needs to go to therapy.

610
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
No, you go to therapy.

611
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
I'll pray for you.

612
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
I'll pray for you.

613
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
I will pray straight to Satan.

614
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little looney toons?

615
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
You have your Jesus bullshit.

616
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
You have your gender nonsense.

617
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,760
And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

618
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
The free market, right.

619
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,760
We all have our little delusions.

620
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
The important thing is that we cling to them,

621
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,760
and we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way.

622
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Because that's what makes us free.

623
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
And freedom is what makes America great.

624
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Other countries, they don't have choices.

625
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,760
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.

626
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
So can we do drugs?

627
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
No, that's illegal.

628
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I thought you said we could choose.

629
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Yes, but we have to make the right choices.

630
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
And what if we want to make the wrong choices?

631
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.

632
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,760
You will be locked in a tiny cage.

633
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
That is literally the opposite of freedom.

634
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Well, we have to be tough on crime.

635
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
It's the only way to keep this country free.

636
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
We have to build more prisons.

637
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?

638
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Well, Father decides.

639
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Father always decides.

640
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,760
And do you always do what Father says?

641
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Of course.

642
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
We always do what Father says.

643
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Why?

644
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Because Father says so.

645
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?

646
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.

647
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Yes, you do.

648
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.

649
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
No, I'm not.

650
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.

651
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
My heart was also broken by a woman.

652
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I thought she was a cat girl.

653
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
She turned out to be a fuckboy.

654
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,760
You are a straight man.

655
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
I mean, at this point, I wish.

656
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,760
But no, definitely a gay woman.

657
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
We're all stuck with it.

658
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Hold on.

659
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,760
So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.

660
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?

661
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
No.

662
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
In the mirror?

663
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,760
No, because I'm not a fucking animal.

664
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,760
I can't tell the difference between my own reflection and a different person.

665
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Desire is always for something that you lack.

666
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,760
You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.

667
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Desire feeds on absence.

668
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
It reaches out across a void.

669
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
I don't know.

670
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,760
I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

671
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Okay.

672
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Well, thank you for sharing.

673
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?

674
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Do you have bodies in your basement?

675
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
You better watch out or you're going to be next.

676
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Are those clothes even yours?

677
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?

678
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,

679
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
and I will feast upon it.

680
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.

681
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
It's not enough for you to possess a woman.

682
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,760
You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.

683
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?

684
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
You're the one who keeps bringing that up.

685
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Nice.

686
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Got her.

687
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Shut up, dum-dum.

688
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.

689
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
You stay out of this.

690
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Look, so you're a straight man.

691
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
You could have had a wife.

692
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
You could have raised a family.

693
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Your life could have meant something.

694
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
But you threw it all away.

695
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?

696
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Do you have babies?

697
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Well, priests don't have babies.

698
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Maybe you think of queer people as priests.

699
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.

700
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Whoa, okay.

701
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
That's Catholics.

702
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
That's not Christians.

703
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
That's kind of crossing a line, don't you think?

704
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Oh, has free speech gone too far?

705
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Now it's gone too far.

706
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Can we have a civil conversation, please?

707
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?

708
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.

709
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility

710
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760
by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.

711
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
I walk with the Spirit until the day I go to glory.

712
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
That's my meaning.

713
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Your meaning is what?

714
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,760
To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty

715
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
until you rot away un-resurrected in the earth?

716
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
And for what?

717
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,760
To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

718
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Anything else would be a lie.

719
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,760
If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.

720
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,760
And with or without your approval and understanding,

721
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,760
I will always be the way I am.

722
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?

723
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.

724
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Just...

725
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Leave children out of it.

726
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.

727
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,760
And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.

728
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Listen, Justin.

729
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.

730
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,760
I know my place in this world.

731
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,760
I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.

732
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A dollar sign community?

733
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Well, obviously not.

734
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.

735
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.

736
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,760
So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl GF.

737
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Can you honestly say that you're happy?

738
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
That you're fulfilled?

739
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,760
That you have purpose?

740
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,760
That you have hope?

741
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,760
That you have purpose?

742
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
That you have purpose?

743
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
That you have purpose?

744
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
That you have purpose?

745
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
That you have purpose?

746
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
That you have purpose?

747
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
That you have purpose?

748
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
That you have purpose?

749
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
That you have purpose?

750
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
That you have purpose?

751
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
That you have purpose?

752
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
That you have purpose?

753
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Just do it.

754
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Just do it.

755
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Just do it.

756
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Just do it.

757
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Just do it.

758
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Just do it.

759
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Hello?

760
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Just do it.

761
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Hello?

762
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Jesus.

763
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Don't say that name in front of me.

764
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,760
How did you get in my house?

765
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

766
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Who are you?

767
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
What are you?

768
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Well, I used to be an angel.

769
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
And now?

770
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

771
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
A satanic visitation.

772
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,760
At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

773
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Yes.

774
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

775
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Do you want it to be?

776
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
No.

777
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Look, I've had a terrible day.

778
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm really not in the mood for this.

779
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Well, I can help you with that.

780
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Can you?

781
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Sure.

782
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
I can help with anything.

783
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.

784
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Shame?

785
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Is it the shame?

786
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Well, yeah.

787
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
There is the shame.

788
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
There's always going to be the shame.

789
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
But it's a complex cocktail.

790
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
There's the heartbreak.

791
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

792
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
I'm a parched landloose.

793
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.

794
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Oh, emptiness inside?

795
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

796
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

797
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
It's not a weird sex thing.

798
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Potions, Justine.

799
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Potions.

800
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

801
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Potions, elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

802
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary, a dealer.

803
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Are you trying to get demonetized?

804
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Sorry.

805
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
What potions do you have?

806
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Well, this is one of my favorites.

807
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,760
It's called hype.

808
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
This will make you come alive.

809
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
I'm going to jump right out of your show.

810
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

811
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,760
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

812
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
You'll finally get things done.

813
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
You'll connect with people.

814
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,760
You'll always know just what to say.

815
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

816
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,760
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

817
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Pain.

818
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Well, I surely have something for that.

819
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,760
It's called void.

820
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,760
One drop of this, and all the pain will melt away.

821
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,760
The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,

822
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,760
the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.

823
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,760
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket

824
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,760
of serenity and love.

825
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.

826
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,760
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

827
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

828
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,760
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness all alone?

829
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,760
What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?

830
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Because it was embarrassing.

831
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Humiliating, honestly. It was difficult to watch.

832
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Shut up.

833
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Is it some kind of masochism?

834
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

835
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Because you're not impressing anyone.

836
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,760
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

837
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,760
You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?

838
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Because that is pathetic.

839
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
And it's so unnecessary.

840
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Because you're choosing to feel bad.

841
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,760
When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.

842
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Pass.

843
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
The cool kids are doing it.

844
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it because it's not the 90s.

845
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,760
Kids today are vaping Benadryl. Don't you keep up with this?

846
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Okay, I mean, I respect your choice, but I'm not going anywhere.

847
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,760
I will stay right here.

848
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,760
And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes

849
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,760
that your pain is optional.

850
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,760
And I have the antidote right here.

851
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:05,760
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain and shame and humiliation

852
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,760
and a heartbreak and boredom, loneliness,

853
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:22,760
despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.

854
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Look, I'm a smart person, okay?

855
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,760
And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.

856
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Pathetic? Is it pathetic to feel good?

857
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

858
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,760
And to me, that's pathetic.

859
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Well, the thing about that is...

860
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Okay, just give me the goddamn void.

861
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

862
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
I thought I was going to be here all night.

863
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Well, my will is weak, okay? Can I have the potion, please?

864
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
All right, well, let's be a little patient.

865
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,760
You should really do this the right way, okay? It's called a harm reduction.

866
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:17,760
What you're going to do is put one drop and only one drop of pure void into water.

867
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,760
This is important. Do not do too many drops.

868
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
What happens if I do too many drops?

869
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Oh, you'll probably die.

870
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I'll die?

871
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I told you it was important.

872
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

873
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Well, it's difficult to say exactly. It depends on a lot of factors.

874
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Seriously?

875
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:49,760
But it's your first time, so just do one.

876
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
So, do I just drink it or...

877
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Of course you drink it. It's a purely fictional magical potion,

878
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
utterly disconnected from any real world social issues.

879
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
What else would you do with it?

880
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Okay.

881
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Good girl.

882
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I don't feel anything.

883
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
Okay, well, give it a minute.

884
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,760
In about 15 seconds, you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.

885
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
Are you ready for that?

886
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.

887
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
In my God.

888
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Damn.

889
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
There she goes.

890
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
Oh, thank God.

891
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Well, don't thank God, thank me.

892
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,760
I have a father taking credit for my work.

893
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:46,760
Lucy, Lucy, Luciferia, Mother, a Doctor, Mother, Doctor, Doctor, Mother,

894
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,760
Mom, Mother Void, Mother Void.

895
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.

896
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?

897
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,760
You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.

898
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,760
You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.

899
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Lucy, can I get a drop?

900
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,760
A drop. I thought you didn't want to go down, dark pads.

901
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Doctor, my pain is at a ten.

902
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,760
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.

903
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
I'm a little disappointed, honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase.

904
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,760
But there is no chase with you, no chase at all.

905
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:41,760
You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.

906
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,760
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.

907
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,760
Please, just give me the void so I can feel the emptiness.

908
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,760
If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.

909
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,760
But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?

910
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,760
You call me Mommy now, because I own you.

911
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Yes, Mommy dearest.

912
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?

913
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,760
Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

914
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
So you're going to do five drops?

915
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off.

916
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
So I'm going to do five drops.

917
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.

918
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,760
By all means, continue.

919
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,760
Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.

920
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Thank you.

921
00:50:39,760 --> 00:51:08,760
That was dumb. That was so dumb.

922
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Shit.

923
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,760
I need to quit. I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.

924
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,760
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

925
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,760
Yes, Mother. I've got to quit. I just...

926
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,760
Good luck.

927
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:43,760
I'll quit after one more drop, of course.

928
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:58,760
All right, that's it. Never again. I'm quitting. I quit.

929
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:09,760
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

930
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,760
How hard could that be?

931
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:39,760
Oh, I can't do this. I can't do this. Shit.

932
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy.

933
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,760
Lucy, wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up.

934
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
Wake up!

935
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Lucy, wake up.

936
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Lucy, wake up.

937
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,760
Lucy, wake up.

938
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,760
Lucy, wake up.

939
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Lucy, wake up.

940
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Lucy, wake up.

941
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Lucy, wake up.

942
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,760
Lucy, wake up.
