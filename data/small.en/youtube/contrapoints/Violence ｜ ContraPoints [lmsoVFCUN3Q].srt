1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,600
ðŸŽµ

2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:49,600
ðŸŽµ

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,400
So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Well, I don't know. What do I look like to you? Some kind of philosopher?

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
ðŸŽµ

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,120
So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,

7
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,400
not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,680
However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,560
I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,800
well, violence is fun.

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,440
ðŸŽµ

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,800
And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,040
It's not fun when other people are violent to you.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,800
I mean, unless that's what you're into.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
That is what I'm into.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
Did I say you could speak?

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
No, mistress.

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Then shut up.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:02:05,240
ðŸŽµ

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,800
That's good.

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Chocolatey.

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,680
Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,080
and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,560
I mean, if you're gonna watch a non-violent movie, you may as well read a fucking book.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,320
What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to video the old

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,240
ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,800
a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,320
What's creepy about Alex is that film encourages us to identify with him,

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,840
and he kind of draws us in.

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,520
I mean, he listens to Beethoven,

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,480
and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
Also, he tries the line.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Try to watch!

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,600
Shh!

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,400
So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people,

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,520
and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,560
and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,600
It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,000
So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,160
How normal is it to enjoy violence?

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,800
I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,160
but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,920
where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,640
And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,680
And I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy watching a clock work orange.

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,440
It's not that they don't enjoy violence.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,520
It's that in order for them to enjoy violence,

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,320
they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,120
and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
I guess it's kind of like sex.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,480
At least, not since I started taking this shit.

54
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know?

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,160
A little goddamn ambiance.

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,680
And you could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,320
You can't properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging going on in the background.

58
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,560
But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,760
What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,040
Well, think about the TV show Long Order SVU.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,760
Which has just as much sex and violence as a clockwork orange, but which is much more popular.

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,280
SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process

63
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,840
brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,360
You like that, don't you?

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,880
I love it so much.

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
You all do.

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,160
I think a lot of the appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
while promising the moral purification of justified police violence.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,760
Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance of the moral psyche.

71
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,400
When we believe that violence is morally justified,

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,080
when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room fucking deserved it,

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,560
we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Exactly.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,960
And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,440
you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George Kills the Rapist.

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,360
For viewers with too many moral hang-ups to get off on totally senseless violence,

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,680
a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,600
for gratifying bloody payoff.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,280
But I wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the good

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,520
person's enjoyment of justified violence and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,360
violence as we might like to think.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Yes, the good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence,

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,800
but once you get past that, there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture and swinging,

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,880
thrashing, stabbing, shooting, blasting, and burning, and aesthetics of violence and destruction.

86
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,080
Now, I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim,

87
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,880
and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,960
I mean, unless I get real frustrated.

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,160
Shut up.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
Please just shut up.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
Oh, it's nice.

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
I can't get straight.

93
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
You're so filthy.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
It's time to drink your milk.

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,520
But you know, when I'm playing video games and there are no moral or practical consequences

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,120
to any of my actions, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,760
I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:41,560
I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life, and that's fun, but life itself is terrible.

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,120
To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm actually fine.

101
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
I have tons of friends.

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,960
I'm fine.

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm reallyâ€”I'm fine.

104
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm happy, okay?

105
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
Here's what I want to know.

106
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,280
Unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the

107
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,400
gameplay of most video games is based entirely around it?

108
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,080
Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,520
and that it's a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent.

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,840
And yeah, it's true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted.

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,120
But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique since I like violent media,

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,880
and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence.

113
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,960
Although sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurry

114
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,560
with what I usually like to think.

115
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Little baby, don't you cry, mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

116
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,200
Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary The Act of Killing chronicles the contemporary lives

117
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,040
of the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965 to 1966.

118
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,520
One of the killers, Anwar Congo, explains on a local television program that his torture

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,800
and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies.

120
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:41,080
The documentary takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrator is set to work producing

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,720
cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes, stylizing the events after Westerns,

122
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,040
mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.

123
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,920
It's a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art.

124
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,520
And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange withdrawn from British

125
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,120
distribution in 1973 after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults.

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,920
Now I'm not saying that violent movies make people violent,

127
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,240
and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves.

128
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,920
I mean, I watch violent movies all the time and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.

129
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,000
So now Woke Contrapoints thinks child abuse is funny.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I personally drowned several of my babies and it was very traumatic for me.

131
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,560
Why did I become an SJW again?

132
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,280
Hey, what I want to know is what's the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,040
and those who are sadistic killers?

134
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,360
Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt?

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:06,840
So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself with some kind of flimsy excuse,

136
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
you can kill without remorse.

137
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,360
And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,520
and you never have to face any consequences for it.

139
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,400
What's interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical,

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,240
whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense.

141
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,560
In other words, the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist,

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,400
except that the former happens to have better reasons backing him up or lives in a better

143
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
political situation.

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,880
But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?

145
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,760
I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies, but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?

146
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,720
What would be helpful here is an example, some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,

147
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior, and none of them would ever enjoy it.

149
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,720
ContraPoints has completely lived out and can't stop wringing your hands over a poor little

150
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,800
Nazi getting hit in the face.

151
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,000
Alright, alright, let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's say it's morally required, even.

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,160
Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?

154
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,280
Suppose there's a Nazi turf and he's about to punch a baby,

155
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,960
and punching the turf Nazi is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.

156
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,160
Socrates, is it just to punch the baby puncher?

157
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,000
ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community for this video's ongoing

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,760
trivialization of infanticide.

159
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,400
They'd also like you to know that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,

160
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,640
and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.

161
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,480
Why are we even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?

162
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,960
I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example of actual far-left violence in America

163
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,640
that anyone seems to be able to dig up.

164
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,320
Not for long, bourgeois dogs!

165
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,160
Cat girls of the world unite!

166
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,040
Tabby, could you bring it down just 27 notches or so?

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,120
Why don't you take a second to relax?

168
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,960
Just chill out a little bit.

169
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Here, have some spiked milk.

170
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,600
Ra-ra, Rasputin, lover of the Russian fleet.

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,120
There was a cat that really was gone.

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,680
That was having a very interesting effect on her.

173
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,120
I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist punching discourse,

174
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
whether it's Nazis or turfs or whatever, is twofold.

175
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,920
First, there's the optics problem.

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,400
We want to convince people that, for instance,

177
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,520
trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women.

178
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,080
And I can't help but wonder, is the slogan,

179
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,000
kill all turfs, really the most effective way to convey that message?

180
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,760
And I realize the costume I'm wearing is not the best for making this point either.

181
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,160
But, you know, I just didn't plan well.

182
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,760
The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic and starts being fun,

183
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,480
as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spencer punch.

184
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,840
Because then it's not just that we're saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary to

185
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,200
prevent worse crimes, it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.

186
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
And any time real violence becomes fun, that's a little alarming,

187
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,840
because even if your actions are genuinely justified,

188
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,640
you don't want to get in the habit of enjoying real violence,

189
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,440
because the violence will continue to be fun, whether or not your justifications are any good.

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,600
Though I agree there's something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-Satism hangup.

191
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,840
For most of history, it was just accepted that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,

192
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,720
and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.

193
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,120
As a boring French postmodernist called Michael Foucault pointed out,

194
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,280
in the 18th and 19th centuries there was a so-called humanitarian revolution

195
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,520
that was suddenly ashamed of overt Satism with respect to criminal justice and treatment of the

196
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,840
mentally ill, replacing brutal executions with intricate techniques of discipline.

197
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,960
And a boring French communist called Alain Badieux

198
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,240
argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance is actually just fucking neoliberal

199
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,360
bullshit that encourages first world people to stage third world humanitarian interventions

200
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,680
that look a lot like invasions for some reason, as well as opposing genuine liberation movements

201
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,760
on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology, the bourgeois liberals claim.

202
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,920
So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence benefits the people in power,

203
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,880
since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia,

204
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,280
and sometimes to make political progress you have to tar and feather some folks and

205
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,320
cut their heads off just a little bit or punch them in the fucking face.

206
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,080
Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this are absolutely horrified right now,

207
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,480
and they're thinking, what's to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and

208
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,120
unjust as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists? To which I respond, well that's an

209
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,000
easy one, it's because my side are the good people and your side are the bad people, I'm so sorry.

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,480
Seriously though, that is a pretty good question. Why don't I change the subject to avoid how much

211
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,920
of a problem it is for the argument I'm making? Isn't all politics kind of violent? What about

212
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,200
capitalism? Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings, and it's the relations of

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,680
power that maintain or disrupt that organization, so there's always violence or the threat of

214
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,400
violence in there somewhere. In our own society, police will use violence against us if we disobey

215
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,280
the law or are black, and even when white people do obey the law, there's always the implicit

216
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,240
threat of police violence, including the potential arrest and incarceration of pretty much every

217
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,400
citizen who doesn't have enough money to- Let's talk about Western values. According to the great

218
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,080
tradition of European political thought, sovereign power is justified by the social contract. In other

219
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,280
words, we all consent to be governed because it's in our own interest. Except it's really hypothetical

220
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,840
consent more than anything, because no one actually asks you, and you can't say no. Wait a minute.

221
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,400
I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society, it's pretty easy to see how fascism

222
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,800
and revolutionary movements are inherently violent, and how those political situations

223
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,440
generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish. What's harder to see is how the same

224
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,320
tendency spills out at the seams of our own supposedly humane society. We think of the

225
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:08,760
police as peacekeepers, not killers, yet it's not unheard of that- Oh. Oh no. Oh god.

226
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,760
Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions,

227
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,960
but when you put real human beings in combat situations, the nature of war has a way of just-

228
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh. Oh god. No. Fuck. We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,

229
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,760
but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people.

230
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,160
There's also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving,

231
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,880
or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory, or the low-key normalization

232
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,200
of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries, none of which requires so much as

233
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,760
a single cackling maniac. So in order to think about this intelligently, we need to weigh the

234
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,320
risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem against the

235
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,920
risk that our own complacency with the injustices of the status quo will make us quiet enablers of

236
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,640
more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence. And I don't feel confident enough to say which

237
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,200
one I think is the bigger risk, but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone who doesn't

238
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,720
acknowledge the problems with both options. So, in conclusion, is violence good, or is it bad?

239
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
I guess we'll never know.

240
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,080
You know, with any true philosophical question, there always comes a point when you realize that

241
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,160
all the rationalizations you tell yourself, or all the things you believe and do, just

242
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,200
don't really make any sense. And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?

243
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,280
Just do the fucking laundry. Drink some wine. I don't know, do whatever. Look, what do you want from me?

244
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,280
Let me know in the comments below, and I'll see you in the next video.
