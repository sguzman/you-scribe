1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
My lords, ladies, and theirs that lieth betweeks, Tis evident nor sensation nor the passions

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,160
possess dominion over the mind of man, which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,560
all faculties.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,320
It must needs be remarked that the power of the commonwealth deriveth not from the despotical

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,840
acquisitions of conquerors, but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
the lobster.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,240
Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,960
Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,280
Monsieur Ting, I'm not going to kiss your hand, you freak, I'm more of a woman than

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
you are.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,640
It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,400
Clock me, Amadeus.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Don't break the fourth wall.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm trying to make a video about post-modernism.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,120
Get out of my drawing room, 18th century sexual deviance.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,920
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Reason, power, truth, these are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,480
So who's Jordan Peterson?

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Wow.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,240
He's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, who got famous for sounding the

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,040
alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,560
lead to Stalinism.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,600
Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,760
David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the western world, and

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,800
his self-help book, 12 Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,640
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here because I want to

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
talk.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,440
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven't really engaged with his ideas very

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
much.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,080
He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview where

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Kathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,760
So you were saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
deserve.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,960
No, I'm saying that that's one component.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,440
You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's murderous.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're just saying things though to provoke, aren't you?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean, you are a provocateur.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I never say anything.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,040
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are, like, afraid of his

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
actual ideas.

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,880
But I'm not afraid of his ideas.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Daddy.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,520
I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,280
and reading his books, and honestly, I think I get why people like him.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,880
His book, 12 Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,240
Effective People or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,000
The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like, take responsibility

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,920
for yourself, don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
of psychology, philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,800
He's telling us a pretty classic story.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering, so you need

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,520
a higher purpose in your life.

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
But I knew that already.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,600
I learned it at the AA meetings I refuse to go to.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,160
These are, like, basic insights of world philosophy and religion, but they're insights that today's

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,520
youths apparently haven't heard before, I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,240
Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with, so to a

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,440
lot of people, Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent.

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,320
And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,360
Most of Peterson's fans are young men, and, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,280
into shape, and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,720
I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy, and sometimes girls do too.

71
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,200
But, there's a big problem here, and the problem is that all of this life coaching

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,520
is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.

73
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,880
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life, but

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,920
as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,080
There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,200
Why not?

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,160
Now Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics because that doesn't sound scary

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
enough.

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,720
His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,640
Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism with cultural Marxism, the Nazi

82
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,600
conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Right?

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,760
So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist, and you may quote me

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,000
on that, but I am wondering if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson, Professor, Daddy, let's talk.

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,320
And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
I think it deserves.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Mmm, that's good, that's good temperature.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Thanks, Daddy.

95
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,760
It's really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your stature.

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,640
You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I like about you.

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,200
The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the left, the stifling of even

99
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,560
slightly different opinions, the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments, the

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,320
politics of resentment, are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,880
I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person, oh god

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,240
the dysphoria, please don't watch it.

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,200
But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,120
localized problem, and I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could

105
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
be hurt by that backlash.

106
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,680
Like fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists, but

107
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,880
if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights, that would

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,480
be bad, right?

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240
I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,200
I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom, but clearly, the sheep need

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,840
a shepherd, and you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,680
You know, on the left, we don't really tell people what to do.

113
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
We tell them what not to do.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
Don't exploit the workers.

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
Do not do blackface.

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,800
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people, but that's a pretty small

117
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
rule compared to some of your rules, like how to raise your children, or when it's

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
okay to criticize things.

119
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,680
The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,480
I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons were talking about Plato and

121
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,160
Aristotle and the meaning of life, and I thought, huh, on the left, we don't really talk about

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,440
that kind of thing.

123
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,160
What we talk about is how society oppresses people, and that might not be enough, because

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,200
people need to have a positive purpose in life.

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,680
I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons of Strangers with Candy

127
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
until I die.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,640
But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus, other white guys who talk about lobsters,

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,800
they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering and, like, not just complain

130
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
about patriarchy.

131
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,440
I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy when patriarchy isn't the thing

132
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,560
that's making you suffer, but I do think that an education that only teaches people about

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
oppression is inadequate.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,200
We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad, and then we say, well,

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,440
you're educated now, good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,480
And that really kind of sucks.

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,400
But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made without comparing transgender

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
activism to Stalin.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,040
I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.

140
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,240
See, this is when you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,880
If you don't establish dominance, I'm just going to mouth off.

142
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,160
They use all this compassion language, and I'm on the side of the oppressed, all of

143
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,840
that posturing.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,320
It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.

145
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,400
And I've just been starting to review their curriculum for children from kindergarten

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
to grade 8.

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,920
This pure social justice, postmodernism, the people who hold this doctrine, this radical

148
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,480
postmodern communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,440
identity or some kind of group identity paramount, they've got control over the most low to mid-level

150
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,680
bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well, but even in the United States where

151
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
you know, there's a lot of...

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:50,840
So you've got to give it to JP.

153
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,680
When he says stand up straight with your shoulders back, he means it.

154
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,280
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences with fairly popular

155
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,520
opinions.

156
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,920
Political correctness often feels stifling.

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,240
Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.

158
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use, and I don't like it.

159
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,820
But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes, he leads you to a pretty weird place.

160
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,880
His central political message is that leftist professors, student activists, campus diversity

161
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,560
initiatives, and corporate HR departments are collectively following the philosophy

162
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,840
of postmodern neo-Marxism to destroy Western civilization and sink us all into a totalitarian

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
nightmare.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,080
Now there's just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar to the cultural

165
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,400
Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory, but I'm just gonna ignore that because if I dwell

166
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,920
on it, I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist and then everyone will think

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm crazy.

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,360
Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists, I don't like to hide.

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,160
So let's just try not to think about that and instead, straightforwardly ask, is it

170
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,800
true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all?

171
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,360
Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,600
We all know what Marxism is, the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,520
between workers and capitalists and that the workers will eventually revolt.

174
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,940
Some college professors definitely do believe that, but zero percent of corporate HR departments

175
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,420
do, so that, okay.

176
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,980
So what is postmodernism?

177
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,140
Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.

178
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,860
Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern and

179
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,340
then trying to guess what they have in common.

180
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,940
That's basically what the YouTuber ArmouredSkeptic did in his video about it.

181
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,460
So many daddies in this video.

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,940
We should invite them all to a barbecue, complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.

183
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,660
I've had worse evenings.

184
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,540
I don't think there really is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern.

185
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,700
Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945 that seemed to me at the time.

186
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,980
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism, he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.

187
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,260
He's talking about postmodern philosophy.

188
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
So what's that?

189
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,540
Well, basically it's a kind of skepticism.

190
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,780
Not YouTube skepticism, but actual skepticism, you know, like having doubts about whether

191
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,020
humans can really know things about the world.

192
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,780
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea, that goes way back to ancient times.

193
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,660
But more specifically, postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

194
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,860
So what's modernism?

195
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,660
What's what?

196
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,460
What are words?

197
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,340
What's anything?

198
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,700
I'm going to divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.

199
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,220
First, there's early modernism.

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,780
Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens

201
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,660
which says that we can form universal theories about the world

202
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,100
through observation and reasoning aka the scientific method.

203
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,260
Now that turns out to work pretty well for whatever questions you have about plants

204
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,100
and crystals and how to medically reconfigure human genitals.

205
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,540
But it has some limits, which was pointed out by David Hume,

206
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,460
one of the least boring 18th century queens and one of the only philosophers

207
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,900
I can actually put up with in small doses even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.

208
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,020
This is a call out.

209
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,060
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,

210
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,100
you can't really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self

211
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,820
because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.

212
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,460
Anyway, then the late modernists came along and they said,

213
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,420
fuck Hume, we're going to do science about those things anyway.

214
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,940
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards

215
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,580
who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.

216
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,140
So for example, you have psychoanalysis,

217
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,060
which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives,

218
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,820
which is of course ridiculous.

219
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I'm conscious of all my drives.

220
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,500
And you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,820
You got early sociology and anthropology,

222
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,460
which started out with racist social evolutionism

223
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,900
and progressed to a kind of we're all the same universalism.

224
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,540
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.

225
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
His first book, Maps of Meaning,

226
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,260
is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world and create order out of chaos

227
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,500
through universal myths and archetypes,

228
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,940
which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.

229
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,860
Boy, this is a lot of explaining.

230
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,820
It's so much explaining, it's triggering gender dysphoria.

231
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,260
I better put on some longer nails.

232
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,180
Nails?

233
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,940
Is that all womanhood means to you?

234
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,260
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

235
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,340
So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories about reality,

236
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
history, and humanity,

237
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,780
postmodernists say, actually, no, that's not possible.

238
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,700
For example, the French postmodernist,

239
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
Michel Foucault.

240
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,700
Sargon?

241
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,100
You little gooths?

242
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,140
Michel Foucault.

243
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,860
wrote intellectual histories of subjects like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,

244
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,020
in which he argued that we should not understand these histories as straightforward progressions

245
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,100
toward liberty and scientific truth,

246
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,700
but rather as mere shifts in the way that power orders our institutions and populations.

247
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,820
The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.

248
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,020
Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.

249
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,260
If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.

250
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,620
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,

251
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,580
irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness

252
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,500
that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world is not the final or best vocabulary.

253
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,940
All right, that's enough explaining.

254
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,060
And my nails are done.

255
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,940
Check it out.

256
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,420
Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails?

257
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,220
But do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them with barely concealed visceral rage?

258
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,980
Well, I have a solution for you.

259
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,660
The bisexual manicure.

260
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,740
One hand for the V, one hand for the D.

261
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,980
Both for degeneracy.

262
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,740
It's absolutely filthy.

263
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,900
So we've got all the pieces on the table.

264
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.

265
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
On the one hand, we have Marxism,

266
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,020
a fundamentally modernist worldview that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.

267
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,260
On the other hand, we have postmodernism,

268
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,380
a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity to know any universal truth is about anything.

269
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,900
On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.

270
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,700
And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,

271
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,820
with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault

272
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,180
the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.

273
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,740
And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died, capitalism did end forever.

274
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,580
So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?

275
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,660
Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists were in some way influenced by Marxism,

276
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,220
so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.

277
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,900
But that's not what Peterson means.

278
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,500
It's clear from the way he uses the term

279
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,420
that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical than it initially appears.

280
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,540
Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to include not only postmodern intellectuals

281
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,740
and Marxist intellectuals, but also liberal politicians,

282
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,300
academic administrators, and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,

283
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,140
and so-called identity politics activists, including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.

284
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,620
Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.

285
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,860
Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally at odds,

286
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,500
since Marxism is a big story about a struggle between two clear and distinct groups,

287
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,

288
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,020
and about the stability of binaries like bourgeoisie and proletariat.

289
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,220
But that's not the only tension in Peterson's clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.

290
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,100
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows

291
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,580
that Marxists and identity politics activists are constantly at each other's throats,

292
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,780
because the Marxists accuse the activists of being bourgeois dogs

293
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,660
who want more female CEOs of color and more disabled transgender drone pilots,

294
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,660
while the activists accuse the Marxists of being a boys' club of brochelists,

295
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,580
no more woke on gender and race issues than the average Jordan Peterson fan.

296
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,020
Most often, these accusations are correct, because everyone is problematic and I disown them all.

297
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,740
And then there's also the conflict between the identity politics activists and the postmodernists.

298
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,940
Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?

299
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,860
There's nothing postmodern about it.

300
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,660
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice for particular groups,

301
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,180
such as women, people of color, and gay and trans people.

302
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,340
This kind of activism presupposes that these group categories exist

303
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,060
and are a useful basis for political organizing.

304
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,460
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.

305
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,620
They want to show that these categories, race, gender, sexual orientation,

306
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,100
are contingent social constructs and are themselves potentially oppressive.

307
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,580
This is why conventional feminist activists often hate postmodern feminism.

308
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,260
Because the postmodern feminists want to show that the whole concept of womanhood,

309
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,460
for instance, is contingent and potentially oppressive,

310
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,500
and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it.

311
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,820
And then the conventional feminist activists say,

312
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,540
the fuck, we need the concept of womanhood to organize around women's political interests.

313
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,780
How are we supposed to do that if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?

314
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,260
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,

315
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,140
well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler, the most famous postmodern feminist ever.

316
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,020
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics when identity becomes its own policy,

317
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,220
bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?

318
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,500
And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility,

319
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
but rather to make use of a category that can be called into question,

320
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,980
made to account for what it excludes.

321
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,460
If you take the first part of that quote out of context,

322
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,100
it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said.

323
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,220
The difference is that JP actually does think we should return to silence and invisibility.

324
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
Or does he?

325
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,020
It's hard to tell what he thinks.

326
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,220
More on that in a moment.

327
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,540
I bring all of this up to show that one,

328
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,860
the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,

329
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,980
and two, identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned.

330
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,060
There are sophisticated debates about this going on within leftist academia,

331
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,500
but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that or doesn't care.

332
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,700
He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to characterize the left as a unified philosophical

333
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:55,060
force bent on destroying Western civilization when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,580
who can't stop squabbling with each other over every goddamn little issue.

335
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,460
The only reason I can think of that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force

336
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,260
is if you're so far to the right that literally everyone who supports the economic and social

337
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,260
advancement of disadvantaged groups looks like one homogenous enemy.

338
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?

339
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,740
That he opposes all social progress for women, racial, and sexual minorities?

340
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,380
Well it's difficult to say, because while he spends much of his time comparing activists

341
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,340
for these movements to 20th century mass murderers, he resists being pinned down to

342
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,020
any more specific position.

343
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,580
I was maybe too harsh on Kathy Newman earlier.

344
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,940
She came out of the interview looking bad, but she had a tough job to do.

345
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,700
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves saying something that's more or less

346
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,500
uncontroversially true, while at the same time implying something controversial.

347
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,740
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like there are biological differences

348
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,300
between men and women, which is obviously true.

349
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,140
But he'll say it in the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation

350
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,300
of women in government, which implies… what exactly?

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,820
So how do you respond to this?

352
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,140
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement,

353
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,620
or you have to guess at what he's implying in response to which he can accuse you of

354
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,940
misrepresenting him, which is exactly what happened with the Kathy Newman interview.

355
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,420
The most famous moment where Peterson does this is the notorious lobster argument.

356
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,620
So he starts by saying,

357
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,620
There's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct

358
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,220
of the Western patriarchy.

359
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,340
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,

360
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,020
and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,

361
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,900
so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.

362
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,940
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters?

363
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals

364
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,340
and human beings organize their structures.

365
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,700
The problem with that is that no one has ever said

366
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,700
that every hierarchy is the product of Western patriarchy.

367
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,020
This is such a massive straw man that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation

368
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,140
of Peterson suggested by Kathy Newman in this interview.

369
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,220
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.

370
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,900
Even the anarchists whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies

371
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,500
limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.

372
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,060
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.

373
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,820
The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics within our own society,

374
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,700
to which the lobster case is a complete non-sequitur.

375
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,540
I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument the same way he uses it

376
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,660
to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,

377
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,180
no matter how unjust.

378
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,100
You could be an 18th century Republican arguing against the monarchy,

379
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,260
and the monarch could turn around and say,

380
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,500
well, hierarchies are inevitable.

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,940
God save the lobster queen.

382
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,060
Oh dear God.

383
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,940
My lords, ladies, and those of life betweeks,

384
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,780
present rumors of Republican rumblings amongst the rabble

385
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,900
have compelled us to summon you together.

386
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,540
Let us remind you that nature has so made the lobster

387
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,060
that some individuals be stronger than the others.

388
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty be anywise impugned.

389
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,460
And as for parliamentarians, well, let them vote for cake.

390
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,980
Very good.

391
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,540
Thank you.

392
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,740
I need new roommates.

393
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,180
So I've argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept

394
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,220
of postmodern neo-Marxism as the supervillain

395
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,020
in a childishly simple worldview he's promoting

396
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,140
where these evil leftists are out to destroy the West.

397
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,860
Now it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.

398
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,340
What, exactly, is the West?

399
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,140
Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West

400
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,980
that describes the intellectual tradition

401
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,740
that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.

402
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,060
Now a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West

403
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,300
and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist

404
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,420
and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing.

405
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,180
But we don't have time for that right now.

406
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,420
So I'm just going to grant that the West is a thing

407
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,660
and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.

408
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,860
For Peterson, the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism,

409
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,940
individualism, the idea that each human has a spark of divinity

410
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,220
and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,

411
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,700
a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectual historians.

412
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,100
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism,

413
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,140
which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.

414
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,220
This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism

415
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,580
and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering.

416
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,820
Marxism is Western philosophy.

417
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,140
Postmodernism is Western philosophy.

418
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,340
If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries

419
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,660
of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.

420
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,020
Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western.

421
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,900
The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs

422
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,820
is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty

423
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,300
over collective dogma should be on board with.

424
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,220
You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy

425
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,660
with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.

426
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,060
I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition,

427
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,100
but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.

428
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,780
If you did read it, you'd find a surprising diversity of thought

429
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,900
that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.

430
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,020
Much of Plato's political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,

431
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,780
suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity,

432
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,180
it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.

433
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,300
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher, David Hume, famously said that reason is,

434
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,660
and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, literally feels over reals.

435
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:06,420
And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade, was advocating the abolition of morality,

436
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,620
filling the churches with scat porn, and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion

437
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,940
so decadent and depraved, I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.

438
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,140
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,

439
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,660
and it's just as much a part of the West as Peterson's soggy Bible-patting conservatism.

440
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,100
But again, and I really can't stress this enough, I don't care either way.

441
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,420
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.

442
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,260
So what do you people want from me?

443
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,780
The lobster queen is dead.

444
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,740
Long live the queen.

445
00:26:41,620 --> 00:27:10,100
I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the queen.

446
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:38,580
I'll save the lobster queen.

447
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,180
And I think you would agree that there's just a foundational erosion that,

448
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,340
I think people of all sides, and I think there's totally intellectually smart people

449
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,540
on the far left that can help.

450
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,100
Where are those people?

451
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,020
There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in, that I watch,

452
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,140
and I don't mean to misgender her because I think she identifies with her,

453
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,020
ContraPoints, I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber,

454
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,060
who's on the far left.

455
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,260
I've seen the name come up every now and again.

456
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,300
Totally disagree with everything this person says.

457
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,500
When I look at it, I'm like, this seems very reasonable, educated, academic.

458
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,220
And I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone's in love.

459
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,900
Hello, Dave.
