00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
In color theory, the selection of colors used in the design is called a color scheme.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.840
Analogist color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary

00:11.840 --> 00:18.640
schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.560
Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounds, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk

00:23.560 --> 00:27.520
about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.800
This week, we'll be talking about colors.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
Colors!

00:31.800 --> 00:33.760
What the fuck are they?

00:33.760 --> 00:37.200
In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.880
Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.

00:41.880 --> 00:42.880
It's delicious!

00:42.880 --> 00:47.480
Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic

00:47.480 --> 00:48.480
radiation.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.400
But what about the shadow illusion?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.560
Same wavelengths, different colors.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.160
Some people say I'm a mandress to as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be

00:57.160 --> 01:00.320
a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.560
Explain that Professor Butler illusion.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.440
What matters more, the way things are or the way things look?

01:07.440 --> 01:11.760
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

01:11.760 --> 01:30.160
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um, it's too early for this.

01:30.160 --> 01:38.440
Today my guests are, um, well, who are you people?

01:38.440 --> 01:45.040
I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbane, associate professor of women's studies and author of many, many

01:45.040 --> 01:50.720
books, most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
and Flow.

01:51.720 --> 02:02.520
Oh, yes, and, uh, well, you look familiar, who are you?

02:02.520 --> 02:13.960
Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic, um, well, here's a good one.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.960
Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for transgender?

02:17.960 --> 02:19.480
What do you think Annabelle?

02:19.480 --> 02:24.120
Well Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom

02:24.120 --> 02:25.120
of speech.

02:25.120 --> 02:31.280
For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
costume wig.

02:32.280 --> 02:37.240
Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that

02:37.240 --> 02:41.480
pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.

02:41.480 --> 02:46.080
But perhaps you disagree, sir.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.080
That's a human rights violation.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
I'll smash your fucking face.

02:48.080 --> 02:55.080
And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a

02:55.080 --> 02:57.680
smokescreen for male violence against women.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.200
And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,

03:01.200 --> 03:06.280
it's becoming mandatory, and every day, the centers are being silenced, and something

03:06.280 --> 03:11.080
must be done about the encroaching trans agenda, taking away women's rights, invading women's

03:11.080 --> 03:16.560
spaces, depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard to do.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.280
I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.720
Gender's just like color.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.000
Some people see yellow, some people see blue.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.680
It's all a matter of opinion, or is it?

03:27.080 --> 03:29.080
Let's hear the real tea.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
Tabby.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.080
Sweetie baby.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
Princess.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
I feel ridiculous in this dress.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.480
Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.480
I think I'm gonna take the dress off.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
Well don't do that.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.280
I'm trying to help you out girl.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.680
If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.080
I'm gonna take it off.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.280
But don't leave, you can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.280
I'm gonna go behind the curtain.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.280
I like looking at naked people.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.480
Why do you always hit on me?

04:14.480 --> 04:15.680
I thought you were into men.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.280
Well I swing both ways.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.280
I like boy dick and girl dick.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.880
That's not how that works.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
I hate that.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.280
The heart wants what it wants.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.080
Why did you invite me over here anyway?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.880
I saw what happened to you on the freedom report and girl.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
Girl.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.480
You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.880
You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?

04:35.880 --> 04:36.880
Pfft no.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
Morally wrong.

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
What does that even mean?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.880
It was much worse than morally wrong.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.280
It was aesthetically wrong.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.880
It was unfeminine.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
This is all you ever say to me.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.880
It's bad optics.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
It's bad aesthetics.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.880
Well does reality matter at all to you?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.880
Cause the reality is I am a woman.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.280
And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
But the way things look isn't all that matters.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
Tabby, this is politics.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.280
Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?

04:59.280 --> 05:02.280
Reality plays no role in politics.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.280
Politics is aesthetics.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.280
Politics is aesthetics?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.280
That's literally what fascism is.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.280
Have you even read Benjamin?

05:10.280 --> 05:14.280
Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.280
The military parades, the pageantry,

05:16.280 --> 05:19.280
and communism responds by politicizing art.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.280
This is what I can't stand about communists.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.280
You want to turn art into propaganda.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
Well art is already ideology.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
Ah, look, instead of ruining art,

05:27.280 --> 05:29.280
why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism

05:29.280 --> 05:31.280
with pageantry of our own?

05:31.280 --> 05:34.280
And you know who's going to make that happen?

05:34.280 --> 05:35.280
Who?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.280
Well funded trans women.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
Patreon's in the description.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.280
Ew.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.280
Stop that.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
What?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.280
I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community

05:43.280 --> 05:45.280
by strategically leveraging my content creator

05:45.280 --> 05:47.280
promotional media brand analytics.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
Is that so wrong?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.280
You're so bougie.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.280
I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.280
Revolutionary philosophers.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.280
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.280
Look, the point I'm trying to make

05:57.280 --> 06:00.280
is that the world we live in is not a philosophical world.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.280
Think about Instagram.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.280
It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.280
If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.280
No one sees that.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.280
They only see the show you're putting on.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.280
Okay, but life is not a show.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.280
Hmm, politics is a show.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.280
Look around you, Tabby.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.280
Try to understand what's happening to the world.

06:17.280 --> 06:21.280
The president of the United States is a reality TV star.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.280
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.280
In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
And it's important to know what you're in.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.280
Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.280
It's Rome.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.280
And your problem is you think you're in the Forum

06:36.280 --> 06:38.280
when you're really in the circus.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.280
I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.280
Now you're against reason, too?

06:42.280 --> 06:44.280
I'm not against reason.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.280
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.280
If you're a man.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.280
And what if you're a woman?

06:49.280 --> 06:50.280
Oh, don't be a woman.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.280
That's not a good idea.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.280
Ow.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.280
Do you remember that debate between Blair White

06:54.280 --> 06:56.280
and that YouTuber with the pink wig?

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
What was her name?

06:57.280 --> 06:58.280
I don't know.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.280
She was relevant back in 2017.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.280
Anyway, this was before she transitioned.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.280
And in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.280
And the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig

07:08.280 --> 07:10.280
not looking at the camera.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.280
I vaguely remember.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.280
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.280
Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.280
It was embarrassing to watch.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.280
Not really.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
I mean, she was right.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.280
And her arguments were better.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280
Ah, Tabby.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.280
Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
Arguments don't matter.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.280
How pretty you are matters.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.280
Is this really where you're going with this?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.280
Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,

07:35.280 --> 07:38.280
sooner or later you're going to need to take the trans girl black pill.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.280
Oh, boy.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
If you're a trans woman in the public eye,

07:41.280 --> 07:44.280
what matters is one thing and one thing only.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.280
And it's always been the thing that matters.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.280
What?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.280
The realness.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.280
Verisimilitude.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.280
You have to look like a fucking woman.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.280
There it is.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.280
There it is is right.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.280
We don't say it in public,

07:56.280 --> 07:58.280
but we all know it and we all feel it.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.280
What does it even mean to look like a woman?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.280
I'm trying to have a real conversation here.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.280
We all know what it means.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.280
I don't know what it means.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.280
Women have a lot of different looks.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.280
There are bald women, bearded women,

08:10.280 --> 08:12.280
muscular women, wide-shouldered women.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.280
And what is society's opinion

08:14.280 --> 08:16.280
about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.280
Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.280
The dress is the last of my concerns.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.280
I mean, where do I even start with this?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.280
You're wearing combat boots.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.280
You cannot be wearing combat boots.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.280
Why not?

08:28.280 --> 08:29.280
A lot of cis women wear them.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.280
Cis women?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.280
Fully clockable.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.280
So you want me to look like a woman

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
without imitating cis women?

08:35.280 --> 08:36.280
Yes.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
Do not, under any circumstances,

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
imitate cis women.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
They have no idea what they're doing.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.280
Well, where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?

08:48.280 --> 08:50.280
And where does that come from?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
Poets.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.280
Teenage gay boys on Instagram?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.280
The only people with any coherent vision

08:55.280 --> 08:57.280
of contemporary womanhood.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
That's insanity.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.280
Is it?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.280
Tabby, look at my face.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.280
Look at this highlight.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.280
Does that look like the product of insanity to you?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.280
I mean, yeah, kind of.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.280
Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
Good banter.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.280
Well done.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.280
But trans women have to overdo it.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.280
You need to be so good at makeup

09:16.280 --> 09:19.280
that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.280
You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.280
You need to smile even at people who hate you.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.

09:26.280 --> 09:31.280
You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.280
Your hands are not tools.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.280
They are ornaments at the ends of your arms.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.280
So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.280
Literally a man's idea of a woman.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.280
Well, men have the power, men make the rules,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.280
and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.280
So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.280
I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform

09:54.280 --> 09:56.280
to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
Not stereotypes.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
Performances.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.280
You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?

10:01.280 --> 10:03.280
Gender is performance.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.280
We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.280
Womenhood is not what you are, it's what you do.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.280
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.280
So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.280
I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.280
I mean performance in the sense of everything you do,

10:24.280 --> 10:28.280
the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.280
And authentic performance is just a habitual performance,

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
and nothing more than that.

10:33.280 --> 10:37.280
So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?

10:37.280 --> 10:41.280
I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.280
You fake it till you make it.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.280
So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.280
That's what any woman is.

10:49.280 --> 10:52.280
What about gender non-conforming cis women?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.280
They're not doing womanhood in that way.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.280
Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.280
They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.280
You don't want to end up like that, do you?

11:02.280 --> 11:05.280
And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,

11:05.280 --> 11:07.280
talks like a woman, takes female hormones,

11:07.280 --> 11:09.280
is gendered female by other people,

11:09.280 --> 11:12.280
and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,

11:12.280 --> 11:15.280
that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
Yep, that's absurd.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.280
But it's absurd because the example is absurd.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.280
No cis man would do that.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.280
It's like asking is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
Like, yeah, pretty much.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.280
See, this is a philosophy at its worst, pointless speculative fiction.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.280
And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,

11:33.280 --> 11:36.280
which is you getting rid of those combat boots.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.280
I thought we were talking about philosophy.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.280
No, we're talking about shoes.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.280
Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?

11:42.280 --> 11:46.280
You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.280
The left will abide a regal queer.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.280
Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.280
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,

11:57.280 --> 12:00.280
then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?

12:00.280 --> 12:02.280
What matters is that we identify as women.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.280
We can express that identity in different ways,

12:05.280 --> 12:08.280
but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.280
But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.280
Without action and without social recognition,

12:14.280 --> 12:16.280
the identity is meaningless.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.280
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,

12:18.280 --> 12:22.280
then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.280
Because unless you're living womanhood,

12:24.280 --> 12:26.280
the identity is literally that meaningless.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.280
That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.280
Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.280
I'm trying to talk about what's really true.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
I didn't say it was insensitive.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
I said it was unfair.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.280
Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality

12:40.280 --> 12:43.280
that implies a potential to live your inner truth.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.280
No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
It's just a troll example.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.280
True.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.280
But even if they were sincere,

12:50.280 --> 12:54.280
there would still be no reality to it because helicopter is not an actual social role.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.280
Whereas, you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,

12:58.280 --> 13:00.280
but you have to work to get there,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.280
and ultimately, society has to let you.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.280
What do you mean?

13:03.280 --> 13:07.280
I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,

13:07.280 --> 13:09.280
but if no one recognizes me as a doctor,

13:09.280 --> 13:12.280
then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?

13:12.280 --> 13:15.280
But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.280
All it takes is being misgendered.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.280
It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?

13:20.280 --> 13:23.280
Why did you get so angry when that turf called you sir?

13:23.280 --> 13:27.280
Isn't it because in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.280
That's ridiculous.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.280
I am a woman.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.280
That's my reality.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.280
It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.280
I know you're a woman.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
I'm just saying that in that one moment,

13:35.280 --> 13:38.280
you effectively had your gender canceled.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.280
Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.280
Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
There's no reasoning your way into it.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
But don't worry about that.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.280
I don't argue I'm a woman.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
I smash.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
I know you do, and it's a bad look.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.280
Is this about the shoes again?

13:54.280 --> 13:55.280
Yep.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.280
Here, put these on.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.280
Absolutely not.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.280
I'm not wearing those.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.280
Yes, you are, bitch.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.280
No?

14:01.280 --> 14:06.280
If you put these on, I'll scratch you behind the ears later.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.280
Okay, fine.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.280
Now walk.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.280
Walk.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.280
That was the worst thing I've ever seen.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.280
Well, you're the one who made me do it.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
Look, don't stop around like that.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
Keep your shoulders back and steady.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.280
All the movement comes from your hips.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.280
And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.280
Here, I'll show you.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.280
Your turn.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
Do it right.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.280
The category is...

15:15.280 --> 15:17.280
Cat Girls.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.280
Yes, bitch!

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
That was flawless.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.280
It was iconic.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.280
I'm loving for this.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
I'm loving this for you.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.280
You're doing so good for yourself.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.280
I'm never doing that again.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.280
Why not?

15:43.280 --> 15:45.280
Because it's not who I am.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.280
All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.280
Well, that's not what aesthetics is.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.280
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.280
And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
but I can be a first-rate tabby.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.280
Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson

15:58.280 --> 16:00.280
about the importance of being yourself.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
Shut up.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.280
I know I'm not pretty.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.280
And I know you think you're too good for me

16:06.280 --> 16:08.280
because you mostly pass.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.280
And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
and that's weird,

16:14.280 --> 16:17.280
but I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.280
because I'm not like anyone but myself,

16:19.280 --> 16:21.280
and because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us,

16:21.280 --> 16:24.280
and I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
and deep voices,

16:25.280 --> 16:27.280
the girls even other trans women make fun of,

16:27.280 --> 16:29.280
and when, in the history of the world,

16:29.280 --> 16:32.280
has anyone but me ever stood up for them.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.280
That's why everyone knows who tabby is.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.280
When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?

16:37.280 --> 16:40.280
Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.280
But so what?

16:41.280 --> 16:43.280
So mail to anime Twitter stans you.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
Big deal.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.280
You're mad, aren't you?

16:45.280 --> 16:47.280
I'll get over it in a few weeks.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.280
Look, you're right.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
You have to be yourself.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.280
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.280
then wear them well and make it work.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.280
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.280
Sometimes you have to become yourself.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.280
And for you,

17:04.280 --> 17:07.280
I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.280
I mean, with the Nazis, it's one thing,

17:09.280 --> 17:11.280
but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.280
I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
were willing to stick up for us.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.280
Your delicate notion of femininity

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
is a product of the privilege you share

17:19.280 --> 17:21.280
with a lot of thin white cis feminists.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.280
Wow.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
It must be so hard for you out on the streets

17:24.280 --> 17:26.280
as a fat woman of color.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.280
Shut up.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
I'm just saying,

17:28.280 --> 17:30.280
don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.280
You could have what I have.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
You just have to work for it

17:32.280 --> 17:34.280
instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.280
You are raised a white boy.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.280
You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.280
And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,

17:41.280 --> 17:43.280
but you still stand on a lot of privilege.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.280
I look at all the photos of trans women

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
who are murdered in this country,

17:46.280 --> 17:48.280
and they don't look like you or me.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.280
Why don't you use your privilege and use your education

17:51.280 --> 17:52.280
to actually do some good in the world

17:52.280 --> 17:55.280
instead of this elective, revolutionary larping?

17:55.280 --> 17:57.280
You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.280
I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough

17:59.280 --> 18:02.280
to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.

18:02.280 --> 18:06.280
I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.280
You don't win friends and allies with a bat.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.280
They're just using you.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.280
Well, who do you think benefits,

18:10.280 --> 18:12.280
and who do you think gets hurt

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
when you go out into the world

18:13.280 --> 18:16.280
and represent trans women as masculine and violent?

18:16.280 --> 18:17.280
Who do you think benefits

18:17.280 --> 18:20.280
when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?

18:20.280 --> 18:22.280
I guess we can't win, can we?

18:22.280 --> 18:24.280
You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?

18:24.280 --> 18:26.280
Yeah, okay.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.280
Forget about the disrespect.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.280
Facts don't care about your feelings.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.280
It turns out that every chromosome,

18:32.280 --> 18:34.280
every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body

18:34.280 --> 18:37.280
is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
You don't know what you're talking about.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.280
You're not educated on genetics.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
Would you like to discuss the genetics or not?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
Well, no, no.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.280
What are your genetics?

18:43.280 --> 18:47.280
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.280
Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.

18:50.280 --> 18:55.280
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.280
So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,

18:58.280 --> 19:01.280
I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community,

19:01.280 --> 19:02.280
which is so frustrating.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.280
Damage controlling, so frustrating.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.280
Facts don't care about your feelings.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
So frustrating.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.280
It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.280
If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex

19:15.280 --> 19:18.280
and then talk about you're a very feminine biological man

19:18.280 --> 19:21.280
and you've had the surgeries to prove it,

19:21.280 --> 19:23.280
then I think that we can talk about

19:23.280 --> 19:24.280
what is the appropriate pronoun to use.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
Because my problem is the...

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
The...

19:26.280 --> 19:27.280
They're...

19:27.280 --> 19:31.280
Tambi, I don't want to fight with you.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.280
We're surviving in this shit world together

19:33.280 --> 19:35.280
and you'll always be my sister.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.280
Well, I'm glad.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.280
I love you.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.280
What?

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
Love.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.280
I was in love once.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.280
I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati,

19:44.280 --> 19:46.280
bent over a pool table.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.280
The year was 1985.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.280
And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey

19:51.280 --> 19:54.280
hits my nostrils at just the right moment,

19:54.280 --> 19:57.280
I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth

19:57.280 --> 19:59.280
against my cheek.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.280
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.280
Thank you.
