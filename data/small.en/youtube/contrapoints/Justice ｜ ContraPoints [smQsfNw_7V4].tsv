0	11520	All right, so what are we looking at?
11520	15400	What new hell have we sunk to now here in the United States of-
15400	18360	They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine and you're not really
18360	21520	fine but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.
21520	27640	Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter thin blue line punisher
27640	29480	skull on the hood.
29480	35440	Um, there's a lot to unpack here but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining
35440	36440	the skull.
36440	41040	The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.
41040	45160	The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess
45160	47640	because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.
47640	48640	Disappointing.
48640	52520	Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him
52520	56480	an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.
56480	57480	Nya.
57480	60840	I did watch a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher and as research for this
60840	66920	video I did watch all of them and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where
66920	71480	Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass his Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty
71480	75680	in the sewers worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.
75680	78680	You know, just like the police do.
78680	84720	Hi, I'm Nyaataly, creator of Catra Points.
84720	86400	And no, I'm not a cat girl.
86520	87520	I'm a cat woman.
87520	89120	I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.
89120	94160	Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite heterosexual body.
94160	102720	I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and...
102720	105160	As a woman with values.
105160	106600	Just kidding, I'm trash.
106600	109000	Let's talk about justice, Ulu.
109000	112640	Justice is when I get lots of headpats, nyaaa.
112640	117000	The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family but once
117000	121200	he gets revenge he can't stop killing because it's the only thing that gives meaning to
121200	125080	his shitty life so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.
125080	130320	But no matter how many bad guys he kills it's never enough because new criminals just come
130320	133280	along and take the place of the old ones.
133280	139040	It's like a cycle where violence gets violence and nothing ever really changes.
139040	143240	It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime
143240	144240	and punishment.
144240	145240	But you know what?
145240	146240	Let's not overthink this.
146240	149200	Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.
149200	150200	Great.
150200	151200	Perfect.
151200	152200	Are we the baddies?
152200	158640	Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, anti-phasympathizing, big government
158640	164600	anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte criticizing the police even though
164600	167760	I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.
167760	172280	And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.
172280	175560	This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.
175560	179240	There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose
179240	181020	of the chemical you're addicted to.
181020	186560	They tried to make me get a rehab, I said, meow, meow, meow.
186560	192000	But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free
192000	193960	marketplace of ideas gorge.
193960	198200	And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because
198200	200240	I happen to enjoy headpats.
200240	205280	As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher
205280	207200	king or a peasant nave.
207200	208200	Or a neko-mimi.
208200	210200	Ah, kawaii dates.
210200	213560	This is problematic.
213560	215640	Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.
215640	217300	This is beyond cringe.
217300	219680	This is cursed children, cursed.
219680	223880	So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but that just proves the
223880	227240	point I'm making, so maybe you should hear meow, meow.
227240	231560	I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared
231560	235480	on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.
235480	241000	And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice is taken
241000	246320	into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.
246320	248840	All of this raises a lot of questions.
248840	252380	Like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?
252380	254380	Who should impose these consequences?
254380	256060	And under what circumstances?
256060	257460	And for what purpose?
257460	260980	If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place?
260980	262480	Oh my god, these contacts.
262480	265100	I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.
265100	266100	Ridiculous.
266100	270580	Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice, Socrates?
270580	274820	It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years with no conclusive
274820	275820	answers.
276820	281540	I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers
281540	282540	were dummies.
282540	284540	And I am very smart.
284540	285540	Nyah.
285540	286540	Ra-ra-raspoutine.
286540	287540	One.
287540	288540	Revenge.
288540	294720	The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull
294720	300260	he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.
300260	304500	The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people.
305500	311360	This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment
311360	312860	in proportion to their crime.
312860	317780	It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in
317780	321440	our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.
321440	326180	Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it
326180	328160	serves an evolutionary function.
328160	332660	If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas and you don't get revenge, then
332660	335700	other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.
335700	340340	But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend
340340	345300	pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that
345300	348260	it is not profitable to mess with you.
348260	351900	So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.
351900	356100	And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is
356100	362000	strong and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when
362000	364640	justice of this kind is served.
364640	369640	So of course, there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.
369640	374360	For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served with one and a half
374360	375360	million subscribers.
375360	381320	I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves
381320	385640	stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment.
385640	389560	And all this celebrated under the heading police justice.
389560	393920	In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community
393920	397320	was now with 20% more police brutality.
397320	399920	Um, fun fact?
399920	401320	This ain't it, chief.
401320	402320	Period.
402320	403320	Full stop.
403320	404320	That's the tweet.
404320	408480	Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping
408480	410280	an eye on these people.
410280	412440	Here's a typical justice served post.
412440	420280	One sets P E D O husband on a fire after catching him R A P E seven year old daughter
420280	423920	titled this man got what he deserved.
423920	425960	Instant regret.
425960	426960	Predator exposed.
426960	430320	To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was going to be wearing
430320	431320	cattiers.
431320	434960	I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed
434960	441040	like a aging bargain bin Bill Delphine impersonator.
441040	443240	Well, dress for the job you want.
443240	447480	I mean, whom's to amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,
447480	448480	right?
448480	450720	Let's look at the comments on that post though.
450720	452400	Let's read the room.
452400	456400	She's a hero in my opinion, should have had it live on television.
456400	457640	Give her a medal.
457640	458640	Give her two medals.
458640	463600	So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but you know, there's always a couple
463600	469200	buzz kills in there whining as usual about, Oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning
469200	471960	people alive with no due process and no evidence.
471960	476400	Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.
476400	478280	But those people get shouted down pretty fast.
478280	481600	They get called pedo simps.
481600	482600	Pedo simp.
482600	487720	So justice served as a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared
487720	489960	love of extra judicial violence.
489960	494040	But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.
494040	498480	On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one
498480	502280	commenter says, that's a justice boner for me.
502280	509120	I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me and kick the life out of them.
509120	510120	Criminal fail.
510120	511760	Prank gone wrong.
511760	519160	So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off putting
519160	520560	to some people.
520560	525560	As one disgruntled former justice serve subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos
525560	527760	of assholes getting their comeuppance.
527840	533520	Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.
533520	535120	Everything is black and white with them.
535120	539540	If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving them
539540	542840	a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.
542840	543840	Unsubscribed.
543840	549200	But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their
549200	550200	comeuppance.
550200	555440	I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.
555440	560360	There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games, win stupid
560360	568200	prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced
568200	575160	to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people
575160	580360	getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right wing feel
580360	581360	to it.
581360	587520	Like to police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes shotgun
587520	591520	blasts to the balls, Arizona.
591520	592520	Just Arizona.
592520	593520	What more is there to say?
593520	594520	Arizona.
594520	595520	Justice served.
595520	596520	Punished.
596520	600960	It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're going
600960	604600	to kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this
604600	607920	longing for retribution is distinctively right wing.
607920	613560	Left wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.
613560	618360	Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.
618360	623520	Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?
623520	624520	Karma.
624520	626480	And she got her husband fired.
626480	629880	Dumb bitch really should have minded her business, love to see it.
629880	635440	She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in
635440	638520	jail for at least six months.
638520	640520	Firing them was not enough.
640520	643680	Life in prison.
643680	646600	Life in prison.
646600	651720	An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his
651720	656200	power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced
656200	661440	to serve 263 years in prison.
661440	664840	He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.
664840	671680	And of course there's the much savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.
671680	673640	Let's watch it now.
673640	680680	Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.
680680	685400	It's Pepe's become kind of assembled.
685400	691040	That was informative, but let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people
691040	697640	just enjoyed watching an NAZI get what he deserved.
697640	698640	Justice served.
698640	699640	Punished.
699640	700640	Smashing.
700640	706280	Very happy they found who you will remember to smash subscribe.
706280	712400	So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically
712400	717080	a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.
717080	723160	The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing
723160	726120	the suffering of someone who deserves it.
726120	730760	Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.
730760	735480	The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and
735480	737760	someone who's hiding bodies in the crawl space.
737760	742040	It puts the lotion on its skin, Mia.
742040	747800	But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.
747800	750280	It's why we love stories about revenge.
750280	760640	Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.
760640	765080	Revenge is such a popular plotline because it's easy for people to identify with a
765080	770600	revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles
770600	771680	of violence.
771680	775960	This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey by Homer.
775960	779960	I stole this copy from my high school, and I stole this copy from my college.
779960	781640	I still just read the sparknotes.
781640	782640	Well let's read it now.
782640	785480	See, I knew this would be useful someday.
785480	788260	God, he's such a fuckboy.
788260	790320	What does Athena see in this man?
790320	791320	Must be really odd.
791320	793440	Okay, I'm ready for my book report.
793440	798480	So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to
798480	805960	the island of Ithaca after, um, okay, so in the prequel, Odysseus' shitty friend Menelaus
805960	810800	throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually
810800	811800	attracted to.
811800	812800	How dare she?
812800	818120	So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would
818120	821120	do and blowing off some steam at femboy's symposium.
821120	825520	Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of
825520	830920	men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.
830920	835960	So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors
835960	842560	as payback, and then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and
842560	844120	he has them all hanged.
844120	849520	And this one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose
849520	854520	and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.
854520	859960	And reading this, I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?
859960	864400	Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?
864400	868080	I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kind of kills it for me.
868080	872080	I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause
872080	875520	men love hearing about assholes, that's why they watch my channel.
875520	879920	But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.
879920	886440	The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors, and to his, uh, his slaves.
886440	887440	Yikes.
887440	888440	Disappointing.
888440	893080	Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves, it isn't a good look.
893080	896280	Wow, this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.
896280	899600	Oh my god, this contact is fully horizontal.
899600	902440	This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts, fuck this.
902440	904160	It just seems disproportionate, you know?
904160	908200	Like it's not even eye for an eye, because the suitors didn't kill anyone, they were
908200	910640	basically just rude to Odysseus.
910640	913840	But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.
913840	918920	They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it, but
918920	919920	whatever will play along.
919920	922680	So that was an affront to Odysseus' honor.
922680	928400	And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.
928400	930840	Because this was a pre-legal society.
930840	936200	No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck 12.
936200	940980	So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people
940980	945340	from stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing
945340	947120	causing them to murder each other.
947120	950800	Because back then honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage
950800	951800	of.
951800	955440	If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themself into your house and
955440	960320	drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, cause
960320	962240	then people will walk all over you.
962240	966920	So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person
966920	968600	who is not to be messed with.
968600	972080	It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.
972080	976840	Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.
976840	980240	It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.
980240	985920	We call it toxic masculinity now, because in our society it's destructive and dysfunctional.
985920	989440	We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.
989440	993960	As society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.
993960	996800	I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.
996800	1001520	Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Fenboy's Symposium.
1001520	1004520	Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.
1004520	1009000	But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not
1009000	1014800	an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve
1014800	1021120	conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.
1021120	1026360	It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.
1026360	1030280	And the poison is vengeance, just as served.
1030280	1034720	So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.
1034720	1039920	The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first
1039920	1042960	paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.
1043960	1045760	I am very smart, meow.
1045760	1050800	But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.
1050800	1054600	An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?
1054600	1059440	If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try
1059440	1061360	to get revenge by killing you.
1061360	1062360	It's a cycle.
1062360	1064200	A cycle of smashing.
1064200	1068440	At the end of The Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together
1068440	1071280	and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.
1071280	1075040	And literally the last thing that happens in The Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,
1075040	1081640	who has an inexplicable lady boner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by just making the
1081640	1084720	families forget that Odysseus killed their children.
1084720	1088600	So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence.
1088600	1093560	But in reality, that doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades
1093560	1094960	or even centuries.
1094960	1099500	In Albania, there's an ancient code called the canon, which requires a family to commit
1099500	1103580	murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.
1103580	1105620	Life for life, blood for blood.
1105620	1110380	This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,
1110380	1113940	and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of Northern Albania.
1113940	1118260	There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the
1118260	1122580	rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,
1122580	1123580	they'll be murdered.
1123580	1128620	Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed
1128620	1132460	to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.
1132460	1136340	These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange
1136340	1137740	for getting to live as men.
1137740	1141940	There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially
1141940	1146480	recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name Uwu, act as head
1146480	1150900	of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of
1150900	1151900	a man.
1151900	1153940	Extremely happy trans sounds, Uwu.
1153940	1157900	I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have
1157900	1162700	been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to
1162700	1164300	support trans rights.
1164300	1166980	No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.
1166980	1169580	Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender.
1169580	1170580	Most were compelled to-
1170580	1171580	Yeah, I know that, sweaty.
1171580	1172940	It was just a joke, okay?
1172940	1173940	Calm down.
1173940	1179340	Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,
1179340	1180340	religions.
1180340	1184700	I'm worried if I give a real example, I'll be cancelled for seeming neutral about a conflict
1184700	1186740	where I'm supposed to take a side.
1186740	1194180	So, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that the cat girls bomb the dog girls,
1194180	1198860	and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that cycle repeats for a few decades.
1198860	1203380	And by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against
1203380	1207300	each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.
1207300	1209940	Extremely angry gay sounds, meow.
1209940	1213900	So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.
1213900	1218220	It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.
1218220	1222940	So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos
1222940	1223940	caused by vengeance.
1223940	1228700	And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system.
1228700	1229700	2.
1229700	1230700	Retribution.
1230700	1236260	The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined this state
1236260	1240300	as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.
1240300	1245540	In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long
1245540	1248060	as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.
1248060	1252340	But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.
1252340	1256500	In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law
1256500	1263700	codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as history times.
1263700	1265940	The code of Hammurabi looked like this.
1265940	1271500	The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.
1271500	1276220	I mean, it was like a thousand years ago, so I'm sure they were doing their best.
1276220	1277620	It's very good, sweetie.
1277620	1279940	I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.
1279940	1282580	Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?
1282580	1287260	Sort of a spinal tap stone henge situation.
1287260	1291420	The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in
1291420	1294180	the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.
1294180	1297900	Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried, sort of.
1297900	1299500	Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.
1299500	1300500	That's content, right?
1300500	1303580	Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.
1303580	1306900	Neosqueen.
1306900	1308580	We don't deserve rights.
1308580	1314540	So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment is Y.
1314540	1319420	Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.
1319420	1321060	That's extremely valid.
1321060	1325900	If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, you are not
1325900	1329020	my father or my mother, his tongue shall be caught off.
1329020	1331380	Well, at least they're standing up for adoptive parents.
1331380	1335700	If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.
1335700	1338100	Now we're getting into some of the classics.
1338100	1341620	If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.
1341620	1347220	If a freed man strike the body of another freed man, he shall pay ten shekels in money.
1347220	1352180	But if the slave of a freed man strike the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut
1352180	1353180	off.
1353180	1355860	Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.
1355860	1358260	So it's like our legal system, except honest.
1358260	1362520	If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house
1362520	1367200	which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.
1367200	1371700	If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.
1371700	1372700	Love that.
1373260	1378580	So by modern standards, the code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.
1378580	1380140	The vibrations are very negative.
1380140	1383820	It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe
1383820	1384820	killer all around.
1384820	1389060	But you have to credit Hammurabi's code for resolving the problem of honor-driven
1389060	1390060	revenge cycles.
1390060	1394340	You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against
1394340	1399940	their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the
1399940	1404580	elders of the city who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.
1404580	1408840	So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante
1408840	1412460	revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.
1412460	1414340	Let's list all the differences.
1414340	1417820	Revenge is personal in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.
1417820	1420700	It's often emotional, an act of passion.
1420700	1425180	It can be disproportionate as an Odysseus killing the suitors for his squatting in his
1425180	1426180	palace.
1426180	1427180	And it's sadistic.
1427180	1429420	It's satisfying to the avenger.
1429420	1430420	Revenge is sweet.
1430420	1435060	On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal in the sense that the
1435060	1439100	punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.
1439100	1444220	It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion and also lacking the
1444220	1446260	sadism of sweet revenge.
1446260	1449340	It's also proportionate, again in theory.
1449340	1453820	You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than
1453820	1454820	an eye.
1454820	1459220	And that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's family
1459220	1460220	for an eye.
1460220	1464780	And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for
1464780	1465780	the same crime.
1465780	1469300	I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about
1469300	1470300	it?
1470300	1471300	Just pay some gold.
1471300	1472300	It's fine.
1472300	1473300	Girl, these contacts, like...
1473300	1479820	So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which
1479820	1485060	is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.
1485060	1490980	Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.
1490980	1498500	However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.
1498500	1503020	It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.
1503020	1508780	If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.
1508780	1513740	In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out
1513740	1519900	the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of
1519900	1520900	way.
1520900	1525760	Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body
1525760	1530180	part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the
1530180	1534500	breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced
1534500	1535500	its parents.
1535660	1540300	There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of
1540300	1541940	punishment and crime.
1541940	1546620	For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.
1546620	1551700	Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down.
1551700	1554660	Besides, founders were just arrested for extortion.
1554660	1555660	Here are their mugshots.
1555660	1561180	There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful
1561180	1562180	cosmic harmony.
1562540	1567060	And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct
1567060	1569140	that's difficult to get rid of.
1569140	1571940	But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.
1571940	1578220	The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists,
1578220	1583980	messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.
1583980	1589300	One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.
1589300	1593820	And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called
1593820	1595660	Jesus of Nazareth.
1595660	1600060	Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to
1600060	1601540	the Code of Hammurabi.
1601540	1606380	Like in the book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches
1606380	1608460	of Hammurabi classics.
1608460	1612780	Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.
1612780	1616780	If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but
1616780	1621140	there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband
1621140	1622500	demands in the court allows.
1622500	1627780	But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for
1627780	1634180	tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,
1634180	1640380	head pats for head pats, welcome to Cat Girl Bible Study, new, extremely devotional gay
1640380	1641620	sound Zulu.
1641620	1643700	I feel very spiritually aroused right now.
1643700	1646260	My third eye chakra, dripping.
1646260	1649860	Macaroni in a pot.
1649860	1650860	I need Jesus.
1650860	1654460	So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.
1654460	1660660	It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.
1660660	1665020	But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.
1665020	1671740	In Matthew 26-52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays
1671740	1672740	him.
1672740	1677300	Jesus says, put your sword back in his place Spartacus, all who draw the sword will die
1677300	1678300	by the sword.
1678300	1683100	Now some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced even
1683100	1687780	to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism, denying the
1687780	1691620	right of marginalized people to defend themselves.
1691620	1692620	Rethink this.
1692620	1693620	It gets worse.
1693620	1698740	In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
1698740	1699740	you.
1699740	1702380	Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.
1702380	1708180	No loving, smashing, but maybe Jesus wasn't as literal minded as that.
1708180	1713740	You know, religion is a very subjective thing and I have my own Bible interpretations and
1713740	1720820	my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.
1720820	1723180	Like consider Matthew 538.
1723180	1725300	Why is no one talking about Matthew 538?
1725300	1729980	Jesus says, you've heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
1729980	1735020	but I say to you, do not resist an evil doer, but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek,
1735020	1736780	turn the other also.
1736780	1740260	Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.
1740260	1747540	Someone strikes you across the face and you go, ugh, this is not pacifism, this is passive
1747540	1751300	aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.
1751300	1758500	This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus at
1758500	1764860	face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing
1764860	1769620	is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.
1769620	1776060	In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment
1776060	1779820	and anger the victims of injustice experience.
1779820	1784700	And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about
1784700	1789540	serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take
1789540	1792220	care of that when the day of judgment comes.
1792220	1796580	It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism there's the idea of karma, which is like
1796580	1803820	a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.
1803820	1809460	You reap what you sow, basically, so maybe don't worry about injustice too much because
1809460	1811140	karma will take care of it.
1811140	1814620	This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy.
1814620	1819100	The cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good.
1819100	1820740	Everything happens for a reason.
1820740	1825580	If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say there's a
1825580	1829620	special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.
1829620	1833700	And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished
1833700	1835460	by fire demons or whatever.
1835460	1840940	People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved
1840940	1842100	injustice.
1842100	1846300	In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.
1846300	1848620	Why do bad things happen to good people?
1848620	1851500	And the answer is just don't worry about it.
1851500	1852500	It's part of God's plan.
1852500	1854100	It'll all work out in the end.
1854100	1855100	It's fine.
1855100	1856100	Everything's fine.
1856100	1862180	The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very
1862180	1868380	not good, in which case you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe
1868380	1869540	changing some things.
1869540	1873580	I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not all religion, and obviously many political
1873580	1878700	activists have been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.
1878700	1879700	3.
1879700	1880700	Utilitarianism
1880700	1887220	So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as
1887220	1890340	something other than retaliation.
1890340	1895020	Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve
1895020	1899380	society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.
1899380	1903500	Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes
1903500	1907100	the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.
1907100	1912140	So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,
1912140	1916820	where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.
1916820	1921620	Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive
1921620	1927420	for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation
1927420	1931660	of criminals trying to educate or discipline them so that they can re-interest society.
1931660	1936220	A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than
1936220	1939260	retribution, which is very based in emotions.
1939260	1945020	Also, the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense even if you don't believe in free will.
1945020	1949140	Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their
1949140	1955220	actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior and can be deserving of punishment.
1955220	1959900	Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems… well,
1959900	1964740	the Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the
1964740	1969860	sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.
1969860	1971620	Which seems irrational, right?
1971620	1973060	To punish a force of nature?
1973060	1975260	Leave my beautiful white wife alone!
1975260	1980340	It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our
1980340	1986260	genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus
1986260	1992060	in our natal chart, dry, oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take
1992060	1994020	all of that into consideration.
1994020	1997940	You might get a later sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took you
1997940	1998940	to Disneyland.
1998940	2000820	It was a crime of passion.
2000820	2005060	Through no fault of my own, I was high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion,
2005060	2006060	your honor.
2006060	2009580	A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian.
2009580	2015140	Like, prisons are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.
2015140	2020100	But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are
2020100	2021700	not doing very much correcting.
2021700	2022700	I'm sorry.
2022700	2027740	In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,
2027740	2031340	and 76% are re-arrested within five years.
2031340	2034460	And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.
2034460	2037260	Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say,
2037260	2038260	Good.
2038260	2039940	I hope he rots in prison.
2039940	2044100	Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, Good.
2044100	2049020	The proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him
2049020	2051300	a contributing member of his community.
2051300	2055740	So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative
2055740	2059900	function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.
2059900	2065660	I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often
2065660	2068060	offensive to human emotions.
2068060	2071140	And you can say, effects don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our
2071140	2075860	legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with
2075860	2076860	you.
2076860	2081260	But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,
2081260	2086140	you want to set him on fire, and this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion
2086140	2087780	affects law enforcement too.
2087780	2092740	A YouTuber called Jose has a video called, Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,
2092740	2096900	which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher because they relate to
2096900	2102940	his military background while fantasizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism.
2102940	2107060	Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like,
2107060	2111900	Castle doesn't see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system
2111900	2116660	is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder victims of crime
2116660	2118900	from getting the justice they deserve.
2118900	2122980	Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam's razor for the military.
2122980	2127180	Don't worry about uniforms, inspections, or restrictive rules of engagement.
2127180	2130780	Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.
2130780	2133180	Any true warrior, that's the dream.
2133180	2138780	So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions
2138780	2142220	that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.
2142220	2147500	You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren't for all these pesky laws.
2147740	2152300	There's a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview.
2152300	2155100	Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.
2155100	2159940	Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good guy with a gun
2159940	2162180	to stop a bad guy with a gun.
2162180	2165300	These only eight-year-old boys playing cops and robbers.
2165300	2167620	Good guys and bad guys.
2167620	2170220	Pia pia pia pia pia pia pia pia.
2170220	2171860	That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.
2171860	2175660	And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.
2175660	2179660	People love justice served and instant karma videos for a reason.
2179660	2184740	We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution.
2184740	2189260	But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don't allow for that.
2189260	2193820	There's all these tedious roadblocks, right to an attorney, right to remain silent,
2193820	2196700	right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.
2196700	2201580	A lot of police wish they could simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner.
2201580	2205700	But the function of police is supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating
2205700	2207100	criminal investigations.
2207100	2212380	They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing freeform retribution
2212380	2217420	in the streets at will, justice served, now with 20% more police brutality.
2217420	2221660	But a lot of people defend the police when they behave like this, because the thin-wristed
2221660	2226660	civilians are just as emotionally frustrated by due process as the cops.
2226660	2229420	Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?
2229420	2230420	I'm double-cancelled.
2230420	2235140	Well, look, all lives are bastards, but only some bastards are armed by the state and
2235140	2237580	licensed to go bastarding around town.
2237580	2240500	The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.
2240500	2245060	I also think there's a secular version of the just world fallacy going on here.
2245060	2249540	People like to think that if the police kills somebody, it must be because that person did
2249540	2250940	something wrong.
2250940	2253340	Karma at work, justice served.
2253340	2256860	Victim blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.
2256860	2261860	You get what you deserve, so if something bad happens to you, you must have been asking
2261860	2262860	for it.
2262860	2266660	And obviously, racism is a huge part of this, you know, there's structural white supremacy
2266660	2271140	that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities, and people
2271140	2275140	are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as criminal thugs and therefore
2275140	2277100	deserving of police violence.
2277100	2281260	So we get this no-angel discourse that comes up every time a black person is murdered by
2281260	2285380	the police, where they bring up the victim's criminal record or picture of them looking
2285380	2286540	like a scary thug.
2286540	2288980	As if that proves they deserve to die.
2288980	2293060	The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel.
2293060	2295340	There are no angels walking this earth.
2295340	2296340	We're all flawed.
2296340	2297740	We've all made mistakes.
2297740	2299140	We've all done bad things.
2299140	2301940	That doesn't mean we deserve to die a violent death.
2301940	2305660	And then there's people like Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know
2305660	2310060	were about as close to angels as humans come, but that didn't protect them.
2310060	2314740	So that is 100% beside the point, because black people in America should not literally
2314740	2319540	have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be murdered by the
2319540	2320540	police.
2320540	2324260	In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low-life, drug-addicted petty
2324260	2328980	criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be executed by
2328980	2332900	the cops because that's what it's supposed to mean to live in a free country.
2332900	2334540	So things need to change.
2334540	2338140	The Punisher Police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice system with
2338140	2339140	them.
2339140	2343460	We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice, and to be honest, that might take
2343460	2344460	more than one YouTube video.
2344460	2350620	I know at the beginning I said I was going to explain what justice is, but, um...
2350620	2351620	I lied.
2351620	2354900	I'm sorry that I can't fix America.
2354900	2356580	I'm just a lonely cat.
2356580	2360020	I guess the only solution is revolution.
2360020	2363420	And by revolution, I do mean to vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into actually
2363420	2365060	doing something.
2365060	2373060	And if they don't listen, well, hang on, let me get this.
2374060	2375060	Mosho Moshi!
2375060	2377060	Hey, how are you, taste?
2403060	2410060	How are you?
2433060	2440060	How are you?
2463060	2470060	How are you?
2493060	2500060	How are you?
2523060	2530060	How are you?
2553060	2560060	How are you?
2583060	2590060	How are you?
