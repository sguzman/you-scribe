36140	47740	One, hello darkness, hello children, it is I, the darkness within.
47740	52020	So you know how life is like kind of bad?
52020	53340	Well what are you going to do about that?
53340	55700	I mean there's a few things you can do.
55700	59980	First you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.
59980	65500	That's probably the most effective approach eventually but the problem is that it's hard
65500	71820	and I don't like things that are hard because when you do things that are hard you have
71820	77300	to feel bad now so that you can feel good later and I don't want to feel good later.
77300	82620	I want to feel good now and if you want to feel good now well you have a couple options.
82620	88500	The first is of course to do drugs and I've tried that I spent most of my 20s on the threshold
88500	93500	of alcoholism but it turns out that's not a cute look for me it's not my vibe so what
93500	98340	I do now when I feel the darkness coming is what any respectable woman would do.
98340	102580	I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.
102580	107740	Is it a pee under my mattress your majesty or is it another Xanax I left under the throat
107740	108740	rug?
108740	112660	Now the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off you feel bad again.
112660	115540	In fact you probably feel worse.
115540	117660	So where do we go from here?
117660	119460	Well how about music?
119940	125420	When you feel bad you want to listen to sad music because sad music makes you cry.
125420	127900	And crying feels good.
127900	130620	It's like an orgasm for sad people.
130620	134140	And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?
134140	136860	The sound of silence by Simon and Garfunkel.
136860	137860	You know.
137860	141180	I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.
141580	144700	Hello darkness my old friend.
144700	148460	But in the memes you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.
148460	150940	You only hear hello darkness my old friend.
150940	155220	And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song which is good because if you're making
155220	161020	songs for sad people it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.
161020	164020	Because sad people don't like happy songs.
164020	168960	When you're sad happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.
168960	173680	There were 10 seconds into the song, hello darkness my old friend, the key is D sharp
173680	174680	minor.
174680	176200	The saddest of all keys.
176200	181440	But when we get to the next line, because of vision softly creeping, something happens.
181440	182440	Let's listen.
182440	190800	Come to talk with you again Because of vision softly creeping
190800	192280	Ah!
192280	193600	What was that?
193600	199200	Suddenly a major chord, an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds, and every
199200	204560	peach fuzz hair on the back of my biologically female Nax stands on end.
204560	205560	Hello light.
205560	211040	So the song has enticed me with its promise of company for misery and then it has tricked
211040	212600	me into feeling good.
212600	214660	And that's what I like about art.
214660	219360	It takes the standard disappointments and humiliations of life and cooks them into something
219360	221160	worth getting off the floor for.
221160	225560	Unfortunately I don't really play music much anymore because my hands are too beautiful
225560	228360	for instruments and my singing voice sounds like a man.
228360	233320	So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to.
233320	234320	Comedy.
234320	236840	And I especially like dark comedy.
236840	240560	You know, comedy about the things in life that are the most painful.
240560	243480	To me, Dark Hammer is kind of like a sad song.
243480	247840	It takes your worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twists them into a source of
247840	248840	pleasure.
248840	251560	Don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?
251560	252560	Ah!
252560	256680	A lot of the time that means joking about topics that an ordinary life are considered
256680	257680	taboo.
257680	261960	You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
261960	266200	Without the ability to joke and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing, substance
266200	270920	abuse, gender dysphoria, I mean I'd probably be on the floor right now looking for that
270920	271920	Xanax.
271920	275880	But this puts me in a difficult situation because I want to defend my sense of humor
275880	279920	which I feel is like the core of my personality and what keeps me alive.
279920	283920	But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture who are really
283920	291320	big on defending provocative, controversial, politically incorrect comedy are kind of umâ€¦
291320	292320	dick nuggets?
292320	293720	Let's discuss this.
293720	298360	And by discuss, I mean use it quietly and I'll tell you what to think.
298360	299440	2.
299440	300440	Dick Nuggets
300440	305840	So the year 2016 had just begun and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.
305840	311320	Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian, was ranting on Twitter for days
311320	315840	and days about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.
315840	319360	This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais, a man whose personal branding screams,
319360	325160	I don't care about your feelings, I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs,
325160	329360	I am too much of a badass rebel to care what minorities think.
329680	336120	But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass, irreverent, not caring about
336120	338520	your feelings kind of month.
338520	339520	Why?
339520	344320	Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes
344320	346400	about ol' Tranma, Caitlyn Jenner.
346400	350960	But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight, I've changed.
350960	353360	Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.
353360	356200	That's cutting edge material there, Rick.
356200	360920	Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist, ooh.
360920	365520	I mean I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage, but honestly the joke wasn't
365520	369720	even as transphobic as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.
369720	374480	Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it, and Ricky spent the rest
374480	378600	of the month tweeting about how offending people is good actually, and he definitely
378600	380680	doesn't care that people were offended.
380680	385200	But clearly, Twitter got to him, because two years later, he opened his Netflix special
385200	391120	with a 13 minute bit rehashing the incident, and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent
391120	392120	jokes.
392120	394200	Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?
394200	401880	Well, I am a chimp, if I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp, pre-op, but um, and don't ever
401880	407240	deadname me, don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again, from now on you call me Bobo.
407240	409880	Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?
409880	415120	Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage in a $20 million comedy special?
415120	419760	My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passe and overdone, it also
419760	424360	doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe that trans women are delusional men,
424360	427040	and even then, it's just not very funny.
427040	429120	But am I offended by the joke?
429120	434960	Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny, and as a great
434960	440520	comedian named Ricky Gervais once said, to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,
440520	443000	badly delivered, and not funny enough.
443000	448400	So by that measure, yes, I'd say this I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.
448400	451200	But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.
451200	455440	I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle it seems like
455440	458280	our culture repeats about once a week.
458280	462740	Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke, and other people are indignant
462740	464920	about the fact that those people are offended.
464920	469000	The cycle usually gets framed as a battle in a culture war that's supposedly going
469000	474840	on between generation snowflake easily triggered humorless peasy cucks and badass edgy nothing
474840	476760	off limits free speech truth tellers.
476760	482600	Now if this really is a culture war between two sides, then I am a double agent because
482600	487680	I'm a generation snowflake peasy cuck who loves dank edgy memes, and I've found myself
487680	491460	on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.
491460	495360	So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian for some shitty trans
495360	499360	joke, my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.
499360	504240	But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.
504240	508640	And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living, I
508640	515920	appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy
515920	520480	while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.
520480	525280	So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles and
525280	529800	try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.
529800	531480	What is the purpose of comedy?
531480	533720	What is it that makes comedy good or bad?
533720	536840	Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?
536840	539800	Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?
539800	544560	Is it, as Aristotle said, the imitation of worse than average men?
544560	548240	Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?
548240	550760	Well I don't think there's a single objective answer.
550760	553040	I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.
553040	557200	But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?
557200	560560	And by we, again, I do mean me.
560560	563200	The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouth shut.
563200	564200	3.
564200	565200	Straw men.
565200	569840	So as a trans woman up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes
569840	574040	are funny, a lot of haters and losers out there are probably going to try to straw
574040	575040	man me.
575040	579640	Did you just assume the straw person's gender?
580360	584360	Since people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.
584360	587240	Here's the straw person's assholes.
587240	588320	Straw person one.
588320	591560	You hate free speech and are trying to silence comedians.
591560	594680	I'm not trying to silence anyone.
594680	600200	Comedians can say whatever they want on stage and I can say whatever I want about them.
600200	601360	Straw person two.
601360	604520	You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.
604520	610720	I transitioned on YouTube making controversial political content all the while and I read
610720	611840	the comments.
611840	616240	My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.
616240	621120	Of course I do not have the internalized self-loathing that has damaged my psyche irreparably, but
621120	623000	sweetie, who doesn't?
623000	624400	Straw person three.
624400	627520	You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.
627520	630960	I invented joking about trans people.
630960	632520	Ever heard of the mouth feel?
632520	633520	I'm that tran.
633520	634520	That's right.
634520	640080	If I die tomorrow, my legacy will be that I applied wine tasting terminology to fellatio
640080	642240	and I accept my destiny.
642240	645400	Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.
645400	647440	I live for trans jokes.
647440	651240	I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them because they don't know enough
651240	653840	about trans people to know what the funny things are.
653840	657280	And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.
657280	661680	Like you used to live as one gender and then you became a different gender.
661680	664880	Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.
664880	666840	But humor is in the details.
666840	670680	And Ricky Gervais does not know the details because he's clearly never been close to
670680	674880	a trans person and that's why he's still telling these Tinkertoy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner
674880	675880	jokes.
675880	676880	And it's too bad.
676880	680320	Because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark
680320	681320	stuff too.
681320	684880	I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline calling her hormones titty skittles.
684880	686680	No, I like the edgy stuff.
686680	688280	I like being on the edge.
688280	692280	Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.
692280	696840	Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy that I'd like to share with you because
696840	701640	when you're doing art criticism it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.
701640	706400	And the exemplary work I have in mind is one not a lot of people are talking about yet
706400	711120	but which I have no qualms placing in the same company as the works of Dante or Swift.
711120	715840	I am of course referring to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.
715880	719200	If you don't know who Gigi is, first of all who even are you, do you have no respect
719200	720200	for legends?
720200	725180	She's a trans YouTuber like the trans YouTuber whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids
725180	729800	and I had sex with a dog long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.
729800	735320	But in this critic's opinion, the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt the
735320	738720	singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.
738720	740040	Let's do a close reading.
740040	741040	4.
741040	742640	Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience
742640	746200	A great work of literature is never just a text.
746200	751320	It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson would call a moment within
751320	753640	an intertextual dialectic.
753640	754640	Love that.
754640	758920	Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience within its proper context.
758920	762400	Several months earlier Gigi had released a video about how she and her girlfriend were
762400	767760	trying to have a child so far without success and so they went to see a fertility specialist.
767760	772120	Apparently Gigi was not aware that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile
772120	775960	which girl they tell you like seven times before you start hormones.
775960	776960	Like how?
776960	778160	We'll move past it.
778160	782360	A few months later the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone
782360	786520	cause that's right I clicked the bell and immediately I knew I was about to experience
786520	787600	something special.
787600	791960	The thumbnail for this video is so much greater than anything I've ever conceived of that
791960	795920	honestly it makes me feel like a failure both as a YouTuber and as a woman.
795920	801160	The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature, the eyes are dotted with hearts
801160	803080	and her facial expression.
803080	804080	Ew.
804080	805080	Come.
805080	809920	The video begins with Gigi explaining that in order to produce a sample for the clinic
809920	812640	she had to stop taking hormones for three months.
812640	817400	So I hesitantly agreed I was like fine I will stop all of my hormones so you know my shit
817400	820520	can get juicy again and I can get a good little sample up in here.
820520	824760	The sperm bank day arrives she goes to the clinic and approaches the receptionist.
824800	832360	And I said yes ma'am I am here to give sperm from me to be frozen now.
832360	836680	The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room which she describes with the precision
836680	838160	of mama Flaubert.
838160	841040	I walk into this room fluorescent lighting the house.
841040	845120	I was like I can see every pore in my arm like Jesus what do they want me to do here?
845120	850160	And then the kicker this like leather couch the back is kind of like angled so I guess
850160	853000	like you can lean and really get into it or something.
853000	858400	The doctor offers her lubrication pornography if needed and a donation cup Gigi closes the
858400	860000	door and gets to work.
860000	864280	I get in the mood I get in the zone and I'm killing it bitch I am like I'm going to give
864280	869000	the best sample ever my kid is going to be a godsend child before I know it the moment
869000	874960	has crept up on me it happened and it's been so long that it hits the wall behind me.
874960	879920	And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgias gets up off the leather couch
880000	885360	and attempts to scrape a prodigious quantity of Gigi Gism off the wall of a fluorescent
885360	889400	lit exam room in a desperate final bid to become a mother.
889400	893000	And I took the cup and I was like full on like scraping it off the wall because I was
893000	896200	like I'm not going to let any little drop go to waste you know I'm here this is like
896200	897200	my moment.
897200	901240	I'm trying to understand why this video makes me laugh so much it's really the contrast
901240	906160	of style and substance like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person told this story
906320	911000	It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine storytelling style and this real housewives
911000	917160	diction but the story itself is about blasting a giant load onto a wall of a room full of
917160	918720	leather and pornography.
918720	923720	The dissonance between form and content is genius and that dissonance perfectly captures
923720	928640	the absurdity of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness that Ricky Gervais could
928640	929640	only dream of.
929640	933800	I also really relate to this story because right before I started Hormones I decided
933800	938800	to freeze a sample of my own so I too have a sperm bank experience.
938800	942360	And it was exactly like Gigi describes down to every detail.
942360	946440	It is not a dignified moment ladies there is just no way to feel like a woman while
946440	951160	you're hastily rubbing one out in an over lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.
951160	954160	I feel so fish right now.
954160	956760	For this five minutes in the exam room I was a man.
956760	960720	Now I somehow managed to get most of my sample into the cup but there's a different absurd
960720	962080	detail to my story.
962080	966560	The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork that I was depositing because
966560	970800	I was going to start feminizing hormones and he asked me if there was a name I preferred
970800	971800	he called me.
971800	974680	In retrospect he was actually really sweet and really cute.
974680	977800	Not that anything was going to come of that at the time since I was pretty everything
977800	979440	and rough around the edges.
979440	983360	To be honest I was all edges but he asked me for my preferred name and I just blurted
983360	984360	out Natalie.
984360	989000	And so this was actually the first time anyone ever called me by my biological name and it
989000	990000	went like this.
990000	994840	The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me and said right this way Natalie here's
994840	996800	a cup for you to bust a nut in.
996800	1000840	And that's how my life as a woman began.
1000840	1004760	Now in the end Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.
1004760	1006440	Her sample wasn't usable.
1006440	1010400	She wanted to have a child with her own DNA but she's been on hormones too long and she
1010400	1011400	just can't.
1011400	1014800	And that revelation at the end of the video kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole
1014800	1015800	story.
1015800	1020360	In the ridiculous image of Gigi scraping a jackalit off the wall I now see this primal
1020360	1023280	maternal urge to produce and protect children.
1023280	1027360	I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen prematurely from the nest.
1027360	1030060	I see the virgin Mary cradling her child.
1030060	1034160	I really really thought that I was going to have a good sample and I was going to be able
1034160	1038640	to participate in having a baby with my DNA but it's just not in the cards for me.
1038640	1042320	And I really wanted to make this video more positive and funny because there is nothing
1042320	1043320	I can do.
1043320	1045240	And that's exactly it.
1045240	1047320	That is the darkness.
1047320	1048320	5.
1048320	1049600	The darkness.
1049600	1054320	The darkness is my name for what I consider the highest form of comedy where you take
1054320	1059680	your own worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twist them into a source of pleasure.
1059680	1063680	The darkness is Richard Pryor running down the street in flames because he set himself
1063680	1065920	on fire in a coke field psychosis.
1065920	1070480	The darkness is Gigi gorgeous scraping her own prodigious jism off the wall of an exam
1070480	1073380	room in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.
1073380	1077140	If you can make these low points funny then you're going to be okay.
1077140	1078260	You're going to survive.
1078260	1079740	You're going to make it through life.
1079740	1084860	And I need that now more than ever because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty
1084860	1085860	dark.
1085860	1089820	But trans people make it through because we're good humored and strong as fuck.
1089820	1093780	Pretty soon I'm going to have to stop hormones before an operation and I'm terrified of
1093780	1094780	that.
1094780	1095780	What's going to happen to me when I stop hormones?
1095780	1097260	Am I going to become a man again?
1097260	1099100	Because I don't know if I can handle that.
1099100	1102820	I am thinking about names though like maybe Nathan or Jaden.
1102940	1104660	I can see myself as a Jaden.
1104660	1108300	See I've got to have my little jokey jokes or I don't think I can make it through this.
1108300	1113460	Like when I have bottom surgery I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as my sex
1113460	1116240	change operation because it makes me laugh.
1116240	1117440	It brings me joy.
1117440	1120980	Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.
1120980	1124940	Now it's important to notice that just because it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean it's
1124940	1127140	a politically correct euphemism.
1127140	1131740	Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change because you're literally
1131740	1133100	not changing your sex.
1133100	1134740	That's not what surgery does.
1134740	1140220	But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness where they mistake edginess for
1140220	1144460	honesty, accuracy, and directness but these are very different things.
1144460	1149340	For example, George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms that has some great moments
1149340	1152340	but also some moments that are way off base.
1152340	1155180	For example, content warning ableist slur.
1155180	1160620	They say they're going to preboard those passengers in need of special assistance.
1160620	1170140	So look, I understand the aesthetic preference for simple, honest, direct language and the
1170140	1173020	repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.
1173020	1175460	That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.
1175460	1179260	But the word he just used is literally a slur so I wonder if what you're being honest
1179260	1182140	about is your feelings toward disabled people.
1182140	1186620	Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance is a little wordy sure but in this
1186620	1191180	situation it's actually more accurate since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,
1191180	1193100	anyone in need of assistance boarding.
1193100	1197540	So I call my gender confirmation surgery getting a sex change not because it's more direct
1197540	1203380	and honest but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated and that makes me laugh.
1203380	1207020	Not because I'm a fearless truth teller but because I'm a bad person.
1207020	1211860	And I get to call it my sex change operation but cis people don't get to call it that
1211860	1215140	because it's my darkness not yours.
1215140	1216140	Get your own darkness.
1216140	1220060	When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people he's being a hack because he knows nothing
1220060	1221060	of our darkness.
1221060	1225020	And when someone tries to joke about something that they're totally ignorant of the result
1225020	1228060	is usually clumsy, awkward and not very funny.
1228060	1233140	What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness
1233140	1235300	and turned it within.
1235300	1238620	Because within is where the darkness lies.
1238620	1239820	6.
1239820	1243500	Self-deprecation Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite
1243500	1248900	because as a lazy, selfish, preening, attention whore who looks like a slightly more passable
1248900	1253580	and culture with the voice of a tropical bird there is a lot of material here to work with.
1253580	1258500	But especially when it comes to the trans jokes there is a faction of the trans community
1258500	1262380	that is not amused by the buffoonery that goes on on this channel.
1262380	1267060	I think the objection to it is best summed up by the comic Hannah Gatsby who in her stand-up
1267060	1273060	special Nanette said that when self-deprecation comes from someone who exists in the margins
1273060	1277860	it's not humility, it's humiliation.
1277860	1280660	And to be honest I felt a little called out by that.
1280660	1286860	I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak.
1286860	1289460	And she's not wrong like that is how this works.
1289460	1294340	In order to gain an audience as a trans person you have to demonstrate what cis people call
1294340	1295340	self-awareness.
1295340	1301460	That is, you have to signal that you see yourself the way the audience sees you, which can mean
1301460	1304340	looking at yourself with a pretty merciless gaze.
1304340	1308740	And of course I'm happy to do that because I have no self-respect and laughter is the
1308740	1310060	only way to numb the pain.
1310060	1314760	But the terrible thing about being a not-normal with an audience is that you don't just get
1314760	1320340	to be yourself because whether you like it or not people will see you as a representative
1320340	1323260	of the community.
1323260	1327540	So because of that responsibility which I never asked for I have to balance out the
1327540	1331980	self-deprecation with a lot of positive messaging about my people.
1331980	1337460	And that way the dark jokes function as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis
1337460	1338780	go down.
1338780	1344460	But even without the group representation issue it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation
1344460	1345460	too far.
1345460	1350900	As I've said I have been diagnosed with an incurable edginess of temperament and I sometimes
1350900	1355560	do feel suffocated by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces even though those
1355560	1358440	spaces are there for good reason and a lot of people need them.
1358440	1363800	But sometimes this atmosphere of everything and everyone is valid all the time, no uncomfortable
1363800	1369840	questions may be asked, any self-deprecation is a sign of traumatic internalized bigotry,
1369840	1374000	I just need to get out of there for a while and find a place where I can relax and be
1374000	1375300	my edgy self.
1375300	1380360	I need a safe space for my edginess where I can just blurt out whatever stupid question
1380360	1384400	or joke comes to mind without being afraid that I'm going to inflict horrible trauma
1384400	1385920	on everyone around me.
1385920	1390720	So I call up another transsexual edgelady, you know, Kiki, accuse each other of being
1390720	1393720	cross-dressers and just laugh it all off.
1393720	1399160	And it's so so cathartic to do that but it does have to be done in moderation because
1399160	1403140	there can come a point where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.
1403140	1408160	And it mostly has to be done in private because in public you have to worry about how cis
1408160	1413120	people will interpret it and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating without
1413120	1415080	abandoning all social responsibility.
1415080	1421040	Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that instantly deadens all laughter, it's social responsibility.
1421040	1425100	But since it's kind of the central topic of the comedy culture war, I should probably
1425100	1429760	say something about it, even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back to jabbering
1429760	1431520	about my sex change.
1431520	1432520	7.
1432520	1434200	The eternal tension.
1434200	1436120	So what is a comedian's job?
1436120	1437720	What is a comedian supposed to do?
1437720	1442960	I suppose my ideal comedian is one who is perfectly able to balance the tension between
1442960	1445480	shitposting and snowflakery.
1445480	1448880	And this is an eternal tension and must never be resolved.
1448880	1452280	It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.
1452280	1458760	See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery, you get a moralist who might say that a comedian's
1458760	1463640	purpose is to promote justice by punching up, by speaking truth to power, by exposing
1463640	1465920	the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.
1465920	1470440	And these are all very admirable goals but they leave out what I think is the essential
1470440	1476400	purpose of comedy, which is to be funny, to surprise, to shock, to make people laugh.
1476400	1480280	It's kind of like how some art and media critics only ever evaluate a work based on
1480280	1484640	whether or not it's socially progressive and don't seem to really think about aesthetic
1484640	1489440	pleasure very much, which, to me, is the reason why art exists in the first place.
1489440	1494160	But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent and should probably be sent to the
1494160	1495160	guillotine at once.
1495160	1498240	Just let me do my makeup first so that when they hold my head up, everyone can see my
1498240	1500200	beat and their wings all fly to the Bastille.
1500200	1504560	Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram because that's gonna get a lot
1504560	1506000	of engagement.
1506000	1510320	So the opposite of the pure snowflake is the pure shit poster, who might say that a comedian's
1510320	1513680	purpose is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.
1513680	1518400	But that seems kind of barbaric since, like, if a guard at a prison camp is torturing an
1518400	1522280	inmate and the other guards are laughing, does that count as comedy?
1522280	1523640	Is a war crime funny?
1523640	1528160	Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.
1528160	1532040	The thing is, I don't think many comedians actually believe in a completely nihilistic
1532040	1533240	vision of comedy.
1533240	1536680	I think they sometimes pretend to when they're trying to evade criticism.
1536680	1541000	I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics and listen to the way they talk about
1541000	1543360	their heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.
1543360	1548440	There's always an element of admiration for bravery, risk, subversion, truth telling.
1548440	1552680	In other words, there's a concern there for what is virtuous and what is true, not
1552680	1554680	just for what makes people laugh.
1554680	1559280	So maybe, before we can even talk about what's funny, we have to have a level of shared agreement
1559280	1561600	about what is true and what is morally right.
1561600	1566040	My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes is not just that they're not funny.
1566040	1570720	I think he's wrong about trans people, and I think his ignorance is infectious.
1570720	1575400	I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience, which has the consequence
1575400	1578360	of making the world slightly scarier for people like me.
1578360	1581160	And this is edginess at its worst.
1581160	1586040	Just a privileged person with a platform punching down at a politically besieged group he understands
1586040	1587040	nothing about.
1587040	1591920	And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension collapses into pure shitposting.
1591920	1597080	It's boring and immature, like when someone says he wants to watch the world burn.
1597080	1601240	You only get to watch when you have the privilege of not being on fire.
1601240	1603920	It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.
1603920	1608840	The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.
1608840	1610560	Edginess is always adolescent.
1610560	1615040	The darkness is edginess, aged by time and pain.
1615040	1620400	And it's only at that full maturity that comedy becomes art, that it becomes comparable to
1620400	1621400	music.
1621400	1624600	So, those are my thoughts.
1624600	1627400	Like comment and subscribe.
1627400	1631200	The end.
1631200	1637120	And I'll sing the song.
1637120	1641000	I wish my brother George was here.
1641000	1657160	Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly
1657160	1664800	creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping.
1664800	1677800	And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains within the sound of silence.
1677800	1683800	In restless dreams I walked alone.
1683800	1697200	Narrow streets of cobblestone, beneath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar
1697200	1701080	to the cold and damp.
1701080	1711360	When my eyes were stopped by the flash of a neon light, I split the night and touched
1711360	1715920	the sound of silence.
1715920	1728000	And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more.
1728000	1733000	People talking without speaking.
1733000	1737640	People hearing without listening.
1737640	1744640	People writing songs that voices never share.
1744640	1757080	No one dared disturb the sound of silence.
1757080	1758440	Stay gorgeous.
