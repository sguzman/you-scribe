1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,920
messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,840
are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and alone

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,680
I came upon them, and the glory of my posts taught about me, and I delivered unto them

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
a vision.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Freedom, freedom, fuck in freedom, which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,480
or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jack-boo. As a centrist, I am

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,560
undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it. Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,760
of The Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,000
How dangerous are they? Muslims, can we stop them? Tonight we return once again to the dangerous

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,920
transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half and halfs and in-betweens.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,080
I mean look at this, they're transing 13 year olds now, what's next? Babies with breast implants?

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,800
It makes me want to throw up. I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,320
Cut the music. Tonight my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,640
conservative opinion haver, and my second guest, well what the hell are you? You're transgender,

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,960
you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal? Well Jackie Jackson,

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,040
my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society forcing me into tiny little boxes. Okay, but are

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,520
you a man or a woman? Just tell me. Well why does it matter? Why do you have to know? Maybe you

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Jackie Jackson. Well can I at least ask your name or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,120
My name is Baltimore. Baltimore what? Baltimore Maryland. I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,640
Maryland? It is among my names. Tiffany, what do you make of this? Look Jackie, I'm gonna be

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,480
completely real with you. I am a transsexual, that means I have a very specific mental disorder

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,360
called gender dysphoria. I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
in the womb. This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,840
and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function. It is not a fashion statement,

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,040
it is not a trend, it is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed. It is a very difficult

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:08,880
condition to live with. I'm dying inside. Okay, so you're both transsexuals then. Now I am a

29
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,760
transsexual. That is not a transsexual. That is a trans-trender. Trans-trender? Well what is that?

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,200
Is that a gender? No, it's not a gender. A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,960
and complaining about misgendering for oppression points. Actually, it's they. What? I use they

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,120
them pronouns. They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see. Why do you say that,

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,880
Tiffany Tumbles? Have I complained about oppression so far? It seems to me that it is you who has been

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:55,040
complaining about your dysphoria. Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,880
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed. I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:09,840
It's in my brain. I was diagnosed. It's a fact. It's real. My pain is real. And my pain isn't real?

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,240
It's interesting that you think that. Well, what pain are you talking about? People making fun of

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,320
you because you dress like a circus act? Interesting that you mentioned the circus,

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,360
Tiffany Tumbles. Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,920
circus? You're not confined anywhere. You choose to dress like that. And why do you choose to dress

42
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,400
the way you dress? Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman. Hello. And I'm non-binary,

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,720
so I dress non-conforming. Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Well, it's a free country. If you want to be a glitter of your gender fuck, then go ahead.

45
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,480
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a

46
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,200
bunch of trendy freaks. But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society? Do you think you can

47
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,040
purchase acceptance through conformity? Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles. That is

48
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,600
simply adding another cell to the prison. It's not about conforming. It's about me having an actual

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,080
medical condition. You do not have a female brain. You have a fashion disaster. Oh, do they?

50
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles. When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,560
take a look at your brain then? What? Of course not. But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Well, no. Where are you going with this? I mean, if you've never seen your brain and the doctor

53
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,280
who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it, then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
how do you know that you have a female brain?

55
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,760
Well, shit, that's a good point. No, it isn't. Look, there's scientific studies. Can you explain

56
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,960
to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain? Are they different colors?

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm not an expert, but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

58
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,360
I see, but your doctor never looked at your brain. So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,280
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it. And you told him what exactly?

60
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,680
That I experienced gender dysphoria. So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

61
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,480
and therefore your identity, is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain, but

62
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
because of your...

63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
feelings? Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter. You backed me into a corner.

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,080
Sure. It's because of my feelings. My feelings of gender dysphoria. So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

65
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,800
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid, but mine, according to you, are not?

66
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,560
This burgeoning brick. You guys, let's think about this. If I have never seen my brain,

67
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,920
how do I know I even have a brain? Well, you probably don't, girl. Look, Baltimore, I'm sure

68
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,360
you have lots of feelings about your gender. And if you feel cloud gender, or demi nebula,

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,400
or astroglide, or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind, then you do you, girl. Or not

70
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,920
girl. Whatever the fuck you are. But I want to make one thing very clear. I am nothing like you,

71
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,000
okay? My gender is not unicorns and glitter. My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis that

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,040
I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. No, not even you. My? I'm really getting under your skin,

73
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,280
aren't I? No. Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are. You're getting under my skin because it

74
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
really rattles my dysphoria that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender

75
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,800
community when in fact you're just making a mockery of my pain. Your pain? You're in a lot of pain,

76
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,920
aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles? Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,520
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles. I pity you because you don't think you're real

78
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,720
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad. And I can't imagine what it must be like

79
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,680
to have so little confidence in your own reality. Okay, well, don't patronize me. I'm just trying to

80
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,160
understand, Tiffany Tumbles, why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating

81
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,640
your body. Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory? Now, you don't have to hate yourself

82
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,200
or hate your body, but you do have to have dysphoria. And if you tell people otherwise,

83
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,360
you're just misleading them. I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles. Would

84
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,680
you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness? Actually, I would strongly prefer if

85
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,480
you would stay away from any of my rifts. Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,880
Tiffany against the ravages of inner strife and close her and your loving arms and cleanse her of

87
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,680
all condemnation and internalized transphobia. I entreat you, oh great mother, bathe Tiffany in

88
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,800
her peace, acceptance and self care and rid her of her toxic cisnormative truce gone ways. Amen.

89
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,520
Are we done here? I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.

90
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver on to you? Because I'm grossed out by

91
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,280
you. That's why. Okay, then. Well, namaste, bitch. Look, why don't we all take a step back

92
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,040
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform and let them know how much we appreciate

93
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,960
their service. God, I love the troops. Thinking about the troops makes me wet. It makes me come.

94
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:21,120
Semper Fi, boys. What? I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

95
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Tiffany, your transsexualism. I have to say I don't love it, but you do seem to at least be

96
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,360
aware that you have some kind of mental disorder. So I'll give you that. Whereas Baltimore,

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,760
you're what? Making some kind of statement? If my existence is a statement, I think that says more

98
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,400
about society than it says about me. Jackie, what you have to understand is there have been

99
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,240
transsexuals around for a long time. I have talked to 80 year old transsexuals and they agree with

100
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,120
me that all this genderqueer bullshit, it's just a trend. It's a fact. But is it? For thousands of

101
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,720
years, there have been third gender groups across human cultures. There's the Hijra of India,

102
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,560
the two-spirit people among Native Americans. Whereas binary transsexualism is a medical

103
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,040
construct of the 20th century. Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until

104
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:24,240
2013, meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis. So perhaps it is

105
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:35,600
you, Tiffany Tumbles, and not I who is following a trend. Wow, that just blew my mind. Well,

106
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,440
tables are turned, bitch. Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a

107
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:50,960
trans trender? He's not Native American, though. They. They. You know, it's kind of hard not to

108
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,760
call you he when you have a fucking beard. If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,

109
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,400
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that. Your honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.

110
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,440
Okay. Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they, but what it isn't is two-spirit. Look,

111
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,560
the SJWs don't even agree with this. They think it's racist. White people have two genders. Pick

112
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
one and sit down, dude. Yeah, that's a good point. Two genders, two genders, attack helicopter.

113
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,440
It's ma'am. Okay. Well, now you're just. Two genders, only two genders. My gender's Baltimore.

114
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,360
I think there's 76 genders because I don't think it's for you. You're just saying that you're me

115
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,200
and talking in a whiny voice. That is not an argument. The toxic truce gum bullies are gay

116
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,320
eating my gender. I don't have to, you know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal

117
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,520
with in life is assholes. It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it. Let's be ourselves.

118
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,800
Let's totally be ourselves. All right. That's enough of this. You know, as a biological female,

119
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I honestly don't understand any of this. Okay. That was a hard T. Now does my husband sometimes wear

120
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,160
panties around the house and ask me to call him mommy's little slut? Well, sure. But that is a

121
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,720
matter between her and the Lord. It's best not to think about it too much. Anyway, uh, Tiffany,

122
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,560
my brain has an easier time processing youth and whatever is going on over here. So congratulations.

123
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,760
You're the winner. That was some excellent free speech. Okay. Great. So in conclusion,

124
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,760
trans trenders are real and probably dangerous. Make sure to protect your children. As for how

125
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,040
many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.

126
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
All right. That's our show. This has been the freedom report where the debate never stops.

127
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,120
Except when the show is over. The girl can't help it. She's a Libra.

128
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:01,280
Behold the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected. They gave their cheek to them

129
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,920
that mocked their beard and did not their face from shame. But lo, Tiffany, the person who tricks

130
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,320
the trendier than thou is shady queen. Give next of all her friend Justine and sought her counsel

131
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:37,760
thus. God, damn it, Justine. I just can't with these trenders anymore. I simply cannot. You

132
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,760
know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door. Okay. Seems a little formal.

133
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,160
Ugh. You look great, hun. Cute. Justine, you look like absolute shit. What happened? Did the cat

134
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,520
girl finally beat you up? No, I just, look, I slept in my makeup. Okay. Leave me alone. I've

135
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,600
been having a difficult time. Are we serving a little depression moment? Jesus. Well, don't leave

136
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,960
me out. I saw you on the freedom report today. Okay, girl, can we talk about Ladybeard Baltimore,

137
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,360
Maryland? Oh, add that one to the crazy hall of fame. Really? You're happy with the way that went?

138
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
You feel good about that? You feel good about yourself right now? Well, why wouldn't I?

139
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world than a tran

140
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,080
who thinks she's better than other trans. It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.

141
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,600
You seem to think that you're queen of the world because you're hanging on to societal

142
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,360
acceptance by two fingers instead of one. Well, you're not, bitch. You're just an insecure,

143
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,400
frightened little queer who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread

144
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,200
other people down. And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.

145
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,520
Your eyelash is coming unglued.

146
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,720
My life is coming unglued. Look, it's not like I'm coming out to trannies who just can't afford

147
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,280
to transition. I don't have the social support. It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he

148
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,840
can to pass and people just treat him like a freak for no reason. They. It's they. Are we really

149
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,680
saying they now in private? Yes, we are. So get used to it. My name is Justine. I think

150
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,680
misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings. I always forget that you're like

151
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,480
actually an SGW. I always forget that you're actually an asshole. Why do I even hang out with

152
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
you? Oh, because you hate yourself and you have to believe there's hope for me because if there's

153
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,280
hope for me, there might be hope for you. Wow, you're developing self-consciousness. Where'd

154
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:53,120
you learn that trick? Gigi, Tiffany. Have you ever been bullied? Oh, let's see. Let me think.

155
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,800
Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day. But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the

156
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,760
victim. No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully. I think you grew up getting bullied for

157
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,600
being a sissy till you started passing as a woman. And then you got a little taste of normal. And now

158
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,640
you want to be the one who bashes the queers. Bash them? If anything, I'm the one defending

159
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,360
trans people from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders. You said on air

160
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,120
that Baltimore grosses you out. Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here

161
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,920
have nothing to do with your own self-loathing? How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is

162
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,080
nothing like me? Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse. Oh, it's not bigotry. Look,

163
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,920
I shouldn't have said grossed out. I'll give you that. But he does. They do make me uncomfortable.

164
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,400
And why do you think that is? I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.

165
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,720
Makes me want to down a bottle of hormones. Make sure I never look like that. Bitch,

166
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
secondhand dysphoria. What is that? You know, when you look at a tranny and you just clock

167
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,760
everything and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria? Yeah, I do know what you're talking

168
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
about. And I'll tell you why it happens. When you're early in your transition and you're doing

169
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,640
everything you can to pass, you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little

170
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,040
thing that makes you clockable. Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people

171
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,280
and you project your dysphoria onto them. I buy that. Yeah. Well, that is absolutely not a valid

172
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,120
reason to please other trans people's presentation. Secondhand dysphoria is not valid. The fact that

173
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,040
you project your dysphoria onto other people is your problem and your problem alone. And you need

174
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,320
to deal with that issue in private, girl, not on a fucking talk show. Yeah, you're probably right

175
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,280
about that, but it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid. Tiffany, let's be

176
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,400
pragmatic about this. Suppose everything you're saying is true. Suppose the only real trans people

177
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,800
are dysphoric, binary transgender people, transsexuals. Every time you say the word

178
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,160
transsexual, I feel like it's 1978. Are you 80 years old? I guess you could say I'm not the

179
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,760
trendiest person. Haha. Look, suppose you're right and everyone who doesn't meet your definition

180
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,440
of a transsexual is some kind of confused trend follower. Even if that were true, and to be clear,

181
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
it isn't, what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid because virtually

182
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
every trans person goes through a period of being confused about their gender and of having

183
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,920
nonconforming expression. And you're going around enforcing a stigma against that. Didn't you ever

184
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,360
have doubts about your gender? Weren't you ever androgynous? Oh yeah, I mean, I was never a sad

185
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,000
burgeoning, but I had my little cringe here being a non-binary SJW. Uh-huh. And one of the great

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,200
things about non-binary identities is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist,

187
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,680
even when neither gender really fits them, whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple

188
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,560
months. Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated for being a trenderer during

189
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,640
your exploration year might not have been the most helpful thing? Not really. I have dysphoria,

190
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,520
so if anyone called me a trenderer, I'd eventually prove them wrong. That's all I'm saying. If you're

191
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,120
not a trenderer, then transition. Prove me wrong. The stigma you perpetuate against gender confusion

192
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,040
and experimentation keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition. It alienates baby

193
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,720
trans from the community that should be welcoming them instead of publicly humiliating them. And when

194
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,480
you appoint yourself the public decider of whomst is really trans, the torquemata of the trender

195
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,000
inquisition, you're terrorizing a lot of people who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.

196
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,880
Okay. But then how do we decide which t***ies are valid? We don't. This is where I'm losing you,

197
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,400
because trendstrenders are absolutely a thing. Like, undeniably. I've talked to people who've

198
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,920
literally told me they used to be trendstrenders. So, some people question their gender but end up

199
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,480
deciding they're not really trans. There is nothing wrong with that. And those people still

200
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,800
aren't being helped by public shaming. Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place if

201
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,520
SJW's weren't going around telling people they don't need dysphoria to be trans. You know, it's

202
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,000
one thing if teenage girls want to dye their hair pink and call themselves demi-boys for most of

203
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,280
sophomore year. But some of these kids are actually going to medically transition. And soon, we're going

204
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,760
to have an epidemic of detransitioners on our hands. And there's going to be TERFs publishing,

205
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,280
I told you so, op-eds in every major newspaper. Now, maybe you think that's worth it just to make

206
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,600
sure no one ever feels invalidated for any reason. But I think that's highly irresponsible. Look,

207
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,000
if you're so worried about people feeling pressured to medically transition, then what you

208
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,960
should be doing is working to make the trans community as inclusive and welcoming as possible

209
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,920
to gender non-conforming people and non-binary people and people who are questioning and trans

210
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,280
people who don't medically transition. But instead, you're doing the exact opposite. You're telling

211
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,080
everyone that medical transition is the only way to be valid. And if anything is pressuring people

212
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,120
to medically transition, it's that. Justine, I think you're a good person. Maybe too good. And

213
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,760
that's why you're trying to have compassion for everyone. But at some point, you have to protect

214
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,120
yourself. We live in a world of Jackie Jackson's who don't understand trans people and don't think

215
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,560
we're real. So we need to have an explanation of what it is to be trans that's based on facts and

216
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,160
not feelings. And the most factual explanation is transmedicalism, which is the idea that

217
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,360
transsexualism is a diagnosable mental disorder called gender dysphoria. There's science to back

218
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,960
this up. It's accepted by medical professionals, and it clearly explains why we are valid,

219
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,480
unlike Rachel Dolezal and snowflake gender teenagers and people who identify as cats.

220
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay, I see the appeal, but I don't think transmedicalism is as validating as you think it is.

221
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,600
Why not? I'll put it bluntly. Why does having gender dysphoria make you a woman? Because gender

222
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,120
dysphoria means I have a female brain. No, it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you, but the science

223
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,640
does not say what you think it says. There may be neurological causes of gender dysphoria. But at the

224
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,480
end of the day, all dysphoria is is discomfort in a male body or a male social role or however you

225
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:19,120
want to put it. And wanting to be a woman is not the same thing as being a woman, not by any means.

226
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,800
Girl, where are you going with this? What is this? Are you becoming a turf? No, I just don't think

227
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,160
your theory actually validates our womanhood. Well, if you're right, that's a real problem,

228
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,280
because we need to have reason and science and logic and facts on our side so that we can

229
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,720
explain to society that we are valid and that we are real. Otherwise, bad things. Well, maybe

230
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,240
there's a better theory. Well, okay, Socrates, let's hear it then. The way I see it, gender is

231
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,520
either psychological or biological or social. Now, my friend Tabby, the cat girl, she thinks it's all

232
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,720
psychological, that it's just identity, that whatever you think about your own gender is true.

233
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,680
And that makes me really uncomfortable because then what's the difference between identifying

234
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,840
as a woman and identifying as a Norwegian forest cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself seems

235
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,120
not to have much of a grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to tell you about

236
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,760
transtrenders this entire time. Just let me finish. If gender is strictly biological,

237
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,400
then that's game over for trans people unless you make some kind of wrong brain and the wrong body

238
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,280
argument. But I told you I'm not buying that. So that leaves gender as a social construct.

239
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,160
Are you gonna try to make me read Judith Butler again? I'll summarize it. Gender is a series of

240
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,120
gestures. It's called performativity. It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak. It's the

241
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,560
way you act. It's the way you relate to other people. Through transitioning, we habituate to

242
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,480
the gestures of womanhood and socially that makes us women regardless of biology or psychology,

243
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:56,160
checkmate transphobes. Okay, the problem with that is that it's both too exclusionary

244
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,360
and too inclusive. It excludes a lot of trans people who can't transition for circumstantial

245
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,440
reasons, but whose dysphoria is very real. And it includes every transtrender, drag queen,

246
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,680
fetishist, and two-bit cross-dressing comedian in a dino wig. Uh, well, do you really believe

247
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,960
that a man who plays a woman on stage becomes just as much of a woman as you and me? Yes? Bitch,

248
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,040
no you don't. Yeah, you're right. I'm full of shit. I know you are because you're an SJW,

249
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,280
and SJWs hate performativity theory almost as much as they hate me. Well, they only hate it

250
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,760
because they don't understand it. They think it invalidates non-binary identities, but in fact,

251
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,800
it's the most rational way to explain non-binary identities. How can you perform a non-binary

252
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,480
identity? Simple. You learn the rules so you can break them. Wearing a beard and a dress communicates

253
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,080
ambiguity. Even the gesture of declaring, I am neither a man or a woman, is a speech act that

254
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,880
removes the speaker from the semantics of- Girl, shut up. This is too much philosophizing. I can't

255
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,120
stand it anymore. Why don't you tell me what's really going on with you? Why do you look like

256
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,200
you've been in a k-hole for a week? Why are you suddenly so obsessed with white knighting for

257
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,000
non-binary people? Because I am non-binary. No, you're not. What are you talking about?

258
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,120
I just feel like since I started transitioning, I've been trying so hard to fit in and to perform

259
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,920
my gender and to pass and to just be normal. But I can't do it anymore. I just cannot make it work.

260
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,600
I feel like an actor. I feel like a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions of this new gender

261
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,880
role that's supposed to liberate me, but that's somehow just as empty as the old one. Because

262
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm just not normal Tiffany. I am a freak and I'm always going to be a freak. Justine,

263
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,560
you're not non-binary. You're gay and everyone can see this except you. Oh, come on. I'm not,

264
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm not gay. Justine was extremely gay. Protests though the lady may, there simply is no stopping

265
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:14,320
a gayness. I love girls. I hate girls. Okay. So I'm a little bit gay, right? And you don't know

266
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,640
how to reconcile your attraction to women with your desire to reform your gender. That's why

267
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,000
you feel this dissonance. Yeah. I guess that's basically it. Well, it really shouldn't be that

268
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,880
hard girl. You already came out as a woman. Just blurt it out. Say hello world. My name is Justine

269
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:38,720
and I fuck pussy. That's a very cis normative way to say it. Hello world. My name is Justine and

270
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,680
I fuck pussy. Oh, I feel like a man when I say it. Yeah. Well, you should probably buy a pickup

271
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,200
truck then get some of those mud flaps on the back with the little sexy ladies on them. And

272
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,160
you may as well change your name back to Justin. Okay. Well, that's just uncalled for. Girl,

273
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,280
I don't know what to say except I told you so. Sexuality is just like gender identity. It is

274
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,320
not a performance. It's not a trend. It's not a choice. It's just part of who you are. And

275
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,600
there's nothing you can do to change it. I guess you're right. I guess my theory sucks. It sucks

276
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,800
so fucking hard. But the good news is you can unclench your asshole now and do whatever you

277
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,600
want because you're still a woman, whether you're performing a stereotype or not. So run free,

278
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,120
Justine. Go top a cis woman. Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized flannel. Do whatever you want.

279
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,400
Wow. Yeah. I guess, I guess that is pretty liberating. Yeah. Thank God for transmedicalism,

280
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,400
right? Oh, except not because you just destroyed transmedicalism with facts and logic. So we have

281
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,520
no theory. We have no theory, Justine. What do we do now? How do we prove we're valid? Well,

282
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,680
just do what every trans woman has done since the beginning of time. Go out and

283
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,600
fuck the most brutally heterosexual man you can find and be validated and come. Oh, honey,

284
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,480
I have and I will, but that's not going to convince anyone but me. It's not a proof.

285
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,760
It's not a theory. Well, maybe we don't need a theory. Maybe we don't need to prove anything.

286
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,840
Bad things, Justine. Bad things. Well, do we have a theory about why people are gay?

287
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,960
No, they just are. The only reason we even feel like we need a theory about trans people

288
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,480
is that society is so unaccepting of us that it's constantly demanding we justify our own reality.

289
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
Okay. So what am I supposed to tell Jackie Jackson then? What am I supposed to tell the

290
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,680
TERFs? That I'm a woman because reasons? No, not even because reasons. Just because you are.

291
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,720
So it's what? A leap of faith? Oh, great. I'm sure that's going to convince all the rational

292
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,760
skeptics. Justine, it makes us sound completely delusional. Well, Tiffany, delusion is what

293
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,320
separates us from the animals. Who do you think built the pyramids and the cathedrals? Clearly

294
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,320
not people with a perfectly rational worldview. But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one

295
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,120
who thinks being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't describe it as the height of sanity,

296
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,520
but I would prefer to think that my whole life and identity is based on something I can rationally

297
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,120
explain. Well, what are we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the single most obnoxious thing about men that

298
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,960
they think they have to wrap up the entire world in a little rational box? Maybe the most important

299
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,720
things in life can't be logically proved. Can you logically prove that you love your own children?

300
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,840
No. And the attempt to prove it is as degrading as it is futile. Maybe gender identity is one of

301
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,560
those things. Okay. But then how do I prove I'm more valid than Baltimore, Maryland and the star

302
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,160
genders and the cat people? Well, maybe we should stop getting so caught up in proving our validity

303
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,360
to ourselves that we end up being horribly cruel to other people. What if we just accept all the

304
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,560
freaks of the world? At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as important to have logical proofs

305
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,160
as it is to be empathetic and open-minded and compassionate.

306
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:13,040
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya, Kumbaya.

307
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,400
I have something to tell you. Here it comes. I love you.

308
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Okay. Well, I'm going to get going now. I have an important date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries

309
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,320
and reading YouTube comments by myself. So I'd really better go do that. But good luck with

310
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:45,760
your new life as a male lesbian who fucks cats. Are you upset? Just go. I'm sorry.

311
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,640
Oh, I hate this bitch, but God, she's a yum yum.

312
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,920
Harken children, in this vision, you have witnessed world fools on the screen.

313
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Fools who did all of themselves. But I, your goddess mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.

314
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:24,400
For I am truth. I am light. I am in capitalism. And everything I tweet is woke. Most importantly,

315
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:33,280
I love myself. I love myself so much. It makes me wet. It makes me cum. Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.

316
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,840
Like, comment, and subscribe. Amen.
