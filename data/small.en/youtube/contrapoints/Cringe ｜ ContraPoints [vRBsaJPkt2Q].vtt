Hello again, the gays.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Straight people you're of course welcome to tag along to

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
provided you're emotionally damaged.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Hi. Hey, how are you?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Cringe. Let's talk about it.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
It just pops into my head all the time.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Like, when I randomly remembered that month back in 2013

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics to Kezha songs

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
were rewritten in iambic pentameter.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Why? What audience was that for?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Cringe. Mega cringe.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I think I say this word like 50 times a day.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Cringe, cringe, cringe. And I'm not the only one.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
has dramatically increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
and remaining pretty constant ever since.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
as at an all-time high the month I'm making this video.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So what is cringe?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Well, let's start with some examples.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
What Things Really Make You Cringe?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And here's some of the most upvoted responses.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
and everyone at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Recordings of my own voice.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
he just goes to another school thing.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Early teen me. So many cringe stuff I did.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
This happened about two years ago.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I ordered some pizza hot online, and when it was delivered,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
the lady handed me the pizza boxes.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I said, oh.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I said, oh.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Then I said, you too.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
And then I closed the door and killed myself.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
says in her book Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
are when we're yanked out of our own perspective

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
and we can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
who in the 60s did a study of the Byami tribe in New Guinea

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
where he showed them mirror, video, and photographic images

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
of themselves for the first time and described the results.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
They were paralyzed after their first startled response

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
covering their mouths and ducking their heads.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
They stood transfixed, staring at their images,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
only their stomach muscles betraying great tension.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
So basically, they cringed at themselves.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
when they hear a recording for the first time.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating in your head.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh God,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
that's how other people hear me all the time.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear to yourself

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
and the way you appear to other people.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
That's when you cringe.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
The feeling Dahl describes as,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
an unpleasant kind of self-recognition

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
It's a forced moment of self-awareness,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing fact

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
When you're talking too loud at a wedding

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and suddenly everyone turns around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
you suddenly realize how you look to them.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
There's no law of state or even of etiquette

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak at a wedding.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It's something you have to intuit based on context.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
How loud are other people speaking?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
the function of awkwardness is that

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
And memories of your cringy moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Ten years later you'll be trying to fall asleep,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
and for no reason at all your brain will decide to remind you

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
You know, this stupid thing you were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
and you'll cringe all over again.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Because you look back and you realize,

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self cringe.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
But usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
we're talking about cringing at other people.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
cringepix and cringetopia,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
host videos and images of people behaving in cringy ways.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter with black people.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Who let the dogs out?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Ugh.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
It makes me want to crawl out of my body and escape into another dimension.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like that

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
because I just can't stand it.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
which, sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
or secondhand embarrassment.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Basically, it's a form of empathy.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
just as if if you watched someone fall down the stairs,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
But there's a problem with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
or at least a complication,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
the person doing the cringy thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
In fact, often they're super confident,

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Like when a woman posts a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
So in the internet sense of the word, cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Nothing about this is cringe.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
but I don't cringe at her.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone and cringing with them.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
My feelings mirror what she's feeling,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
but when I'm cringing at someone,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm feeling something very different to what they're feeling.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Another example is Bad American Idol auditions,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
which are quintessential cringe content.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
People try out for American Idol

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
because they think they're good enough singers

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
to compete in a national competition,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
so they're effectively revealing their own delusions

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
when they show up and sing like this.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Is this the real life?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Oh, is this just fantasy?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Most of us are bad singers, right?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
When people sing happy birthday at a party,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
usually they're singing in three different keys at no particular tempo.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
But that's not cringe because the point of singing happy birthday

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
is not to sound amazing.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Do you as good as, in your opinion,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
the lead singer from Queen?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
when, in fact, you sound like a wounded street dog.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
I admit that watching Red,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I laugh at his ludicrous performance, just like the judges do.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And because he's so cocky

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
There's almost a sense of karma,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And my sense that he deserves it suppresses my compassionate response

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant, Misha,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
who's there with her mom and they both seem like such sweethearts.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I do believe in her talent.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
That's very much.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
but I'm rooting for her.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And when she embarrasses herself,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yikes.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
My differing reactions to Red and Misha

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
track a distinction that Doll makes

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
with the person you're cringing at.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves in the cringe-worthy moment,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
of how other people were perceiving them.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
involves an emotional distancing from the person you're cringing at.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Just like with compassionate cringe,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
you feel annoyance and disgust at them

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
So these are actually two very different emotional responses,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
We call both feelings cringe,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
not because they're similar feelings,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
but because they're responses to the same type of situation,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
people lacking self-awareness,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
embarrassing themselves without realizing it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
So why are we so fascinated by content that makes us feel this way?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos so popular on YouTube?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, I think the answer to that question depends

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
When I read that Ask Reddit thread where all the people share their cringe stories,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I cringe compassionately.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with them.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I recognize myself in them,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
and I'm reassured to hear that other people are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm not the only one who cringes out my past or videos of myself.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
only to later educate ourselves and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
as beautiful and talented and badass,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
only to totally miss the mark and completely embarrass ourselves.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It makes us feel less alone.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Now this is all of course assuming that we're cringing compassionately.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet does not encourage compassion.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact, because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
This is the 21st century, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Pillaries and freak shows and public floggings.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
These are barbaric practices from the Dark Ages, right?

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves by humiliating people.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Right?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
We've got maniacs.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
We've got whackadoos.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
We've got skitsos, fatties, and spurs.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Come see sexual deviants on display.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
That's right, folks.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Come see the panty sniffer.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Come see the skeleton girl.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Half man, half woman, all freak.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
And by that I mean there's whole channels making content that centers the experience of cringing.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content, including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation, or SJW Cringe Compilation.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Remember those?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
but in 2016 the word cringe was most associated with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
His video has followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
which means he would play someone else's content,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No makeup with some sweatpants.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Oh my god, it's so fucking bad.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
He looks like he's gender fluid.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
He looks like a fucking lesbian.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts and freethinking tuxedos.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
What even is this thing?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It must be one of the 76 genders.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Sorry my dudes, you were on the cringe side of history.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster a shared sense of humanity

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
by recognizing your own weakness in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video of fat acceptance activists

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
behaving in cringy ways.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
But it isn't.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Is this cringe?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
What is cringe about it?

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Earlier we defined cringe as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
She's just existing in water.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
Presumably something along the lines of, ew, fat people, gross.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It's literally just disgust, right?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Here's another cringe compilation, this one titled,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Gender-Fluid Non-Binary Cringe.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
And we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their gender-fluid identity.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because, you know, like, gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, apparently not.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
But despite that self-awareness, we're being invited to cringe.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
Because, I guess being gender-fluid, like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
This is not real cringe, I want to say.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
that there's really no point in objecting to it.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia, one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow, a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

16:48.000 --> 16:57.000
Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels, neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens, not like other girls girls,

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
fanfic writers, beat poets, SJWs, feminists, maggots, trans people, non-binary people,

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
transtrenders, queer afab ukulele players, autistic people, fat people, the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common, and a handful of themes do jump out.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Eviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Obsessive interests in unconventional hobbies.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Low social status.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
If you add up all the groups on this list, I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
It includes me three or four times.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm of course a fedora tipping queer afab ukulele playing TikTok teen.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe and try to be like, compassionate or whatever?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Fuck no.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
It's part of patriarchy.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Part of patriarchy.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't know if you're noticing a theme.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Patriarchy.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm reading fuckface.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Mr. Entitled.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Mr. Ego.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Patriarchy fuckface.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
She's one of these people who generates meme-able phrases at an amazing rate.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
but I have unconventional tastes in Estasia.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
the mascot of feminism,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
which is highly dishonest considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I call this strategy mascotization,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
the construction of a strawman nemesis.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It's very simple, but very effective.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And it's best paired with memification.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
you freeze it, and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Then, through mascotization,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
You're fucking a white male!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
...memified as AIDS and Skrillex,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
and this protester...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Take the hatred of the devil!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Take the hatred of the devil!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
...who was memified as Trigley Puff.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness of beta new male cuckoldry

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb tier casual,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
throwing up a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
threatening to confiscate your video games and engulf you in her yonic abyss.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
though it comes at the risk of backfiring

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
a little too badass.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
But the subtler's strategy of symbolizing your political enemies,

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense emotional way.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Don't act like that or people will laugh at you.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
at the whipping post.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and it sends a powerful message.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Don't do whatever that guy did.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriend's nudes.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
for alleged breaches of wokeness.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Public humiliation is a powerful force,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
and it's usually, uh, it's not a good force.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
But there are some rare exceptions.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Back in the Gamergate era,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
and there was a network of besieged feminists of loggers

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
What I see as one of the turning points in shifting the atmosphere

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
from the pro-Gamergate days to the left tube world of today

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
was a handful of videos uploaded by then obscure YouTuber Harry Brewess

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual called Davis Orini.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Come on, Davis, we have to...

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
No, stop lecturing me about ethics. We have to get it out of here.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
while posing in front of a toy skull

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Men of the West, women in our culture,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
I would start with the premise that all women are whores.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
and a fairly positive response even from a mostly male gamer audience

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
Why did these videos work with this audience where so many others didn't?

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Well, I think it's because Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
for being problematic or misogynistic.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
And Davis was a perfect target because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
He had no self-awareness about the fact that pretty much everyone saw

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
through his absurd posturing as a badass tough guy by day,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I've spoken to men and boys who have told me

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
that Harry's videos inspired the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Not just because they cringed at Davis Arini,

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
but also because they recognized a little bit of Davis in themselves,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
and they cringed at that too.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person induces self-cringe,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
which can motivate you to change your behavior,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
your beliefs, or even your own self-concept.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
namely the fedora temper.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader for traditional masculinity,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
but who's basically just a pasty nerd who can't relate to women.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments so frequently

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
that I would classify him as what the internet calls a lol cow.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Lol cow is old 4chan lingo.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric or foolish behavior

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
can be milked for lols.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
And milking in this context can mean simply watching a lol cow's behavior

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
and laughing at them,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
or it can mean making reaction videos where you make fun of them,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
to get a response that you find entertaining.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
or my old videos about the Golden One,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
as lol cow milking content with a political angle.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
an argument from cringe,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
with the aim of convincing people,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I'll embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
and I wanted people to laugh.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
There doesn't need to be a political agenda behind milking lol cows.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
In fact, usually there isn't.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
The purest example of a lol cow I can think of

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
is actually someone from way before the internet,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
was an American soprano who attracted a cult following in New York City

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
due to her being such a terrible singer

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
that people went to her concerts,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
essentially for the lols.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
She was described as the world's worst opera singer.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
No one, before or since,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
has succeeded in liberating themselves

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Behold this fucking camp queen.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh, we have no choice but to stand.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Here's a clip of one of the few recordings she made.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Cringe.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
the William Mahone of her age.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
until 1944, when she was 76 years old

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
to which newspaper critics showed up.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
The next morning, The New York Sun reported,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
in a semblance of pitch,

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
but the further a note was from its proper elevation,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
the more the audience laughed and applauded,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
and five days later, she had a heart attack and died.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I find something very touching about this story.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
At least he tries to stop these people before things get out of hand.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a locale.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Like, yes, this is hilarious,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
but on the other hand,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
does not a locale bleed?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
On some level, we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
but on the other hand,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
There's a good bug about this called the Joy of Pain,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
by Richard Smith.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
in other people's misery,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and Smith argues that we experience it

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
because psychologically, we gain something when other people lose.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
by comparing ourselves to other people.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Maybe I'm not perfect,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
but at least I'm not this locale.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And we also get a boost when people who are socially above us,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
whom we envy, get brought down a peg.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
James Charles' cancelled party,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
LOLOL.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Smith uses the word,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Humillitainment, for this type of media,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
like reality TV shows designed to produce spectacular moments of embarrassment.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
or some kind of carnival side show.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I mean, take a look around you.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
at the time I'm making this video,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
remains apparently in total denial about her eating disorder

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
and continues to make videos modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
We have Wings of Redemption,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
a bad-tempered gamer who, for a long time,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
was essentially confined by poverty, obesity, and depression

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
to streaming video games all day

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
We have Onision,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
a habitual alleged abuser of women and teenage girls,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
who, earlier this year,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
essentially performed his own mental breakdown on YouTube

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
after Patreon banned him for doxxing an accuser.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
I love kombucha!

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Whose idea was it to give hundreds of pathological narcissists

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
access to video equipment?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
And the viewers are no better than the performers.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Oh, you people love nothing more

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
completely lose our minds live on camera.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Is this what you want, huh?

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
Is this what you want to try to melt down?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
You know, as a creator,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
you have to be aware that you're a circus performer,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
and the crowd may, in fact, be more entertained

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Online media today is full of Lady Florenses,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Now, to be clear,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
with indulging now and then

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
in a little bit of light contempt.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
Cringing at Davis Orini or Bad American Idol auditions

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
seems pretty harmless,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
but it can be taken too far.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
And there's no better case study of taking it too far

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
If you don't know what's coming,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
you might want to strap in Gorge,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
because this is coconuts.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
It's bananas.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It's a full fruit salad.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
more commonly known on the internet as Chris Chan,

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
is the victim of what is quite possibly

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
the longest-running and most obsessive

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
internet trolling saga of all time.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
She's the lol cow of lol cows.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Hello, everybody.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
It's just Christine Chandler

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
coming to you live from home once again.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Chandler is an autistic trans woman,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
which I pause to explain,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
actually take her transition seriously.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Most people seem to regard it as

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
simply another absurd symptom

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
of her hilarious mental condition.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
In fact, a bunch of trans people

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
will probably get real salty with me

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
for making trans people look bad

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
by including Chris Chan in our,

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Oh, please.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity sweaty.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
God, how did Trannies get so snobbish?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Look, is Chris Chan really trans?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
I don't know, and I don't care.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
If Chris Chan wants to be a woman,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I for one support her journey.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
But it doesn't matter.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
The relevant thing about Chris Chan is not Chris Chan.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
nearly every aspect of her life

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
has been obsessively archived online

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
by thousands of years known as Christorians.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
several internet centuries ago back in 2007

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Sonichu, a childishly drawn hybrid

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
of Sonic and Pikachu.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
The comic is set in quick fill,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
CWC being Chris Chan's initials.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
The protagonist is a self-insert

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
who references Chandler's real life quote,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
love quest to find a quote boyfriend free girl,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
which apparently involved posting bizarre

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
attraction signs around her community college.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
For this story to make sense,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
you have to keep in mind that Chandler identified

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
and presented as male until 2015.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
So these trolls saw her as like

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Just to give you a feel for this person,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
here's Christine in 2018 holding up

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
the iconic pre-transition portrait.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Note the Sonichu medallions.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
and here she is in recent years

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Pegasister snapped.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Basically she's the entire cringe-topia sub-reddit

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
condensed into a single person.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
because of course they did.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And they began tormenting her

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
posting candid photos of her, et cetera.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
which of course encouraged some more,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
They hacked her accounts

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
or tricked her into giving out passwords.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
They posted all her emails online.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
They showed up in person and photographed her house.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
They called her parents,

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in order to extract as much information

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
about her as possible.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
And of course they contacted Chandler herself,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
which was very rewarding for trolls

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
because she has no filter

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
and was very naive and trusting.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
So she was very willing to divulge,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
or easily manipulated into divulging,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
mortifying information about herself.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Sexual, psychological, scatological.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
There's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
For all the information they gathered,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
the trolls created a wiki called The Quickie,

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris Chan data.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
entire articles about all numbers

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
of her immediate and extended family,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
in descending them, and that's only the beginning.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
In their more grandiose moods,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
the Christorians have speculated

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
that Chris Chan is the most documented life

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
in all human history,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
comparing their social experiment to the Truman Show.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It's a level of obsession

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
that surpasses the wildest excesses of stan culture.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
or on one occasion sex workers, to the Chandler household.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
with Chris Chan, of course secretly wearing wires

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
to record their conversations.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
These things must be archived, don't you understand?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Chris Chan must be documented.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
The absolute low point came when some trolls

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
and to have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
In other words, they groomed a child

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
to deceive an autistic person

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
into performing sex acts for their entertainment.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Now, to contemporary Christorians,

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
is frowned upon.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Not so much because it's immoral,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
a bit attention-seeking.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
No, to the sophisticated Christorian,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the real pleasure in all this

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
is supposed to lie and quietly spectating,

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
savoring the fine notes of cringe.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
on the morality of all this.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
The real question to me is why?

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
with Christine Chandler?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And yes, it is an obsession.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
personal investment in this,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
one of very few Christorians with the audacity

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
to show his face,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
has been working for more than two years

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
to produce an eventual 100 episode documentary series

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
about the life of Chris Chan.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
I'll call it morbid cringe,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
defined as an obsessive and addictive,

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
Why does morbid cringe happen?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Well, I've spent some time pouring over

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Christorians' conversations with each other,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and this is what I've found.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
The first thing they'll tell you

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
that Christine's strange life and mind

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And I'm sure that's true.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and morbidly interesting.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Why fixate on this particular person?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Well, for a lot of them,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
it's a reassurance that there's someone out there

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
worse than them.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
but at least this defenseless punching bag

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
called Chris Chan is here for them

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
to assert their superiority over.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
It's pretty much common knowledge

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
that a lot of Christorians,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
including some of the most vocal haters,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
are autistic themselves.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris Chan

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
In recent years, there's also been

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
a small contingent of transgender trolls

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
who are likewise prone to say,

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
he's not a real transgender like me

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
and he's making us all look bad.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris Chan,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
you guys look amazing.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
about why trolling Chandler is justified,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
righteous even,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
because at the end of the day,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
trolls are people too.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
And a lot of them actually do have a guilty conscience about this,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
which they suppress by insisting

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
that Chris Chan is a horrible person

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
who deserves to be tormented.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
But trolls who protest too much about the evils of Chris Chan

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
and therefore reveal the excess of their emotional investment in this

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
are known in the community as A-logs.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
A-log is the name of a troll

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
who attracted the ire of other trolls

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
by ranting about Chris Chan's crimes,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
comparing her to Hitler,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Among the trolls,

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
this kind of behavior is considered an embarrassment to all of them

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
because they want to feel like they're just cruelly

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
and casually toying with this person.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
You know, just for laughs,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
not a big deal.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
This is all perfectly healthy

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
and normal and fine.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's fine.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
because it was obvious that his Chris Chan obsession

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
wasn't healthy or normal or fine.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
So the other trolls turned on A-log

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
and they made him into Chris Chan 2.0

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
and they uncovered his autism

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and his furry porn collection

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
and his cringey erotic fanfiction.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
So why would someone as similar to Chris Chan as A-log

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
obsessively hate on her?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Well, there's two explanations.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
One is troll shielding.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris Chan

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Obviously, this did not work.

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
The other explanation is that A-log saw himself reflected in Chris Chan

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
and sort of projected his own shame and self-contempt onto her.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
A-log hated Chris Chan because he saw part of himself in her.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
And the other trolls hated A-log

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
because they saw part of themselves in him.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
To quote Margaret Plus,

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
who covered this story for New York Magazine a few years ago,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
I think it might be A-logs all the way down.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris Chan

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
because to them she's a symbol of something they hate about themselves,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
something they're ashamed of.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
or being a socially awkward recluse.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
or embarrassing sexual proclivities

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
or all of the above.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
This is how scapegoating works, right?

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
You repress your uncomfortable feelings of shame

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
and insecurity and self-loathing,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
and you displace them onto someone else,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
usually someone you can feel superior to.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
It's pretty safe to assume

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris Chan.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris Chan

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
of social rejection and exclusion.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
contemptuous cringing helps us cope with our own shame and insecurity.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing with other people

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
and find a way to make this all about me.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
...

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
...

43:37.000 --> 43:58.000
...

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
...

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
Would you like to meet my boyfriend's boyfriend?

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
That's right, honey. I'm giving you fujoshi realness.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
He's going to stay right here as a grim reminder

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
of the things that you have seen.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
Actually, I identify as a trap. It's very that.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Cringe is failed seriousness.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
of being a transgender lesbian.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Cringe. Shame.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
At the end of that video, I talk about how I sense that my shame

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
particularly those of the heck and stripey sock

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
nya nya catgirl variety.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I want to return to that thought and kind of psychoanalyze myself

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
as a kind of first-person case study of a morbid cringe obsession.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
So, catgirl trans girls are...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
who express their identity online

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
through cloying, neotenous otaku memory.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
as a kind of visual baby talk,

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
an infantilized and unrealistic representation of femininity

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
and womanhood that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Fuck your dreams.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked with a discussion

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
of whether my opinions about catgirls are fair or correct.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
catgirls are being cringe online.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Is a situation so inconsequential

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much?

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
Well, according to the A-Log theory of morbid cringing,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
for people who have traits in common with us,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
people who make us uncomfortable

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
because we see something of ourselves in them.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Well, we're both trans women.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
We're both attracted to women.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I like good anime that has, you know,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
mature three-dimensional female characters.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay? I'm not like you.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
It's also not lost on me that this is like

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
the seventh time on this channel I've dressed as a catgirl

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
to make fun of them.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
I have posted cringe.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
You should all be laughing at me right now.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
that I'm A-Log-ing these catgirls.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
because of how these catgirls are acting.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
So let's make another distinction between

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
who belongs to the same group identity as you.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
For example, your family, your romantic partnership,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
your ethnicity, or your country,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
in front of outsiders to the group.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
if her mom does something cringy in front of her friends.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
being our president.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Or think about these phrases.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
They're making trans people look bad.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
He's giving autistics a bad name.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
We feel embarrassment, because their disgraceful behavior

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
makes us look bad too.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
because you're cringing at your membership

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
in an embarrassing group.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Nothing has ever triggered this kind of in-group embarrassment

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
more for me than a cringe video that went viral last year,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
You're making my fucking money back.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It is ma'am.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Motherfucker, take it outside.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
If you want to call me, sir, again,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I will show you a fucking sir.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Motherfucker.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly intimidate people

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
into seeing you as a woman.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Ooh!

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Ooh!

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Now, Twitter's going to come for me over this

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
and say, Natalie hates trans women, you don't pass.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
But passing is really not what this is about.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
from a trans woman, accompanied by, apparently,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
a total delusion about how she's presenting.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Well, I'm going to ask you for the fifth time

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
to stop calling me a man, because quite clearly, I am not.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
The incongruity between her thinking that she's serving women

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
while bellowing like a drill sergeant.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
this is cringe reaction content.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't really do that on this channel,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
And it feels good, like, intoxicatingly good.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
I'm imagining myself right now, surrounded by cis people,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
and I am leading the righteous mob

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
as we point and laugh at some delusional, manly dump truck.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
I am a real transgender, a true transgender, a good transgender.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Father, find the bruise of me.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Jot that down in my progress notes, please, Doctor.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
When I watched that GameStop video,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
for the first few seconds,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
I can even relate,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
because in the first couple months of my transition,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
there was an occasion

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
where the guy at the desk was calling me Sir the entire time.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
And there's something very humiliating

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
about trying to present female,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
like wearing a dress and makeup,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and yet being called Sir.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and the way other people are seeing you.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And the memory of it is painful to me,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
but what I cling to is that,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
while I may have looked like a man,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
at least I didn't act like a man.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
and show them a Sir.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
So as the GameStop video progresses,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
my sympathy runs out fast.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And instead of compassionate cringe,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
including myself.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
And I feel contempt toward this individual

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
for making us all look bad.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
And that fear motivates me to distance myself

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
from that person in the video.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
I don't feel compassion for her,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
because that would mean putting myself

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
in her size 16 shoes.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
And I don't want to do that,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
because I'm horrified and repulsed

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
by the thought that I'm like her in some way.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
So I want to push away,

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
and contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
And if I express that contempt

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
by publicly shaming and condemning her,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Accidental COVID jokes.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Oops, I guess it's contagious.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I think many people who are stigmatized

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
or who have been humiliated long for the experience

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
of being a normal surrounded by fellow normals

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
judging and humiliating a freak.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
a lot of the biggest creators in the platform

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
have channels basically devoted

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
to exactly this type of cringe reaction humilitainment.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
who's best known for what are essentially

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
cringe reaction videos.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
Mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
That is, people who claim to be trans

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
He's especially bothered by girly, afab,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
trans and non-binary teenagers

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
or by anyone who blurs the line

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Sometimes he'll do a long form reaction

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
to a specific person who grinds his gears.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
So this person is an asexual,

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
non-binary, transgender, lesbian,

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
In other times, he'll basically just laugh

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
at cringy trans TikTok teens.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
No, no, I'm turning off the video.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
I can't watch this.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
He has a couple justifications for making these videos.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
One is that he's actually helping the people

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
he's cringing at because of a trend or transitions

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
His other justification is that trans-trenders

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
are giving real trans people a bad name.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
They're the reason people are transphobic.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
This is why they hate us.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
It's because of the trenders.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Wow, I love that idea of a true scum furry.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Isn't that just wonderful?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
A true scum furry.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
But it's not though.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
I mean, transphobia existed long before there were people

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
you could plausibly describe as trans-trenders.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
So trans-trenders aren't the reason society

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
hates trans people, Calvin.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Or at least the trans community.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
that feeling onto society at large and you're saying,

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
it was cis people mocking trans people with all these tropes.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders, special snowflakes.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
But now they're used by trans people trying to distance themselves,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people in the community

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
under the label of trans-trenders.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
And Calvin, there may be some truth to what you're saying

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
about their being confused teenagers who think they're trans when they're not.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
I mean, I wouldn't know.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
and I don't hang out with teenagers.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But even if it is true, Calvin,

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Like you return to this topic to cringe again and again

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
and again and again and again and again.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
It's like you're picking at a wound.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
This could be me projecting, of course,

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
but I wonder if the way you feel about girly sparkle gender afabs

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
is similar to the way I feel about otaku, transbian, cat girls.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
And it might be worth considering that

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
I don't cringe at the sparkle genders the way you do.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
I mean, I'm with you on wondering what a he-they-seer, gender-flux, lesbian, demi-boy is.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
But unlike you, Calvin, I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
with feminine afab trans people.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
They can identify as however many genders they want for all I care.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
I may not always understand it, but I support their journey.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
I guess it doesn't bother me because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
because of how they behave.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I don't feel in-group cringe.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Now, it's a different story.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
and I see a comment like,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
pre-transition trans lesbian here,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I wish I had titties.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Girl dick, nya nya.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Get the fuck out of here, Lily.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
You're giving real trans lesbians a bad name.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
This is why they hate us.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
See, now I have strong feelings.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Now I'm in-group cringing.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct to some extent.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Like, I don't think a general lesbian community

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
is the appropriate forum for a trans woman

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
who's effectively still living as a man

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
to take the mic and whine about wanting titties

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
or rhapsodize about girl dick.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And honestly, my own self-loathing.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
because I feel like a fake woman imposing myself on real women.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
That's where my head is at.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
So where does this pre-transition trans lesbian get the audacity?

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe about an identity,

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
trans lesbianism, which for me is already a pain point

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
of insecurity and embarrassment and shame.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
So Calvin, maybe, and again I could just be projecting,

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
but maybe that's kind of like how you feel about these trenders.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
When you make these videos condemning them as not really trans,

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
aren't you essentially exiling them from the in-group

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
so you no longer feel the pain of in-group cringe?

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
what you're really trying to destroy is the trender within.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And again, I could be full of shit here.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
At the end of the day, this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
But still, I guess I invite you to consider

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
whether producing trans-trender human attainment

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
is actually helping anything,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
or whether it's really just an addictive way

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
to scratch some kind of emotional itch.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Who's next?

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
Oh, how about Vanessa?

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
We meet again, Gorge.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
And once again, I'm wearing some kind of embarrassing anime hair piece.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
Vanessa is a trans woman who is the second most popular political trans YouTuber.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
At least that's what I wrote in the script when I had more subscribers than her

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
But since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Good for her.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
back when SJW Cringe was fashionable.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
but the most consistent theme was

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
trans-trenders and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
They're making us look bad.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
This is why people hate us.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
So what we can now recognize as a standard in-group cringe fixation.

58:34.000 --> 58:42.000
But Vanessa focused in particular on a strident SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
where she made a point of misgendering Riley

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
and dismissing her as a fake transgender

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
You know, if you went on estrogen,

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
your sex drive wouldn't be so high

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
and you wouldn't be guilt tripping people and having sex with you.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Just saying.

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
But then Riley made a video revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
where she not only apologized to Riley and acknowledged her transition,

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
but she actually went beyond the script of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
and opened up about having experienced herself,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
the cruelty she directed at Riley.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
or, you know, digging up my old pictures.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
And so the thought that this entire time

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
I've done that exact same thing to someone else

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and pushed that off on someone else

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
fucks with me.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And I'm fucking sorry.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Vanessa actually managed for one fleeting moment

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
to make a connection between her own past, her and drama

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists who consume human misery like a glutton

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
However, this lesson would not last.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content well past the point it had become passe,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
making a video with big red in the thumbnail as recently as 2019.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But once again, I underestimated Vanessa.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
In July 2019, her channel rocketed to a new level of success

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
when she released a video titled,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman called Jessica Yaniv.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Well, as far as I can tell,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
to close down several beauty salons that had refused to wax her hairy balls

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
after she approached them about it in an awkward and creepy way.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
She has a long history of sending extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And she attempted to host a topless pool party for unshaperoned children.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Basically Yaniv is someone who appropriates the language of transgender acceptance and equality

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And my read on Yaniv, by the way, is not that she's a cunning manipulator,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
but that this is someone who is mentally not playing with a full deck.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
After the success of her initial video, Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
At least now she's finally picking on someone who deserves it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and the lack of attention given to it by other trans public figures

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
as an indictment of trans activists,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000
who Vanessa thinks should spend more time sounding the alarm about transgender predators.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And I'm willing to admit there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Like some trans people really are so paranoid about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
that they basically look the other way and refuse to acknowledge the small

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
but real subset of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation like it's urgent breaking news.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name, but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But why? Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults reported to American law enforcement every year.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The literal president of America is a bit of a sexual predator himself.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I guess you could argue that since Yaniv is a trans identified predator, a tip,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
we as real trans people have a responsibility to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Like initially the LGBT website, Pink News,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.000
But I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates about the transgender crowd is really the best optics for us either.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Is it simply because she cares deeply about the well-being of children

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
and she thought making a video exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
but it's still a YouTube video and you have to ask,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
This got two million views.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Is this what you do with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
You host a live event debating the pedophile on your YouTube channel?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
What's to debate?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I don't need to be scared of my own house that I'm going to get fucking attacked.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Which is illegal in Canada, just saying.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
But do you think that was like cute?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Was that a moment for you?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Then of course you sell t-shirts featuring the meme that resulted from your YouTube pedophile debate.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I mean, that makes sense.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If you're going to catch a predator, you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And of course you gotta follow the pedophile's makeup tutorial.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
You know.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
For the children.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Now, I hate to be overly critical, but when I look at this,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I don't see a high-minded activist working to protect children in trans people's image.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I see a tabloid entertainer who's discovered a way to monetize milking lulz from a mentally defective pervert.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And I have to say Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I'm very entertained by all of this.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That's genius.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I wish I'd thought of that.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
But just be honest.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
This isn't activism.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
This isn't justice.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's a lol cow cult.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And I love that for her.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I love that for her.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000
But Blair, I can't help but notice you're still hitting all the same beats your videos have always hit.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Attention everyone.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's very important that we all gather around to condemn this bad transgender who is not a real transgender.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And Blair, I'll give you this.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You are getting better at choosing your targets.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and Jessica Yaniv is good casting for the part.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
as anything more than a smarter version of the same in-group cringe-humillatainment you've always made.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And by the way, you may want to check in on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber who produces a series called Trans Stupid.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Hi everyone, and welcome to another edition of Trans Stupid,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the show where I take a look at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news because stupidity is intersectional.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Transgender, more like trans retarded, more like trans gay.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Trans gay? I love that.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I just realized I'm literally trans gay.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses of trans ideology and activism,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
which in theory I do think is a perspective worth including in the conversation.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But in practice, well, let's just say Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And here's her transition advice to trans women just beginning their journey.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
You probably have this image in your head that, you know, you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Like, look at this seal. Isn't this seal adorable?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
You're so cute.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But the truth is, you're probably not looking like this seal right now, are you?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You're probably more like this big bull seal barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
this is a woman's body.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Rose, no. Do not simp for Vanessa. It only encourages her.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Would I be wrong to say I'm getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and wrongdoings,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000
but she also cannot resist making it very clear how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
The irony being that this kind of tweet came from someone who you can smell just by looking at a picture of them.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest at all in white knighting for Yaniv.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I do not support her journey. As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And maybe she does. I wouldn't be surprised.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
No, my point is that part of the catharsis that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive from making this kind of content

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
comes from contrasting themselves as good, presentable, real trans people

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
On one half, Vanessa looking fish, looking cunt.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast, the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Look, I happen to possess a little thing, you probably haven't heard of it, called inner beauty.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's right, sweetie. My pancreas, unclockable.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself with this cartoon.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Okay, straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune and the titanic tranner of Canada.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
A particular titanic tranner of Canada, the titanic tranner of Canada.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender that I associate with 4chan.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Or I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Well, I'm guessing that must be another important part of stopping a predator, right?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:50.000
It seems almost taboo to condemn people for how rough they look when I think that that tough love, in a way, is needed.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Because I look at what I looked like when I first transitioned.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Like, I looked bad. Like, I was overweight. I had no poor taste in clothes.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything. It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Rose, are you okay? No, you're not okay.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
None of us are okay. No trans woman, remotely in the public eye, is in any way okay.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And look, I don't want to take this psychoanalysis too far.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Because I don't know from watching YouTube videos what's going on in someone's head.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
But I can try to make intelligent inferences.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And I think it's pretty revealing that this is how Rose introduces the topic of Jessica Yaniv.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I think, well, one of the biggest characters in the whole fucking world at the moment, which is Jessica Yaniv.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Rose? Gorge? Jessica Yaniv is not one of the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
This is not a world historical figure.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
At the end of the day, this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver, B.C.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
She is not one of the most important characters in the world.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But it sounds like what she is, Rose, is one of the most important characters in your brain.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
This is distorted thinking. It's like A-Log comparing Chris Chan to Hitler.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession that you've lost perspective.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And I'm sure you have what seem to you like perfectly logical reasons why you're devoting so much attention to this.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm sure that's a factor too.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession when I see one.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet is more difficult than most people can imagine.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And I know that pretty much every trans person is bullied or shamed or humiliated at some point in our lives.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And I know how good it can feel to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies and turfs have said about us

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and to repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake, dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Oh, it feels good to be the turf for once.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Because when you point the finger at someone else, you're also pointing away from yourself.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles queer people are often treated like suspected sex criminals by default.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
So there's safety in being the one who spearheads the think of the children type moral crusade.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And when you expose a trans predator, you get that feeling of safety plus the relief of having someone in particular to blame for the shame and stigma we all feel.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us, but that's just not true.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It's a simple answer to a complicated problem. It's scapegoating.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:26.000
When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube, I see a community trying to cope with stigma and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's basically a blood sacrifice. It's not rational.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving in a long line of bad transgenders who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name and are the reason people hate us and must be condemned and destroyed.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But when Yaniv is finally gone, when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is, you're just going to find a new scapegoat to take her place.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And the shame cycle continues.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced is internalized as shame.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
When we project that shame onto scapegoats and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And we voice that contempt by shaming other people, which starts a new cycle.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags, new shame dumps, new lolcows, and you can end up like one of the people who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But that will never really heal us.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
God, how do I get out of this video?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I'm trying to have a serious conversation dressed as some sort of cat girl degenerate.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Cringe.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Shame I machined.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Don't look at me.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Thank you. Yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The word cringe really describes two different emotions, either embarrassment or contempt.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
When you're embarrassed for someone else, we call that vicarious embarrassment.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And that can mean cringing with someone who is embarrassed themselves, which I've argued is excluded in the internet usage of the word cringe.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone who isn't embarrassed themselves, in which case we say we're cringing at them.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Now if someone who's part of your in-group is embarrassing themselves, and by proxy embarrassing the in-group that includes you, you feel in-group cringe,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
which can involve both vicarious embarrassment and a kind of self-cringe.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And on the contempt side, contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you, particularly if they're traits you have contempt for in yourself,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
can develop into morbid cringe, which is that obsession with a lol cow,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that addiction to contempt you is gazing at a dark mirror in which you see reflected everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Now I want to end this video by reflecting on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good. Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It helps us interact smoothly with each other by telling us what not to do.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories can be cathartic.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It can make you feel closer to other people, more alike, less alone.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe is very healthy.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
It shows yourself aware, and you care at least a little bit what other people think.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves, and let's just say they're not my kind of people.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000
They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves, regardless of how they're actually coming across.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But I think partly out of fear of ending up like one of those people, I've overcompensated.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And I cringe too much, both at myself and at other people.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself, and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And when I take a look around the internet, like I've done in this video, I find that I'm not alone in this situation.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And it's not cute. So how do we cringe less?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Well, the cliche solution is self-love, which our culture plays a lot of value on.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Self-love and self-esteem.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I'm a bad bitch. I look like a supermodel. I'm a genius.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way, but it doesn't work because it's not realistic.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And when you realize that, you fall from one extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls the self-esteem tower of terror.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You go from self-love to self-hate, but self-hate is also a distortion.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Recently, I was listening to a David Foster Wallace interview.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Yeah, I know, cringe.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
How dare you notice that?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But it's true. Time spent cringing at yourself is still time spent obsessing over yourself.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And it's hard not to because humans are animals, so our perspective is egocentric by nature.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But we can still learn to appreciate that the world is bigger than us.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I mean, I've heard rumors.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:13.000
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy, Melissa Doll advocates not self-love or self-hate, but what she calls self-indifference.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:21.000
She says, self-indifference is the relief of realizing that you are simply not that big a deal.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So yeah, I was pretty cringy in the past, and I'm still pretty cringy now.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But you know what? Everyone else is pretty cringy too.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And the world's probably going to burn down in 50 years anyway.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So I don't know if I would call this good news, but if it's any consolation, nothing matters.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Nothing matters.
