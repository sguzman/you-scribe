16480	18840	English
18840	20760	English
20760	23000	me esandy
23000	31440	Oh, hey, Quarch, hey, how are you, Quarch?
31440	34400	Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.
34400	39160	I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine, well, fair enough.
39160	42720	But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?
42720	43720	How about this?
43720	48040	I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off, but first, you have to let me tell
48040	49440	you my life story.
49440	50440	Fair?
50440	51440	That's super fucking great.
51440	53960	Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.
53960	55840	I'll start at the beginning.
55840	59160	My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.
59160	63400	I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C., where the most exciting attraction for children
63400	65440	is the National Museum of Natural History.
65440	70120	At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who, might I add, deserve
70120	73360	their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.
73360	77680	Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong, I liked a good Stegosaurus
77680	82840	as much as the next five-year-old, but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.
82840	85100	Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.
85100	87720	It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.
87720	91960	I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.
91960	96120	The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up for my sixth-grade teacher,
96120	99200	Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.
99200	100200	Fuck you, Romano.
100200	102160	I'm glad your father died.
102160	104720	Comrades, losers, and haters.
104720	110680	I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion,
110680	114360	or music, begins with absolute pleasure.
114360	119380	You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.
119380	122880	Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.
122880	123880	Yes, god.
123880	127840	But as you get older, things get more complicated.
127840	133280	Northern Virginia is McMansion country, and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,
133280	137600	I remember riding around in the back of the minivan, looking at some stylistically jumbled
137600	142920	monstrosities, and I would get excited by some little detail, like, say, a circle of
142920	145280	fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.
145280	149440	But then my mom would say, look at this ostentatious trash.
149440	150440	So you learn.
150440	154000	You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.
154000	160160	And with taste comes all this adult baggage, snobbery, and pretense and conceit.
160160	164280	So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers, but I assure you, I have nothing
164280	165280	to do with taste.
165280	170320	I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.
170320	176680	So stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee, before you pass sentence, allow
176680	178160	me to make my case, gorge.
190160	191160	One.
191160	192160	Success.
192160	202280	Oh, hey, how are you, gorge?
202280	204280	Look, I like stuff.
204280	205840	I like shiny things.
205840	210200	For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.
210200	214880	But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.
214880	217120	There's a social context for it.
217120	219440	It generally means something.
219440	223600	Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace, married a Turkmenistani dictator
223600	225480	and moved into a cheesecake factory?
225480	230360	Well, because he's trying to send a message, maybe to the world, maybe to himself.
230360	237520	He's saying, behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.
237520	241360	Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power, from the pharaohs of
241360	246280	Egypt, to the kings of France, to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.
246280	248520	I guess God likes shiny things too.
248600	253400	In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.
253400	258040	It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.
258040	262080	The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.
262080	263240	In the words of Drake,
263240	266000	Started from the bottom, now we're here.
266000	269880	Started from the bottom, now the whole team's back in here.
269880	273400	Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.
273400	274400	You've made it.
274400	275400	You're rich, bitch.
275400	279920	Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?
279920	284040	The character J. Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them
284040	288920	anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's
288920	289920	worth something.
289920	294360	And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to
294360	295960	save the Hall of Hrolfgar.
295960	299880	At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of
299880	304080	The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.
304080	305640	I got a D minus.
305640	306640	I like dollars.
306640	307640	I like diamonds.
307640	308640	I like money.
308640	309640	I like shining.
309640	310640	I like those Balenciagas.
310640	311640	Fuck.
311640	315760	I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all
315760	319040	that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.
319040	320400	Let's talk about symbols.
320400	321560	Let's talk about allegory.
321560	323160	Let's talk about metaphor.
323160	324160	Let's talk about themes.
324160	329560	Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.
329560	334520	Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.
334520	337040	That's the American dream.
337040	340480	Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.
340480	344480	It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind
344480	345800	of success is really improbable.
345800	350960	Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say, rap music is a reason
350960	353640	for the problems with the blacks?
353640	358240	For conservatives, the American dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.
358240	363080	And is there any sector of our culture where the American dream is more unironically celebrated
363080	364080	than hip-hop?
364080	366200	It's not just hip-hop, though.
366200	369160	Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.
369160	372920	You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and
372920	375800	the Fendi and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.
375800	381480	Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,
381480	384600	to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.
384600	388480	Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care and replace it with a large-scale
388480	391920	figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.
391920	395520	That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese
395520	397960	furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.
397960	400040	I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?
400040	403080	Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.
403080	404680	We have standards in this country.
404680	406280	Listen up, America.
406280	411160	We live in a society, a society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
411160	415000	Not of climbers, but of...graspers.
415000	421640	To paraphrase Ian Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone cannot.
421640	425520	And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.
425520	429600	I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?
429600	432440	I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?
432440	434360	Not all the rich people, that's for sure.
434360	439080	So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also
439080	445400	so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well, what's the average person supposed
445400	447000	to do?
447000	448200	Two.
448200	449400	Fantasy.
451400	453720	I wish the world were my gem collection.
453720	455840	I wish I owned everything.
455840	458080	I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?
458080	462120	I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt.
462120	465160	Okay, that's super fucking great, but can I buy it?
465160	467160	Well, no, I can't buy it.
467160	470520	The grim reality is, you can't own everything.
470520	472000	So what do you do?
472000	474280	Well, you fake it.
474280	476680	You create an illusion.
476680	481120	I don't own this building, and you droop off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here,
481120	483720	as indeed you did, but that's okay.
483720	484720	I need a witness.
484720	490480	I need you to see me here, among the other art, where I belong.
490480	493000	Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?
493000	495760	It makes me feel valuable.
495760	502120	You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.
502120	504880	Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.
504880	508760	It is the aesthetic of owning everything.
508760	514760	The phrase opulence you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.
514760	515760	Opulence.
515760	517760	Op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly.
517760	521840	But it originally comes from the documentary Paris is Burning, up at the Harlem Ballroom
521840	524720	Culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by M.C.
524720	525720	Jr.
525720	526720	LaBeija.
526720	527720	O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E, opulence.
527720	528720	You own everything.
528720	538560	It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.
538560	542680	In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer, black, and Latin American participants of
542680	543680	the Bulls,
543680	547760	You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.
547760	549280	Some of them don't even eat.
549280	554280	So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour, an illusion created by skillful
554280	555680	artifice.
555680	559780	Participants walk categories like executive realness, with the goal of being indistinguishable
559780	561520	from a real executive.
561520	565800	Nowadays every white queer says the word realness, I guess in kind of a frivolous way.
565800	571280	I mean, who's among us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state, dressed up
571280	576400	as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children, and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne
576400	578040	Gacy realness, hunty.
578040	581600	I did it officer, I did the cultural appropriation.
581600	585800	I am a colonizer, I am part of the problem, and I'm sorry.
585800	587280	Take me away boys.
587280	588280	That's crazy.
588280	589280	That's mega coconuts.
589280	594280	I guess I should explain that American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up
594280	596040	model of linguistics.
596040	599800	All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.
599800	604160	Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays, and then finally white
604160	605720	cisheads start using them.
605720	609440	A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.
609440	612440	So originally realness, as Chanté put it,
612440	617680	was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume, but a treasure-comic disguise of
617680	623760	the chasm between what is being emulated and what is absent, namely racial justice, class
623760	626120	equality, and safety.
626120	630840	Realness in that sense is a much more complicated and interesting concept than the generic trans
630840	632840	notion of passing.
632840	636000	Realness is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy biogirl.
636000	640320	Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.
640320	644960	You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle that has been unjustly kept
644960	645960	beyond your reach.
645960	649920	You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.
649920	653440	And therefore you're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.
653440	657080	If I had the opportunity, I could be one, because I can look like one.
657080	661160	I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture, such as
661160	666200	the FX drama Pose, which is said during the era, is that it dramatizes an essential truth
666200	667200	about America.
667200	671160	It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel like they're
671160	674360	living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.
674360	678080	Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.
678080	682480	Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace are designed to make
682480	686760	you feel like a fancy bitch, even though they're actually just high-rise traps designed to
686760	688040	lure you in and take your money.
688040	690200	And if there's one thing I can't stand…
692160	695160	…it's traps.
699160	702760	But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American is to want to feel like
702760	704120	a fancy bitch.
704120	705440	I actually love Vegas.
705440	709720	I was there last year for the only good YouTuber, Lindsay Ellis's Bachelorette party.
709720	712680	I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.
712680	717960	But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s, I did once experience the first exciting stages
717960	719200	of a gambling habit.
719200	723280	I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity, and had some good luck playing
723280	724280	Blackjack.
724280	728480	I mean, I wasn't a high-ruler or anything, but my first time I walked out with an extra
728480	729480	$200.
729480	731240	And that was a lot of money to me.
731240	736840	At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour, so to make $200 in
736840	737840	five minutes.
737840	744280	But that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing customer service toil before taxes.
744280	749360	So I went back, and I went back, but I never got lucky again, and fortunately that was
749360	750840	enough to discourage me.
750840	755480	I remember one time as I was leaving the casino, I saw this man standing outside with this
755480	760120	look on his face that I have never seen on a human being before or since.
760120	766040	Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.
766040	769800	The kind of face that says, I'm going to have to explain to my wife that I spent the
769800	772920	kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.
772920	777480	And there is nothing opulent about that, nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs
777480	780920	with IV drips trying to pay off their hospital bills.
780920	784960	America, we are a bad country.
784960	788960	Donald Trump is a Vegas man, he's pulling this grift on the entire country.
788960	794440	And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream is more enchanting to
794440	799040	the imagination than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.
799040	803600	So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell, but in fact there are two
803600	806000	very different types of magic at work.
806000	810400	For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex, a demonstration of their wealth and
810400	811400	power.
811400	815520	But for the marginalized and impoverished, opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and
815520	817320	power they've been denied.
817320	821840	The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function, it's like the difference between
821840	825800	a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.
825800	826800	3.
826800	827800	Class.
827800	830000	Hey how are you?
830000	831320	Hey how are you?
831320	833520	Hey how are you?
833520	835120	Hey how are you?
835120	837960	People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.
837960	842680	You know, a biological female that looks like me, I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is
842680	846160	gonna sneak in through a rear window and I'll have to dial him for murder.
846160	848280	I get vertigo just thinking about it.
848280	852640	I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.
852640	857400	As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to and I oop
857400	858400	and I oop and I oop.
858400	859400	That's praxis.
859400	863000	Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat, whomst?
863000	864000	Who is she?
864000	865600	Where's her summer collection?
865600	868040	That's super fucking great but can't I buy it?
868040	871760	Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.
871760	877120	Now I could be out of touch, but personally, I've never met a factory worker, or a factory
877120	878120	owner for that matter.
878120	882720	They must all be on a brand trip to China, working on the BMP summer collection.
882720	886120	What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles is that the bougies own the
886120	889000	means of production and the proles work for wages.
889000	891920	But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?
891920	893280	What about YouTubers?
893280	895320	Which side of the revolution are we on?
895320	898920	I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here, cause if the revolution starts on Twitter,
898920	902600	my head is definitely going in the basket, and then I'll have no choice but to do the
902600	904440	conservative talk show circuit.
904440	908280	You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.
908280	910960	Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, ayo!
910960	915240	I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.
915240	919320	My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class, A Guide Through the
919320	923560	American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.
923560	928320	Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,
928320	931480	what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.
931480	935640	Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.
935640	940440	Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,
940440	943920	but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.
943920	947840	And it's also just pretty funny, like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher
947840	952040	your social class, the smaller the balls in the sports you play, or his description of
952040	953960	middle class living rooms.
953960	959040	Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines on
959040	965040	its coffee tables, otherwise expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas
965040	966040	might result.
966040	969880	One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your
969880	972400	class so much as how you got your money.
972400	976640	If you had to work for your money, then you're not really upper class.
976640	980960	The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident, they
980960	983320	don't feel the need to prove themselves.
983320	988120	Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the latter, but
988120	992960	then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their insecurities
992960	998320	by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper stickers on the back
998320	999320	of the family car.
999320	1001960	This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.
1001960	1006240	The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but the middle classes are all
1006240	1010080	affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.
1010080	1015680	Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove, whether
1015680	1020160	it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves, or the new rich
1020160	1023240	building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.
1023240	1025720	So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.
1025720	1030680	He inherited his wealth, so he should know better than to have golden faucets.
1030680	1031840	But he doesn't.
1031840	1037320	As Fran Lebowitz said, he's a poor person's idea of a rich person, and that's actually
1037320	1038320	his charm.
1038320	1040360	It's part of his mass appeal.
1040360	1043080	Trump behaves like a pro who won the lottery.
1043080	1047600	So there's actually something kind of relatable, unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about
1047600	1049200	the golden faucets.
1049200	1054560	People who have wealth, but not class, are actually very popular in this country.
1054560	1058920	We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.
1058920	1062240	Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves.
1062240	1067560	So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone, even though in practice it isn't.
1067560	1072320	Now the upper class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people, are mostly
1072320	1074120	very unlike Trump.
1074120	1079200	Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy, they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic
1079200	1082440	wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
1082440	1086560	Fuzzled notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.
1086560	1090800	They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.
1090800	1094760	They dress down while traveling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
1094760	1098160	These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.
1098160	1101440	If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you.
1101440	1105400	Or they might get enfiest and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.
1105400	1108560	Or worse, taxation.
1108560	1113480	Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.
1113480	1116800	I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class is dying out.
1116800	1120680	I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.
1120680	1125440	His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want, so long as you
1125440	1127240	have the cash to back it up.
1127240	1131840	So the old class system is dying out, and in its place, we have universally adopted
1131840	1133920	the mindset of the nouveau riche.
1133920	1136040	If you got it, flaunt it.
1136040	1139240	If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.
1139240	1143520	Now I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,
1143520	1150320	but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.
1150320	1152320	4.
1152320	1153320	Taste
1153960	1155760	Listen, comrades.
1155760	1160160	I have been pretty down on opulence so far, and I could continue analyzing it in terms
1160160	1164720	of inequality and class struggle, but you already know all that.
1164720	1166600	That's why you came to cut my head off.
1166600	1170440	But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?
1170440	1172360	Marxist economic analysis?
1172360	1175880	Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?
1175880	1179080	As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,
1179400	1184640	But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media
1184640	1188680	while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.
1188680	1190480	So what about the enjoyment part?
1190480	1193520	Surely you wouldn't be had a queen just for liking shiny thing.
1193520	1195880	Is there no room for art for art's sake?
1195880	1200600	The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen, Freulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlena
1200600	1205920	Kennedy Davenport-Kunt, said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested, that is, completely
1205920	1207760	free of any material desire.
1207760	1212360	Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement, so I don't know how seriously
1212360	1213360	we want to take that.
1213360	1217000	But it's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense, that it
1217000	1221000	merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys, which is really just a
1221000	1224000	shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.
1224000	1228240	God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos
1228240	1231040	trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.
1231040	1232040	What must that be like?
1232040	1235720	From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart that must be super fucking
1235720	1236720	hard for them.
1236720	1237720	I can't even imagine.
1237720	1240160	I mean, it makes sense, really.
1240160	1241800	Straight men don't have these problems.
1241800	1245360	They got away with painting softcore for 500 years and never had to think about it.
1245360	1246960	I guess Nietzsche is the exception.
1246960	1252360	He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel, and let's be honest, definitely
1252360	1253360	a chaser.
1253360	1258000	The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the respectable English
1258000	1259840	gentleman Oscar Wilde.
1259840	1260840	According to Wilde,
1260840	1266520	Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.
1266520	1267860	This is a fault.
1267860	1272440	Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.
1272440	1274400	For these, there is hope.
1274400	1279240	They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.
1279240	1282840	Spoken like a poet, you want to be cultivated, don't you?
1282840	1283840	Don't you think I'm beautiful?
1283840	1285720	Look, I'll play it your way.
1285720	1291160	Let's swing back to the other side of the sarcasian pendulum here.
1291160	1295480	As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that, but from
1295480	1301280	a strictly sociological perspective, I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related
1301280	1302280	to power.
1302280	1306360	When you go to a museum, you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting
1306360	1307720	that makes them appear magical.
1307720	1311480	Now, that's also what you do in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but the difference is that at
1311480	1315640	the museum, you can't buy anything, and that turns out to be important.
1315640	1316640	For Kantian reasons.
1316640	1322600	In the retail context of commodity fetishism, you correlate your aesthetic taste with material
1322600	1323600	desire.
1323600	1328320	Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything, you feel like your aesthetic
1328320	1332560	pleasure is pure, that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.
1332560	1334960	But of course, that's an illusion.
1334960	1339520	The museum is the context, and the context is telling you that the things you're looking
1339520	1340920	at are art.
1340920	1345320	So whoever decides what's in the museum decides what good taste is.
1345320	1346320	What's beautiful?
1346320	1347320	What's valuable?
1347320	1350520	Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.
1350520	1355200	Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre, conferring upon themselves
1355200	1358560	the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.
1358560	1363520	But it's not just a flex, it means something more than that because of the racial disparity
1363520	1365680	between the performers and the setting.
1365680	1370680	Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre, so seeing Jay
1370680	1375920	and Bea there looking so regal, with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European
1375920	1378440	art, it's like a full moment.
1378440	1383440	A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by
1383440	1384440	classical art.
1384440	1389360	That's why trans women love that picture, someone photoshopped of the Three Graces but
1389360	1390360	with dicks.
1390360	1395280	I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me, because here in
1395280	1399720	the west, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've
1399720	1401480	seen it sculpted in white marble.
1401480	1405600	Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.
1405600	1411320	For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness
1411320	1416440	of classical statues was the distinguishing feature of western sculpture, proof of the
1416440	1419120	elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
1419120	1422640	In reality, of course it turns out they were painted the colors of something a drag queen
1422640	1424520	might wear to Joaquin Sanyera.
1424520	1428400	Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues for hundreds of years but
1428400	1432520	were totally in denial about it because the pure whiteness of these figures was like
1432520	1434000	a sacred dogma.
1434000	1437800	Margaret Talba in The New Yorker attributes the dogma in part to
1437800	1444160	A tendency to equate whiteness with beauty, taste, and classical ideals, and to see color
1444160	1448480	as alien, sensual, and garish.
1448480	1454720	In 2008, Fabio Barry, an art historian who is now at Stanford, complained that a boldly
1454720	1460800	colored re-creation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum looked like
1460800	1463080	a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.
1463080	1465640	Hey, how are you?
1465640	1470640	And you just know that when the news first broke, some horrified wasp classicists turned
1470640	1477800	to a colleague and said, oh Kingsley, it looks… it looks Mexican.
1477800	1482680	In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues, some art historians have been
1482680	1486960	harassed by the alt-right, who don't take kindly to anyone questioning their white
1486960	1488960	supremacist myths about antiquity.
1488960	1494960	There's some pretty insidious, uh, identitarian prejudices here, hiding out under the cloak
1494960	1496320	of taste.
1496320	1501440	Good taste for upper and middle-class white people generally includes a reflexive disdain
1501440	1504800	for anything a little bit too… colorful.
1504800	1511880	It's these classes that constantly use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.
1511880	1516440	Joe Weldon, author of Fierce, The History of Leopard Print, observes that
1516440	1521960	Tacky, as a concept, refers to the lack of cultivation or the resistance to taste and
1521960	1526320	more often than not refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.
1526320	1533400	Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic, queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,
1533400	1536440	not business-like, not serious.
1536440	1542240	Aesthetic excess, particularly of colors, patterns, and bling, is especially offensive
1542240	1544240	to conservative wasp taste.
1544240	1550160	Tacky is often where the imagination runs free, where the heart is, where the soul is,
1550160	1551160	and where the fun is.
1551160	1554640	Well, that's good news, because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.
1554640	1555640	I can't imagine why.
1555640	1558240	Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.
1558240	1559560	Or camp.
1559560	1563560	People call me camp, and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.
1563560	1566400	I suppose it depends on what camp means.
1566400	1570560	Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala, and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite
1570560	1575080	intellectuals competing to outwit each other with the most erudite definition of what camp
1575080	1576080	really is.
1576080	1579320	What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.
1579320	1584840	The first I'll call coward camp, this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.
1584840	1587640	I have no respect for this whatsoever.
1587640	1591920	This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.
1591920	1595680	You think you're safe from criticism because your look is bad on purpose.
1595680	1597040	Fuck that.
1597040	1598920	Take a stand, you pussy bitch.
1598920	1603840	I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident, and Susan Sontag
1603840	1604960	agrees with me.
1604960	1607120	In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between
1607120	1609880	Naive and deliberate camp.
1609880	1612600	Pure camp is always naive.
1612600	1617240	Camp which knows itself to be camp, or camping is usually less satisfying.
1617240	1623320	Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness, a grand artistic vision that gets a little
1623320	1626160	out of control and enters into absurd territory.
1626160	1628200	Hey, how are you?
1628200	1632520	I don't know, my philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.
1632520	1635680	I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.
1635680	1637840	I think my aesthetic is good.
1637840	1641880	This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.
1641880	1647000	I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1647000	1652600	One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1652600	1656440	To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.
1656440	1661440	I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.
1661440	1664920	Like, I technically have the education to know better.
1664920	1669000	I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.
1669000	1670640	Why am I so tacky?
1670640	1675640	I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.
1675640	1680160	If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now bitch.
1680160	1684440	If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.
1684440	1689960	And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, ooh, sweaty, you'd better start
1689960	1690960	a revolution.
1690960	1693240	Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey, how are you?
1693240	1695240	Chicks with bread.
1697640	1698640	5.
1698640	1699640	Glamour.
1699640	1704200	Trans women have a special relationship with glamour, at least those of us who came of
1704200	1705200	age in the 1960s.
1705200	1709800	In the most basic everyday sense, glam is a way of styling yourself.
1709800	1715600	It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup, it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,
1715600	1717400	it's posing like a fashion model.
1717400	1721640	But originally the word glamour comes from the Scottish word grammery, meaning magic
1721640	1723160	or enchantment.
1723160	1728240	And glamour still involves a kind of illusion, or charm, cast on a spectator.
1728240	1733800	The connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay, Viva MacGlam?
1733800	1739360	Is transgenderism a critique of, or capitulation to, opulence-driven glamour models by transgender
1739360	1745120	writer and underground house music producer Terry Tamletz, aka DJ Sprinkles?
1745120	1746120	Sprinkles writes,
1746120	1751480	Europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes
1751480	1756560	with glimpses of heaven on earth, a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could
1756560	1758880	only be the result of divination.
1758880	1763760	It is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour, which is more
1763760	1767600	associated with wealth than magic.
1767600	1772400	Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour, or grammery, that was associated with witchcraft,
1772400	1774560	paganism, and sexual deviancy.
1774560	1780000	But in our capitalist society, glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often
1780000	1782400	a fantasy of a lavish life.
1782400	1786440	For example, a lot of dry queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating
1786440	1792320	celebrities, thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses, pop stars, and models secondhand.
1792320	1796720	Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of secondhand glamour acquires its power from
1796720	1799440	unquestioned social hierarchies.
1799440	1805200	Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance,
1805200	1806960	not social integration.
1806960	1812440	The promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation, but individual
1812440	1817040	transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.
1817040	1823480	It is the promise of an individual's class mobility, not social betterment or class critique.
1823480	1827200	It is, by and large, the American Dream.
1827200	1831440	Now I have to admit, this is a version of the American Dream that hits pretty close
1831440	1832640	to home for me.
1832640	1836760	The overarching plotline of my whole entire YouTube gender journey is that I used to be
1836760	1837760	a tragic mess.
1837760	1842840	And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started this channel I was a broke, gender-dysphoric,
1842840	1845160	alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.
1845160	1849400	I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance
1849400	1850400	at.
1850400	1851880	And now, I mean, look at me.
1851880	1852880	Look how far I've come.
1853080	1855240	I look like a moderately talented female impersonator.
1855240	1856560	Hey, how are you?
1856560	1860040	Those first several months of transition, though, they were rough.
1860040	1861880	I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.
1861880	1866480	I used to get laughed out of restaurants, and I was so proud that I wouldn't let anyone
1866480	1869200	see how much that stuff hurt me, you know?
1869200	1873080	I would say, well fuck them, I know I'm great.
1873080	1876120	And then I'd go cry my eyes out, alone in my car.
1876120	1881200	And I was a YouTuber that whole time too, which, I mean, the cyberbullying alone.
1882200	1886720	I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you haven't been in that situation.
1886720	1891960	You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice, picking apart your face and body,
1891960	1895760	clocking your clothes and makeup, digging up your past, trying to deduce the nature
1895760	1898640	of your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull.
1898640	1906120	A lot of it is hilarious to me now, but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.
1906120	1910960	But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up like it was the cure for cancer.
1910960	1912880	Like my life depended on it.
1912880	1915200	Which is basically how it felt.
1915200	1920800	Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as, as one tweeter put it,
1920800	1923160	cripplingly obsessed with passing.
1923160	1928760	And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me, but glam, to me, is not about
1928760	1929760	passing.
1929760	1934280	I think I actually pass better in no makeup than I do in eyeshadow out to here.
1934280	1937680	You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here, and people think she's just really
1937680	1943600	into makeup or Instagram or cosplay or something, but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,
1943600	1947440	which serves to call more attention to my situation.
1947440	1954160	But on YouTube, I mean, clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.
1954160	1956240	Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway, so what's the point?
1956240	1962120	I would describe this presentation as female impersonator, and that's basically what I
1962120	1963120	am.
1963120	1964120	A female, female impersonator.
1965120	1969200	And I present this way because it's fun, I find it artistically fulfilling, and let's
1969200	1973880	be honest, there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of larger-than-life
1973880	1974880	superwoman.
1974880	1977480	But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.
1977480	1978480	As Sprinkles says,
1978480	1984360	Glamour offers a strange overperformance of gender signifiers, a tenuously woven layer
1984360	1989720	of superfemininity which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered
1989720	1990720	body beneath.
1991160	1997000	Now a lot of leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility
1997000	2001200	represented by glamour, as well as by transition glow-up narratives.
2001200	2006800	And I think that disillusionment and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of
2006800	2012680	this intense anger and resentment I've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens,
2012680	2018360	for glamorous trans Instagram models, and let's be honest, for me.
2018360	2019960	Here's Sprinkles one more time.
2019960	2024960	As long as an MTF's public acceptance is gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous
2024960	2030040	body and style requirements that elude most quote, real women, then I'll have to ask
2030040	2035840	you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling represented by RuPaul any more
2035840	2041040	than my mother feels represented by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.
2041040	2045440	A lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world a fantasy all
2045440	2046440	the time.
2046440	2049560	They want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that shit.
2049640	2051040	They're fed up with glamour.
2051040	2052480	They're fed up with realness.
2052480	2054000	They're fed up with RuPaul.
2055000	2058080	And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.
2058080	2059480	And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.
2059480	2060480	Six.
2060760	2061760	Envy.
2061760	2067680	The Marxist art critic John Berger called glamour the happiness of being envied.
2067680	2070880	Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.
2070880	2075560	It depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you.
2075560	2079160	But being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination.
2079400	2082760	The actual experience of being envied sucks.
2082760	2084800	This is the risk of opulence.
2084800	2089080	It invites not just enchanted admiration, but also envy.
2089080	2094840	And where envy goes, the guillotine follows, or at least vindictive taxation.
2094840	2099560	This is why the experienced rich note a tone down the opulence, build a nice high wall
2099560	2103760	around their properties, and make a lot of high profile charitable donations.
2103760	2107760	We can call this kind of strategizing the public relations of success.
2107760	2112040	It certainly helps to have a rags to riches story, especially if you can make other people
2112040	2115160	feel included in some way in your success.
2115160	2119600	That's part of the appeal of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems to elevate not just a single
2119600	2122560	performer but an entire underclass.
2122560	2128280	Conversely, being perceived as exclusionary, elitist, or snobbish is going to cost you
2128280	2130960	big in terms of envy management.
2130960	2135880	YouTube music critic Todd in the Shadows did a review of Ariana Grande's song Seven Rings,
2135880	2140880	in which he basically drags Ariana, who apparently is white, for appropriating a bunch of hip-hop
2140880	2145520	rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom.
2145520	2151280	She's not showcasing a triumph over adversity, she's just a white girl who likes stuff.
2151280	2155480	We started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.
2155480	2160960	So in Todd's words, this song is a grotesque, bullying, VIP-only privilege flex of a mean
2160960	2163120	girl shoving her wealth in your face.
2163160	2167080	I actually like that song, but I'm into that sort of thing.
2167080	2168080	Believe me, mommy.
2168080	2169080	Aww.
2169080	2174480	Fellow students, as a case study in the public relations of success and envy management,
2174480	2180400	let us compare and contrast two successful YouTubers, Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.
2180400	2183880	There's enough similarities between them for the differences to be interesting.
2183880	2188600	They're both LGB and orty, they're both white, they're both blonde sometimes, they're both
2188600	2193080	feminine, they're both rich, and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles.
2193080	2200360	But nonetheless, people basically seem to like Jeffree Star, whereas Gigi, well, I don't
2200360	2204240	want to say people don't like her, but they don't relate to her.
2204240	2210280	The best example of this is her 2017 video, I Wear Walmart for a Week, with its gasp-inducing
2210280	2211960	life-to-dislike ratio.
2211960	2214200	Let's analyze what went wrong here.
2214200	2219480	So for today's video, I thought we would take it to a place I've never been, Walmart.
2219480	2221440	So that's a bad start, Gorge.
2221440	2223560	Most Americans have been to Walmart.
2223560	2227920	Never having been marks your upbringing as upper middle class at least.
2227920	2232080	Treating going to Walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes across as you and
2232080	2236080	your rich friends being like, what if we pretend to be poor for a day?
2236080	2239280	I wonder if we're going to see any people at Walmart, you know that website?
2239280	2240280	Baby's crying.
2240280	2241280	The trauma.
2241280	2242280	Gigi, no!
2242760	2246040	You need to turn the shade down like 20 notches, Gorge.
2246040	2248040	I keep picking my shin on this cart.
2248040	2250040	I'm literally going to have bruises.
2250040	2252440	Can someone remake these carts, please?
2252440	2254440	It's dangerous.
2254440	2256440	They're going to cut your head off, Gorge.
2261640	2262640	What should we get next?
2262640	2264640	Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?
2264640	2266280	Do they sell gowns here?
2266280	2271520	This to me is Peak Gigi, strolling down the aisles of Walmart with a 2-liter bottle of
2271520	2276720	Mountain Dew that she plucked from the shelves saying, I need something for a red carpet.
2276720	2278720	Do they have gowns here?
2278720	2282000	This to me is an iconic fashion moment.
2282000	2283320	This is naive camp.
2283320	2284320	This is everything.
2284320	2289240	The idea that she has privileges that other people don't has never once crossed her mind.
2289240	2293760	And that is a very special, precious thing that I want to cherish.
2293760	2295920	Personally, I have no choice but to stand.
2295920	2301120	The YouTube comments section, however, is not as amused as I am, nor as forgiving.
2301120	2304600	This is the second time I've done a close reading of a Gigi video.
2304600	2306120	It's getting kind of weird.
2306120	2308120	Also why hasn't she answered my letters?
2308120	2309720	Step on my throat, mommy.
2309720	2311240	Now let's look at Jeffree Star.
2311240	2314000	Jeffree does similar kinds of videos to Gigi.
2314000	2317440	He's even done his own video wearing Walmart for a day, which people loved.
2317440	2322640	Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in public perception is to scream SACISM.
2322640	2325160	And there's maybe a little of that going on.
2325160	2329320	I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly
2329320	2330800	more than that going on here.
2330800	2336280	Jeffree's fans are, I assume mostly women and not rich women, regular women.
2336280	2338440	The women who work at the dollar store love him.
2338440	2340360	I'm like your biggest fan.
2340360	2344160	Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer
2344160	2349320	bags and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.
2349320	2353840	It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about
2353840	2355320	the extremely wealthy.
2355320	2358880	The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self made.
2358880	2362080	He represents himself as having started from the bottom.
2362080	2366880	You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing and just generally seems like he hasn't let
2366880	2368080	his wealth go to his head.
2368080	2371960	A good example of this is his private jet Burger King Mukbang.
2371960	2375920	Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very relatable, but the Burger
2375920	2379080	King aspect brings it back down to earth.
2379080	2381440	Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger King before.
2381440	2385920	He's able to order fluently, he's even kind of charming to the cashier.
2385920	2389440	He doesn't like scoff or pinch his nose at anything.
2389440	2391920	Also the Gucci barrette.
2391920	2397760	Whereas Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if Sis would
2397760	2399840	make it out of Burger King alive.
2399840	2405280	You know, she'd commit some terrible upper class solicism like, I don't know, not understanding
2405280	2407080	the concept of a value meal.
2407080	2411640	I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video, just not a relatable video.
2411640	2415800	You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat and do a story time about
2415800	2416800	that.
2416800	2418040	That's really when Gigi's at her best.
2418040	2421960	She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives
2421960	2424440	of Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.
2424440	2427680	So I'm like, I see this white little chicklet in my hand.
2427680	2431720	I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like, oh my God.
2431720	2436600	Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled by the fact that people basically
2436600	2437600	like the rich.
2437600	2442200	Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch
2442200	2443200	behavior.
2443200	2447000	But ultimately, we have no choice but to stand.
2447000	2452160	And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who, in a way, seems like
2452160	2455560	a poor person who just so happens to be very rich.
2455560	2459720	Now if inequality increases enough, I suspect the standing will stop.
2459720	2464800	Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store
2464800	2468960	if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.
2468960	2472760	But if you're thinking about how $69,000 can pay off your life for earning medical
2472760	2477520	debt or about how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying wife, this
2477520	2480240	kind of thing will start getting under your skin.
2480240	2483840	And eventually, people will start building guillotines again.
2483840	2489000	In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people
2489000	2491120	start behaving as badly as possible.
2491120	2493120	So this isn't your dream job?
2493120	2494120	No.
2494120	2495120	That's great, right?
2495120	2496120	Whatever you want.
2496120	2497120	Okay, great.
2497120	2498120	7.
2498120	2499120	Ruin.
2499120	2500120	Good evening, Gorge.
2500120	2511320	Ever notice how most vampires are like, cats or queens or at least rich?
2511320	2516760	I guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash.
2516760	2521480	Gothic horror really got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were
2521480	2524520	usually set in an old decaying castle or mansion.
2524520	2529920	By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,
2529920	2535760	so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order, and also
2535760	2540440	maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the land and gentry.
2540440	2545560	Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played
2545560	2549160	an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility.
2549160	2554840	So the gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence, and that aesthetic
2554840	2560520	has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic haunted house,
2560520	2565040	which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.
2565040	2567600	It's a trope with an interesting backstory.
2567600	2572560	During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new wealthy class of people who built what
2572560	2575040	were essentially 19th century McMansions.
2575560	2580080	When the Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began
2580080	2586400	to decay, which gave them morbid associations that made them perfect for stories about hauntings
2586400	2589480	and psychos and weirdos.
2589480	2594560	So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think.
2594560	2599840	We live in an age of opulence and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in
2599840	2600840	power.
2600840	2604640	The middle class is shrinking, social unrest is on the rise.
2604640	2607760	It seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.
2607760	2613440	When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined
2613440	2614760	shopping malls?
2614760	2617960	Well, there kind of already is.
2617960	2622920	The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he
2622920	2628000	explores the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example the now demolished Owings Mills
2628000	2630080	Mall just north of Baltimore.
2630080	2634000	The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.
2634000	2653200	It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue.
2653200	2659160	It was a big high-end mall, but in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was
2659160	2663880	murdered during an armed robbery on the trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station.
2664280	2669320	After the murder, the mall got a reputation for being unsafe and slowly the stores closed
2669320	2670320	down.
2670320	2676960	Dan recorded two videos at Owings Mills in 2015 when only five of the original 155 stores
2676960	2678200	remained.
2678200	2684240	He takes us through the strangely clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted
2684240	2686120	food court.
2686120	2691200	Watching these videos seems to provoke an emotional response in a lot of people.
2691200	2696720	Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express rage at the waste and futility, some
2696720	2702000	find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity
2702000	2703000	of it all.
2703000	2704000	One commenter says,
2704000	2709920	I think it is still hitting people with slow motion shock that the 20th century is really
2709920	2710920	over.
2710920	2716200	In the 80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone.
2716200	2722280	In fact, it was the last gasp of 20th century general prosperity.
2722280	2727160	I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of these emotions.
2727160	2732960	I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for the
2732960	2739680	21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism.
2739680	2742280	Oh, it gives me a chill.
2742280	2749320	My nape hair stands on end and a tingle goes down my spine.
2749320	2754800	The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about
2754800	2760860	it we see clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic
2760860	2764320	footage of the half-demolished ruin.
2764320	2769840	It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey where you somehow perceive
2769840	2772720	the spiritual significance of the original building.
2772720	2779280	In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the shoppers and the workers, their aspirations
2779280	2786680	and material longings, but what does the crumbling wreckage of a JC Penny really mean?
2786680	2795440	That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.
2795440	2798320	Alright comrades, I've said my piece.
2798400	2803480	I'll come quietly, there's no reason to tie me down, I mean, unless you're into that,
2803480	2805600	in which case, by all means.
2805600	2808240	No, I won't resist.
2808240	2810800	I accept my fate.
2828320	2857360	Fuck you, Romano, I'm glad your father died.
2858320	2860800	Let's just get that out there before I just say it.
2860800	2867280	Now let's be honest, definitely a tranny shazer.
2867280	2874160	Gosh I sure do think I'm funny, but he was an incel, and definitely a tranny shazer.
2874160	2878800	I'm looking, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed of what I've written.
2878800	2880800	Huh?
2880800	2886320	Kant yeah, but I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.
2886400	2890400	I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked
2890400	2891920	in a tub full of jewels.
2891920	2894720	How much leg do we want to get in here?
2894720	2896080	A lot, I assume.
2896080	2900160	I'm just getting oil all over my fur, great, it's not real fur, whatever.
2900160	2903840	Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.
2903840	2905840	Ugh, moral people.
2905840	2909280	There's one that I can't stand.
2909280	2911840	People who have some sense of decency.
2911840	2914320	Okay, is a hair light really a good idea?
2914640	2917120	Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?
2917120	2918160	Who invented that?
2918160	2918960	An asshole.
2918960	2922080	What about bartender who owns the bar he works on?
2922080	2923760	I guess what I should be to be feminist.
2924720	2925520	Christ.
2925520	2927280	The demands of these people.
2927280	2928560	Those fucking teeth, man.
2932000	2934960	It's like being tight, happy, happy.
2935680	2940480	That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.
2941120	2944560	It's okay, I'm being stupid.
2944560	2946080	Uh, okay.
