WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

00:15.720 --> 00:23.120
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything

00:23.120 --> 00:24.600
you hate.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.180
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

00:29.180 --> 00:34.580
Even invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands

00:34.580 --> 00:37.540
by a cabal of globalist elites.

00:37.540 --> 00:43.460
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization

00:43.460 --> 00:44.580
as we know it.

00:44.580 --> 00:49.140
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

00:49.140 --> 00:53.340
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

00:53.340 --> 00:59.840
Now watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under

00:59.840 --> 01:03.140
the black boots of the Third World Court.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.500
Does that thought fill you with rage?

01:05.500 --> 01:06.660
Good.

01:06.660 --> 01:09.300
We must be prepared to fight.

01:09.300 --> 01:16.500
To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.

01:16.500 --> 01:22.660
To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.

01:22.660 --> 01:38.540
Make America great again, hail victory.

01:38.540 --> 01:45.580
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

01:45.580 --> 01:57.260
Actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,

01:57.260 --> 02:03.460
so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the dialectical

02:03.460 --> 02:07.580
object through the sublimation of negative materiality.

02:08.580 --> 02:11.980
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.

02:11.980 --> 02:15.980
Death to capitalism, hail Satan.

02:38.580 --> 02:42.780
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

02:42.780 --> 02:44.540
Well, what do you expect?

02:44.540 --> 02:49.180
We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent

02:49.180 --> 02:52.180
white middle class that prefers order to justice.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.380
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.740
So let's accept that all that's true.

02:56.740 --> 02:57.740
The game is rigged.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.740
Fine.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.780
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

03:00.780 --> 03:04.460
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the

03:04.460 --> 03:08.220
predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

03:08.220 --> 03:12.860
Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer s-beat who puts style over

03:12.860 --> 03:17.300
substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary

03:17.300 --> 03:19.900
kropskyite tendencies.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.660
I mean, are you even a communist?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.660
No.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.660
I'm not a communist.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.660
Well, why not?

03:25.660 --> 03:26.660
Mmm.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.460
I like stuff.

03:28.460 --> 03:33.180
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.660
That's why I can't be a communist.

03:34.660 --> 03:39.700
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property,

03:39.700 --> 03:40.700
right?

03:40.700 --> 03:43.780
You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means

03:43.780 --> 03:44.780
of production.

03:44.780 --> 03:47.500
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.940
Well, you should feel bad about that.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.820
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.900
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.900
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

03:54.900 --> 03:55.900
Right.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.100
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

04:01.100 --> 04:03.420
That's what I thought.

04:03.420 --> 04:06.300
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.700
And they're afraid of you.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.860
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

04:09.860 --> 04:10.860
Really?

04:10.860 --> 04:12.540
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.540
Let's see.

04:13.540 --> 04:17.660
We've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.

04:17.660 --> 04:20.780
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.

04:20.780 --> 04:26.020
Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.500
Great.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.100
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.740
Positives first, the rose is great, love the rose, fantastic.

04:35.740 --> 04:39.540
Now, the hammer and sickle, we're gonna need to get rid of that.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.940
I'm just wearing it ironically.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.940
Now, don't you start with that.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.900
It makes me think of red lines and gulags and it needs to go.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.340
Well, maybe you're right.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.020
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.660
See, I can think about optics.

04:50.660 --> 04:51.660
What's that in your bag?

04:51.660 --> 04:52.660
Oh, this?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.660
Yeah.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.420
We're gonna need to do something about that too.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.620
Now hold on, getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing, but Marx is a foundational

04:59.620 --> 05:01.260
thinker in the history of progressive political-

05:01.260 --> 05:05.020
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx, I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.500
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.020
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.020
Red and gold?

05:11.020 --> 05:15.140
What is this foreign shit, like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

05:15.140 --> 05:16.140
It's un-American.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.140
I don't trust it.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.140
I don't like the cut of its jib.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.140
So you want a Marx-Angels reader wrapped in an American flag?

05:22.140 --> 05:24.580
Oh, I can do you better than that.

05:24.580 --> 05:28.100
Let's start with a gradient, got a grid, maybe a wave grid.

05:28.100 --> 05:34.940
Let's get some shiny fonts, maybe a bust, a pink bust, with 3D glasses, pink glasses,

05:34.940 --> 05:37.020
maybe some palm trees.

05:37.020 --> 05:39.020
Oh, yeah.

05:39.020 --> 05:43.460
Or how about this?

05:43.460 --> 05:44.460
Lots of brands.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.460
More, more, more.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.460
Oh my god.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.460
It's beautiful.

05:47.460 --> 05:48.460
Okay, one more, one more.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.460
A pink field, chocolate.

05:49.460 --> 05:50.460
Yes, girl.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.460
Yes.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.700
I just realized that I actually hate you.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.700
Hello, fellow whites.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.700
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and future

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
for white children?

05:59.700 --> 06:04.700
Turn the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.700
Effective, isn't it?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
Well, I see your point.

06:08.700 --> 06:14.020
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

06:14.020 --> 06:19.020
if there's some way you cannot do that.

06:20.020 --> 06:24.020
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

06:24.020 --> 06:29.020
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

06:36.020 --> 06:40.220
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not going to do by tweeting

06:40.220 --> 06:44.860
death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone

06:44.860 --> 06:49.420
to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas

06:49.420 --> 06:53.940
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting

06:53.940 --> 06:57.540
that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent

06:57.540 --> 07:02.460
revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.220
Well, that's an unfair association.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.220
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.140
Has there ever been real communism?

07:10.140 --> 07:11.620
Well, yes.

07:11.620 --> 07:17.860
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary Eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived communist

07:17.860 --> 07:21.780
utopia did flourish until it was smashed by Western imperialism.

07:21.780 --> 07:22.780
Right.

07:22.780 --> 07:26.620
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

07:26.620 --> 07:30.340
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible, that's how deep you are in pure

07:30.340 --> 07:31.340
theory.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.500
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.020
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

07:37.020 --> 07:41.340
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

07:41.340 --> 07:45.020
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the

07:45.020 --> 07:46.020
way things are going.

07:46.020 --> 07:49.660
I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.980
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

07:51.980 --> 07:53.660
For all I know, you could be correct.

07:53.660 --> 07:56.700
I'm just saying, it's a tough sell and you are not selling it.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.980
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal

07:59.980 --> 08:05.140
intellectual void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted

08:05.140 --> 08:09.700
the Overton window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical

08:09.700 --> 08:10.700
liberalism.

08:10.700 --> 08:16.060
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

08:16.060 --> 08:18.820
Hey, hey, hey.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.380
You leave centrists alone.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.380
Thanks, Justine.

08:21.380 --> 08:22.500
Jackie, get out of here.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.660
You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.500
I'll see you at brunch.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
Mimosas.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.380
What the hell was that?

08:30.380 --> 08:31.380
Brunch?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.180
You got a brunch with these people?

08:33.180 --> 08:36.100
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.100
Afternoon tea?

08:37.100 --> 08:42.260
Does Jeeves bring around Madeline cookies and fresh sliced lemon wedges?

08:42.260 --> 08:46.340
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor, China tea set.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.420
Unbelievable.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.900
You get the bullet too.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.380
You get the goddamn bullet too.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.380
Oh, come on.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.380
Me?

08:52.380 --> 08:53.380
Me?

08:53.380 --> 08:54.380
What do you want me to do?

08:54.380 --> 08:59.020
Drink victory gin out of a rusty Harrington like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in

08:59.020 --> 09:00.020
Eastern Cameroon?

09:00.020 --> 09:02.260
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

09:02.340 --> 09:06.860
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle, shooting at capitalists with

09:06.860 --> 09:10.260
a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left wing enough for you.

09:10.260 --> 09:14.540
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

09:14.540 --> 09:18.820
and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?

09:18.820 --> 09:20.700
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

09:20.700 --> 09:26.140
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

09:26.140 --> 09:31.540
Most of what we do is behind the scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxxing them,

09:31.540 --> 09:35.740
disrupting their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist

09:35.740 --> 09:36.740
rallies.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.100
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long

09:40.100 --> 09:44.020
enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the black block is going to save your

09:44.020 --> 09:47.780
life because you don't look like you can fight and the police certainly aren't going

09:47.780 --> 09:48.780
to save you.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.380
Well, maybe so.

09:50.380 --> 09:55.500
I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going

09:55.500 --> 09:59.740
to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what

09:59.740 --> 10:00.740
we're in.

10:00.740 --> 10:05.100
We can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to be, and

10:05.100 --> 10:09.580
black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.

10:09.580 --> 10:10.580
Oh, come on!

10:10.580 --> 10:14.620
You have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

10:14.620 --> 10:21.980
What about a girl in a mask?

10:21.980 --> 10:25.140
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.060
Well, it was worth a shot.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.900
Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.100
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.140
You mean the propaganda war.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.140
Shh!

10:35.140 --> 10:36.660
Don't call it propaganda.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.500
There could be liberals listening.

10:38.500 --> 10:42.420
Look, what the left needs to get and what the centrists need to get, and what only

10:42.420 --> 10:47.100
I and the fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.100
Oh boy, here we go.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.580
What is an eccentric hate about social justice warriors?

10:50.580 --> 10:53.500
It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.000
It's that they're not cool, right?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.420
Social justice warriors are not cool.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.420
What do you mean?

10:58.420 --> 10:59.420
They're not popular?

10:59.420 --> 11:00.420
No, no, no.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.420
I mean, they're not cool.

11:01.420 --> 11:05.580
You can be unpopular and still cool, and in fact it can be cool to be unpopular.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.340
So what does it mean to be cool?

11:07.340 --> 11:11.420
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about

11:11.420 --> 11:14.340
social justice warriors is that they're emotional.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.060
The social justice warriors, who everyone cringes at online, are people who I'm sure

11:18.060 --> 11:21.900
are nice people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
middle of an outburst.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.620
They're out of control, and that's the problem.

11:25.620 --> 11:26.620
It's not cool.

11:27.380 --> 11:32.500
This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-it-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality

11:32.500 --> 11:37.400
is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.800
People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses

11:41.800 --> 11:42.800
to injustice.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.300
I thought you'd say that, but what you're failing to consider is that it's possible

11:46.300 --> 11:48.460
to be both angry and cool.

11:48.460 --> 11:52.300
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?

11:52.300 --> 11:53.300
What?

11:53.300 --> 11:56.140
You get... ice cold.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.620
I'm sorry.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.620
What?

11:58.620 --> 11:59.620
And that's what we on the left need to become.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.620
Ice cold motherfuckers.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.620
What the hell are you talking about?

12:01.620 --> 12:02.620
Miles Davis.

12:02.620 --> 12:03.620
Incredibly cool.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.620
But pretty angry.

12:04.620 --> 12:08.620
Did not take shit from white people, but also, ice cold motherfucker.

12:08.620 --> 12:12.620
So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.620
Precisely.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.620
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.620
This is ridiculous.

12:17.620 --> 12:18.620
This is ridiculous.

12:18.620 --> 12:19.620
This is ridiculous.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.620
This is ridiculous.

12:20.620 --> 12:21.620
This is ridiculous.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.620
This is ridiculous.

12:22.620 --> 12:23.620
This is ridiculous.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.620
This is ridiculous.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.620
This is ridiculous.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.620
This is ridiculous.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.620
This is ridiculous.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.620
This is ridiculous.

12:28.620 --> 12:29.620
I think it's stalemate.

12:29.620 --> 12:30.620
No it's not.

12:30.620 --> 12:31.620
My queen is wide open.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.620
No it isn't.

12:32.620 --> 12:33.620
Take me.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
I'm going to get going now.

12:34.620 --> 12:35.620
Wait.

12:35.620 --> 12:36.620
Where are you going?

12:36.620 --> 12:39.620
I'm going to go bash the phabish.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.620
Well, be careful.

12:41.620 --> 12:42.620
Sure.

12:42.620 --> 12:45.620
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.620
What a goddamn lunatic.

12:48.620 --> 12:55.620
What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her.

13:18.620 --> 13:25.620
What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her, I'm gonna miss her.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.620
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.620
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

13:52.620 --> 13:54.620
Anyway, they killed each other, they're both dead.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.620
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.620
It's best not to think about it too much.
