WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.720
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

00:16.720 --> 00:22.720
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

00:22.720 --> 00:30.160
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile,

00:30.800 --> 00:34.320
and I will not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.240
You know what, America? Things have not gone well. We're having a hard time. We are. Between the

00:44.240 --> 00:50.400
plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of

00:50.480 --> 00:56.960
fascism, the criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease

00:56.960 --> 01:02.160
that has killed 200,000 people and counting, of course there's going to be some trumpet in

01:02.160 --> 01:09.840
the comments saying, it's not that big a deal. Calm down. People die all the time.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.280
Funny, that's not what she said about.

01:12.880 --> 01:18.640
Godly. We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness. And unfortunately,

01:18.640 --> 01:25.360
Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job. I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being

01:25.360 --> 01:29.840
more vocal about it when I had the chance. So this time, I'm going to say something,

01:29.840 --> 01:35.760
because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden

01:35.760 --> 01:40.160
is the single most important thing any American can do right now. So allow me to make my case,

01:40.160 --> 01:46.080
Gorge. By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're

01:46.080 --> 01:53.200
firing off hot takes as we speak. Typical T-Thot normie radlib endorses the electoral farce.

01:53.200 --> 01:58.160
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube? Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain

01:58.160 --> 02:04.720
about cancel culture than revolt against the neoliberal status quo. Tabby-chan, tabby-chan.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.200
You know what, Tabitha? For once, I'm actually going to take the bait. So this will be a

02:09.200 --> 02:15.680
conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain. I'm making this video

02:15.680 --> 02:22.720
because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so disillusioned with the system that they

02:22.720 --> 02:27.520
intend not to vote in this election. And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but

02:27.520 --> 02:32.720
that's fine. Maybe I can whenever the Russian bot vote. So I really do understand the perspective

02:32.720 --> 02:37.840
that Biden is not worth voting for, because that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.

02:37.840 --> 02:42.720
But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.640
Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children. There's probably asbestos in that tile,

02:46.640 --> 02:51.680
because America's so great even the floor is made of poison. Okay, Tabby-chan, give me your worst.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.280
I want free health care, student debt cancelled, and worker ownership of the means of production.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.520
Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change

03:01.520 --> 03:07.200
things. We'll listen, Tabby-chan. None of us want to vote for Joe Biden. I don't want to vote for Joe

03:07.200 --> 03:13.040
Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom. But sometimes, a situation gets so toxic and so

03:13.040 --> 03:18.400
dangerous, well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty. And in this election, I consider a

03:18.400 --> 03:25.280
vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump. You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily

03:25.280 --> 03:31.360
the same as supporting the politician. I don't think anyone should stan Joe Biden. I'm not asking

03:31.440 --> 03:37.520
you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans. Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.

03:37.520 --> 03:44.800
The president has a big stick. To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the

03:44.800 --> 03:50.480
likely consequences of each candidate winning. It's not hero worship. It's not choosing a person

03:50.480 --> 03:57.600
to have a beer with. It's strategy. Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump. The Dems are just

03:57.600 --> 04:02.720
Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility. Well, I agree

04:02.720 --> 04:08.320
that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's no difference

04:08.320 --> 04:12.800
between them and the Republicans. I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real

04:12.800 --> 04:18.240
difference between Trump and Hillary, but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would

04:18.240 --> 04:23.200
not have done. Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion of an addict, withdrawing

04:23.200 --> 04:27.520
from the Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

04:27.520 --> 04:31.840
to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

04:31.840 --> 04:36.160
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling white

04:36.160 --> 04:41.680
nationalist militias very fine people, and telling them to stand by, aspiring to be an autocratic

04:41.680 --> 04:46.080
dictator, and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in the name

04:46.080 --> 04:51.360
of delusional macho bostering. So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make

04:51.360 --> 04:56.640
a real difference if they're in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're, you know,

04:56.720 --> 05:06.560
a woman or LGBTQ or, you know, a human who lives on the planet Earth. So Biden will give us rainbow

05:06.560 --> 05:11.280
capitalism in streets named after Black Lives Matter, but he'll do nothing to bring about

05:11.280 --> 05:17.360
systemic change. Well, Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that. I fully expect

05:17.360 --> 05:22.160
to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for. So you sit

05:22.240 --> 05:26.720
here vote shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

05:26.720 --> 05:32.880
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote. Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan. Look,

05:32.880 --> 05:37.120
I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade. Why is it that when you tell people on

05:37.120 --> 05:42.000
the left to vote, they think you're saying quit your job, abandon your family, retreat from society,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.120
and fall into a deep slumber from which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib

05:47.120 --> 05:52.000
before fleeing into the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch

05:52.000 --> 05:58.240
temple awaiting the return of bales above? Voting doesn't take that long. At most, it takes one day.

05:58.240 --> 06:02.800
You can vote and do other things also. I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman

06:02.800 --> 06:09.360
with the we'd be a brunch sign. And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI-style

06:09.360 --> 06:14.320
armchair with a pair of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now. Could you be any

06:14.320 --> 06:19.760
bougier? Don't call me bougie. I'm beyond bougie. When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie,

06:19.760 --> 06:26.400
I scoff at them openly. I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my

06:26.400 --> 06:31.680
fiefdom. You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine. Why should I

06:31.680 --> 06:36.560
listen to what you say? Oh, you shouldn't. I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly. But also,

06:36.560 --> 06:41.120
I am a degenerate class traitor and, in my opinion, influencers should be the first against the wall.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.520
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with. You at least have to admire

06:45.520 --> 06:50.320
that about us libs. We have a remarkable willingness to have played conversations with

06:50.320 --> 06:54.720
people who are trying to kill us. Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan,

06:54.720 --> 07:02.880
but what is your plan, Tabitha? Uh, protest? Unionize? Mutual aid? Strikes? So I totally agree.

07:02.880 --> 07:08.160
Those are all good things to do. I've gone to protests myself this year. I've given to a mutual

07:08.160 --> 07:11.920
aid group. You know, you're right that voting won't fix all their problems, and it's good to

07:11.920 --> 07:16.320
get involved in local things like that. But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

07:16.320 --> 07:20.720
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus. So, in addition to whatever else

07:20.720 --> 07:26.640
you're doing, vote. Why participate in the charade of a farcical election? America is

07:26.640 --> 07:34.240
not democratic. It's a rigged two-party corporatocracy. Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot

07:34.240 --> 07:39.840
wrong with our elections. Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering,

07:39.840 --> 07:45.840
voter suppression, DC being disenfranchised. All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't

07:45.840 --> 07:51.600
think that in this moment, leftists boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.280
Okay, by voting as for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit. Ew. Okay, yeah, it's true

07:57.280 --> 08:01.840
that voting is not cool. It's boring. It's incrementalist. It doesn't make you feel like

08:01.840 --> 08:05.920
you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents. But, you know, you could always vote in

08:05.920 --> 08:10.640
secret and then maintain your radical image around your friends. Isn't being involved in

08:10.640 --> 08:16.640
politics inherently not cool? Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things,

08:16.640 --> 08:21.680
people who place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool. I feel

08:21.680 --> 08:26.960
like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing. It's

08:26.960 --> 08:32.400
showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all the bullshit,

08:32.400 --> 08:38.240
the corrupt system, the electoral farce. But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting

08:38.240 --> 08:42.960
and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.680
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing

08:47.680 --> 08:51.680
are no different from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.320
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.880
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses? This ends in violence

09:00.880 --> 09:06.160
either way, so he may as well smash. Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.

09:06.160 --> 09:12.400
But if there's a decisive Biden victory and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare scenario,

09:12.400 --> 09:17.280
then I think the military will force Trump to leave. Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are

09:17.280 --> 09:22.240
tough. The president is a fascist. I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising

09:22.240 --> 09:27.440
than it's ever been in my life. But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies. And for a

09:27.440 --> 09:33.840
lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting democracy itself,

09:34.560 --> 09:39.440
that would legitimize smashing. So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

09:39.440 --> 09:44.400
But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world. The whole system is broken,

09:44.400 --> 09:49.520
and voting won't change that. We don't need a democrat. We need to end capitalism.

09:50.480 --> 09:58.480
Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order. When you say end capitalism,

09:58.480 --> 10:04.400
you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us

10:04.400 --> 10:09.360
that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending. Like before capitalism,

10:09.360 --> 10:16.240
there was feudalism, and feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population

10:16.240 --> 10:23.440
and production. Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism. So won't capitalism

10:23.440 --> 10:28.560
end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it? I don't think that's the kind of thing that

10:28.560 --> 10:34.080
can be accomplished by a small group of activists. And I say small group because I'm sorry to break

10:34.080 --> 10:39.360
it to you, but the vast majority of Americans are not communists. I think a lot of internet leftists

10:39.360 --> 10:45.040
have a vastly overinflated sense of how big and important they are. I fall prey to it myself.

10:45.040 --> 10:50.560
Like I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary, in part because when I looked at my

10:50.560 --> 10:56.160
timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream

10:56.160 --> 11:02.400
deaths. But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and very

11:02.400 --> 11:07.680
unrepresentative sample of the population. You have to remember that only 22 percent of Americans

11:07.680 --> 11:13.600
use Twitter at all. Most users rarely tweet, and 80 percent of tweets come from 10 percent of users.

11:13.600 --> 11:19.760
So 80 percent of tweets come from 2 percent of Americans. And it's not a representative 2 percent.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.920
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population,

11:23.920 --> 11:27.680
and that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,

11:27.680 --> 11:33.920
more educated, and higher income. And far left hammer and sickle Twitter is an even smaller,

11:33.920 --> 11:39.520
even more unrepresentative sample within a sample. We're talking about less than 0.1 percent of

11:39.520 --> 11:44.880
Americans. And that less than 0.1 percent does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific

11:44.880 --> 11:49.440
tweeters, and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform. Which is why

11:49.440 --> 11:54.400
there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture is produced by a

11:54.400 --> 11:59.600
relatively tiny group of people. So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater

11:59.600 --> 12:05.120
to this retrograde soft conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

12:05.200 --> 12:12.000
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign, and I enraged people's dogs by knocking

12:12.000 --> 12:16.720
on their doors and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls. And I really recommend

12:16.720 --> 12:21.360
that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though it is the worst thing in

12:21.360 --> 12:25.200
the world and I hated it so much. You know, you do have to listen to a lot of,

12:25.200 --> 12:30.240
I don't want Barack Hussein, Obama, redistributing my wealth.

12:30.800 --> 12:35.440
Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping

12:35.440 --> 12:40.320
business, but whatever. Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of what your fellow

12:40.320 --> 12:45.760
Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

12:45.760 --> 12:50.640
you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist.

12:50.640 --> 12:56.160
You know, most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves

12:56.240 --> 13:00.960
and their families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking

13:00.960 --> 13:05.760
points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is on about Antifa

13:05.760 --> 13:10.880
so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

13:10.880 --> 13:16.320
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,

13:16.320 --> 13:23.360
in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa and Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.440
It's Ryan and his transgender furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,

13:31.440 --> 13:36.960
or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.

13:36.960 --> 13:42.160
You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to do that,

13:42.160 --> 13:46.720
because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with them.

13:46.720 --> 13:52.800
You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,

13:52.800 --> 13:57.760
what's Indigenous Peoples Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the

13:57.760 --> 14:02.240
height of praxis? And who probably watch ContraPoints? How embarrassing. You know,

14:02.240 --> 14:06.640
you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.

14:07.280 --> 14:13.600
How very bourgeois. But revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

14:14.560 --> 14:20.320
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the U.S.

14:20.320 --> 14:29.360
government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid.

14:30.800 --> 14:35.360
I mean, I guess I admire the ambition. Just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.120
Are you counting on the U.S. military and police taking the side of the communists,

14:39.120 --> 14:44.560
or is your plan to overpower them? Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,

14:44.560 --> 14:48.960
I don't think that much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.520
So there will have to be a war. You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After

14:53.520 --> 15:00.240
the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923. But you are going to need to

15:00.240 --> 15:04.560
raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?

15:04.560 --> 15:10.560
So how's that going, Talitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?

15:11.520 --> 15:15.360
Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,

15:15.360 --> 15:18.400
when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,

15:18.400 --> 15:22.640
they actually mean it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,

15:22.640 --> 15:28.000
the three percenters, the boogaloo boys, their stockpiling weapons, and training to use them.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.480
They have ex-military men in their ranks, and connections to white supremacists within the

15:32.480 --> 15:36.960
police and the military. Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,

15:37.680 --> 15:43.920
it strikes me as ideation, not intent. You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between

15:43.920 --> 15:48.880
two kinds of suicidal thinking. So there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how

15:48.880 --> 15:53.200
you're going to do it. And then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.920
And then there's ideation, which is, you know, you're not actually going to do it, but you just

15:57.920 --> 16:03.440
have that inner monologue that's constantly saying, I just want to die. There's no more joy

16:03.440 --> 16:08.640
for me left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all. And

16:09.360 --> 16:14.400
then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,

16:15.520 --> 16:22.480
not again, doctor. Not again. So right wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

16:22.480 --> 16:28.320
whereas left wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a

16:28.320 --> 16:35.120
kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics. Well, you can't plan a revolution.

16:35.120 --> 16:41.520
Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice. Yeah, so a riot is the

16:41.520 --> 16:46.960
language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it? What is the point of speaking through a

16:46.960 --> 16:53.520
riot or a protest or a strike? Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the

16:53.520 --> 16:58.720
point not just to speak, but to be heard? Heard by Holmes? Who are you trying to persuade? The

16:58.720 --> 17:04.080
glob glob govicle lab? No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.

17:04.160 --> 17:09.280
So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen. This year, the US has seen one

17:09.280 --> 17:14.480
of the biggest protest movements in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment,

17:14.480 --> 17:19.360
we have a president promising to double down on law and order on military police suppression,

17:19.360 --> 17:24.480
a president who told a room full of cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.

17:24.480 --> 17:29.360
And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown

17:29.360 --> 17:37.520
in. Rough. I said, please don't be too nice. And let's be clear, both Biden and cop Mola have an

17:37.520 --> 17:42.160
ugly record when it comes to crime and policing. For most of his career, Biden has called for more

17:42.160 --> 17:46.320
policing, which is the opposite of what we need right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby John.

17:46.320 --> 17:52.080
But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse about policing and criminal justice. And Biden

17:52.080 --> 17:57.600
has responded by beginning to shift his position. This year's democratic platform includes things

17:57.600 --> 18:02.720
like stricter use of force standards, banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,

18:02.720 --> 18:08.320
creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,

18:08.320 --> 18:13.600
investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough? No, it's not good enough.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.640
But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are at least willing to listen to

18:18.640 --> 18:24.400
protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961, he didn't want to propose a civil rights

18:24.400 --> 18:30.080
bill because that would have been super unpopular with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened

18:30.080 --> 18:35.200
and there were protests and uprisings all over the South in the march on Washington that summer.

18:35.200 --> 18:43.040
And Kennedy listened. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality

18:43.040 --> 18:50.000
that no city or state or legislative body can fruitively choose to ignore them. He was moved

18:50.000 --> 18:56.560
by the protests and he responded by introducing what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what

18:56.560 --> 19:01.920
if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963? What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump

19:01.920 --> 19:08.480
had been president? We might not have gotten a civil rights act. So it does matter who's president.

19:08.480 --> 19:14.960
It actually matters a lot. And please, Tabby-Chan, do not let a fascist win to own the libs.

19:15.760 --> 19:23.120
God damn it. All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state. And yeah,

19:23.120 --> 19:28.000
I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump is going to throw when

19:28.000 --> 19:33.920
an entire nation rejects him. And I'm letting that motivate me. In some states, you can still

19:33.920 --> 19:40.240
register. So register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in person, go to vote.org and

19:40.240 --> 19:46.080
find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there. Make sure your phone's

19:46.080 --> 19:52.400
charged and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends. If you're like me, you need to

19:52.400 --> 19:59.200
set an alarm so you don't forget and then just try not to get inconsolably high until after you've

19:59.200 --> 20:04.240
placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year of hell. And I, for one, think

20:04.240 --> 20:10.080
that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives

20:10.080 --> 20:15.520
this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.640
He is the enemy of the world.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.080
Then,

20:40.080 --> 20:42.080
then,

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
then,

20:44.080 --> 20:46.080
then,

20:46.080 --> 20:48.080
next,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.080
next,

20:50.080 --> 20:52.080
next,

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
next,

20:54.080 --> 20:56.080
next,

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
next,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.080
next,

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
next,

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
next,

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
next,

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
next,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.520
next,

21:10.520 --> 21:12.520
next,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.520
next,

21:14.520 --> 21:16.520
next,

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
next,

21:17.520 --> 21:20.520
next,

21:20.520 --> 21:22.520
next,

21:22.520 --> 21:24.520
now,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.520
now,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
now

21:31.520 --> 21:33.520
now,

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
now,

21:35.520 --> 21:48.520
It does not let you eat the judgment of justice, it does not let you wear whatever the seal of the Lord wants to see.

21:48.520 --> 21:58.520
It does not let you eat the judgment of the Lord.

21:58.520 --> 22:09.520
It shows you all the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:09.520 --> 22:15.520
For I know the thoughts that I think are distressing the Lord.

22:16.520 --> 22:21.520
For I know the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:21.520 --> 22:27.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:27.520 --> 22:34.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:34.520 --> 22:41.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

22:49.520 --> 22:59.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

23:00.520 --> 23:10.520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord as the Lord.

23:11.520 --> 23:29.520
I know the thoughts that I think are the dreams of your school friend, and things you may know better than the part of me today.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.520
Don't worry, I'll stay still.

23:31.520 --> 23:37.520
Till today, I will stop the change, and don't you want to do justice?

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
From the time...
