1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
All right, so what are we looking at?

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,400
What new hell have we sunk to now here in the United States of-

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,360
They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine and you're not really

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,520
fine but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,640
Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter thin blue line punisher

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,480
skull on the hood.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,440
Um, there's a lot to unpack here but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
the skull.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,040
The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,160
The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,640
because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Disappointing.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,520
Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,480
an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Nya.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,840
I did watch a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher and as research for this

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,920
video I did watch all of them and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass his Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,680
in the sewers worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
You know, just like the police do.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,720
Hi, I'm Nyaataly, creator of Catra Points.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
And no, I'm not a cat girl.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm a cat woman.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,160
Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite heterosexual body.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:42,720
I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and...

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,160
As a woman with values.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,600
Just kidding, I'm trash.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's talk about justice, Ulu.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Justice is when I get lots of headpats, nyaaa.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,000
The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family but once

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,200
he gets revenge he can't stop killing because it's the only thing that gives meaning to

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,080
his shitty life so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,320
But no matter how many bad guys he kills it's never enough because new criminals just come

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,280
along and take the place of the old ones.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,040
It's like a cycle where violence gets violence and nothing ever really changes.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,240
It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
and punishment.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
But you know what?

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Let's not overthink this.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Great.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Perfect.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Are we the baddies?

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, anti-phasympathizing, big government

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,600
anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte criticizing the police even though

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,760
I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,280
And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,560
This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,240
There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,020
of the chemical you're addicted to.

52
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,560
They tried to make me get a rehab, I said, meow, meow, meow.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,960
marketplace of ideas gorge.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,200
And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,240
I happen to enjoy headpats.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,280
As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
king or a peasant nave.

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Or a neko-mimi.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Ah, kawaii dates.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,560
This is problematic.

62
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.

63
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,300
This is beyond cringe.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,680
This is cursed children, cursed.

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,880
So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but that just proves the

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,240
point I'm making, so maybe you should hear meow, meow.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,480
on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,000
And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice is taken

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,320
into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,840
All of this raises a lot of questions.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,380
Like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?

73
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
Who should impose these consequences?

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,060
And under what circumstances?

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,460
And for what purpose?

76
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,980
If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place?

77
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh my god, these contacts.

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Ridiculous.

80
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,580
Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice, Socrates?

81
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,820
It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years with no conclusive

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
answers.

83
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,540
I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
were dummies.

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
And I am very smart.

86
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Nyah.

87
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
Ra-ra-raspoutine.

88
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
One.

89
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Revenge.

90
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,720
The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,260
he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.

92
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,500
The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,360
This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,860
in proportion to their crime.

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,780
It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in

96
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,440
our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,180
Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,160
serves an evolutionary function.

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,660
If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas and you don't get revenge, then

100
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,700
other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,340
But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,300
pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,260
it is not profitable to mess with you.

104
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,900
So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,100
And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is

106
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,000
strong and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,640
justice of this kind is served.

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
So of course, there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.

109
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,360
For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served with one and a half

110
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
million subscribers.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,320
I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,640
stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment.

113
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,560
And all this celebrated under the heading police justice.

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,920
In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community

115
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,320
was now with 20% more police brutality.

116
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,920
Um, fun fact?

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
This ain't it, chief.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Period.

119
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Full stop.

120
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
That's the tweet.

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,480
Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping

122
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,280
an eye on these people.

123
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Here's a typical justice served post.

124
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,280
One sets P E D O husband on a fire after catching him R A P E seven year old daughter

125
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,920
titled this man got what he deserved.

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,960
Instant regret.

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Predator exposed.

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,320
To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was going to be wearing

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
cattiers.

130
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,040
like a aging bargain bin Bill Delphine impersonator.

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,240
Well, dress for the job you want.

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,480
I mean, whom's to amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
right?

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Let's look at the comments on that post though.

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
Let's read the room.

137
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
She's a hero in my opinion, should have had it live on television.

138
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,640
Give her a medal.

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Give her two medals.

140
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,600
So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but you know, there's always a couple

141
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,200
buzz kills in there whining as usual about, Oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning

142
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,960
people alive with no due process and no evidence.

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,400
Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,280
But those people get shouted down pretty fast.

145
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,600
They get called pedo simps.

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Pedo simp.

147
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,720
So justice served as a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared

148
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,960
love of extra judicial violence.

149
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,040
But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,480
On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one

151
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,280
commenter says, that's a justice boner for me.

152
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,120
I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me and kick the life out of them.

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Criminal fail.

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
Prank gone wrong.

155
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,160
So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off putting

156
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,560
to some people.

157
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,560
As one disgruntled former justice serve subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos

158
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,760
of assholes getting their comeuppance.

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,520
Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.

160
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
Everything is black and white with them.

161
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,540
If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving them

162
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,840
a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.

163
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Unsubscribed.

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,200
But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their

165
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
comeuppance.

166
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,440
I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,360
There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games, win stupid

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:28,200
prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,160
to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people

170
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,360
getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right wing feel

171
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
to it.

172
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Like to police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes shotgun

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,520
blasts to the balls, Arizona.

174
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Just Arizona.

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
What more is there to say?

176
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Arizona.

177
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Justice served.

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Punished.

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,960
It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're going

180
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,600
to kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this

181
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,920
longing for retribution is distinctively right wing.

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,560
Left wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.

183
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,360
Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.

184
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,520
Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?

185
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Karma.

186
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,480
And she got her husband fired.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,880
Dumb bitch really should have minded her business, love to see it.

188
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,440
She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in

189
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,520
jail for at least six months.

190
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Firing them was not enough.

191
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,680
Life in prison.

192
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,600
Life in prison.

193
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,720
An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,200
power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced

195
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,440
to serve 263 years in prison.

196
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,840
He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.

197
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,680
And of course there's the much savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.

198
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's watch it now.

199
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,680
Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.

200
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,400
It's Pepe's become kind of assembled.

201
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,040
That was informative, but let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people

202
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,640
just enjoyed watching an NAZI get what he deserved.

203
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Justice served.

204
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Punished.

205
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Smashing.

206
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Very happy they found who you will remember to smash subscribe.

207
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,400
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,080
a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.

209
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,160
The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing

210
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,120
the suffering of someone who deserves it.

211
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,760
Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.

212
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,480
The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and

213
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
someone who's hiding bodies in the crawl space.

214
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,040
It puts the lotion on its skin, Mia.

215
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,800
But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.

216
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,280
It's why we love stories about revenge.

217
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:40,640
Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.

218
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,080
Revenge is such a popular plotline because it's easy for people to identify with a

219
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,600
revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles

220
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,680
of violence.

221
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,960
This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey by Homer.

222
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I stole this copy from my high school, and I stole this copy from my college.

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,640
I still just read the sparknotes.

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Well let's read it now.

225
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,480
See, I knew this would be useful someday.

226
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,260
God, he's such a fuckboy.

227
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,320
What does Athena see in this man?

228
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Must be really odd.

229
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay, I'm ready for my book report.

230
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to

231
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,960
the island of Ithaca after, um, okay, so in the prequel, Odysseus' shitty friend Menelaus

232
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,800
throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually

233
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
attracted to.

234
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
How dare she?

235
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,120
So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would

236
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
do and blowing off some steam at femboy's symposium.

237
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,520
Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of

238
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,920
men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.

239
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,960
So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors

240
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,560
as payback, and then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,120
he has them all hanged.

242
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,520
And this one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose

243
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,520
and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.

244
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,960
And reading this, I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?

245
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?

246
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,080
I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kind of kills it for me.

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause

248
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,520
men love hearing about assholes, that's why they watch my channel.

249
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,920
But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.

250
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,440
The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors, and to his, uh, his slaves.

251
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Yikes.

252
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Disappointing.

253
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,080
Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves, it isn't a good look.

254
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,280
Wow, this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.

255
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,600
Oh my god, this contact is fully horizontal.

256
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,440
This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts, fuck this.

257
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,160
It just seems disproportionate, you know?

258
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,200
Like it's not even eye for an eye, because the suitors didn't kill anyone, they were

259
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,640
basically just rude to Odysseus.

260
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,840
But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.

261
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,920
They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it, but

262
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
whatever will play along.

263
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,680
So that was an affront to Odysseus' honor.

264
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,400
And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,840
Because this was a pre-legal society.

266
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,200
No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck 12.

267
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,980
So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people

268
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,340
from stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing

269
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,120
causing them to murder each other.

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,800
Because back then honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage

271
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
of.

272
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,440
If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themself into your house and

273
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,320
drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, cause

274
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
then people will walk all over you.

275
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,920
So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person

276
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,600
who is not to be messed with.

277
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,080
It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.

278
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,840
Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.

279
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,240
It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.

280
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,920
We call it toxic masculinity now, because in our society it's destructive and dysfunctional.

281
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,440
We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.

282
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,960
As society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,520
Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Fenboy's Symposium.

285
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.

286
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,000
But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,800
an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,120
conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.

289
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,360
It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.

290
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,280
And the poison is vengeance, just as served.

291
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,720
So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.

292
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,920
The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first

293
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,960
paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.

294
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,760
I am very smart, meow.

295
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,800
But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.

296
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,600
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,440
If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try

298
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,360
to get revenge by killing you.

299
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
It's a cycle.

300
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,200
A cycle of smashing.

301
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,440
At the end of The Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together

302
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,280
and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.

303
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,040
And literally the last thing that happens in The Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,

304
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,640
who has an inexplicable lady boner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by just making the

305
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,720
families forget that Odysseus killed their children.

306
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence.

307
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,560
But in reality, that doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades

308
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
or even centuries.

309
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,500
In Albania, there's an ancient code called the canon, which requires a family to commit

310
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,580
murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.

311
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,620
Life for life, blood for blood.

312
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,380
This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,

313
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,940
and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of Northern Albania.

314
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,260
There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the

315
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,580
rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,

316
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
they'll be murdered.

317
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,620
Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed

318
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,460
to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.

319
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,340
These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange

320
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
for getting to live as men.

321
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,940
There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,480
recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name Uwu, act as head

323
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,900
of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of

324
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
a man.

325
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,940
Extremely happy trans sounds, Uwu.

326
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,900
I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have

327
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,700
been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to

328
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,300
support trans rights.

329
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,980
No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.

330
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,580
Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender.

331
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Most were compelled to-

332
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
Yeah, I know that, sweaty.

333
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
It was just a joke, okay?

334
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Calm down.

335
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,340
Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,

336
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
religions.

337
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,700
I'm worried if I give a real example, I'll be cancelled for seeming neutral about a conflict

338
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,740
where I'm supposed to take a side.

339
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,180
So, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that the cat girls bomb the dog girls,

340
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,860
and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that cycle repeats for a few decades.

341
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,380
And by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against

342
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,300
each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.

343
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,940
Extremely angry gay sounds, meow.

344
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,900
So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.

345
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,220
It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.

346
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,940
So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos

347
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
caused by vengeance.

348
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,700
And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system.

349
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
2.

350
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Retribution.

351
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,260
The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined this state

352
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,300
as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.

353
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,540
In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long

354
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,060
as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.

355
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,340
But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.

356
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,500
In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law

357
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:03,700
codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as history times.

358
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,940
The code of Hammurabi looked like this.

359
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,500
The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.

360
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,220
I mean, it was like a thousand years ago, so I'm sure they were doing their best.

361
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,620
It's very good, sweetie.

362
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,940
I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.

363
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,580
Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?

364
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,260
Sort of a spinal tap stone henge situation.

365
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,420
The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in

366
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,180
the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.

367
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,900
Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried, sort of.

368
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,500
Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.

369
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
That's content, right?

370
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,580
Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.

371
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,900
Neosqueen.

372
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,580
We don't deserve rights.

373
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,540
So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment is Y.

374
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,420
Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.

375
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,060
That's extremely valid.

376
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,900
If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, you are not

377
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,020
my father or my mother, his tongue shall be caught off.

378
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,380
Well, at least they're standing up for adoptive parents.

379
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,700
If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.

380
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,100
Now we're getting into some of the classics.

381
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,620
If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.

382
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,220
If a freed man strike the body of another freed man, he shall pay ten shekels in money.

383
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,180
But if the slave of a freed man strike the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut

384
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
off.

385
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,860
Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.

386
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,260
So it's like our legal system, except honest.

387
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,520
If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house

388
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,200
which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.

389
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,700
If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.

390
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Love that.

391
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,580
So by modern standards, the code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.

392
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,140
The vibrations are very negative.

393
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,820
It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe

394
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
killer all around.

395
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,060
But you have to credit Hammurabi's code for resolving the problem of honor-driven

396
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,060
revenge cycles.

397
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,340
You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against

398
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,940
their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the

399
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,580
elders of the city who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.

400
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,840
So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante

401
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,460
revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.

402
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,340
Let's list all the differences.

403
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,820
Revenge is personal in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.

404
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,700
It's often emotional, an act of passion.

405
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,180
It can be disproportionate as an Odysseus killing the suitors for his squatting in his

406
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
palace.

407
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
And it's sadistic.

408
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,420
It's satisfying to the avenger.

409
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
Revenge is sweet.

410
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,060
On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal in the sense that the

411
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,100
punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.

412
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,220
It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion and also lacking the

413
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,260
sadism of sweet revenge.

414
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,340
It's also proportionate, again in theory.

415
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,820
You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than

416
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
an eye.

417
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,220
And that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's family

418
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
for an eye.

419
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,780
And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for

420
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
the same crime.

421
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,300
I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about

422
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
it?

423
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Just pay some gold.

424
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
It's fine.

425
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Girl, these contacts, like...

426
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,820
So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which

427
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,060
is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.

428
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,980
Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.

429
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:58,500
However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.

430
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,020
It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.

431
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,780
If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.

432
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,740
In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out

433
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,900
the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of

434
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
way.

435
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,760
Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body

436
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,180
part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the

437
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,500
breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced

438
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
its parents.

439
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,300
There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of

440
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,940
punishment and crime.

441
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,620
For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.

442
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,700
Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down.

443
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,660
Besides, founders were just arrested for extortion.

444
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Here are their mugshots.

445
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,180
There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful

446
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
cosmic harmony.

447
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,060
And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct

448
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,140
that's difficult to get rid of.

449
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,940
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.

450
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,220
The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists,

451
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,980
messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.

452
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,300
One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.

453
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,820
And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called

454
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,660
Jesus of Nazareth.

455
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,060
Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to

456
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,540
the Code of Hammurabi.

457
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,380
Like in the book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches

458
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,460
of Hammurabi classics.

459
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,780
Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.

460
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,780
If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but

461
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,140
there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband

462
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,500
demands in the court allows.

463
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,780
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for

464
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:14,180
tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,

465
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:20,380
head pats for head pats, welcome to Cat Girl Bible Study, new, extremely devotional gay

466
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,620
sound Zulu.

467
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,700
I feel very spiritually aroused right now.

468
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,260
My third eye chakra, dripping.

469
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,860
Macaroni in a pot.

470
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
I need Jesus.

471
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,460
So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.

472
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,660
It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.

473
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,020
But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.

474
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,740
In Matthew 26-52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays

475
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
him.

476
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,300
Jesus says, put your sword back in his place Spartacus, all who draw the sword will die

477
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
by the sword.

478
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,100
Now some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced even

479
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,780
to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism, denying the

480
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,620
right of marginalized people to defend themselves.

481
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Rethink this.

482
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
It gets worse.

483
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,740
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute

484
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
you.

485
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,380
Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.

486
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,180
No loving, smashing, but maybe Jesus wasn't as literal minded as that.

487
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,740
You know, religion is a very subjective thing and I have my own Bible interpretations and

488
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:40,820
my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.

489
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,180
Like consider Matthew 538.

490
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,300
Why is no one talking about Matthew 538?

491
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,980
Jesus says, you've heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,

492
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,020
but I say to you, do not resist an evil doer, but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek,

493
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,780
turn the other also.

494
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,260
Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.

495
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,540
Someone strikes you across the face and you go, ugh, this is not pacifism, this is passive

496
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,300
aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.

497
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:18,500
This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus at

498
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,860
face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing

499
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,620
is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.

500
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:36,060
In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment

501
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,820
and anger the victims of injustice experience.

502
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,700
And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about

503
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,540
serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take

504
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,220
care of that when the day of judgment comes.

505
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,580
It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism there's the idea of karma, which is like

506
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,820
a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.

507
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,460
You reap what you sow, basically, so maybe don't worry about injustice too much because

508
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,140
karma will take care of it.

509
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,620
This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy.

510
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,100
The cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good.

511
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,740
Everything happens for a reason.

512
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,580
If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say there's a

513
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,620
special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.

514
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,700
And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished

515
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,460
by fire demons or whatever.

516
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,940
People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved

517
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,100
injustice.

518
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,300
In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.

519
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,620
Why do bad things happen to good people?

520
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,500
And the answer is just don't worry about it.

521
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
It's part of God's plan.

522
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
It'll all work out in the end.

523
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
It's fine.

524
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Everything's fine.

525
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,180
The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very

526
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,380
not good, in which case you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe

527
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,540
changing some things.

528
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,580
I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not all religion, and obviously many political

529
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,700
activists have been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.

530
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
3.

531
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Utilitarianism

532
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,220
So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as

533
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,340
something other than retaliation.

534
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,020
Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve

535
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,380
society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.

536
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,500
Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes

537
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,100
the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.

538
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,140
So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,

539
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,820
where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.

540
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,620
Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive

541
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,420
for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation

542
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,660
of criminals trying to educate or discipline them so that they can re-interest society.

543
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,220
A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than

544
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,260
retribution, which is very based in emotions.

545
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,020
Also, the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense even if you don't believe in free will.

546
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,140
Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their

547
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,220
actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior and can be deserving of punishment.

548
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,900
Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems… well,

549
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,740
the Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the

550
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,860
sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.

551
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,620
Which seems irrational, right?

552
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,060
To punish a force of nature?

553
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,260
Leave my beautiful white wife alone!

554
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,340
It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our

555
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:06,260
genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus

556
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:12,060
in our natal chart, dry, oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take

557
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,020
all of that into consideration.

558
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,940
You might get a later sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took you

559
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
to Disneyland.

560
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,820
It was a crime of passion.

561
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,060
Through no fault of my own, I was high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion,

562
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
your honor.

563
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,580
A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian.

564
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,140
Like, prisons are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.

565
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,100
But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are

566
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
not doing very much correcting.

567
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,740
In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,

569
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,340
and 76% are re-arrested within five years.

570
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,460
And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.

571
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,260
Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say,

572
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
Good.

573
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,940
I hope he rots in prison.

574
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,100
Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, Good.

575
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,020
The proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him

576
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,300
a contributing member of his community.

577
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,740
So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative

578
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,900
function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.

579
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,660
I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often

580
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,060
offensive to human emotions.

581
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,140
And you can say, effects don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our

582
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:35,860
legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with

583
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,860
you.

584
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,260
But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,

585
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,140
you want to set him on fire, and this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion

586
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,780
affects law enforcement too.

587
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,740
A YouTuber called Jose has a video called, Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,

588
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,900
which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher because they relate to

589
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,940
his military background while fantasizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism.

590
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,060
Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like,

591
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Castle doesn't see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system

592
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,660
is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder victims of crime

593
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,900
from getting the justice they deserve.

594
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,980
Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam's razor for the military.

595
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,180
Don't worry about uniforms, inspections, or restrictive rules of engagement.

596
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,780
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.

597
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,180
Any true warrior, that's the dream.

598
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,780
So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions

599
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,220
that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.

600
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,500
You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren't for all these pesky laws.

601
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,300
There's a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview.

602
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,100
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.

603
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,940
Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good guy with a gun

604
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,180
to stop a bad guy with a gun.

605
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,300
These only eight-year-old boys playing cops and robbers.

606
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,620
Good guys and bad guys.

607
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,220
Pia pia pia pia pia pia pia pia.

608
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,860
That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.

609
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,660
And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.

610
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,660
People love justice served and instant karma videos for a reason.

611
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,740
We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution.

612
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,260
But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don't allow for that.

613
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,820
There's all these tedious roadblocks, right to an attorney, right to remain silent,

614
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,700
right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.

615
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,580
A lot of police wish they could simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner.

616
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,700
But the function of police is supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating

617
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,100
criminal investigations.

618
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,380
They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing freeform retribution

619
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,420
in the streets at will, justice served, now with 20% more police brutality.

620
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,660
But a lot of people defend the police when they behave like this, because the thin-wristed

621
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,660
civilians are just as emotionally frustrated by due process as the cops.

622
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,420
Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?

623
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
I'm double-cancelled.

624
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,140
Well, look, all lives are bastards, but only some bastards are armed by the state and

625
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,580
licensed to go bastarding around town.

626
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,500
The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.

627
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,060
I also think there's a secular version of the just world fallacy going on here.

628
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,540
People like to think that if the police kills somebody, it must be because that person did

629
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,940
something wrong.

630
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,340
Karma at work, justice served.

631
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,860
Victim blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.

632
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,860
You get what you deserve, so if something bad happens to you, you must have been asking

633
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
for it.

634
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,660
And obviously, racism is a huge part of this, you know, there's structural white supremacy

635
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,140
that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities, and people

636
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,140
are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as criminal thugs and therefore

637
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,100
deserving of police violence.

638
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,260
So we get this no-angel discourse that comes up every time a black person is murdered by

639
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,380
the police, where they bring up the victim's criminal record or picture of them looking

640
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,540
like a scary thug.

641
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,980
As if that proves they deserve to die.

642
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,060
The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel.

643
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,340
There are no angels walking this earth.

644
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
We're all flawed.

645
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,740
We've all made mistakes.

646
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,140
We've all done bad things.

647
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,940
That doesn't mean we deserve to die a violent death.

648
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,660
And then there's people like Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know

649
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,060
were about as close to angels as humans come, but that didn't protect them.

650
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,740
So that is 100% beside the point, because black people in America should not literally

651
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,540
have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be murdered by the

652
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
police.

653
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,260
In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low-life, drug-addicted petty

654
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,980
criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be executed by

655
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,900
the cops because that's what it's supposed to mean to live in a free country.

656
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,540
So things need to change.

657
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,140
The Punisher Police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice system with

658
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
them.

00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,460
We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice, and to be honest, that might take

660
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
more than one YouTube video.

661
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:10,620
I know at the beginning I said I was going to explain what justice is, but, um...

662
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
I lied.

663
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,900
I'm sorry that I can't fix America.

664
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,580
I'm just a lonely cat.

665
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,020
I guess the only solution is revolution.

666
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,420
And by revolution, I do mean to vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into actually

667
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,060
doing something.

668
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:33,060
And if they don't listen, well, hang on, let me get this.

669
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Mosho Moshi!

670
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Hey, how are you, taste?

671
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:10,060
How are you?

672
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:40,060
How are you?

673
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:10,060
How are you?

674
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:40,060
How are you?

675
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:10,060
How are you?

676
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:40,060
How are you?

677
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:10,060
How are you?
