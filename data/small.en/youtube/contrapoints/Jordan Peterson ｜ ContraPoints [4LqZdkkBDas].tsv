0	9280	My lords, ladies, and theirs that lieth betweeks, Tis evident nor sensation nor the passions
9280	15160	possess dominion over the mind of man, which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of
15160	21560	all faculties.
21560	27320	It must needs be remarked that the power of the commonwealth deriveth not from the despotical
27320	33840	acquisitions of conquerors, but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth
33840	34840	the lobster.
34840	39240	Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?
39240	43960	Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.
43960	48280	Monsieur Ting, I'm not going to kiss your hand, you freak, I'm more of a woman than
48280	49280	you are.
49280	51640	It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.
51640	53400	Clock me, Amadeus.
53400	54400	Don't break the fourth wall.
54400	56920	I'm trying to make a video about post-modernism.
56920	60120	Get out of my drawing room, 18th century sexual deviance.
60120	62920	So much for the tolerant Jacobins.
62920	74920	Reason, power, truth, these are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.
74920	78920	Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.
78920	81480	So who's Jordan Peterson?
81480	82480	Wow.
82480	89240	He's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, who got famous for sounding the
89240	94040	alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely
94040	95560	lead to Stalinism.
95560	98600	Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.
98600	102760	David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the western world, and
102760	106800	his self-help book, 12 Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.
106800	109880	I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.
109880	114640	He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here because I want to
114640	115640	talk.
115640	119440	A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven't really engaged with his ideas very
119440	120440	much.
120440	125080	He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview where
125080	129720	Kathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.
129720	133760	So you were saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they
133760	134760	deserve.
134760	135960	No, I'm saying that that's one component.
135960	139440	You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?
140000	141000	That's murderous.
141000	142000	You're just saying things though to provoke, aren't you?
142000	143000	I mean, you are a provocateur.
143000	144000	I never say anything.
144000	146200	You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.
146200	151040	You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.
151040	155040	I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are, like, afraid of his
155040	156040	actual ideas.
156040	157880	But I'm not afraid of his ideas.
157880	159120	I'm not afraid of anything.
159120	161440	I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.
167440	168440	Daddy.
168440	172520	I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts
172520	177280	and reading his books, and honestly, I think I get why people like him.
177280	181520	Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.
181520	186880	His book, 12 Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly
186880	190240	Effective People or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.
190240	195000	The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like, take responsibility
195000	199920	for yourself, don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings
199920	204720	of psychology, philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.
204720	206800	He's telling us a pretty classic story.
206800	210720	Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering, so you need
210720	212520	a higher purpose in your life.
212520	213520	But I knew that already.
213520	216600	I learned it at the AA meetings I refuse to go to.
216600	221160	These are, like, basic insights of world philosophy and religion, but they're insights that today's
221160	226520	youths apparently haven't heard before, I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.
226520	230240	Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with, so to a
230240	233440	lot of people, Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent.
233440	236320	And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.
236320	240360	Most of Peterson's fans are young men, and, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards
240360	244280	into shape, and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.
244280	248720	I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy, and sometimes girls do too.
249720	254200	But, there's a big problem here, and the problem is that all of this life coaching
254200	258520	is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.
258520	262880	Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life, but
262880	267920	as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.
267920	273080	There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?
273080	274200	Why not?
274200	278400	The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.
278400	282160	Now Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics because that doesn't sound scary
282160	283160	enough.
283160	288720	His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.
288720	294640	Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism with cultural Marxism, the Nazi
294640	298600	conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.
298600	301440	Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?
301440	302440	Right?
302440	306760	So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist, and you may quote me
306760	312000	on that, but I am wondering if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals
312000	316080	plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?
316080	319440	Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.
319440	324880	So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson, Professor, Daddy, let's talk.
324880	329320	And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect
329320	330560	I think it deserves.
337760	342760	Mmm, that's good, that's good temperature.
342760	345760	Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?
345760	347760	Thanks, Daddy.
347760	352760	It's really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your stature.
352760	358640	You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things
358640	359640	I like about you.
359640	364200	The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the left, the stifling of even
364200	369560	slightly different opinions, the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments, the
369560	375320	politics of resentment, are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.
375320	379880	I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person, oh god
379880	382240	the dysphoria, please don't watch it.
382240	386200	But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very
386200	391120	localized problem, and I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could
391120	393080	be hurt by that backlash.
393080	397680	Like fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists, but
397680	403880	if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights, that would
403880	405480	be bad, right?
407480	410240	I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.
410240	416200	I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom, but clearly, the sheep need
416200	418840	a shepherd, and you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.
418840	421680	You know, on the left, we don't really tell people what to do.
421680	422960	We tell them what not to do.
422960	424480	Don't exploit the workers.
424480	425960	Do not do blackface.
425960	429800	I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people, but that's a pretty small
429800	434800	rule compared to some of your rules, like how to raise your children, or when it's
434800	436560	okay to criticize things.
438160	440680	The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.
440680	445480	I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons were talking about Plato and
445480	451160	Aristotle and the meaning of life, and I thought, huh, on the left, we don't really talk about
451160	452440	that kind of thing.
452440	457160	What we talk about is how society oppresses people, and that might not be enough, because
457160	459200	people need to have a positive purpose in life.
459200	461680	I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.
461680	465400	I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons of Strangers with Candy
465400	466400	until I die.
466400	472640	But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus, other white guys who talk about lobsters,
472640	477800	they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering and, like, not just complain
477800	478800	about patriarchy.
478880	482440	I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy when patriarchy isn't the thing
482440	486560	that's making you suffer, but I do think that an education that only teaches people about
486560	488160	oppression is inadequate.
488160	493200	We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad, and then we say, well,
493200	497440	you're educated now, good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!
497440	499480	And that really kind of sucks.
499480	504400	But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made without comparing transgender
504400	506000	activism to Stalin.
507000	511040	I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.
511040	514240	See, this is when you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.
514240	517880	If you don't establish dominance, I'm just going to mouth off.
517880	522160	They use all this compassion language, and I'm on the side of the oppressed, all of
522160	523840	that posturing.
523840	527320	It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.
527320	531400	And I've just been starting to review their curriculum for children from kindergarten
531400	532400	to grade 8.
532400	538920	This pure social justice, postmodernism, the people who hold this doctrine, this radical
538920	544480	postmodern communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender
544480	552440	identity or some kind of group identity paramount, they've got control over the most low to mid-level
552440	557680	bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well, but even in the United States where
557680	558680	you know, there's a lot of...
562400	590840	So you've got to give it to JP.
590840	594680	When he says stand up straight with your shoulders back, he means it.
594680	599280	So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences with fairly popular
599280	600520	opinions.
600520	602920	Political correctness often feels stifling.
602920	606240	Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.
606240	609760	Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use, and I don't like it.
609760	614820	But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes, he leads you to a pretty weird place.
614820	619880	His central political message is that leftist professors, student activists, campus diversity
619880	624560	initiatives, and corporate HR departments are collectively following the philosophy
624560	630840	of postmodern neo-Marxism to destroy Western civilization and sink us all into a totalitarian
630840	631840	nightmare.
631840	636080	Now there's just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar to the cultural
636080	641400	Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory, but I'm just gonna ignore that because if I dwell
641400	645920	on it, I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist and then everyone will think
645920	646920	I'm crazy.
646960	651360	Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists, I don't like to hide.
651360	656160	So let's just try not to think about that and instead, straightforwardly ask, is it
656160	659800	true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all?
659800	663360	Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?
663360	667600	We all know what Marxism is, the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle
667600	671520	between workers and capitalists and that the workers will eventually revolt.
671520	675940	Some college professors definitely do believe that, but zero percent of corporate HR departments
676020	679420	do, so that, okay.
679420	680980	So what is postmodernism?
680980	684140	Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.
684140	687860	Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern and
687860	690340	then trying to guess what they have in common.
690340	693940	That's basically what the YouTuber ArmouredSkeptic did in his video about it.
693940	695460	So many daddies in this video.
695460	699940	We should invite them all to a barbecue, complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.
699940	701660	I've had worse evenings.
701660	705540	I don't think there really is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern.
705540	709700	Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945 that seemed to me at the time.
709700	714980	But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism, he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.
714980	717260	He's talking about postmodern philosophy.
717260	718260	So what's that?
718260	721540	Well, basically it's a kind of skepticism.
721540	726780	Not YouTube skepticism, but actual skepticism, you know, like having doubts about whether
726780	729020	humans can really know things about the world.
729020	733780	Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea, that goes way back to ancient times.
734100	738660	But more specifically, postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
738660	739860	So what's modernism?
739860	740660	What's what?
740660	741460	What are words?
741460	742340	What's anything?
742340	745700	I'm going to divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.
745700	747220	First, there's early modernism.
747220	751780	Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens
751780	754660	which says that we can form universal theories about the world
754660	758100	through observation and reasoning aka the scientific method.
758100	762260	Now that turns out to work pretty well for whatever questions you have about plants
762260	766100	and crystals and how to medically reconfigure human genitals.
766100	769540	But it has some limits, which was pointed out by David Hume,
769540	773460	one of the least boring 18th century queens and one of the only philosophers
773460	778900	I can actually put up with in small doses even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.
778900	780020	This is a call out.
780020	783060	Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,
783060	788100	you can't really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self
788100	790820	because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.
790820	793460	Anyway, then the late modernists came along and they said,
793460	796420	fuck Hume, we're going to do science about those things anyway.
796420	799940	So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards
799940	804580	who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.
804580	807140	So for example, you have psychoanalysis,
807140	811060	which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives,
811060	812820	which is of course ridiculous.
812820	814820	I'm conscious of all my drives.
814820	818500	And you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.
818500	820820	You got early sociology and anthropology,
820820	823460	which started out with racist social evolutionism
823460	826900	and progressed to a kind of we're all the same universalism.
826900	829540	Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.
829540	831540	His first book, Maps of Meaning,
831540	836260	is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world and create order out of chaos
836260	838500	through universal myths and archetypes,
838500	841940	which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.
841940	843860	Boy, this is a lot of explaining.
843860	846820	It's so much explaining, it's triggering gender dysphoria.
846820	848260	I better put on some longer nails.
849380	850180	Nails?
850180	851940	Is that all womanhood means to you?
855300	858260	Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
858260	862340	So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories about reality,
862340	863860	history, and humanity,
863860	867780	postmodernists say, actually, no, that's not possible.
867780	869700	For example, the French postmodernist,
869700	870980	Michel Foucault.
870980	871700	Sargon?
872660	874100	You little gooths?
874100	875140	Michel Foucault.
875140	879860	wrote intellectual histories of subjects like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,
879860	884020	in which he argued that we should not understand these histories as straightforward progressions
884020	886100	toward liberty and scientific truth,
886100	891700	but rather as mere shifts in the way that power orders our institutions and populations.
891700	894820	The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.
894820	896020	Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.
896020	898260	If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.
898260	901620	Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,
901620	906580	irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness
906580	912500	that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world is not the final or best vocabulary.
912500	913940	All right, that's enough explaining.
913940	915060	And my nails are done.
915060	915940	Check it out.
915940	918420	Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails?
918420	923220	But do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them with barely concealed visceral rage?
923220	924980	Well, I have a solution for you.
924980	926660	The bisexual manicure.
926660	928740	One hand for the V, one hand for the D.
929300	930980	Both for degeneracy.
931060	932740	It's absolutely filthy.
932740	934900	So we've got all the pieces on the table.
934900	936900	Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.
936900	938900	On the one hand, we have Marxism,
938900	944020	a fundamentally modernist worldview that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.
944020	946260	On the other hand, we have postmodernism,
946260	951380	a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity to know any universal truth is about anything.
951380	954900	On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.
954900	957700	And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,
957700	960820	with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault
960820	964180	the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.
964180	968740	And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died, capitalism did end forever.
973060	976580	So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?
976580	980660	Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists were in some way influenced by Marxism,
980660	983220	so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.
983220	984900	But that's not what Peterson means.
984900	986500	It's clear from the way he uses the term
986580	990420	that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical than it initially appears.
990420	995540	Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to include not only postmodern intellectuals
995540	998740	and Marxist intellectuals, but also liberal politicians,
998740	1003300	academic administrators, and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,
1003300	1009140	and so-called identity politics activists, including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.
1009140	1011620	Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.
1011620	1015860	Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally at odds,
1015860	1020500	since Marxism is a big story about a struggle between two clear and distinct groups,
1020500	1024500	and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,
1024500	1028020	and about the stability of binaries like bourgeoisie and proletariat.
1028020	1033220	But that's not the only tension in Peterson's clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.
1033220	1036100	Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows
1036100	1040580	that Marxists and identity politics activists are constantly at each other's throats,
1040580	1043780	because the Marxists accuse the activists of being bourgeois dogs
1043780	1048660	who want more female CEOs of color and more disabled transgender drone pilots,
1048660	1052660	while the activists accuse the Marxists of being a boys' club of brochelists,
1052660	1056580	no more woke on gender and race issues than the average Jordan Peterson fan.
1056580	1062020	Most often, these accusations are correct, because everyone is problematic and I disown them all.
1062020	1066740	And then there's also the conflict between the identity politics activists and the postmodernists.
1066740	1069940	Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?
1070020	1071860	There's nothing postmodern about it.
1071860	1076660	Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice for particular groups,
1076660	1080180	such as women, people of color, and gay and trans people.
1080180	1084340	This kind of activism presupposes that these group categories exist
1084340	1087060	and are a useful basis for political organizing.
1087060	1089460	Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.
1089460	1093620	They want to show that these categories, race, gender, sexual orientation,
1093620	1098100	are contingent social constructs and are themselves potentially oppressive.
1098100	1102580	This is why conventional feminist activists often hate postmodern feminism.
1102580	1106260	Because the postmodern feminists want to show that the whole concept of womanhood,
1106260	1109460	for instance, is contingent and potentially oppressive,
1109460	1112500	and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it.
1112500	1114820	And then the conventional feminist activists say,
1114820	1119540	the fuck, we need the concept of womanhood to organize around women's political interests.
1119540	1123780	How are we supposed to do that if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?
1123780	1126260	And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,
1126260	1131140	well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler, the most famous postmodern feminist ever.
1131140	1136020	Is it not a sign of despair over public politics when identity becomes its own policy,
1136020	1139220	bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?
1139220	1142500	And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility,
1142500	1146500	but rather to make use of a category that can be called into question,
1146500	1148980	made to account for what it excludes.
1148980	1151460	If you take the first part of that quote out of context,
1151460	1154100	it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said.
1154100	1159220	The difference is that JP actually does think we should return to silence and invisibility.
1159220	1160180	Or does he?
1160180	1162020	It's hard to tell what he thinks.
1162020	1163220	More on that in a moment.
1163220	1165540	I bring all of this up to show that one,
1165540	1171860	the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,
1171860	1176980	and two, identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned.
1176980	1181060	There are sophisticated debates about this going on within leftist academia,
1181140	1184500	but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that or doesn't care.
1184500	1189700	He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to characterize the left as a unified philosophical
1189700	1195060	force bent on destroying Western civilization when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons
1195060	1198580	who can't stop squabbling with each other over every goddamn little issue.
1198580	1203460	The only reason I can think of that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force
1203460	1208260	is if you're so far to the right that literally everyone who supports the economic and social
1208260	1212260	advancement of disadvantaged groups looks like one homogenous enemy.
1212260	1214260	But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?
1214260	1218740	That he opposes all social progress for women, racial, and sexual minorities?
1218740	1223380	Well it's difficult to say, because while he spends much of his time comparing activists
1223380	1228340	for these movements to 20th century mass murderers, he resists being pinned down to
1228340	1230020	any more specific position.
1230020	1232580	I was maybe too harsh on Kathy Newman earlier.
1232580	1235940	She came out of the interview looking bad, but she had a tough job to do.
1235940	1239700	Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves saying something that's more or less
1239700	1244500	uncontroversially true, while at the same time implying something controversial.
1244500	1248740	For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like there are biological differences
1248740	1251300	between men and women, which is obviously true.
1251300	1255140	But he'll say it in the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation
1255140	1259300	of women in government, which implies… what exactly?
1259300	1260820	So how do you respond to this?
1260820	1265140	Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement,
1265140	1269620	or you have to guess at what he's implying in response to which he can accuse you of
1269620	1273940	misrepresenting him, which is exactly what happened with the Kathy Newman interview.
1273940	1278420	The most famous moment where Peterson does this is the notorious lobster argument.
1278420	1279620	So he starts by saying,
1279620	1285620	There's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct
1285620	1287220	of the Western patriarchy.
1287220	1290340	And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,
1290340	1294020	and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,
1294020	1296900	so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.
1296900	1301940	You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters?
1301940	1305700	I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals
1305700	1308340	and human beings organize their structures.
1308340	1311700	The problem with that is that no one has ever said
1311700	1315700	that every hierarchy is the product of Western patriarchy.
1315700	1320020	This is such a massive straw man that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation
1320020	1323140	of Peterson suggested by Kathy Newman in this interview.
1323140	1327220	No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.
1327220	1330900	Even the anarchists whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies
1330900	1334500	limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.
1334500	1337060	No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.
1337060	1342820	The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics within our own society,
1342820	1345700	to which the lobster case is a complete non-sequitur.
1345700	1349540	I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument the same way he uses it
1349540	1352660	to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,
1352660	1354180	no matter how unjust.
1354180	1358100	You could be an 18th century Republican arguing against the monarchy,
1358100	1360260	and the monarch could turn around and say,
1360260	1362500	well, hierarchies are inevitable.
1362500	1363940	God save the lobster queen.
1365940	1367060	Oh dear God.
1367780	1371940	My lords, ladies, and those of life betweeks,
1371940	1375780	present rumors of Republican rumblings amongst the rabble
1375780	1378900	have compelled us to summon you together.
1378900	1383540	Let us remind you that nature has so made the lobster
1383540	1387060	that some individuals be stronger than the others.
1387060	1395060	Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty be anywise impugned.
1395060	1401460	And as for parliamentarians, well, let them vote for cake.
1404180	1404980	Very good.
1404980	1405540	Thank you.
1409140	1410740	I need new roommates.
1410740	1414180	So I've argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept
1414180	1417220	of postmodern neo-Marxism as the supervillain
1417220	1420020	in a childishly simple worldview he's promoting
1420020	1423140	where these evil leftists are out to destroy the West.
1423140	1425860	Now it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.
1425860	1428340	What, exactly, is the West?
1428340	1431140	Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West
1431140	1432980	that describes the intellectual tradition
1432980	1436740	that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.
1436740	1441060	Now a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West
1441060	1445300	and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist
1445300	1448420	and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing.
1448420	1450180	But we don't have time for that right now.
1450180	1452420	So I'm just going to grant that the West is a thing
1452420	1454660	and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.
1454660	1457860	For Peterson, the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism,
1457860	1461940	individualism, the idea that each human has a spark of divinity
1462020	1465220	and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,
1465220	1469700	a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectual historians.
1469700	1474100	Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism,
1474100	1479140	which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.
1479140	1483220	This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism
1483220	1486580	and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering.
1486580	1488820	Marxism is Western philosophy.
1488820	1491140	Postmodernism is Western philosophy.
1491140	1494340	If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries
1494340	1498660	of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.
1498660	1504020	Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western.
1504020	1508900	The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs
1508900	1512820	is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty
1512820	1515300	over collective dogma should be on board with.
1515300	1519220	You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy
1519300	1522660	with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.
1522660	1527060	I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition,
1527060	1530100	but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.
1530100	1533780	If you did read it, you'd find a surprising diversity of thought
1533780	1536900	that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.
1536900	1542020	Much of Plato's political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,
1542020	1545780	suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity,
1545780	1550180	it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.
1550180	1555300	Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher, David Hume, famously said that reason is,
1555300	1560660	and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, literally feels over reals.
1560660	1566420	And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade, was advocating the abolition of morality,
1566420	1571620	filling the churches with scat porn, and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion
1571620	1575940	so decadent and depraved, I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.
1575940	1579140	This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,
1579140	1584660	and it's just as much a part of the West as Peterson's soggy Bible-patting conservatism.
1584660	1590100	But again, and I really can't stress this enough, I don't care either way.
1590100	1594420	I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.
1594420	1596260	So what do you people want from me?
1596260	1597780	The lobster queen is dead.
1597780	1598740	Long live the queen.
1601620	1630100	I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the queen.
1630100	1658580	I'll save the lobster queen.
1659220	1662180	And I think you would agree that there's just a foundational erosion that,
1662820	1666340	I think people of all sides, and I think there's totally intellectually smart people
1666340	1667540	on the far left that can help.
1669300	1670100	Where are those people?
1670100	1676020	There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in, that I watch,
1676020	1679140	and I don't mean to misgender her because I think she identifies with her,
1679860	1682020	ContraPoints, I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber,
1682020	1683060	who's on the far left.
1683060	1684260	I've seen the name come up every now and again.
1684980	1687300	Totally disagree with everything this person says.
1687380	1690500	When I look at it, I'm like, this seems very reasonable, educated, academic.
1691220	1695220	And I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone's in love.
1696660	1698900	Hello, Dave.
