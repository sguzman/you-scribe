0	20460	Hello, boys!
20460	24460	I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what
24460	25460	that means.
25460	30060	I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom
30060	33900	to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.
33900	40260	Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant
40260	45660	paladin of the Fourth Reich, but to this priestess of Blasphemes, he'll always be the Golden
45660	46660	One.
46660	54620	A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.
54620	59940	Oh my god, look at his butt.
59940	61540	Oh my god.
61540	63820	Daddy, can I have some meat?
63820	66220	Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
66220	68220	Oh, daddy.
68220	71700	You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.
71700	76420	I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chased since I started my transition.
76500	79220	So, in a sense, I'm a virgin.
79220	82660	And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about
82660	84660	a little thing called purity.
84660	89020	So now that my decade of gender-dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming
89020	92820	to a close, I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.
92820	97460	But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water
97460	99340	and pure absinthe.
99340	100340	It's time.
100340	101340	I'm ready.
101340	102340	I'm ready.
102340	103340	I'm ready.
103340	104340	I'm ready.
104340	105340	I'm ready.
105340	106340	I'm ready.
106340	107340	I'm ready.
107340	108340	I'm ready.
108340	109340	I'm ready.
109340	110340	I'm ready.
110340	111340	I'm ready.
111340	112340	I'm ready.
112340	113340	I'm ready.
113340	114340	I'm ready.
114340	115340	I'm ready.
115340	116340	I'm ready.
116340	117340	I'm ready.
117340	118340	I'm ready.
118340	119340	I'm ready.
119340	120340	I'm ready.
120340	121340	I'm ready.
121340	122340	I'm ready.
122340	123340	I'm ready.
123340	124340	I'm ready.
124340	125340	I'm ready.
125340	126340	I'm ready.
126340	127340	I'm ready.
127340	128340	I'm ready.
128340	129340	I'm ready.
130060	131860	I'm ready.
132660	133660	What?
133660	135740	Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?
135740	136740	It is, isn't it?
136740	137740	Wellâ€¦
137740	139260	They're shiny and I want them.
139260	141340	It's not my fault black people have good ideas.
141340	142760	What am I supposed to do.
142760	143840	Not steal them?
146220	147260	I'll pop it out.
147260	149600	Alright thou resplendent champion of the north.
149600	151300	Hit me with your finest wisdom.
151300	157560	I'm going to take some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.
157560	160920	There's always a nice thing to do.
160920	163520	Well, at least we agree on something.
163520	165080	Aha!
165080	168800	Autogynophilic narcissist exposed.
168800	170960	Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms
170960	172080	like your whole thing?
172080	176000	Misogynistic mental illness confirmed.
176000	178400	Abigail, what is your damage?
178400	179560	Are you okay?
179560	180600	How's your mom doing?
180600	182000	Is everything all right?
182000	197720	You want to get in the tub?
197720	198720	Yeah.
198720	204960	So you're a lost baby girl, and you're a game sweet prince.
204960	208320	He has an Instagram, and it is delectable.
208320	210480	Meets back on the menu, boys.
210480	213840	He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.
213840	215800	What ho, you jaunty lads.
215800	217160	My captain.
217160	218160	My king.
218160	219160	Yes!
219160	227760	If the golden one didn't exist, I would have to invent him.
227760	228760	I need him.
228760	230600	And maybe you need me too, Lars.
230600	234720	I'm the moon to your sun, the, uh, the broom hilda to your Siegfried.
234720	238160	As you become more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky femme.
238160	242640	But you know, I'm noticing that even though you're straight, you don't seem super interested
242640	245280	in the bodies of the women in your life.
245280	250000	And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like
250000	251000	me.
251000	252480	I'm not like the other girls.
252480	254800	I've got the T's and the D's.
254800	256920	On second thought, leave Kranz women alone.
256920	259000	I don't want that blood on my hands.
259000	262120	Well, this is no longer a relaxing bath.
262120	265600	And that's why we never bathe with fascists.
295600	299600	I blocked my T, I popped my E, let's talk about degeneracy.
299600	302760	What are people talking about when they call something or someone degenerate?
302760	306840	Well, let's take a look at some examples from my YouTube comments section and see if
306840	309320	we can figure it out from context.
309320	310840	Transgender communist degenerate.
310840	313560	Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak.
313560	314880	Degen tranny, lal.
314880	317600	Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens.
317600	320840	Or at least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses.
320840	322180	Well, what's up with that?
322180	323500	This is degeneracy.
323500	325520	You ought to be slung from a tree.
325520	326880	He likes to rhyme.
326880	331200	You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.
331200	332200	The end.
332200	334960	Aww, these people are trying so hard to upset me.
334960	337800	They've only got one card in the deck though, alas.
337800	342840	Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,
342840	347360	like a burly Nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired
347360	348960	with a loathing of queerness.
348960	351080	Now it's not always just about queerness.
351080	355640	In fact, fascists and social conservatives use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term
355640	361360	to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists, people with disabilities, basically
361360	363620	anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.
363620	365920	But where does the word degeneracy come from?
365920	368960	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
368960	376920	The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix d, which means away from, and the Latin word
376920	379320	genus, which means race or kind.
379320	383980	So to be degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already
383980	386800	sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.
386800	391960	The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian
391960	396520	protoevolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing
396520	401880	colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,
401880	406240	the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.
406240	410320	Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?
410320	412040	The exact same dingbats, yes.
412040	417160	And one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artur de Gabenau, one of the intellectual
417160	418960	grandfathers of Nazism.
418960	423360	Gabenau wrote a book called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed
423360	427720	the idea of the Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos,
427720	431440	and gave the word degenerate its modern fashy definition.
431440	432440	M'lord?
433240	438680	The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same
438680	444880	intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,
444880	450200	continual adulterations have gradually affected the quality of the blood.
450200	456400	In fact, the man of a decadent time, the degenerate man, a properly so-called, is a different
456400	461120	being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages.
461120	466000	I think I am right in concluding that the human race, in all its branches, has a secret
466000	469360	repulsion from the crossing of blood.
470360	475720	Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept
475720	478360	closely related to degeneracy.
478360	483200	Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies a fall from a previous
483200	484200	date of grace.
484200	488560	By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence were everywhere in the European cultural
488560	489560	imagination.
489720	493520	During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning
493520	498320	Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally
498320	499320	means free thought.
499320	502520	That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.
507400	512040	Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,
512040	515240	accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy.
515240	518760	And around the same time, a bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word
518760	521400	decadence as the title of their movement.
521400	525920	Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence, it was 4chan writ large.
525920	530520	So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then?
530520	531520	Not at all.
531520	535680	The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive goes
535680	540160	back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to
540160	543480	speculation about what causes civilizations to decline.
543480	548120	And one of the hypotheses was that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence
548120	552160	left the Romans vulnerable to butch visigoths and vandals.
552160	553600	Is there any truth to that?
553600	557520	No, it's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives.
557520	563160	The decadent emperors Nero, Caligula, and Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries.
563160	566440	The empire didn't collapse until the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least
566440	570040	two hundred years between the decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was
570040	571040	thoroughly Christian.
571040	576080	And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.
576080	578040	Well, hail Caligula.
578040	582380	But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient civilizations collapsing
582380	583880	because of the queers.
583880	588800	Here's feminist Camille Paglia on how the transgenders destroy civilizations.
588800	596960	The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting
596960	597960	to unravel.
597960	601960	Hang on a second, I'm gonna need to shift up a gear for this.
602200	608200	Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.
608200	609200	You can see it happening.
609200	617200	All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome, nude young men
617200	621760	athletes that used to be very robust in the arcade period suddenly began to seem like
621760	623760	wet noodles toward the end.
623760	629760	People who live in such times, they feel that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan.
629760	633760	And homosexuality, heterosexuality, somewhat anything goes, and so on.
633760	639760	But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer
639760	640760	believes in itself.
640760	649760	And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity
649760	654760	on the edges, whether they're the vandals or the huns, or whether they're the barbarians
654760	655760	of ISIS.
655760	660760	You see them, you know, starting to mass on the outside of the culture.
660760	661760	And that's what we have right now.
661760	667760	There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the
667760	673760	transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there, okay?
673760	676760	And so, I mean, that's why I'm concerned.
676760	678760	I feel it's ominous.
678760	687760	I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.
687760	690760	Riley J. Dennis.
690760	693760	Why did you destroy ancient Rome?
698760	702760	So the idea is that our infatuation with a feminine decadence means we're going to be
702760	703760	destroyed by real men.
703760	705760	You know, like ISIS.
705760	707760	This doesn't deserve a response.
707760	708760	We're moving on.
708760	711760	Where does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?
711760	712760	Oh god.
712760	715760	Do we really have to do this?
715760	719760	So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich...
719760	721760	Who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.
721760	725760	Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.
725760	728760	Dionysian in the street, in the...
728760	730760	Shhhh.
730760	731760	Go to sleep.
731760	735760	Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,
735760	739760	is decadent in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,
739760	742760	we have all these hang-ups about guilt and sin in the afterlife.
742760	746760	And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick
746760	751760	and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.
751760	755760	In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.
755760	759760	There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea
759760	764760	of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.
764760	770760	And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like, fucking Christian morality, man,
770760	774760	and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party,
774760	777760	especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.
782760	787760	What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,
787760	792760	European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.
792760	799760	Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of national socialism.
799760	806760	Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.
806760	813760	Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.
813760	818760	And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.
818760	823760	So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from foppington to fascism.
823760	825760	Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.
825760	832760	One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.
832760	836760	Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.
836760	840760	And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,
840760	849760	including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married,
849760	858760	not having kids, having kids that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using birth control, having abortions.
870760	875760	Cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.
875760	879760	Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?
879760	882760	Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.
885760	892760	There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be responsible and I hate it.
892760	898760	So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about driving, okay?
898760	901760	Drink lots of water and pace yourself.
901760	905760	There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.
905760	913760	Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.
913760	918760	So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.
920760	924760	I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good, where were we?
925760	942760	Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms, antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things.
942760	958760	Hi there, I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.
959760	976760	What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax, and I am just going to slowly start to drip in hot candle wax.
977760	991760	So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.
991760	994760	And individual fascists differ on what those things are.
994760	999760	Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people can't raise children.
1000760	1010760	Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.
1010760	1014760	And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.
1014760	1020760	So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.
1020760	1027760	Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century the social conservative position is not very cool.
1027760	1034760	So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.
1034760	1037760	What they have a problem with essentially is queerness.
1037760	1039760	Now, what is queerness?
1039760	1046760	Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most generic sense queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.
1046760	1050760	So either your gender is all fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.
1050760	1056760	But unlike the words homosexual or transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion.
1056760	1062760	Often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.
1062760	1067760	So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,
1067760	1073760	but only if you shut up about it conform to straight society and try to act as normal as possible.
1073760	1077760	What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness because think of the children.
1077760	1085760	We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters, polyamorists, sing it with me.
1085760	1089760	These are my favorite degenerate things.
1089760	1095760	To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.
1095760	1100760	So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,
1100760	1103760	which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.
1103760	1108760	At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.
1108760	1114760	In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.
1114760	1120760	While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper from 1976
1120760	1121760	that claims,
1134760	1140760	which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom.
1140760	1144760	Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.
1144760	1148760	Jeez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?
1148760	1154760	We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.
1154760	1159760	Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?
1159760	1186760	["Pomp and Circumstance"]
1186760	1188760	Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.
1188760	1193760	I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.
1193760	1195760	And you know, that's probably for the best.
1195760	1198760	Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.
1198760	1203760	All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.
1203760	1206760	My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.
1206760	1211760	In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you worry about that.
1211760	1213760	And that's the difference between me and the fascists.
1213760	1217760	I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.
1217760	1221760	And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.
1221760	1225760	Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.
1225760	1229760	The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.
1229760	1233760	So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,
1233760	1238760	which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy,
1238760	1244760	well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs.
1244760	1249760	So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine.
1249760	1251760	Go make white babies.
1251760	1254760	But I really must insist, upon my right and the right of all degenerates,
1254760	1260760	to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.
1260760	1263760	Rock and roll.
1263760	1266760	Rock and roll.
1266760	1269760	Rock on, gold dust woman.
1269760	1272760	Take your silver spoon.
1272760	1280760	Take your grave.
1280760	1284760	I wake up in the morning.
1284760	1295760	See your sunrise, love is to go down.
1295760	1303760	Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud.
1303760	1307760	They cry out.
1307760	1310760	Well, did she make you cry?
1310760	1314760	Make you break it down and shatter your illusions of love?
1314760	1317760	Well, tell me, is it over now?
1317760	1327760	Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?
1327760	1330760	Rock on, ancient queen.
1330760	1338760	Follow those who'd fail in your shadow.
1338760	1340760	That was a jacket.
1340760	1344760	Rulers make bad lovers.
1344760	1350760	You better put your king in dumb mouth for sale.
1350760	1352760	One more time.
1352760	1355760	Oh, did she make you cry?
1355760	1359760	Make you break down and shatter your illusions of love?
1359760	1362760	Well, tell me, is it over now?
1362760	1374760	Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?
1374760	1376760	Rock and roll.
