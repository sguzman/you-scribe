0	19020	Alright children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.
19020	21280	How do I put this delicately?
21280	24120	Your humble hostess is a total les.
24120	25620	Shame.
26620	35020	You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse than just that.
35020	45020	You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness, and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.
45020	50920	And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be gay.
50920	54420	Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.
54420	64820	So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key, les-bicious behavior.
64820	67720	And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.
67720	70520	So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend.
70520	72820	Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.
72820	78620	Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is piping hot.
78620	84720	For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi, I'm a super fucking bi.
84720	91220	But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into the straight lifestyle.
91220	93020	This really started in 2018.
93020	99820	By that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman.
99820	105220	And we're going to circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle of things.
105220	107420	I'm like an epic poet.
108420	109820	Hey, how are you, gorge?
109820	116220	So, at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I didn't even say best friends, with a woman whom I'll call...
119220	121320	Joanne, light of my life.
121320	123520	Can we get some melodramatic music, please?
123520	124520	Yeah, here we go.
124520	126720	You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.
126720	129320	I want you to fully enjoy my pain.
129320	132620	So, my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.
132620	137420	It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes,
137420	140620	and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.
140620	143720	We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.
143720	147820	And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds,
147820	153820	which is very unusual for me because I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people.
153820	157420	One reason we got so emotionally close is we're both trans.
157420	162420	And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with another trans woman
162420	164720	that I can't really have with anyone else.
164720	170320	Oh, and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful,
170320	173620	which I did notice every time I looked at her.
173620	179320	And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either.
179320	180720	We'd get drunk and make out.
180720	183220	We'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle.
183220	184620	Straight girls do that, right?
184620	186620	Gal, pals.
186620	190920	I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,
190920	195720	and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand,
195720	198120	and we walked down the street together holding hands.
198120	201320	This is garbage and I want to die.
201320	203320	I hope you all know that I'm in agony.
203320	207120	Later, we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink,
207120	210420	we'd run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.
210420	214720	Ah, this is still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.
214720	217620	Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.
217620	221720	A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.
221720	225320	They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.
225320	228020	Gal, pals.
228020	228820	Just kill me.
228820	234520	Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home,
234520	235620	and they won't notice.
235620	243920	So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love.
243920	248520	So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time,
248520	252820	I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.
252820	254820	So how could I possibly think that?
254820	257720	Well, the short answer is shame.
257720	260220	Why is no one talking about the shame?
260220	263420	I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.
263420	266420	There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.
266420	272220	Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.
272220	277320	There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription,
277320	280520	Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.
280520	282020	I'm a bronze star lesbian.
282020	286420	Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.
286420	288420	Oh, I was desperate to be straight.
288420	289620	I tried prayer.
289620	291220	I tried electric shocks.
291220	294220	All the classics, all the hits.
294220	297220	You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women,
297220	299020	you start to associate the two in your head.
299020	301720	So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.
303220	307220	This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.
307220	312220	So at some point the shame was just too much for me and it literally broke my brain.
312220	314220	I no longer wanted to be straight.
314220	317220	I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.
317220	320220	Maybe a little by a little bit.
320220	325220	By that time I started dating men and I got into a serious long-term relationship with a man.
325220	331220	And at first I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself female friendships are just really intense.
331220	334220	That's probably why I feel so strongly.
334220	338220	And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that.
338220	343220	And, you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.
344220	347220	So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.
347220	349220	And then two things happened.
349220	352220	First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.
358220	360220	Fuck my drag, right?
360220	366220	I think before that I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia
366220	371220	allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as I just have a thing for my straight best friend.
371220	373220	Like, who doesn't?
373220	379220	But that's a very self-serving narrative because it quarantines your feelings inside the safety of unattainable fantasy
379220	382220	and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.
382220	386220	Because that way it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just she's just not that into women.
386220	390220	But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.
390220	394220	And the jealousy hit me so hard I couldn't ignore it.
394220	398220	Second, around that same time Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.
398220	400220	It was a long-distance friendship.
400220	403220	And about halfway through that visit I cracked.
403220	405220	One morning I woke up next to her.
407220	411220	And I looked at her pretty fucking face and I had the thought,
411220	414220	I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.
414220	421220	And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual biogirl to have about her gal pal.
421220	425220	Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.
425220	428220	Like, what the fuck is this? What am I feeling?
428220	435220	I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th century Italian opera.
435220	441220	So I confessed my feelings to Joanne and, love confession gone wrong, devastating.
442220	445220	But she did not reciprocate my feelings.
445220	448220	Nurse, my pain is at a 10, I need more pills.
448220	452220	Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah.
452220	454220	I'm sure we all know how that goes.
454220	458220	And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,
458220	460220	I might have recovered.
460220	462220	But we couldn't keep away from each other.
462220	466220	She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me because
466220	469220	the truth is, we were never just gal pals.
469220	471220	And I was beyond reason.
471220	476220	Like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts.
476220	478220	That's how tragic this got. Those are great by the way.
478220	480220	Pay no attention to bitter queens.
480220	484220	So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other,
484220	487220	and I just repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.
487220	492220	Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year
492220	496220	because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.
496220	501220	But rejection and a heartbreak are shameful in themselves and only made the situation worse.
501220	506220	So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial until finally last October.
506220	510220	I got super fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.
510220	512220	Link in the description. Subscribe.
512220	517220	And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a friendship break.
517220	519220	Otherwise, I was never going to get over her.
519220	523220	So there was this combination of things, being politically cancelled by Twitter,
523220	528220	being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend,
528220	532220	which sent me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.
532220	537220	And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.
537220	540220	Because depression brings your life to a standstill,
540220	544220	and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes feel outside yourself.
544220	547220	And with that comes a new perspective.
547220	550220	So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day
550220	553220	and binge watching Orange is the Bluest L word,
553220	556220	I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.
556220	558220	And that gave me a new kind of clarity.
558220	563220	I looked back on the last couple years and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.
563220	572220	So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a gay, not clickbait.
580220	603220	Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.
603220	604220	Shame.
604220	610220	This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.
610220	611220	Well that's my Eden.
611220	612220	Candy flipping.
612220	613220	I love it.
613220	619220	Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.
619220	622220	It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.
622220	626220	First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.
626220	628220	Female friendships are just really intense.
628220	630220	Straight girls have girl crushes too.
630220	636220	And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic attraction to men.
636220	640220	And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.
640220	648220	Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again and I'll slide back into denial.
648220	652220	So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.
652220	658220	Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.
658220	659220	She's a Libra.
659220	662220	So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.
662220	665220	And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that.
665220	669220	Like it makes you grow breasts, at least in theory.
669220	671220	I just added progesterone.
671220	672220	We'll see if that does anything.
672220	676220	But the lesser-known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.
676220	684220	The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual because the libido I had known before was just gone.
684220	686220	But I'm very much not asexual.
686220	692220	It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.
692220	697220	One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now, whomst I'm attracted to.
697220	701220	Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way.
701220	705220	It sparks my interest, but it doesn't light my fire.
705220	709220	It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.
709220	711220	It's a slow burn that has to be built up.
712220	716220	Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about.
716220	720220	But I think the concept it describes applies to me.
720220	724220	Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,
724220	729220	but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them as a friend.
729220	732220	So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?
732220	737220	Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?
737220	739220	I know that's not how it works.
739220	740220	I have to play the field.
740220	744220	I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.
744220	747220	Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.
747220	748220	It's boring.
748220	750220	The build-up of desire.
750220	754220	That's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and shame.
754220	757220	I shouldn't, but I want to.
757220	759220	That's how you build a plotline, kids.
759220	764220	I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality is more common in women than men.
764220	769220	And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.
769220	775220	When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.
775220	781220	Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.
781220	785220	And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.
785220	789220	So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality.
789220	793220	Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards the beautiful people of any gender,
793220	795220	and that can be pretty intense in its own right.
796220	804220	I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating to me than looking at a beautiful man.
804220	811220	Which can be moving in its own way, but it's more like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.
811220	816220	You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.
816220	819220	That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.
819220	820220	I'd fuck it so hard.
820220	824220	I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,
824220	831220	and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.
831220	838220	There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.
838220	849220	Like, I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms unfolding my smooth, fragile body.
850220	857220	Or maybe it's Mark Freudian, the masculine man as Daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic power of the phallus,
857220	860220	penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.
860220	865220	There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man
865220	871220	and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.
871220	876220	And I can find things I like about male bodies, like, they're very warm.
876220	879220	I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.
879220	882220	But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head and she says,
882220	887220	but are you attracted to men, or do you just like being warm?
887220	889220	My attraction to women is very different.
889220	895220	I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.
895220	898220	This is going to destroy me.
898220	901220	You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.
901220	903220	I've never once been in pain over male beauty.
903220	907220	But around Joanne, once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,
907220	910220	there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be like,
910220	912220	don't even enter my line of sight right now.
912220	914220	You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.
914220	918220	There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.
918220	920220	It's insatiable, like an addiction.
920220	925220	And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.
925220	928220	I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.
928220	931220	It's that they're interested in me.
931220	933220	And that's pretty interesting.
933220	938220	I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.
938220	944220	You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.
944220	945220	Fuck me up, King.
945220	946220	God, that's odd.
946220	948220	It gets me every time.
948220	953220	But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,
953220	957220	is not the same thing as attraction to men.
957220	962220	You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.
962220	965220	But for a long time, I confused one for the other.
965220	970220	And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women
970220	976220	is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.
976220	978220	It's all very passive.
978220	981220	And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,
981220	984220	I've taken a very submissive role.
984220	989220	Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let them do things to me.
989220	994220	And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.
994220	996220	I like that feeling myself.
996220	1000220	And I do genuinely enjoy taking on a more submissive role sometimes.
1000220	1002220	But you have to go about it thoughtfully.
1002220	1008220	Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid confronting
1008220	1010220	what your desires actually are.
1010220	1012220	It's freedom from freedom.
1012220	1014220	And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation
1014220	1016220	and ashamed of your transsexual body
1016220	1019220	and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all
1019220	1022220	because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,
1022220	1026220	then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires
1026220	1028220	by letting someone else take control
1028220	1031220	can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.
1031220	1034220	And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.
1034220	1037220	And I was able to convince myself that was normal
1037220	1041220	because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women
1041220	1043220	isn't really that much more liberated.
1043220	1046220	Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago
1046220	1048220	and totally identified with the fantasy.
1048220	1053220	And later, I thought that was evidence I had normative female desires.
1053220	1057220	Never mind that I was identifying with the midlife crisis fantasies
1057220	1059220	of a repressed English housewife
1059220	1061220	longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.
1061220	1066220	I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy.
1066220	1070220	I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.
1070220	1072220	But what makes me different is that for me,
1072220	1077220	submission to a man was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.
1077220	1079220	And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,
1079220	1083220	even though my real sexual attraction is to women.
1083220	1086220	Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,
1086220	1090220	straight women are ultimately attracted to men
1090220	1092220	and sexually aroused by male bodies.
1092220	1094220	Or are they? Gay men certainly are.
1094220	1097220	And gay women are just rhapsodic about women.
1097220	1102220	But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh about male bodies and men in general.
1102220	1105220	Which, what is that about?
1105220	1109220	I just, I just do not understand straight women.
1109220	1112220	I don't think I ever will. And that's okay.
1112220	1116220	I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment and move on with my lesbian life.
1116220	1121220	Now, what I've been giving you so far is a retrospective analysis,
1121220	1125220	an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.
1125220	1128220	But you have to understand that when I was living through this,
1128220	1131220	I experienced it very differently, because I didn't have these insights.
1131220	1134220	So I wasn't thinking, oh I'm not really attracted to men,
1134220	1137220	but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,
1137220	1141220	so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.
1141220	1145220	Now, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,
1145220	1147220	at least until Joanne ruined my life.
1147220	1150220	And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,
1150220	1153220	which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.
1153220	1156220	I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half,
1156220	1159220	who I had very genuine feelings for.
1159220	1161220	Plot twist, story time.
1161220	1167220	So, my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.
1167220	1171220	Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga Chad fantasy.
1171220	1174220	You know, he was very masculine, taller than me,
1174220	1177220	objectively attractive, very charming.
1177220	1180220	Straight women used to tell me all the time they were jealous of me for being with him.
1180220	1182220	And obviously I loved that.
1182220	1187220	To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,
1187220	1191220	a sort of archetypal romantic lead who swept me off my feet
1191220	1195220	and fulfilled my sick fantasies of being a heterosexual woman.
1195220	1199220	Now, you probably think I'm gonna say that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,
1199220	1203220	but that once it came to actually dating, I realized I didn't like it.
1203220	1206220	But honestly, it's more complicated than that.
1206220	1209220	Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him.
1209220	1213220	And I still think of him as the one genuine boy crush of my life.
1213220	1216220	When we started dating, it was really exciting.
1216220	1220220	I'd never had a boyfriend before, and he'd never been with a trans woman before.
1220220	1224220	And we had this, like, adorably heterosexual energy together,
1224220	1226220	like holding hands in the park.
1226220	1227220	It was cute!
1227220	1230220	This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a cad.
1230220	1232220	But he wasn't. He was great.
1232220	1233220	He took very good care of me.
1233220	1236220	He was never ashamed to be seen with me,
1236220	1239220	or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,
1239220	1243220	which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.
1243220	1246220	He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself.
1246220	1250220	And when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed.
1250220	1252220	And that meant a lot.
1252220	1255220	So I really wanted this to work.
1255220	1259220	Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.
1259220	1262220	And for a year or so, I thought it was working.
1262220	1264220	I enjoyed the time we spent together.
1264220	1266220	I missed him when he was gone.
1266220	1268220	I told him I loved him, and I meant it.
1268220	1271220	But what happened is, by the end of the first year,
1271220	1274220	the initial excitement ad died down.
1274220	1278220	And while Chad was ready to keep escalating the relationship,
1278220	1284220	I was realizing that something was very seriously, emotionally wrong on my end.
1284220	1286220	There was something missing.
1286220	1289220	And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,
1289220	1292220	I was like, there's that missing feeling.
1292220	1295220	And I started to understand what my problem was.
1295220	1299220	Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram
1299220	1301220	an aloof picture of me with the caption,
1301220	1305220	do I actually like men or do I just like attention?
1305220	1307220	And I didn't mean anything serious by that.
1307220	1308220	I was just joking around.
1308220	1310220	You know, you can post something like that
1310220	1312220	and a bunch of straight women will respond like,
1312220	1314220	yeah, fuck men.
1314220	1316220	What is their damage?
1316220	1318220	Well, they're stuck dating men. That's their damage.
1318220	1320220	But a few people left comments saying,
1320220	1322220	oh, are you making a video about comphet?
1322220	1324220	You should make a video about comphet.
1324220	1327220	And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?
1327220	1332220	So I Googled it and I learned that comphet is short for compulsory heterosexuality.
1332220	1337220	Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality is socially required of women.
1337220	1342220	And it's so bound up with the conventional idea of what it even means to be a woman
1342220	1347220	that gay women often mistakenly believe for years that they're attracted to men.
1347220	1352220	And this Google search led me to a Reddit post called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?
1352220	1358220	And I'm reading through this post like, oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.
1358220	1364220	Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head that says I must really be het
1364220	1366220	even when I'm in love with a woman.
1366220	1370220	Quote, you have every reason to be happy in your relationship with a man,
1370220	1372220	but you just aren't.
1372220	1376220	Everything is going really well, but something is missing and you can't figure out what.
1376220	1379220	So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.
1379220	1384220	and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.
1384220	1389220	And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual taking this quiz like, it's true.
1389220	1390220	Samantha was right.
1390220	1392220	I am a total lass.
1392220	1395220	All the cis gay people watching this video probably want to kill me right now
1395220	1400220	because y'all figured this shit out in high school and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,
1400220	1402220	it's just, I just, I just can't.
1402220	1406220	Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?
1406220	1408220	Is it all right with you, the gays?
1408220	1413220	So to be honest, I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.
1413220	1418220	Like for a long time, I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.
1418220	1423220	But after a lot of introspection, I've realized that this is not really a fantasy
1423220	1426220	of private happiness and fulfillment.
1426220	1430220	It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.
1430220	1437220	Like, can you imagine if I got married to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding
1437220	1440220	with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?
1440220	1443220	Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.
1443220	1445220	I'd be super heck and valid, uwu.
1445220	1447220	But I don't actually want to be married.
1447220	1448220	I want to get married.
1448220	1450220	I want to have a wedding.
1450220	1452220	Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.
1452220	1454220	I want attention, okay?
1454220	1456220	Please pay attention to me.
1456220	1462220	So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy, but it's still really hard for me to let it go.
1462220	1466220	I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality.
1466220	1472220	Because there's a level of gender instability and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.
1472220	1477220	And until recently, I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.
1477220	1480220	Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,
1480220	1484220	and I think I needed to go through the more one-on-one straight girl experience
1484220	1487220	before attempting anything as difficult as that.
1487220	1493220	I still have a hard time imagining a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.
1493220	1498220	And I think that's partly because good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.
1498220	1502220	The best we have is a Showtime melodrama from 15 years ago,
1502220	1505220	which I do like, and I like the new one too.
1505220	1511220	But after that, the runner-up is, I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.
1511220	1514220	It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whom we ship.
1514220	1519220	Well, I don't ship them because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush on Kacha's Amalochkava.
1519220	1523220	Don't laugh at me. She's smart. She's funny. She's beautiful.
1523220	1525220	That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.
1525220	1531220	Sure, some haters and losers will probably try to convince me that Kacha is in fact a homosexual man posing as a woman.
1531220	1536220	But you know what? This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life, and I don't need this right now.
1537220	1542220	I need to be touched by a real woman. I'm losing my goddamn mind.
1542220	1548220	It's so deeply embedded in our culture that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.
1548220	1556220	And it's not just Disney movies, like it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology, German fairy tales, Victorian novels.
1556220	1562220	The whole weight of cultural history is telling you that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.
1562220	1568220	And if you're already super dysphoric and insecure about your gender, then to reject that possibility?
1568220	1571220	Ah, it hurts. It hurts so bad.
1571220	1578220	But whenever I think about having a long-term partner, you know, not the wedding day, but the one thousandth morning waking up together,
1578220	1589220	I can only imagine her being a woman. My brain wants a good man to take care of me, but my heart wants a high maintenance diva to ruin my life.
1589220	1595220	And once I knew that for sure, I thought I would be wrong to stay with Chad.
1595220	1599220	And this man was like my hinge. He was holding me together.
1599220	1611220	But last December, I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian, which at least is a good reason.
1614220	1618220	I'm having a hard time, you guys. Leave your pity in the comments.
1618220	1621220	And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too. I feel like shit.
1621220	1626220	I think it's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me. I could really use a couple Advil on a vodka tonic.
1626220	1630220	I think I might throw some clothes on, too. Where's that snake?
1639220	1642220	I already missed my heterosexual nails.
1642220	1646220	I know these are too long to be gay, but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.
1646220	1650220	Getting my acrylics removed? Traumatizing. I feel like I'm detransitioning.
1650220	1653220	One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure with acrylics on eight fingers.
1653220	1656220	I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon and say,
1656220	1662220	Hi, I'm a homosexual, please. I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.
1663220	1670220	Shame. Let's talk about the shame. Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women, though.
1671220	1676220	Two of those women later turned out to be trans, so I guess we had some way of finding each other.
1676220	1680220	An attraction to women was never really a problem for me before the transgendering,
1680220	1685220	because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle where men are supposed to be attracted to women.
1685220	1690220	Crazy, I know. Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty.
1690220	1694220	I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.
1694220	1699220	And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around my being, at the time, a gender non-conforming man,
1699220	1707220	which, in my early YouTube videos, I dealt with by caricaturing myself and basically leaning into the public humiliation.
1707220	1709220	One of my classic techniques.
1709220	1714220	But now, my shame is centered around my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.
1714220	1724220	And the most glaring aspects of that failure are my male past, my sexual orientation, and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.
1724220	1730220	Yeah, killing all those people was not my most feminine moment, but I was having a bad skin day.
1730220	1731220	What was I supposed to do?
1731220	1734220	So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.
1734220	1736220	One, I'm ashamed of being trans.
1736220	1739220	Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.
1739220	1746220	And whatever one times two is, I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.
1746220	1747220	Ugh.
1747220	1756220	And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.
1756220	1758220	Why is no one talking about the shame?
1758220	1760220	Because we are ashamed of the shame.
1760220	1761220	But we shouldn't be.
1761220	1764220	The shame is a natural result of shaming.
1764220	1773220	I grew up in a media era when trans women were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities who deserve the violence they bring upon themselves by existing.
1773220	1787220	And I started my transition in the first year of the Trump administration when there's been constant vilification of trans people in the press, invading women's bathrooms, forcing our insanity on children, destroying western civilization with our authoritarian pronouns.
1787220	1792220	It's hard to express just the daily humiliation of being a trans woman under these conditions.
1792220	1797220	And then there's the little jabs people throw at you like my laser technician recently told me,
1797220	1802220	you must be very courageous to transition because that is not socially acceptable.
1802220	1805220	And then she went back to blasting laser beams into my asshole.
1805220	1810220	And then there's the internet where, you know, I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.
1810220	1816220	And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet are a wretched, wretched horde of bigoted attack helicopters.
1816220	1819220	The whole point of this channel is I try to talk sense to these people.
1819220	1825220	I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives and I try to empathize with their point of view and provide a rational response.
1825220	1831220	But a side effect of all that research is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self loathing.
1831220	1834220	It seeped into my brain and become a part of me.
1834220	1839220	And this lifelong build up of shame has become a wound at the heart of my existence.
1839220	1844220	And all I can really do about it is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.
1844220	1848220	I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.
1848220	1850220	I am resplendent trash.
1850220	1852220	I am couture trash.
1852220	1858220	And I just bought a mid-century gold trimmed Venetian blown glass decanter.
1858220	1863220	Which helps me forget the shame and self loathing that plagues my every moment.
1863220	1868220	Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused about why I'm so ashamed of being gay
1868220	1872220	when I've already come out as trans, which seems like a bigger deal.
1872220	1877220	To paraphrase what some people have told me, you're already a transgendered and a freak's a freak.
1877220	1879220	So who cares what kind of freak?
1879220	1883220	Well first of all, I would like to propose a sociological theory.
1883220	1890220	Tiffany's Law. All freaks have a deep psychological need to feel superior to a different type of freak.
1890220	1894220	And trans lesbians are pretty close to the bottom of that packing order.
1894220	1897220	Who's even left for me to feel superior to, the goddamn Belgians?
1897220	1899220	Fuck this waffle.
1899220	1905220	Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me because I did it incrementally over like eight years.
1905220	1909220	At first I was like, well, I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.
1909220	1912220	Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup.
1912220	1915220	I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.
1915220	1918220	And then I realized I'm not a man at all and I identified as non-binary.
1918220	1920220	Then I started taking hormones.
1920220	1925220	In two months on HRT I woke up one day and said, it's fine. I am literally a woman.
1925220	1930220	So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman, that was actually a step up
1930220	1933220	in terms of social acceptability from where I was before.
1933220	1936220	When I was a genderqueer gender fuck, I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.
1936220	1942220	Whereas when I started transitioning to female, even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,
1942220	1949220	there was at least a goal in mind, some possible future where I could lead a normal-ish life as a woman.
1949220	1954220	So the moment I started identifying as a woman was the moment the comphette voice entered my head.
1954220	1958220	Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before, but maybe I'm attracted to them now.
1958220	1959220	I'm a woman, right?
1959220	1963220	I've always been a little bi-curious and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.
1963220	1965220	Maybe I can make this work.
1965220	1968220	Let's choose some boys to be attracted to and get started on this.
1968220	1971220	Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.
1971220	1976220	My way of explaining it to myself was, I guess hormones just magically changed my sexual orientation
1976220	1979220	to the socially acceptable one. That's zebra-freaking-crazy.
1979220	1982220	Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.
1982220	1986220	God, there's so much pressure on trans women to be extremely gender-conforming.
1986220	1989220	And even more so if you're a representative of the community.
1989220	1994220	You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife or else cis people are going to throw us all in camps.
1994220	1998220	And early in my transition, I kind of worshipped straight trans women.
1998220	2001220	Like, I looked up to them and I wanted to be just like them.
2001220	2007220	Now back then there were a handful of trans lesbians on YouTube trying to make the case to the masses
2007220	2010220	that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.
2010220	2013220	But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.
2013220	2015220	I watched those women get eaten alive.
2015220	2020220	And as a result of my witnessing that at a super-freaking-vulnerable moment for me,
2020220	2026220	I internalized the message that a trans lesbian is just not an okay thing to be
2026220	2030220	if you want to be tolerated or respected by anybody other than a handful of communists.
2030220	2036220	So I began my transition with essentially no role model of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.
2036220	2041220	And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia are harsher on gay trans women
2041220	2043220	than they are on straight trans women.
2043220	2048220	They could take this trope that trans women are men who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.
2048220	2051220	In response to that, it feels really good to be able to say,
2051220	2055220	I'm not even attracted to women, I'm just a petite heterosexual biogirl,
2055220	2059220	I'm surely not some kind of six-foot monster who likes women.
2059220	2062220	Shame. Shame.
2062220	2064220	It does make me feel like a monster sometimes.
2064220	2066220	Like a mutant that has no place in society.
2066220	2071220	And this shame has actually made it more difficult for me to accept that I'm a gay woman
2071220	2074220	than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.
2074220	2079220	It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain where I traded my sexual orientation for my gender identity.
2079220	2084220	So I finally transitioned only to spend the next couple years living with a different kind of denial.
2084220	2088220	And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.
2088220	2094220	This is painful and incriminating to admit, but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.
2094220	2099220	Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust toward things I saw trans lesbians doing.
2099220	2103220	Like this anime catgirl shit which clearly gets under my skin.
2103220	2106220	And not just because these people have been harassing me for three years.
2106220	2109220	Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,
2109220	2113220	this queasy combination of the hypersexual and the infantile.
2113220	2116220	I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian cum slut.
2116220	2118220	Meow meow girl dick, meow meow.
2118220	2122220	Here's the 97th picture of my own legs and thigh-hide stripey socks oo-woo.
2122220	2124220	What is that about?
2124220	2126220	Is this how women act?
2126220	2128220	Sis people are gonna see this.
2128220	2131220	They're not gonna let us into women's spaces if we act like that.
2131220	2135220	Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings.
2135220	2139220	But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,
2139220	2143220	guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.
2143220	2147220	And if I was a different type of YouTuber, I could have turned this into content.
2147220	2150220	At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,
2150220	2153220	why are trans lesbians so cringey?
2153220	2156220	They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.
2156220	2158220	And that's the real darkness, isn't it?
2158220	2163220	Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself like an honest American.
2163220	2167220	No, just sitting there in absurd denial of who you are as a person,
2167220	2171220	disparaging your own repressed identity to anyone who will listen.
2171220	2172220	And I'm ashamed of that too.
2172220	2174220	I'm ashamed I sunk that low.
2174220	2177220	But all you can do is try to get better.
2177220	2178220	And I'm trying to get better.
2178220	2180220	I've broken free of the denial.
2180220	2182220	And now I have to break free of the shame.
2182220	2185220	Because shame is literally ruining my life.
2185220	2188220	I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame.
2188220	2193220	And she said, I might want to mention that one of the reasons she didn't want to be with me
2193220	2197220	is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.
2197220	2200220	She said she feels like relationships between trans women
2200220	2205220	are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society with no attempt to integrate.
2205220	2209220	These are very painful words to hear from the woman you're in love with.
2209220	2212220	But I understand why she feels that way.
2212220	2215220	Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.
2215220	2220220	But I can't be the hinge that connects her to mainstream society.
2220220	2222220	And it's maddening to me that she feels that way
2222220	2226220	because I would have chosen her over every cis woman in the world.
2226220	2230220	But I'm just another worthless freak without the authority of society behind me.
2230220	2232220	So my love doesn't count.
2232220	2233220	Shame.
2233220	2234220	It poisons the soul.
2234220	2237220	You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,
2237220	2240220	is such a basic part of your humanity.
2240220	2243220	And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.
2243220	2245220	It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.
2245220	2248220	It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.
2248220	2251220	It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.
2251220	2255220	And living in that state of mind is garbage.
2255220	2257220	It's basically hell.
2257220	2259220	Even after I realized my sexuality,
2259220	2263220	I considered just shoving that shit back down, never coming out.
2263220	2265220	I have all these fears about it.
2265220	2267220	I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.
2267220	2271220	I'm worried cis women or straight women I'm friends with will get weird about it.
2271220	2273220	I'm worried I'll die a lonely useless lesbian,
2273220	2275220	in which case I should have just married a man,
2275220	2279220	because at least then there'd be someone to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.
2279220	2282220	I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.
2282220	2284220	Although, I mean, love you boys,
2284220	2288220	and please keep the attention coming because I need all the validation I can get right now,
2288220	2290220	but I will be fine without you.
2290220	2295220	And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?
2295220	2298220	I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,
2298220	2302220	just sacrificing my sexual orientation to regain that safe,
2302220	2307220	comfortable, shameless feeling I used to have when walking down the street holding Chad's hand,
2307220	2310220	feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.
2310220	2313220	But if I don't deal with this now and work towards accepting myself,
2313220	2316220	then I'm just going to be in the same situation in 10 years,
2316220	2320220	when I'm 41 years old and married to a man and having these same feelings.
2320220	2321220	So it's time for this to stop,
2321220	2324220	because literally the only good thing about being gay
2324220	2325220	is doing gay shit.
2325220	2327220	And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,
2327220	2329220	no one's going to want to do gay shit with me.
2329220	2332220	As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,
2332220	2335220	how in the hell are you going to prop up your narcissistic delusions?
2335220	2337220	Look, I'm trying to stay positive.
2337220	2340220	Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now, but just you wait.
2340220	2342220	We all know how trends work.
2342220	2348220	In 10 years, being a trans lesbian will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,
2348220	2351220	and all the people who talk shit now will forget they ever said a word.
2351220	2352220	That's right.
2352220	2356220	Even the straight trans girls will be making out with each other just for the clout.
2356220	2358220	Like, we can be lesbians too.
2358220	2359220	We are aji.
2359220	2363220	Oh, it's going to be Madonna and Britney at the 2003 VMAs all over again.
2363220	2365220	Mark my words.
2365220	2371220	And among cis lesbians, oh, it will actually be a sign of prestige to have a trap waifu.
2372220	2373220	I can dream, right?
2373220	2376220	Once you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?
2381220	2382220	I can't believe it.
2382220	2383220	I can't believe it.
2383220	2384220	I can't believe it.
2384220	2385220	I can't believe it.

2409220	2410220	I can't believe it.
2410220	2411220	I can't believe it.
2411220	2412220	I can't believe it.
2412220	2413220	I can't believe it.
2413220	2414220	I can't believe it.
2414220	2416220	I can't believe it.
2436220	2461220	I can't believe it.
2467220	2495220	Thank you.
2495220	2521220	Thank you.
