0	4400	9-1-1, what are you reporting?
4400	7600	Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.
7600	10600	Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...
10600	15600	I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six feet tall. Big man-ham.
15600	19600	I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man-ham?
19600	22800	Well, she's covered in butter-five, and she has giant wings.
22800	24800	I'm sorry, what?
24800	26800	Oh, and she talks like a fat ****.
26800	28800	Memph.
30800	33600	Out of this wood do not desire to go.
33600	37600	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
37600	44600	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
60600	66400	Hail mortals, I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.
66400	73600	Western culture is being destroyed by cocks and by gender-bending intoxication and sodomy.
73600	76600	You know, things that have never happened in Europe.
76600	92200	There's a lot of people talking lately about the West and Western culture and Western civilization.
92200	94200	But what do those words even mean?
94200	99800	I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.
99800	100600	Fuck that!
100600	104200	The people demand blood, and I'm thirsty for blood.
104200	106200	And by blood, I mean dick.
106200	108200	And by dick, I mean corndogs.
108200	111800	And by corndogs, I mean sixteen of them over the course of an evening.
111800	113800	And by evening, I mean morning.
113800	117000	And by morning, I mean between eight o'clock and eight fifteen.
117000	119000	And by corndogs, I mean dick.
119000	120600	Who's up first?
120600	124600	Well, Angry White Guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,
124600	129800	and it's been a while since I've done a video response, so let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.
129800	131800	McGonk is here, baby doll.
131800	133800	What?
133800	137800	I don't want to die!
141800	144600	That is a mad.
144600	148600	Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.
148600	154600	The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.
154600	157800	Both of these clues have to do with coming out.
157800	159800	Wrong!
159800	161800	Her magic power is the conflict of the plot.
161800	167800	And her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential
167800	171800	and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.
171800	175800	She will destroy her enemies and raise their castles to the ground.
175800	179800	The song Let It Go is basically, fuck this shit, I'm conquering everyone.
179800	185800	So just to be clear, this is a grown man who has addressed himself
185800	191800	as far as a sorcerer to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.
191800	193800	It almost feels like punching down at this point.
193800	195800	At least the golden one was mask for mask.
195800	197800	Who can I punch up at?
197800	199800	I don't like talking about punching.
199800	201800	It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.
201800	203800	I would never punch a turf.
203800	205800	My hands are too feminine.
205800	207800	And my fingers are tired.
207800	209800	Someone massage them.
209800	211800	Who can I claw up at?
211800	215800	The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.
215800	217800	How about that?
217800	219800	Dad, stop. Ugh, get out of my life.
219800	223800	In my video about Jordan Peterson, I talked about how he posits a struggle
223800	226800	between the West and postmodern neo-Marxism.
226800	232800	I argued that Pomo No Mo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,
232800	234800	none of which are in any sense non-Western.
234800	239800	Unless, of course, you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,
239800	243800	which, surely, no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?
243800	247800	I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.
247800	251800	In this video, I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West
251800	253800	and the people who claim to defend it.
253800	256800	Wow, Daddy, nice sword.
256800	258800	God damn it, we're going to need to aim even higher.
258800	261800	Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...
263800	266800	The President of the United States of America,
266800	269800	big dick, special big boy Donald Trump.
269800	271800	Just as Poland could not be broken,
271800	274800	I declare today for the world to hear that
274800	278800	the West will never, ever be broken.
278800	283800	Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,
283800	286800	and our civilization will triumph.
287800	299800	So we've got the most powerful fuckboy on the planet
299800	302800	prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization,
302800	306800	so I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.
306800	309800	Which is too bad, because that's going to require a lot of thinking.
309800	312800	And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.
312800	314800	Someone massage it.
316800	318800	And soon, mechanically,
318800	322800	dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,
322800	325800	I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea
325800	328800	in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.
328800	332800	No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate,
332800	335800	then a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,
335800	338800	intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.
338800	341800	An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,
341800	346800	something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.
346800	350800	And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,
350800	354800	its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,
354800	357800	this new sensation having had on me,
357800	361800	the effect which a love has of post-preambulatory banter.
361800	365800	Whether you're in Fashy YouTube or Pomo, Nomo, Akadomino,
365800	369800	it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,
369800	372800	clearly defined thing called Western Civilization
372800	375800	that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era
375800	377800	of enlightened philosopher kings.
377800	378800	On the track!
378800	379800	On the track!
379800	380800	On the track!
380800	383800	But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively
383800	386800	by modern people for particular purposes.
386800	388800	It's like an origin myth.
388800	389800	In an article titled,
389800	392800	There is No Such Thing as Western Civilization,
392800	395800	the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out
395800	397800	that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
397800	399800	there was no such thing as the West.
399800	402800	The world was divided into three continents he called Europe,
402800	404800	Asia, and Libya.
404800	407800	Herodotus had no notion that these three continents
407800	409800	corresponded to different types of people,
409800	412800	and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.
412800	415800	In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia,
415800	416800	in which he traveled,
416800	419800	than with the faraway and foreign people of northern Europe.
419800	422800	So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.
422800	425800	Really, there is no one idea of the West,
425800	427800	which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of
427800	430800	discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.
430800	433800	According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked
433800	435800	under the heading of the West.
435800	437800	Let's talk about them now!
437800	438800	Concept 1.
438800	440800	Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values
440800	442800	In the year 732,
442800	445800	a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory
445800	447800	at the Battle of Tor,
447800	449800	against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain
449800	451800	into what is now France,
451800	454800	effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate
454800	455800	into Western Europe.
455800	456800	According to Apiah,
456800	458800	the first recorded use of the Latin term
458800	461800	Europensis, or Europeans,
461800	465800	dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tor,
465800	467800	distinguishing Christians from Muslims.
467800	468800	In the late Middle Ages,
468800	470800	the concept of Christendom appeared
470800	472800	and was used to distinguish the Christian world
472800	475800	from the Islamic world and from paganism.
475800	478800	This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor
478800	481800	to the modern concept of the West.
481800	482800	Notice that the term itself
482800	485800	posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,
485800	488800	where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.
488800	491800	The Christian inheritance is still invoked today
491800	492800	by defenders of the West,
492800	495800	like Lil Benny and Professor Studied the Blade,
495800	499800	often under the heading of Judeo-Christian Values,
499800	501800	a term usually used to falsely imply
501800	503800	that contemporary moral norms
503800	505800	derive from such a generic parochial
505800	508800	and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,
508800	511800	as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,
511800	513800	as if the prohibition of graven images
513800	516800	has any contemporary influence whatsoever,
516800	519800	as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws
519800	522800	protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily triggered ego
522800	524800	and non-condemning slavery and rape.
524800	527800	And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?
527800	528800	Bible jokes.
528800	530800	The other main use of Judeo-Christian Values
530800	533800	is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.
533800	534800	Speaking of which,
534800	538800	what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?
538800	541800	Two kids and a dog just like the Bible says?
541800	542800	Well, no.
542800	546800	Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament
546800	548800	and not forbidden in either testament.
548800	549800	Even in the beginning,
549800	551800	Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents
551800	553800	and who can blame her,
553800	556800	and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.
556800	558800	But it's cool he was into that.
558800	559800	In the Middle Ages,
559800	561800	the Catholic Church gradually enforced
561800	563800	the one man and one woman view of marriage.
563800	565800	Although in formerly pagan lands,
565800	567800	this idea was slow to take hold.
568800	570800	Charles Martel's grandson, Charlemagne,
570800	573800	had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines
573800	575800	because he was a proud son of the North,
575800	578800	100% Natty, and Alpha as fuck.
578800	580800	I'm sorry, I just can't stop.
580800	584800	The Golden One, his soul and mind are intermingled.
584800	586800	Probably because we both played
586800	589800	1200 hours of Age of Empires in 1999.
589800	591800	And then something went terribly wrong.
591800	593800	Fuckin' 9-11.
593800	595800	It used to be such an innocent decision
595800	597800	to play as the Franks or the Saracens
597800	600800	that it became this huge civilizational struggle,
600800	602800	and that's why this guy is a fascist
602800	604800	and I grew up to be a woman.
604800	605800	Thanks a lot, Osama.
605800	607800	Being transgender is so weird.
607800	609800	You have these childhood memories
609800	611800	that are just totally discordant
611800	613800	with your adult gender identity.
613800	615800	How do you even deal with that?
615800	616800	Well, here's how.
616800	617800	You bond with straight guys
617800	619800	over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia
619800	621800	and then you fuck them.
621800	624800	I'm not like other girls.
624800	629800	No.
629800	631800	Concept 2, Enlightenment Values.
631800	634800	So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior
634800	636800	named Martin Luther nails his list
636800	639800	of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.
639800	642800	That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence
642800	644800	between Catholics and Protestants.
644800	645800	That eventually chills out,
645800	647800	but then the 18th century rolls around
647800	649800	and shit's just fuckin' crazy.
649800	652800	There are various fops and dandies and macaronis
652800	654800	getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses
654800	656800	and babbling about enlightenment
656800	658800	like the beatnik trash they are.
658800	659800	Then, 300 years later,
659800	661800	a bunch of drinks sought in fedora tippers
661800	664800	appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire
664800	666800	before sinking into sweeping
666800	668800	sexual harassment allegations under the rug
668800	671800	and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos
671800	674800	about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.
674800	676800	That's not what they were discussing
676800	677800	at the Parisian Salon.
677800	679800	This is all very embarrassing,
679800	682800	but still, some of these Enlightenment values,
682800	685800	science, liberty, skepticism about dogma,
685800	687800	these are basically good ideas
687800	690800	and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.
690800	692800	But it's important to keep in mind
692800	694800	that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.
694800	697800	In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.
697800	700800	So the sum of what we now think of as the West
700800	702800	actually contains major contradictions
702800	704800	because the history of the West
704800	706800	is a history of change and revolution.
706800	708800	So when a new movement comes along,
708800	711800	like for instance a bunch of Buzzkill sad sacks pointing out
711800	714800	that actually our society is still pretty terrible
714800	717800	to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,
717800	719800	it might not be the smartest thing
719800	721800	to just dismiss it as some kind of sinister
721800	723800	postmodern new Marxist cuckoldry.
723800	725800	It could be the next Reformation,
725800	728800	in a history marked by a series of reformations.
728800	730800	If there are any historians watching this,
730800	733800	please call it the SJW Reformation.
733800	735800	Think about the Protestant Reformation.
735800	736800	At the time,
736800	738800	that probably seemed like a civilizational threat
738800	740800	to the Holy Roman Empire,
740800	741800	and it kind of was.
741800	743800	But in retrospect,
743800	745800	we see the Reformation as just as important a moment
745800	747800	in Western culture
747800	749800	as the medieval period that preceded it.
749800	751800	But today's Counter Reformation,
751800	753800	made up of people like Orangie Smalls
753800	755800	and Dr. Clean Your Room,
755800	757800	uh, insist on pretending the current Reformation
757800	759800	is some kind of alien threat.
759800	761800	And as for the Counter Counter Reformation,
761800	764800	well, that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.
764800	767800	Concept three, Western culture.
767800	770800	The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism
770800	772800	between the Western Roman Catholic Church
772800	774800	and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
774800	776800	But in its contemporary sense,
776800	779800	the idea of Western culture didn't really exist
779800	783800	until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
783800	786800	when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spangler's
786800	789800	1918 book, The Decline of the West,
789800	792800	an important influence on Nazi ideology.
792800	795800	As long as people have been talking about Western culture,
795800	798800	they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,
798800	801800	as I've discussed in several earlier videos,
801800	803800	which I encourage you not to watch.
803800	805800	But the idea of Western culture
805800	807800	was influential well beyond the Third Reich.
807800	809800	At the height of European imperialism,
809800	812800	the idea of a superior high culture of the West
812800	815800	was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit
815800	817800	the mysterious Orient.
817800	819800	And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist
819800	821800	rhetoric under the rug,
821800	824800	the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept
824800	826800	in our schools and universities,
826800	828800	where you have to take courses like
828800	831800	History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,
831800	833800	but you didn't actually do any of the readings for
833800	836800	because you were too busy crouching in the bushes
836800	837800	outside the dean's office,
837800	839800	vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.
839800	842800	The consequence of this Western culture education
842800	844800	is that we now all have this sense
844800	847800	that we belong to a continuous civilization
847800	849800	whose crowning achievements are the Ten Commandments,
849800	852800	Jesus fucking Christ, Athenian pederasts,
852800	855800	cathedrals, Mozart, human rights,
855800	857800	science, and iPhones.
857800	858800	But the reality is,
858800	860800	this is an essentialist conglomeration
860800	862800	of a history that's much more non-linear
862800	863800	than we often think.
863800	865800	We in the West claim to be the inheritors
865800	868800	of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,
868800	871800	but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.
871800	872800	St. Thomas Aquinas,
872800	875800	one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,
875800	877800	is largely responsible for introducing
877800	879800	Aristotle to Christian universities,
879800	881800	but he never would have encountered Aristotle
881800	884800	in the first place had not ancient Greek philosophy
884800	886800	been translated and commentated
886800	888800	by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.
888800	890800	So the origins of Western culture
890800	892800	aren't really unique to us at all,
892800	895800	and the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.
895800	898800	On the one hand, you have Judeo-Christian values,
898800	900800	and on the other hand, you have degenerates
900800	901800	like William Shakespeare,
901800	904800	who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens
904800	905800	and make out with each other,
905800	907800	which, for the record, is disgusting,
907800	909800	and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.
909800	911800	Because if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times,
911800	913800	boys in drag played female parts.
913800	915800	I wish I had female parts.
915800	917800	Working on it.
917800	919800	Concept four, The Free World.
919800	921800	From 1941 to 1945,
921800	924800	Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,
924800	926800	an agricultural scientist from Iowa,
926800	928800	whom Democratic Party officials despised
928800	931800	for being what we'd now call a democratic socialist.
931800	934800	Wallace later ran for president in 1948
934800	936800	as a third-party candidate on a platform
936800	939800	of universal health care, anti-segregation,
939800	941800	in opposition to the Cold War.
941800	943800	During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked
943800	945800	in the press for his spiritualism,
945800	948800	his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,
948800	951800	and what Time Magazine called his assault on the South,
951800	953800	that is, his, quote,
953800	955800	ostentatious ride through cities and towns
955800	958800	with his Negro secretary beside him,
958800	961800	for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.
961800	963800	The poor, naive Wallace commented,
963800	965800	there is something so unlovely about hate
965800	968800	when you see it distorting the human face.
968800	969800	We'll get used to it, buddy.
969800	970800	This is America.
970800	972800	Am I lecturing someone from 1948
972800	974800	about how bigoted this country is?
974800	976800	This is fine.
976800	979800	Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote
979800	981800	in the 1948 election,
981800	984800	and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech
984800	986800	titled, The Century of the Common Man,
986800	988800	in which he contrasted what he called
988800	991800	the slave world of fascists with the free world,
991800	993800	which he described as an incomplete
993800	996800	and ongoing international people's revolution.
996800	999800	No Nazi counter-revolution will stop him.
999800	1003800	The common man will smoke the Hitler Stooges
1003800	1005800	out into the open in the United States,
1005800	1008800	in Latin America and in India.
1008800	1011800	He will destroy their influence.
1011800	1014800	No Laval's, no Mussolini's
1014800	1017800	will be tolerated in a free world.
1017800	1019800	Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it,
1019800	1021800	but it was common during World War II
1021800	1023800	when the phrase the free world
1023800	1025800	first entered common parlance
1025800	1028800	to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers,
1028800	1030800	including the Dirty Reds.
1030800	1033800	After the war, the phrase the free world
1033800	1035800	remained common in American politics,
1035800	1037800	but the meaning shifted.
1037800	1039800	Instead of referring to the international alliance
1039800	1042800	against fascism, it referred to the capitalist west
1042800	1045800	as opposed to the communist east.
1045800	1047800	The idea of the free capitalist west
1047800	1049800	is still an important ingredient
1049800	1052800	in this jumbled concept we call western civilization.
1052800	1054800	So when lobster dad says there's a struggle
1054800	1056800	between Marxism and the west,
1056800	1058800	it seems at first like he's just stuck
1058800	1060800	in the 1980s or something.
1060800	1063800	Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?
1063800	1065800	Dad, what year do you think it is?
1065800	1068800	Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?
1068800	1070800	They're on your side now, remember?
1070800	1073800	The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism
1073800	1075800	to invoke red scare sentiment
1075800	1078800	in opposition to the SJW Reformation.
1078800	1079800	But the point I'm trying to make
1079800	1081800	is that the west is a concept,
1081800	1083800	or rather several contradictory concepts,
1083800	1085800	that are always posited in particular
1085800	1087800	political circumstances
1087800	1090800	as one side of an us versus them opposition.
1090800	1092800	Whether it's the Christian west versus the infidels,
1092800	1095800	the Enlightenment west versus Islam,
1095800	1098800	the cultured west versus the colonized savages,
1098800	1101800	the capitalist west versus the communist east,
1101800	1103800	or the white European west versus
1103800	1105800	the Jewish cultural Marxist plot
1105800	1107800	to cock the sons of the north
1107800	1109800	by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens
1109800	1110800	and inundating their countries
1110800	1113800	with a barbarous board of third world migrants.
1113800	1115800	I guess I have to say something about that.
1115800	1118800	Concept five, blood and soil.
1118800	1121800	If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer
1121800	1123800	Richard Spencer what he thinks the west is,
1123800	1126800	he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic,
1126800	1129800	and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people
1129800	1131800	by their fair-skinned ancestors.
1132800	1136800	To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent
1136800	1138800	could be part of the west is ridiculous
1138800	1142800	because for Spencer to be western is to be white.
1142800	1143800	Now the thing about that is,
1143800	1146800	as an analysis of the common usage of the term the west,
1146800	1148800	it's not even wrong.
1148800	1151800	Consider Latin America where the main language is spoken
1151800	1153800	are Spanish, Portuguese, and French
1153800	1156800	where the majority of religion is Roman Catholicism.
1156800	1159800	Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the west?
1159800	1162800	Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?
1162800	1166800	Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.
1166800	1167800	Or to be more accurate,
1167800	1170800	the flexible and historically variant concepts
1170800	1173800	of whiteness and the west have been constructed
1173800	1175800	so as to exclude them.
1175800	1177800	And I've already spent half my YouTube career
1177800	1179800	on delirious gay screeching about Nazis
1179800	1181800	so I don't want to do more of that now.
1181800	1182800	But suffice to say,
1182800	1184800	the association between whiteness and the west
1184800	1186800	is always lurking beneath the surface
1187800	1189800	and when whiteness rears its head proudly,
1189800	1193800	the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.
1193800	1194800	As I'm making this video,
1194800	1197800	the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes
1197800	1199800	is up and running yet again,
1199800	1201800	thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe
1201800	1203800	and a racist demagogue in the United States.
1203800	1204800	And once more,
1204800	1207800	both continents are dotted with barbed wire,
1207800	1208800	refugee ghettos,
1208800	1212800	and internment camps full of children torn from parents.
1213800	1216800	Concept six, the evil west.
1216800	1218800	The west, in many ways,
1218800	1220800	is an inherently supremacist concept.
1220800	1222800	It's thought to be more civilized,
1222800	1223800	more holy,
1223800	1225800	and more cultured than the non-west.
1225800	1227800	But there are some ridiculous college professors
1227800	1231800	who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.
1231800	1232800	According to them,
1232800	1234800	the west is not uniquely civilized
1234800	1236800	but uniquely uncivilized,
1236800	1237800	cruel,
1237800	1238800	imperialistic,
1238800	1239800	racist,
1239800	1240800	and genocidal.
1240800	1243800	This just perpetuates the same essentializing error.
1243800	1245800	Europeans aren't inherently more evil
1245800	1247800	any more than they're inherently more civilized.
1247800	1250800	If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa
1250800	1251800	400 years ago,
1251800	1253800	the result would have been just as brutal.
1253800	1255800	So instead of vilifying the west,
1255800	1258800	I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,
1258800	1261800	adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,
1261800	1264800	and acknowledge that the world is too complicated
1264800	1266800	to reduce to simple us and them binaries.
1266800	1269800	Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle
1269800	1272800	in classical music and the Cheesecake Factory.
1272800	1273800	We can still keep all that shit
1273800	1275800	while eliminating the propaganda
1275800	1278800	and injustice that surrounds it.
1279800	1280800	Coda.
1281800	1284800	My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.
1284800	1286800	What if traps are gang?
1286800	1288800	What if no one can ever love you?
1288800	1290800	What if happiness is impossible?
1290800	1292800	What if everyone who compliments me is lying
1292800	1294800	so they can laugh at me later
1294800	1296800	when I delusionally feel good about themselves?
1296800	1298800	What if when you die you stay conscious
1298800	1299800	and then you just are...
1299800	1301800	What if I'm standing in an awkward way
1301800	1302800	and it looks weird?
1302800	1304800	What if Blanchard is right?
1304800	1306800	What are these horrible goddamn noises
1306800	1307800	coming out of my mouth?
1307800	1309800	Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain
1309800	1311800	and music is really great for that.
1311800	1313800	I've always liked classical music.
1313800	1315800	When I listened to Mozart or Mendelssohn
1315800	1317800	or even an amateur like Satie,
1317800	1320800	my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.
1320800	1323800	And I don't care what civilization the composer came from
1323800	1325800	or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.
1325800	1327800	And I don't want to know because I need this.
1327800	1330800	I need this feeling that makes me just want to
1330800	1331800	take a big...
