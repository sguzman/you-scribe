1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,020
Alright children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,280
How do I put this delicately?

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,120
Your humble hostess is a total les.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,620
Shame.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:35,020
You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse than just that.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:45,020
You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness, and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,920
And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be gay.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,420
Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:04,820
So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key, les-bicious behavior.

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,720
And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,520
So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend.

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,820
Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,620
Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is piping hot.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,720
For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi, I'm a super fucking bi.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,220
But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into the straight lifestyle.

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
This really started in 2018.

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,820
By that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman.

18
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,220
And we're going to circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle of things.

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,420
I'm like an epic poet.

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,820
Hey, how are you, gorge?

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:56,220
So, at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I didn't even say best friends, with a woman whom I'll call...

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,320
Joanne, light of my life.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,520
Can we get some melodramatic music, please?

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah, here we go.

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,720
You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,320
I want you to fully enjoy my pain.

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,620
So, my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,420
It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes,

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,620
and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,720
We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,820
And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds,

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,820
which is very unusual for me because I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,420
One reason we got so emotionally close is we're both trans.

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,420
And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with another trans woman

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,720
that I can't really have with anyone else.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,320
Oh, and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful,

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,620
which I did notice every time I looked at her.

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,320
And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,720
We'd get drunk and make out.

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,220
We'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle.

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,620
Straight girls do that, right?

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,620
Gal, pals.

43
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,920
I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,720
and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand,

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,120
and we walked down the street together holding hands.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,320
This is garbage and I want to die.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I hope you all know that I'm in agony.

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Later, we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink,

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,420
we'd run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,720
Ah, this is still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,620
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.

52
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,720
A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,320
They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,020
Gal, pals.

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,820
Just kill me.

56
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,520
Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home,

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,620
and they won't notice.

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,920
So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love.

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,520
So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time,

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,820
I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

61
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
So how could I possibly think that?

62
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,720
Well, the short answer is shame.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,220
Why is no one talking about the shame?

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,420
I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.

65
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,420
There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.

66
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,220
Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,320
There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription,

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,020
I'm a bronze star lesbian.

70
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,420
Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,620
I tried prayer.

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,220
I tried electric shocks.

74
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,220
All the classics, all the hits.

75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women,

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,020
you start to associate the two in your head.

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,720
So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,220
This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,220
So at some point the shame was just too much for me and it literally broke my brain.

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
I no longer wanted to be straight.

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,220
I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.

82
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Maybe a little by a little bit.

83
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,220
By that time I started dating men and I got into a serious long-term relationship with a man.

84
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,220
And at first I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself female friendships are just really intense.

85
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,220
That's probably why I feel so strongly.

86
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,220
And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that.

87
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,220
And, you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,220
So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.

89
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
And then two things happened.

90
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,220
First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

91
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Fuck my drag, right?

92
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,220
I think before that I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia

93
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,220
allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as I just have a thing for my straight best friend.

94
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Like, who doesn't?

95
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,220
But that's a very self-serving narrative because it quarantines your feelings inside the safety of unattainable fantasy

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,220
and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

97
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,220
Because that way it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just she's just not that into women.

98
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,220
But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.

99
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,220
And the jealousy hit me so hard I couldn't ignore it.

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,220
Second, around that same time Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
It was a long-distance friendship.

102
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,220
And about halfway through that visit I cracked.

103
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
One morning I woke up next to her.

104
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,220
And I looked at her pretty fucking face and I had the thought,

105
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,220
I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,220
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual biogirl to have about her gal pal.

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,220
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.

108
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Like, what the fuck is this? What am I feeling?

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,220
I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th century Italian opera.

110
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,220
So I confessed my feelings to Joanne and, love confession gone wrong, devastating.

111
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,220
But she did not reciprocate my feelings.

112
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Nurse, my pain is at a 10, I need more pills.

113
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,220
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah.

114
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,220
I'm sure we all know how that goes.

115
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,220
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,

116
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,220
I might have recovered.

117
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
But we couldn't keep away from each other.

118
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,220
She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me because

119
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,220
the truth is, we were never just gal pals.

120
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
And I was beyond reason.

121
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,220
Like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts.

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
That's how tragic this got. Those are great by the way.

123
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

124
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,220
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other,

125
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,220
and I just repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.

126
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,220
Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year

127
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,220
because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.

128
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,220
But rejection and a heartbreak are shameful in themselves and only made the situation worse.

129
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,220
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial until finally last October.

130
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,220
I got super fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.

131
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
Link in the description. Subscribe.

132
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,220
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a friendship break.

133
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Otherwise, I was never going to get over her.

134
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,220
So there was this combination of things, being politically cancelled by Twitter,

135
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,220
being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend,

136
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,220
which sent me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,220
And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Because depression brings your life to a standstill,

139
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,220
and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes feel outside yourself.

140
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,220
And with that comes a new perspective.

141
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,220
So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day

142
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,220
and binge watching Orange is the Bluest L word,

143
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,220
I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

144
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,220
And that gave me a new kind of clarity.

145
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,220
I looked back on the last couple years and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.

146
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:32,220
So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a gay, not clickbait.

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

148
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Shame.

149
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,220
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.

150
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Well that's my Eden.

151
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Candy flipping.

152
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220
I love it.

153
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.

154
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,220
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

155
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,220
First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

156
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Female friendships are just really intense.

157
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

158
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,220
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic attraction to men.

159
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,220
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

160
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,220
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again and I'll slide back into denial.

161
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,220
So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.

162
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.

163
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
She's a Libra.

164
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,220
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

165
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that.

166
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,220
Like it makes you grow breasts, at least in theory.

167
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
I just added progesterone.

168
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
We'll see if that does anything.

169
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,220
But the lesser-known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.

170
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:24,220
The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual because the libido I had known before was just gone.

171
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
But I'm very much not asexual.

172
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,220
It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,220
One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now, whomst I'm attracted to.

174
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way.

175
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,220
It sparks my interest, but it doesn't light my fire.

176
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,220
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

177
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

178
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,220
Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about.

179
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,220
But I think the concept it describes applies to me.

180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

181
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,220
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them as a friend.

182
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,220
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

183
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?

184
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
I know that's not how it works.

185
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
I have to play the field.

186
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

187
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

188
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
It's boring.

189
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
The build-up of desire.

190
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,220
That's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and shame.

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,220
I shouldn't, but I want to.

192
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

193
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,220
I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality is more common in women than men.

194
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,220
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.

195
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,220
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.

196
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.

197
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,220
And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

198
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,220
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality.

199
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards the beautiful people of any gender,

200
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
and that can be pretty intense in its own right.

201
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:24,220
I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating to me than looking at a beautiful man.

202
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Which can be moving in its own way, but it's more like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.

203
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,220
You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.

204
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,220
That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.

205
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I'd fuck it so hard.

206
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,220
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,

207
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,220
and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,220
There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.

209
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Like, I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms unfolding my smooth, fragile body.

210
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Or maybe it's Mark Freudian, the masculine man as Daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic power of the phallus,

211
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

212
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,220
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man

213
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,220
and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.

214
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,220
And I can find things I like about male bodies, like, they're very warm.

215
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,220
I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.

216
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,220
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head and she says,

217
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,220
but are you attracted to men, or do you just like being warm?

218
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
My attraction to women is very different.

219
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,220
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

220
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,220
This is going to destroy me.

221
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,220
You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.

222
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
I've never once been in pain over male beauty.

223
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,220
But around Joanne, once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,

224
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,220
there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be like,

225
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
don't even enter my line of sight right now.

226
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,220
You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

227
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,220
There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

228
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

229
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,220
And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

230
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,220
I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.

231
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,220
It's that they're interested in me.

232
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
And that's pretty interesting.

233
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,220
I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

234
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,220
You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.

235
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Fuck me up, King.

236
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
God, that's odd.

237
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,220
It gets me every time.

238
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,220
But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,

239
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,220
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

240
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,220
You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.

241
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,220
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

242
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,220
And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women

243
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,220
is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.

244
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,220
It's all very passive.

245
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,220
And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

246
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,220
I've taken a very submissive role.

247
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let them do things to me.

248
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,220
And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.

249
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,220
I like that feeling myself.

250
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,220
And I do genuinely enjoy taking on a more submissive role sometimes.

251
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,220
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

252
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,220
Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid confronting

253
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,220
what your desires actually are.

254
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
It's freedom from freedom.

255
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation

256
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,220
and ashamed of your transsexual body

257
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,220
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

258
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,220
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

259
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,220
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

260
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,220
by letting someone else take control

261
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,220
can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.

262
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,220
And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

263
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,220
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

264
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,220
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

265
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
isn't really that much more liberated.

266
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago

267
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
and totally identified with the fantasy.

268
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,220
And later, I thought that was evidence I had normative female desires.

269
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Never mind that I was identifying with the midlife crisis fantasies

270
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
of a repressed English housewife

271
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

272
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy.

273
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,220
I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

274
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
But what makes me different is that for me,

275
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,220
submission to a man was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.

276
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

277
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,220
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

278
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

279
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,220
straight women are ultimately attracted to men

280
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

281
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Or are they? Gay men certainly are.

282
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,220
And gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

283
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,220
But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh about male bodies and men in general.

284
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,220
Which, what is that about?

285
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,220
I just, I just do not understand straight women.

286
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
I don't think I ever will. And that's okay.

287
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,220
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment and move on with my lesbian life.

288
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Now, what I've been giving you so far is a retrospective analysis,

289
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,220
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

290
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,220
But you have to understand that when I was living through this,

291
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,220
I experienced it very differently, because I didn't have these insights.

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,220
So I wasn't thinking, oh I'm not really attracted to men,

293
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,220
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

294
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,220
so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.

295
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Now, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,

296
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
at least until Joanne ruined my life.

297
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,220
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

298
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,220
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

299
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,220
I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half,

300
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
who I had very genuine feelings for.

301
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Plot twist, story time.

302
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,220
So, my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.

303
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga Chad fantasy.

304
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,220
You know, he was very masculine, taller than me,

305
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,220
objectively attractive, very charming.

306
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Straight women used to tell me all the time they were jealous of me for being with him.

307
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
And obviously I loved that.

308
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,220
To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,

309
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,220
a sort of archetypal romantic lead who swept me off my feet

310
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,220
and fulfilled my sick fantasies of being a heterosexual woman.

311
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

312
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,220
but that once it came to actually dating, I realized I didn't like it.

313
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,220
But honestly, it's more complicated than that.

314
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him.

315
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,220
And I still think of him as the one genuine boy crush of my life.

316
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,220
When we started dating, it was really exciting.

317
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,220
I'd never had a boyfriend before, and he'd never been with a trans woman before.

318
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,220
And we had this, like, adorably heterosexual energy together,

319
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
like holding hands in the park.

320
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
It was cute!

321
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,220
This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a cad.

322
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
But he wasn't. He was great.

323
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
He took very good care of me.

324
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,220
He was never ashamed to be seen with me,

325
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,220
or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,

326
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,220
which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.

327
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,220
He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself.

328
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,220
And when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed.

329
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
And that meant a lot.

330
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220
So I really wanted this to work.

331
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.

332
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,220
And for a year or so, I thought it was working.

333
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

334
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
I missed him when he was gone.

335
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
I told him I loved him, and I meant it.

336
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
But what happened is, by the end of the first year,

337
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,220
the initial excitement ad died down.

338
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,220
And while Chad was ready to keep escalating the relationship,

339
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,220
I was realizing that something was very seriously, emotionally wrong on my end.

340
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
There was something missing.

341
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,220
And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,

342
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,220
I was like, there's that missing feeling.

343
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,220
And I started to understand what my problem was.

344
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram

345
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
an aloof picture of me with the caption,

346
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,220
do I actually like men or do I just like attention?

347
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
And I didn't mean anything serious by that.

348
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
I was just joking around.

349
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
You know, you can post something like that

350
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

351
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
yeah, fuck men.

352
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
What is their damage?

353
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Well, they're stuck dating men. That's their damage.

354
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
But a few people left comments saying,

355
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,220
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

356
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
You should make a video about comphet.

357
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,220
And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?

358
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,220
So I Googled it and I learned that comphet is short for compulsory heterosexuality.

359
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality is socially required of women.

360
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,220
And it's so bound up with the conventional idea of what it even means to be a woman

361
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,220
that gay women often mistakenly believe for years that they're attracted to men.

362
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,220
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

363
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,220
And I'm reading through this post like, oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

364
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head that says I must really be het

365
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
even when I'm in love with a woman.

366
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Quote, you have every reason to be happy in your relationship with a man,

367
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
but you just aren't.

368
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Everything is going really well, but something is missing and you can't figure out what.

369
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,220
So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

370
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,220
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.

371
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,220
And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual taking this quiz like, it's true.

372
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Samantha was right.

373
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
I am a total lass.

374
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,220
All the cis gay people watching this video probably want to kill me right now

375
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,220
because y'all figured this shit out in high school and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

376
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
it's just, I just, I just can't.

377
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?

378
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Is it all right with you, the gays?

379
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,220
So to be honest, I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.

380
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Like for a long time, I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.

381
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,220
But after a lot of introspection, I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

382
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,220
of private happiness and fulfillment.

383
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,220
It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.

384
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,220
Like, can you imagine if I got married to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding

385
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,220
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

386
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

387
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
I'd be super heck and valid, uwu.

388
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
But I don't actually want to be married.

389
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I want to get married.

390
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
I want to have a wedding.

391
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.

392
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
I want attention, okay?

393
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Please pay attention to me.

394
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:22,220
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy, but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

395
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,220
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality.

396
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Because there's a level of gender instability and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.

397
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,220
And until recently, I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.

398
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

399
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,220
and I think I needed to go through the more one-on-one straight girl experience

400
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

401
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:53,220
I still have a hard time imagining a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.

402
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,220
And I think that's partly because good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.

403
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,220
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama from 15 years ago,

404
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
which I do like, and I like the new one too.

405
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,220
But after that, the runner-up is, I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

406
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,220
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whom we ship.

407
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Well, I don't ship them because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush on Kacha's Amalochkava.

408
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Don't laugh at me. She's smart. She's funny. She's beautiful.

409
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

410
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Sure, some haters and losers will probably try to convince me that Kacha is in fact a homosexual man posing as a woman.

411
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,220
But you know what? This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life, and I don't need this right now.

412
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,220
I need to be touched by a real woman. I'm losing my goddamn mind.

413
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,220
It's so deeply embedded in our culture that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.

414
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:56,220
And it's not just Disney movies, like it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology, German fairy tales, Victorian novels.

415
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,220
The whole weight of cultural history is telling you that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.

416
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,220
And if you're already super dysphoric and insecure about your gender, then to reject that possibility?

417
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,220
Ah, it hurts. It hurts so bad.

418
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:18,220
But whenever I think about having a long-term partner, you know, not the wedding day, but the one thousandth morning waking up together,

419
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:29,220
I can only imagine her being a woman. My brain wants a good man to take care of me, but my heart wants a high maintenance diva to ruin my life.

420
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,220
And once I knew that for sure, I thought I would be wrong to stay with Chad.

421
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,220
And this man was like my hinge. He was holding me together.

422
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:51,220
But last December, I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian, which at least is a good reason.

423
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,220
I'm having a hard time, you guys. Leave your pity in the comments.

424
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,220
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too. I feel like shit.

425
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,220
I think it's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me. I could really use a couple Advil on a vodka tonic.

426
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,220
I think I might throw some clothes on, too. Where's that snake?

427
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,220
I already missed my heterosexual nails.

428
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I know these are too long to be gay, but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.

429
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Getting my acrylics removed? Traumatizing. I feel like I'm detransitioning.

430
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,220
One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure with acrylics on eight fingers.

431
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon and say,

432
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Hi, I'm a homosexual, please. I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.

433
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Shame. Let's talk about the shame. Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women, though.

434
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Two of those women later turned out to be trans, so I guess we had some way of finding each other.

435
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,220
An attraction to women was never really a problem for me before the transgendering,

436
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,220
because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle where men are supposed to be attracted to women.

437
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,220
Crazy, I know. Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty.

438
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.

439
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,220
And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around my being, at the time, a gender non-conforming man,

440
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:27,220
which, in my early YouTube videos, I dealt with by caricaturing myself and basically leaning into the public humiliation.

441
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
One of my classic techniques.

442
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,220
But now, my shame is centered around my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.

443
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:44,220
And the most glaring aspects of that failure are my male past, my sexual orientation, and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.

444
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Yeah, killing all those people was not my most feminine moment, but I was having a bad skin day.

445
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,220
What was I supposed to do?

446
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,220
So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.

447
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

448
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,220
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

449
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,220
And whatever one times two is, I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.

450
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Ugh.

451
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:16,220
And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.

452
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
Why is no one talking about the shame?

453
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

454
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
But we shouldn't be.

455
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

456
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:33,220
I grew up in a media era when trans women were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities who deserve the violence they bring upon themselves by existing.

457
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:47,220
And I started my transition in the first year of the Trump administration when there's been constant vilification of trans people in the press, invading women's bathrooms, forcing our insanity on children, destroying western civilization with our authoritarian pronouns.

458
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,220
It's hard to express just the daily humiliation of being a trans woman under these conditions.

459
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,220
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you like my laser technician recently told me,

460
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,220
you must be very courageous to transition because that is not socially acceptable.

461
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,220
And then she went back to blasting laser beams into my asshole.

462
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,220
And then there's the internet where, you know, I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.

463
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,220
And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet are a wretched, wretched horde of bigoted attack helicopters.

464
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,220
The whole point of this channel is I try to talk sense to these people.

465
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:25,220
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives and I try to empathize with their point of view and provide a rational response.

466
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,220
But a side effect of all that research is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self loathing.

467
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,220
It seeped into my brain and become a part of me.

468
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,220
And this lifelong build up of shame has become a wound at the heart of my existence.

469
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,220
And all I can really do about it is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

470
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,220
I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.

471
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
I am resplendent trash.

472
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I am couture trash.

473
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,220
And I just bought a mid-century gold trimmed Venetian blown glass decanter.

474
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Which helps me forget the shame and self loathing that plagues my every moment.

475
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

476
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,220
when I've already come out as trans, which seems like a bigger deal.

477
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,220
To paraphrase what some people have told me, you're already a transgendered and a freak's a freak.

478
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
So who cares what kind of freak?

479
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Well first of all, I would like to propose a sociological theory.

480
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Tiffany's Law. All freaks have a deep psychological need to feel superior to a different type of freak.

481
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,220
And trans lesbians are pretty close to the bottom of that packing order.

482
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Who's even left for me to feel superior to, the goddamn Belgians?

483
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Fuck this waffle.

484
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me because I did it incrementally over like eight years.

485
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,220
At first I was like, well, I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.

486
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup.

487
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,220
I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.

488
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,220
And then I realized I'm not a man at all and I identified as non-binary.

489
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Then I started taking hormones.

490
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,220
In two months on HRT I woke up one day and said, it's fine. I am literally a woman.

491
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,220
So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman, that was actually a step up

492
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,220
in terms of social acceptability from where I was before.

493
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220
When I was a genderqueer gender fuck, I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.

494
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Whereas when I started transitioning to female, even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,

495
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:29,220
there was at least a goal in mind, some possible future where I could lead a normal-ish life as a woman.

496
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,220
So the moment I started identifying as a woman was the moment the comphette voice entered my head.

497
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before, but maybe I'm attracted to them now.

498
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
I'm a woman, right?

499
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,220
I've always been a little bi-curious and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.

500
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
Maybe I can make this work.

501
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,220
Let's choose some boys to be attracted to and get started on this.

502
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.

503
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,220
My way of explaining it to myself was, I guess hormones just magically changed my sexual orientation

504
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,220
to the socially acceptable one. That's zebra-freaking-crazy.

505
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,220
Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.

506
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,220
God, there's so much pressure on trans women to be extremely gender-conforming.

507
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,220
And even more so if you're a representative of the community.

508
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,220
You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife or else cis people are going to throw us all in camps.

509
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,220
And early in my transition, I kind of worshipped straight trans women.

510
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Like, I looked up to them and I wanted to be just like them.

511
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Now back then there were a handful of trans lesbians on YouTube trying to make the case to the masses

512
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,220
that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.

513
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,220
But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.

514
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I watched those women get eaten alive.

515
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,220
And as a result of my witnessing that at a super-freaking-vulnerable moment for me,

516
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I internalized the message that a trans lesbian is just not an okay thing to be

517
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,220
if you want to be tolerated or respected by anybody other than a handful of communists.

518
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,220
So I began my transition with essentially no role model of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.

519
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,220
And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia are harsher on gay trans women

520
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
than they are on straight trans women.

521
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,220
They could take this trope that trans women are men who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.

522
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,220
In response to that, it feels really good to be able to say,

523
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I'm not even attracted to women, I'm just a petite heterosexual biogirl,

524
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,220
I'm surely not some kind of six-foot monster who likes women.

525
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Shame. Shame.

526
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
It does make me feel like a monster sometimes.

527
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Like a mutant that has no place in society.

528
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,220
And this shame has actually made it more difficult for me to accept that I'm a gay woman

529
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,220
than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.

530
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,220
It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain where I traded my sexual orientation for my gender identity.

531
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,220
So I finally transitioned only to spend the next couple years living with a different kind of denial.

532
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,220
And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.

533
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:54,220
This is painful and incriminating to admit, but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.

534
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust toward things I saw trans lesbians doing.

535
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,220
Like this anime catgirl shit which clearly gets under my skin.

536
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,220
And not just because these people have been harassing me for three years.

537
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,

538
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,220
this queasy combination of the hypersexual and the infantile.

539
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,220
I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian cum slut.

540
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Meow meow girl dick, meow meow.

541
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Here's the 97th picture of my own legs and thigh-hide stripey socks oo-woo.

542
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
What is that about?

543
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Is this how women act?

544
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
Sis people are gonna see this.

545
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,220
They're not gonna let us into women's spaces if we act like that.

546
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings.

547
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,220
But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,

548
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,220
guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

549
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,220
And if I was a different type of YouTuber, I could have turned this into content.

550
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,220
At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,

551
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,220
why are trans lesbians so cringey?

552
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,220
They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.

553
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
And that's the real darkness, isn't it?

554
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,220
Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself like an honest American.

555
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,220
No, just sitting there in absurd denial of who you are as a person,

556
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,220
disparaging your own repressed identity to anyone who will listen.

557
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
And I'm ashamed of that too.

558
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
I'm ashamed I sunk that low.

559
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,220
But all you can do is try to get better.

560
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
And I'm trying to get better.

561
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
I've broken free of the denial.

562
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
And now I have to break free of the shame.

563
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,220
Because shame is literally ruining my life.

564
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,220
I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame.

565
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,220
And she said, I might want to mention that one of the reasons she didn't want to be with me

566
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,220
is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.

567
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
She said she feels like relationships between trans women

568
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,220
are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society with no attempt to integrate.

569
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,220
These are very painful words to hear from the woman you're in love with.

570
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,220
But I understand why she feels that way.

571
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.

572
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,220
But I can't be the hinge that connects her to mainstream society.

573
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
And it's maddening to me that she feels that way

574
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,220
because I would have chosen her over every cis woman in the world.

575
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,220
But I'm just another worthless freak without the authority of society behind me.

576
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
So my love doesn't count.

577
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Shame.

578
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
It poisons the soul.

579
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,220
You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,

580
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,220
is such a basic part of your humanity.

581
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,220
And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.

582
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.

583
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,220
It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.

584
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,220
It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.

585
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,220
And living in that state of mind is garbage.

586
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
It's basically hell.

587
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
Even after I realized my sexuality,

588
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,220
I considered just shoving that shit back down, never coming out.

589
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
I have all these fears about it.

590
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.

591
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I'm worried cis women or straight women I'm friends with will get weird about it.

592
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I'm worried I'll die a lonely useless lesbian,

593
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,220
in which case I should have just married a man,

594
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,220
because at least then there'd be someone to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.

595
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,220
I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.

596
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,220
Although, I mean, love you boys,

597
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,220
and please keep the attention coming because I need all the validation I can get right now,

598
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
but I will be fine without you.

599
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,220
And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?

600
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,220
I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,

601
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,220
just sacrificing my sexual orientation to regain that safe,

602
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,220
comfortable, shameless feeling I used to have when walking down the street holding Chad's hand,

603
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,220
feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.

604
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,220
But if I don't deal with this now and work towards accepting myself,

605
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,220
then I'm just going to be in the same situation in 10 years,

606
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,220
when I'm 41 years old and married to a man and having these same feelings.

607
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,220
So it's time for this to stop,

608
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,220
because literally the only good thing about being gay

609
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
is doing gay shit.

610
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,

611
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,220
no one's going to want to do gay shit with me.

612
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,220
As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,

613
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,220
how in the hell are you going to prop up your narcissistic delusions?

614
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Look, I'm trying to stay positive.

615
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,220
Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now, but just you wait.

616
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
We all know how trends work.

617
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,220
In 10 years, being a trans lesbian will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,

618
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
and all the people who talk shit now will forget they ever said a word.

619
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
That's right.

620
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,220
Even the straight trans girls will be making out with each other just for the clout.

621
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Like, we can be lesbians too.

622
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,220
We are aji.

623
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Oh, it's going to be Madonna and Britney at the 2003 VMAs all over again.

624
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Mark my words.

625
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,220
And among cis lesbians, oh, it will actually be a sign of prestige to have a trap waifu.

626
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,220
I can dream, right?

627
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,220
Once you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?

628
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
I can't believe it.

629
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,220
I can't believe it.

630
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,220
I can't believe it.

631
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
I can't believe it.

632
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
I can't believe it.

633
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
I can't believe it.

634
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
I can't believe it.

635
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
I can't believe it.

636
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
I can't believe it.

637
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,220
I can't believe it.

638
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,220
