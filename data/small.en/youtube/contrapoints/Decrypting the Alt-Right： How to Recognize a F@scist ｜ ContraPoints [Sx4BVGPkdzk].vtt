00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
You will not replace us, you will not replace us, you will not replace us.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
More than soil, more than soil, more than soil.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Do they have any semblance of guilt?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
A local World War II veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
He believes what happened.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
One, people of European heritage ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as the white race,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Two, Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and non-white immigration,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Three, the only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Now, as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
so what is it that's attracting people to fascism?

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure that out.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Who are you?

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
They could say, I'm a Roman.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm a Saxon.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm a Dane.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Good news, boys.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
You no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA,

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
and defend Voltaire, an adorable blonde children against black civil rights.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
You know, just like the Vikings did.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
We're often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German, or any European nationality,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Democracy.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Freedom.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Tolerance.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Multiculturalism.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
So, life is basically sad.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
And in capitalist society, that sadness is a sense of isolation,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990's collector's edition

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Beersdine's Until You Die.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
a homeland for your people,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
and as far into the future.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling other human beings as property.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white ethnostate is just nonsense.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
is in no way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become the same thing.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt propaganda.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
In the wake of the disastrous Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
the Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
At least two of their major websites were shut down,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Confederate monuments were removed all over the country,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
None of this means fascists will go away,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
it just means they'll have to be more subtle and indirect.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Shortly after the Charlottesville rally,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared on poll,

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of Japanese nymphettes.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away is really stupid.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the Overton window to the right,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average white person.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And the way to do that is...

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
and holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
This instantly makes the average person hate you.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental overt goals.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
and prioritizes white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning against you.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
Leftists will recognize dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
So at first glance, this seems like a really silly juvenile post that references Dragon Ball Z.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to long-term goals

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
that I wish were more common on the left.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
But of course the strategy described here isn't new.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in order to appeal to racists.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
You start out in 1954 by saying, by 1968, you can't say that hurts you backfires.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
So you say stuff like force busing states rights and all that stuff.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these things that you're talking about a totally economic things.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to hear dog whistles.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism, and white supremacy.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
At least when talking to you, a non-fascist.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Fascists are more likely to gain traction and are hence more dangerous when they use subtler tactics.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use to code their ideas

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Strategy one, outright denial. Never reveal your power level.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking points,

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism should be worth absolutely nothing to you

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
and shouldn't even enter into your consideration of whether they're a fascist.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Strategy two, euphemism.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
Of course I'm not a fascist. I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve Western values.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations that develop around the names of their movements

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
whenever people figure out what they really are.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
So they insist they are Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
they'll shift their terminology again and start telling you,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
or whatever the next thing is. But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist,

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
they'll talk about preserving Western civilization or Western culture instead.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
they'll talk instead about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and leave it to the audience to catch the color-coding on their own.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Strategy three, pedantry.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
It's absurd to call me a Nazi. The German National Socialist Party has an existence since 1945.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
and also to bond you down in a petty, terminological dispute.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led you to call them a Nazi in the first place.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think that whites are superior to other races.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
I simply think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest IQs,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
he's, if anything, an Asian supremacist.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
instead of talking about the fact that the main goal of the politics he supports

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
is the political and social supremacy of white people over all other Americans and Europeans.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
In other words, white supremacy.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Strategy four, secret symbols.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
or like the swastika itself,

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with fascism

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
or at least have some other meaning, such as the Athala rune or the Iron Cross.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod at each other,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So it doesn't matter what the symbols are.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
In fact, it's important that the symbols constantly change so that normies don't catch on.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Maybe it'll be this.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Or this.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to identify themselves.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try to point those symbols out,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the fascists can always say,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Is there anything they don't think is racist?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
The poor centrists.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
They're so afraid that Antifa's gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
or because of the emoji they use.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political rallies,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh God, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
And the fascists whose free speech you defend so often are trying to drum up exactly the sentiments

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
that make the police dangerous to black people

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
and that make it dangerous for queer people to be themselves in public.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
So I hope that's something you think about.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
or that anyone who uses it is racist.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
And in fact, it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink and nudge.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
sets the stage for, strategy five,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
camaraderie of the accused.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
The left accuses everyone of racism.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
They think all white people are Nazis.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
especially online.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
and some of them do throw the label at centrists or liberals.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
History shows that happens regardless.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But it can accelerate the process,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
lending some plausibility to the fear that moderate centrists have

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
that anti-fascists will come after the next.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
and use it to pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
Strategy six, irony, jokes, satire, and memes.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Of course I wasn't actually being racist.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It was just an edgy meme.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Can anyone take a joke anymore

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
or will the anti-fascists violently attack you over humor now too?

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
and then when called out, you mock your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Before I realized I was transgender,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
I used to jump at any opportunity to cross-dress ironically.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So when you see people joking about being Nazis,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
they could just be joking,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
or they could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
that just happens to use a Nazi battle flag.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
who are unable or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Kekistan became the perfect pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
including the ones who led the rally

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
for an edgy shit-poster hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Pfft. Those normie fools. It's just a joke.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Strategy 7. Shifting blame.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
like Black Lives Matter or Antifa?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
This is essentially just a two-quo-quay fallacy,

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
especially heinous because of the equivocation between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
and between white nationalism and Black civil rights.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against Black people

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Shortly after the Charlottesville incident,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
our proto-fascist president called out Antifa in the alt-left,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
and establish the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
Both sides rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists,

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
and helps to shift the center of acceptable discourse in their direction.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Strategy 8. Incrementalism.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
but we do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
often aimed at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
as a defense of white people and white culture.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
The fascist's long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
which at some point will require massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
but of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration,

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
something they'll try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
by emphasizing the danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
they can later turn that energy against the non-white people who are already here.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Strategy 9. The Free Speech Defense.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
You may not agree with what I say,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble as anyone else.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and intimidate,

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies or by pressuring platforms not to host fascists.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value of free speech.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced you are.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
They only value the race, the people, the nation.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Their long-term goal is a society where there is no room for anyone who isn't white,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
or even anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
but remember, you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
They do not care about diversity of opinions.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
and to garner sympathy from centrists.

17:40.000 --> 18:04.000
Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children who don't get sexual innuendo.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy to exploit.

18:23.000 --> 18:31.000
Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking points without intending to or realizing it.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate fascist memes,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
then isn't just about everyone suspect.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, that's what they want you to think.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-light

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
or if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Likewise, it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-light but not an outright fascist

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and a fascist who is concealing their power level.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
The other day, the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This is the future ACLU members want.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And for a second I was like, what the fuck?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
But of course it's unintentional, it's the ACLU.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Not make a quick statement.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yes, I have become crazy.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
is the psychological consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and communicating in code.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And it's the intentional consequence of that.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist psychological arsenal.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
So, how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
And I admit that I am pretty frustrated with you right now, obviously.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better at resisting fascism.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
So don't feel guilty for falling for them, just try to get better at resisting.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
If you care about even one person of color or queer person or immigrant,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
stand up for that person by opposing the alright and its allies.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Do not give them a platform. Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
but they do not have a right to a megaphone and you should not be giving them one.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
everyone expressing their ideas peacefully.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
But to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Now if you're just an average person without a big platform,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
then you actually can debate and you should be debating.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Argue with your family. Argue with your coworkers.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Let them know that you don't agree. Make them listen to a different perspective.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
you have to get out now.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
It's not too late, society will forgive you.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate,

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
an organization founded by a former neo-Nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And as for all you lefties, naz drovia.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Keep up the good fight, comrades.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Thanks for watching.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Thanks for watching.
