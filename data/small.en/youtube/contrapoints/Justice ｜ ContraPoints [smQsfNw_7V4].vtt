WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
All right, so what are we looking at?

00:11.520 --> 00:15.400
What new hell have we sunk to now here in the United States of-

00:15.400 --> 00:18.360
They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine and you're not really

00:18.360 --> 00:21.520
fine but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.

00:21.520 --> 00:27.640
Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter thin blue line punisher

00:27.640 --> 00:29.480
skull on the hood.

00:29.480 --> 00:35.440
Um, there's a lot to unpack here but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
the skull.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.040
The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.160
The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess

00:45.160 --> 00:47.640
because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Disappointing.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.520
Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him

00:52.520 --> 00:56.480
an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
Nya.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.840
I did watch a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher and as research for this

01:00.840 --> 01:06.920
video I did watch all of them and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where

01:06.920 --> 01:11.480
Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass his Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty

01:11.480 --> 01:15.680
in the sewers worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.680
You know, just like the police do.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.720
Hi, I'm Nyaataly, creator of Catra Points.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.400
And no, I'm not a cat girl.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.520
I'm a cat woman.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.120
I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.160
Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite heterosexual body.

01:34.160 --> 01:42.720
I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and...

01:42.720 --> 01:45.160
As a woman with values.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.600
Just kidding, I'm trash.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.000
Let's talk about justice, Ulu.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.640
Justice is when I get lots of headpats, nyaaa.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.000
The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family but once

01:57.000 --> 02:01.200
he gets revenge he can't stop killing because it's the only thing that gives meaning to

02:01.200 --> 02:05.080
his shitty life so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.320
But no matter how many bad guys he kills it's never enough because new criminals just come

02:10.320 --> 02:13.280
along and take the place of the old ones.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.040
It's like a cycle where violence gets violence and nothing ever really changes.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.240
It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
and punishment.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
But you know what?

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
Let's not overthink this.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.200
Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
Great.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
Perfect.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
Are we the baddies?

02:32.200 --> 02:38.640
Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, anti-phasympathizing, big government

02:38.640 --> 02:44.600
anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte criticizing the police even though

02:44.600 --> 02:47.760
I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.280
And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.560
This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.240
There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose

02:59.240 --> 03:01.020
of the chemical you're addicted to.

03:01.020 --> 03:06.560
They tried to make me get a rehab, I said, meow, meow, meow.

03:06.560 --> 03:12.000
But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free

03:12.000 --> 03:13.960
marketplace of ideas gorge.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.200
And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because

03:18.200 --> 03:20.240
I happen to enjoy headpats.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.280
As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher

03:25.280 --> 03:27.200
king or a peasant nave.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
Or a neko-mimi.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.200
Ah, kawaii dates.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.560
This is problematic.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.640
Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.300
This is beyond cringe.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.680
This is cursed children, cursed.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.880
So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but that just proves the

03:43.880 --> 03:47.240
point I'm making, so maybe you should hear meow, meow.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.560
I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared

03:51.560 --> 03:55.480
on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.

03:55.480 --> 04:01.000
And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice is taken

04:01.000 --> 04:06.320
into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.840
All of this raises a lot of questions.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.380
Like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?

04:12.380 --> 04:14.380
Who should impose these consequences?

04:14.380 --> 04:16.060
And under what circumstances?

04:16.060 --> 04:17.460
And for what purpose?

04:17.460 --> 04:20.980
If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place?

04:20.980 --> 04:22.480
Oh my god, these contacts.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.100
I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.100
Ridiculous.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.580
Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice, Socrates?

04:30.580 --> 04:34.820
It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years with no conclusive

04:34.820 --> 04:35.820
answers.

04:36.820 --> 04:41.540
I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers

04:41.540 --> 04:42.540
were dummies.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.540
And I am very smart.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.540
Nyah.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.540
Ra-ra-raspoutine.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.540
One.

04:47.540 --> 04:48.540
Revenge.

04:48.540 --> 04:54.720
The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull

04:54.720 --> 05:00.260
he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.

05:00.260 --> 05:04.500
The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.360
This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment

05:11.360 --> 05:12.860
in proportion to their crime.

05:12.860 --> 05:17.780
It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in

05:17.780 --> 05:21.440
our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.

05:21.440 --> 05:26.180
Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it

05:26.180 --> 05:28.160
serves an evolutionary function.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.660
If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas and you don't get revenge, then

05:32.660 --> 05:35.700
other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.340
But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend

05:40.340 --> 05:45.300
pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that

05:45.300 --> 05:48.260
it is not profitable to mess with you.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.900
So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.

05:51.900 --> 05:56.100
And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is

05:56.100 --> 06:02.000
strong and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when

06:02.000 --> 06:04.640
justice of this kind is served.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.640
So of course, there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.360
For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served with one and a half

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
million subscribers.

06:15.360 --> 06:21.320
I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves

06:21.320 --> 06:25.640
stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.560
And all this celebrated under the heading police justice.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.920
In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community

06:33.920 --> 06:37.320
was now with 20% more police brutality.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.920
Um, fun fact?

06:39.920 --> 06:41.320
This ain't it, chief.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
Period.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.320
Full stop.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
That's the tweet.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.480
Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping

06:48.480 --> 06:50.280
an eye on these people.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.440
Here's a typical justice served post.

06:52.440 --> 07:00.280
One sets P E D O husband on a fire after catching him R A P E seven year old daughter

07:00.280 --> 07:03.920
titled this man got what he deserved.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.960
Instant regret.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
Predator exposed.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.320
To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was going to be wearing

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
cattiers.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.960
I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed

07:14.960 --> 07:21.040
like a aging bargain bin Bill Delphine impersonator.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.240
Well, dress for the job you want.

07:23.240 --> 07:27.480
I mean, whom's to amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
right?

07:28.480 --> 07:30.720
Let's look at the comments on that post though.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.400
Let's read the room.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.400
She's a hero in my opinion, should have had it live on television.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.640
Give her a medal.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
Give her two medals.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.600
So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but you know, there's always a couple

07:43.600 --> 07:49.200
buzz kills in there whining as usual about, Oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning

07:49.200 --> 07:51.960
people alive with no due process and no evidence.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.400
Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.280
But those people get shouted down pretty fast.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.600
They get called pedo simps.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
Pedo simp.

08:02.600 --> 08:07.720
So justice served as a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared

08:07.720 --> 08:09.960
love of extra judicial violence.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.040
But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.480
On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one

08:18.480 --> 08:22.280
commenter says, that's a justice boner for me.

08:22.280 --> 08:29.120
I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me and kick the life out of them.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
Criminal fail.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.760
Prank gone wrong.

08:31.760 --> 08:39.160
So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off putting

08:39.160 --> 08:40.560
to some people.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.560
As one disgruntled former justice serve subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos

08:45.560 --> 08:47.760
of assholes getting their comeuppance.

08:47.840 --> 08:53.520
Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.120
Everything is black and white with them.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.540
If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving them

08:59.540 --> 09:02.840
a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.

09:02.840 --> 09:03.840
Unsubscribed.

09:03.840 --> 09:09.200
But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
comeuppance.

09:10.200 --> 09:15.440
I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.360
There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games, win stupid

09:20.360 --> 09:28.200
prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced

09:28.200 --> 09:35.160
to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people

09:35.160 --> 09:40.360
getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right wing feel

09:40.360 --> 09:41.360
to it.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.520
Like to police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes shotgun

09:47.520 --> 09:51.520
blasts to the balls, Arizona.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
Just Arizona.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
What more is there to say?

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Arizona.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
Justice served.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.520
Punished.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.960
It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're going

10:00.960 --> 10:04.600
to kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this

10:04.600 --> 10:07.920
longing for retribution is distinctively right wing.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.560
Left wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.360
Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.

10:18.360 --> 10:23.520
Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?

10:23.520 --> 10:24.520
Karma.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.480
And she got her husband fired.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.880
Dumb bitch really should have minded her business, love to see it.

10:29.880 --> 10:35.440
She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in

10:35.440 --> 10:38.520
jail for at least six months.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.520
Firing them was not enough.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.680
Life in prison.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.600
Life in prison.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.720
An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his

10:51.720 --> 10:56.200
power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced

10:56.200 --> 11:01.440
to serve 263 years in prison.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.840
He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.

11:04.840 --> 11:11.680
And of course there's the much savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.640
Let's watch it now.

11:13.640 --> 11:20.680
Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.400
It's Pepe's become kind of assembled.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.040
That was informative, but let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people

11:31.040 --> 11:37.640
just enjoyed watching an NAZI get what he deserved.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.640
Justice served.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.640
Punished.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.640
Smashing.

11:40.640 --> 11:46.280
Very happy they found who you will remember to smash subscribe.

11:46.280 --> 11:52.400
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically

11:52.400 --> 11:57.080
a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.

11:57.080 --> 12:03.160
The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing

12:03.160 --> 12:06.120
the suffering of someone who deserves it.

12:06.120 --> 12:10.760
Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.

12:10.760 --> 12:15.480
The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and

12:15.480 --> 12:17.760
someone who's hiding bodies in the crawl space.

12:17.760 --> 12:22.040
It puts the lotion on its skin, Mia.

12:22.040 --> 12:27.800
But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.280
It's why we love stories about revenge.

12:30.280 --> 12:40.640
Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.080
Revenge is such a popular plotline because it's easy for people to identify with a

12:45.080 --> 12:50.600
revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles

12:50.600 --> 12:51.680
of violence.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.960
This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey by Homer.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.960
I stole this copy from my high school, and I stole this copy from my college.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.640
I still just read the sparknotes.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
Well let's read it now.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.480
See, I knew this would be useful someday.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.260
God, he's such a fuckboy.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.320
What does Athena see in this man?

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
Must be really odd.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.440
Okay, I'm ready for my book report.

13:13.440 --> 13:18.480
So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to

13:18.480 --> 13:25.960
the island of Ithaca after, um, okay, so in the prequel, Odysseus' shitty friend Menelaus

13:25.960 --> 13:30.800
throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually

13:30.800 --> 13:31.800
attracted to.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.800
How dare she?

13:32.800 --> 13:38.120
So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would

13:38.120 --> 13:41.120
do and blowing off some steam at femboy's symposium.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.520
Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of

13:45.520 --> 13:50.920
men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.

13:50.920 --> 13:55.960
So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors

13:55.960 --> 14:02.560
as payback, and then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and

14:02.560 --> 14:04.120
he has them all hanged.

14:04.120 --> 14:09.520
And this one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose

14:09.520 --> 14:14.520
and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.960
And reading this, I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?

14:19.960 --> 14:24.400
Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?

14:24.400 --> 14:28.080
I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kind of kills it for me.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.080
I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause

14:32.080 --> 14:35.520
men love hearing about assholes, that's why they watch my channel.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.920
But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.

14:39.920 --> 14:46.440
The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors, and to his, uh, his slaves.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.440
Yikes.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.440
Disappointing.

14:48.440 --> 14:53.080
Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves, it isn't a good look.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.280
Wow, this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.600
Oh my god, this contact is fully horizontal.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.440
This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts, fuck this.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.160
It just seems disproportionate, you know?

15:04.160 --> 15:08.200
Like it's not even eye for an eye, because the suitors didn't kill anyone, they were

15:08.200 --> 15:10.640
basically just rude to Odysseus.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.840
But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.

15:13.840 --> 15:18.920
They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it, but

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
whatever will play along.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.680
So that was an affront to Odysseus' honor.

15:22.680 --> 15:28.400
And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.840
Because this was a pre-legal society.

15:30.840 --> 15:36.200
No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck 12.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.980
So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people

15:40.980 --> 15:45.340
from stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing

15:45.340 --> 15:47.120
causing them to murder each other.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.800
Because back then honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage

15:50.800 --> 15:51.800
of.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.440
If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themself into your house and

15:55.440 --> 16:00.320
drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, cause

16:00.320 --> 16:02.240
then people will walk all over you.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.920
So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person

16:06.920 --> 16:08.600
who is not to be messed with.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.080
It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.840
Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.240
It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.

16:20.240 --> 16:25.920
We call it toxic masculinity now, because in our society it's destructive and dysfunctional.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.440
We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.960
As society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.800
I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.520
Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Fenboy's Symposium.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.520
Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.

16:44.520 --> 16:49.000
But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not

16:49.000 --> 16:54.800
an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve

16:54.800 --> 17:01.120
conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.

17:01.120 --> 17:06.360
It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.

17:06.360 --> 17:10.280
And the poison is vengeance, just as served.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.720
So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.

17:14.720 --> 17:19.920
The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first

17:19.920 --> 17:22.960
paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.760
I am very smart, meow.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.800
But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.600
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?

17:34.600 --> 17:39.440
If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try

17:39.440 --> 17:41.360
to get revenge by killing you.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.360
It's a cycle.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.200
A cycle of smashing.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.440
At the end of The Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together

17:48.440 --> 17:51.280
and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.040
And literally the last thing that happens in The Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,

17:55.040 --> 18:01.640
who has an inexplicable lady boner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by just making the

18:01.640 --> 18:04.720
families forget that Odysseus killed their children.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.600
So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence.

18:08.600 --> 18:13.560
But in reality, that doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades

18:13.560 --> 18:14.960
or even centuries.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.500
In Albania, there's an ancient code called the canon, which requires a family to commit

18:19.500 --> 18:23.580
murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.620
Life for life, blood for blood.

18:25.620 --> 18:30.380
This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,

18:30.380 --> 18:33.940
and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of Northern Albania.

18:33.940 --> 18:38.260
There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the

18:38.260 --> 18:42.580
rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,

18:42.580 --> 18:43.580
they'll be murdered.

18:43.580 --> 18:48.620
Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed

18:48.620 --> 18:52.460
to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.340
These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange

18:56.340 --> 18:57.740
for getting to live as men.

18:57.740 --> 19:01.940
There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially

19:01.940 --> 19:06.480
recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name Uwu, act as head

19:06.480 --> 19:10.900
of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of

19:10.900 --> 19:11.900
a man.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.940
Extremely happy trans sounds, Uwu.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.900
I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have

19:17.900 --> 19:22.700
been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to

19:22.700 --> 19:24.300
support trans rights.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.980
No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.580
Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.580
Most were compelled to-

19:30.580 --> 19:31.580
Yeah, I know that, sweaty.

19:31.580 --> 19:32.940
It was just a joke, okay?

19:32.940 --> 19:33.940
Calm down.

19:33.940 --> 19:39.340
Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,

19:39.340 --> 19:40.340
religions.

19:40.340 --> 19:44.700
I'm worried if I give a real example, I'll be cancelled for seeming neutral about a conflict

19:44.700 --> 19:46.740
where I'm supposed to take a side.

19:46.740 --> 19:54.180
So, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that the cat girls bomb the dog girls,

19:54.180 --> 19:58.860
and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that cycle repeats for a few decades.

19:58.860 --> 20:03.380
And by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against

20:03.380 --> 20:07.300
each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.940
Extremely angry gay sounds, meow.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.900
So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.

20:13.900 --> 20:18.220
It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.

20:18.220 --> 20:22.940
So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos

20:22.940 --> 20:23.940
caused by vengeance.

20:23.940 --> 20:28.700
And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system.

20:28.700 --> 20:29.700
2.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
Retribution.

20:30.700 --> 20:36.260
The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined this state

20:36.260 --> 20:40.300
as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.

20:40.300 --> 20:45.540
In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long

20:45.540 --> 20:48.060
as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.

20:48.060 --> 20:52.340
But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.

20:52.340 --> 20:56.500
In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law

20:56.500 --> 21:03.700
codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as history times.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.940
The code of Hammurabi looked like this.

21:05.940 --> 21:11.500
The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.

21:11.500 --> 21:16.220
I mean, it was like a thousand years ago, so I'm sure they were doing their best.

21:16.220 --> 21:17.620
It's very good, sweetie.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.940
I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.580
Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?

21:22.580 --> 21:27.260
Sort of a spinal tap stone henge situation.

21:27.260 --> 21:31.420
The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in

21:31.420 --> 21:34.180
the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.

21:34.180 --> 21:37.900
Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried, sort of.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.500
Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
That's content, right?

21:40.500 --> 21:43.580
Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.

21:43.580 --> 21:46.900
Neosqueen.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.580
We don't deserve rights.

21:48.580 --> 21:54.540
So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment is Y.

21:54.540 --> 21:59.420
Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.060
That's extremely valid.

22:01.060 --> 22:05.900
If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, you are not

22:05.900 --> 22:09.020
my father or my mother, his tongue shall be caught off.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.380
Well, at least they're standing up for adoptive parents.

22:11.380 --> 22:15.700
If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.100
Now we're getting into some of the classics.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.620
If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.

22:21.620 --> 22:27.220
If a freed man strike the body of another freed man, he shall pay ten shekels in money.

22:27.220 --> 22:32.180
But if the slave of a freed man strike the body of a freed man, his ear shall be cut

22:32.180 --> 22:33.180
off.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.860
Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.260
So it's like our legal system, except honest.

22:38.260 --> 22:42.520
If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house

22:42.520 --> 22:47.200
which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.700
If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.700
Love that.

22:53.260 --> 22:58.580
So by modern standards, the code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.140
The vibrations are very negative.

23:00.140 --> 23:03.820
It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe

23:03.820 --> 23:04.820
killer all around.

23:04.820 --> 23:09.060
But you have to credit Hammurabi's code for resolving the problem of honor-driven

23:09.060 --> 23:10.060
revenge cycles.

23:10.060 --> 23:14.340
You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against

23:14.340 --> 23:19.940
their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the

23:19.940 --> 23:24.580
elders of the city who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.

23:24.580 --> 23:28.840
So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante

23:28.840 --> 23:32.460
revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.340
Let's list all the differences.

23:34.340 --> 23:37.820
Revenge is personal in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.

23:37.820 --> 23:40.700
It's often emotional, an act of passion.

23:40.700 --> 23:45.180
It can be disproportionate as an Odysseus killing the suitors for his squatting in his

23:45.180 --> 23:46.180
palace.

23:46.180 --> 23:47.180
And it's sadistic.

23:47.180 --> 23:49.420
It's satisfying to the avenger.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.420
Revenge is sweet.

23:50.420 --> 23:55.060
On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal in the sense that the

23:55.060 --> 23:59.100
punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.

23:59.100 --> 24:04.220
It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion and also lacking the

24:04.220 --> 24:06.260
sadism of sweet revenge.

24:06.260 --> 24:09.340
It's also proportionate, again in theory.

24:09.340 --> 24:13.820
You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than

24:13.820 --> 24:14.820
an eye.

24:14.820 --> 24:19.220
And that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's family

24:19.220 --> 24:20.220
for an eye.

24:20.220 --> 24:24.780
And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for

24:24.780 --> 24:25.780
the same crime.

24:25.780 --> 24:29.300
I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about

24:29.300 --> 24:30.300
it?

24:30.300 --> 24:31.300
Just pay some gold.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.300
It's fine.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.300
Girl, these contacts, like...

24:33.300 --> 24:39.820
So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which

24:39.820 --> 24:45.060
is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.

24:45.060 --> 24:50.980
Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.

24:50.980 --> 24:58.500
However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.020
It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.

25:03.020 --> 25:08.780
If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.

25:08.780 --> 25:13.740
In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out

25:13.740 --> 25:19.900
the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of

25:19.900 --> 25:20.900
way.

25:20.900 --> 25:25.760
Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body

25:25.760 --> 25:30.180
part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the

25:30.180 --> 25:34.500
breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
its parents.

25:35.660 --> 25:40.300
There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of

25:40.300 --> 25:41.940
punishment and crime.

25:41.940 --> 25:46.620
For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.

25:46.620 --> 25:51.700
Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.660
Besides, founders were just arrested for extortion.

25:54.660 --> 25:55.660
Here are their mugshots.

25:55.660 --> 26:01.180
There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful

26:01.180 --> 26:02.180
cosmic harmony.

26:02.540 --> 26:07.060
And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct

26:07.060 --> 26:09.140
that's difficult to get rid of.

26:09.140 --> 26:11.940
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.

26:11.940 --> 26:18.220
The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists,

26:18.220 --> 26:23.980
messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.

26:23.980 --> 26:29.300
One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.

26:29.300 --> 26:33.820
And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called

26:33.820 --> 26:35.660
Jesus of Nazareth.

26:35.660 --> 26:40.060
Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to

26:40.060 --> 26:41.540
the Code of Hammurabi.

26:41.540 --> 26:46.380
Like in the book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches

26:46.380 --> 26:48.460
of Hammurabi classics.

26:48.460 --> 26:52.780
Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.

26:52.780 --> 26:56.780
If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but

26:56.780 --> 27:01.140
there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband

27:01.140 --> 27:02.500
demands in the court allows.

27:02.500 --> 27:07.780
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for

27:07.780 --> 27:14.180
tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,

27:14.180 --> 27:20.380
head pats for head pats, welcome to Cat Girl Bible Study, new, extremely devotional gay

27:20.380 --> 27:21.620
sound Zulu.

27:21.620 --> 27:23.700
I feel very spiritually aroused right now.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.260
My third eye chakra, dripping.

27:26.260 --> 27:29.860
Macaroni in a pot.

27:29.860 --> 27:30.860
I need Jesus.

27:30.860 --> 27:34.460
So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.

27:34.460 --> 27:40.660
It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.

27:40.660 --> 27:45.020
But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.

27:45.020 --> 27:51.740
In Matthew 26-52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
him.

27:52.740 --> 27:57.300
Jesus says, put your sword back in his place Spartacus, all who draw the sword will die

27:57.300 --> 27:58.300
by the sword.

27:58.300 --> 28:03.100
Now some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced even

28:03.100 --> 28:07.780
to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism, denying the

28:07.780 --> 28:11.620
right of marginalized people to defend themselves.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.620
Rethink this.

28:12.620 --> 28:13.620
It gets worse.

28:13.620 --> 28:18.740
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute

28:18.740 --> 28:19.740
you.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.380
Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.

28:22.380 --> 28:28.180
No loving, smashing, but maybe Jesus wasn't as literal minded as that.

28:28.180 --> 28:33.740
You know, religion is a very subjective thing and I have my own Bible interpretations and

28:33.740 --> 28:40.820
my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.180
Like consider Matthew 538.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.300
Why is no one talking about Matthew 538?

28:45.300 --> 28:49.980
Jesus says, you've heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,

28:49.980 --> 28:55.020
but I say to you, do not resist an evil doer, but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek,

28:55.020 --> 28:56.780
turn the other also.

28:56.780 --> 29:00.260
Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.

29:00.260 --> 29:07.540
Someone strikes you across the face and you go, ugh, this is not pacifism, this is passive

29:07.540 --> 29:11.300
aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.

29:11.300 --> 29:18.500
This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus at

29:18.500 --> 29:24.860
face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing

29:24.860 --> 29:29.620
is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.

29:29.620 --> 29:36.060
In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment

29:36.060 --> 29:39.820
and anger the victims of injustice experience.

29:39.820 --> 29:44.700
And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about

29:44.700 --> 29:49.540
serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take

29:49.540 --> 29:52.220
care of that when the day of judgment comes.

29:52.220 --> 29:56.580
It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism there's the idea of karma, which is like

29:56.580 --> 30:03.820
a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.

30:03.820 --> 30:09.460
You reap what you sow, basically, so maybe don't worry about injustice too much because

30:09.460 --> 30:11.140
karma will take care of it.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.620
This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy.

30:14.620 --> 30:19.100
The cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.740
Everything happens for a reason.

30:20.740 --> 30:25.580
If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say there's a

30:25.580 --> 30:29.620
special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.700
And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished

30:33.700 --> 30:35.460
by fire demons or whatever.

30:35.460 --> 30:40.940
People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved

30:40.940 --> 30:42.100
injustice.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.300
In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.620
Why do bad things happen to good people?

30:48.620 --> 30:51.500
And the answer is just don't worry about it.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.500
It's part of God's plan.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.100
It'll all work out in the end.

30:54.100 --> 30:55.100
It's fine.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.100
Everything's fine.

30:56.100 --> 31:02.180
The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very

31:02.180 --> 31:08.380
not good, in which case you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe

31:08.380 --> 31:09.540
changing some things.

31:09.540 --> 31:13.580
I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not all religion, and obviously many political

31:13.580 --> 31:18.700
activists have been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.

31:18.700 --> 31:19.700
3.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.700
Utilitarianism

31:20.700 --> 31:27.220
So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as

31:27.220 --> 31:30.340
something other than retaliation.

31:30.340 --> 31:35.020
Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve

31:35.020 --> 31:39.380
society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.

31:39.380 --> 31:43.500
Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes

31:43.500 --> 31:47.100
the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.

31:47.100 --> 31:52.140
So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,

31:52.140 --> 31:56.820
where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.

31:56.820 --> 32:01.620
Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive

32:01.620 --> 32:07.420
for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation

32:07.420 --> 32:11.660
of criminals trying to educate or discipline them so that they can re-interest society.

32:11.660 --> 32:16.220
A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than

32:16.220 --> 32:19.260
retribution, which is very based in emotions.

32:19.260 --> 32:25.020
Also, the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense even if you don't believe in free will.

32:25.020 --> 32:29.140
Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their

32:29.140 --> 32:35.220
actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior and can be deserving of punishment.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.900
Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems… well,

32:39.900 --> 32:44.740
the Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the

32:44.740 --> 32:49.860
sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.620
Which seems irrational, right?

32:51.620 --> 32:53.060
To punish a force of nature?

32:53.060 --> 32:55.260
Leave my beautiful white wife alone!

32:55.260 --> 33:00.340
It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our

33:00.340 --> 33:06.260
genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus

33:06.260 --> 33:12.060
in our natal chart, dry, oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take

33:12.060 --> 33:14.020
all of that into consideration.

33:14.020 --> 33:17.940
You might get a later sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took you

33:17.940 --> 33:18.940
to Disneyland.

33:18.940 --> 33:20.820
It was a crime of passion.

33:20.820 --> 33:25.060
Through no fault of my own, I was high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion,

33:25.060 --> 33:26.060
your honor.

33:26.060 --> 33:29.580
A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian.

33:29.580 --> 33:35.140
Like, prisons are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.

33:35.140 --> 33:40.100
But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are

33:40.100 --> 33:41.700
not doing very much correcting.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.700
I'm sorry.

33:42.700 --> 33:47.740
In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,

33:47.740 --> 33:51.340
and 76% are re-arrested within five years.

33:51.340 --> 33:54.460
And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.260
Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say,

33:57.260 --> 33:58.260
Good.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.940
I hope he rots in prison.

33:59.940 --> 34:04.100
Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, Good.

34:04.100 --> 34:09.020
The proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him

34:09.020 --> 34:11.300
a contributing member of his community.

34:11.300 --> 34:15.740
So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative

34:15.740 --> 34:19.900
function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.

34:19.900 --> 34:25.660
I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often

34:25.660 --> 34:28.060
offensive to human emotions.

34:28.060 --> 34:31.140
And you can say, effects don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our

34:31.140 --> 34:35.860
legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with

34:35.860 --> 34:36.860
you.

34:36.860 --> 34:41.260
But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,

34:41.260 --> 34:46.140
you want to set him on fire, and this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion

34:46.140 --> 34:47.780
affects law enforcement too.

34:47.780 --> 34:52.740
A YouTuber called Jose has a video called, Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,

34:52.740 --> 34:56.900
which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher because they relate to

34:56.900 --> 35:02.940
his military background while fantasizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism.

35:02.940 --> 35:07.060
Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like,

35:07.060 --> 35:11.900
Castle doesn't see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system

35:11.900 --> 35:16.660
is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder victims of crime

35:16.660 --> 35:18.900
from getting the justice they deserve.

35:18.900 --> 35:22.980
Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam's razor for the military.

35:22.980 --> 35:27.180
Don't worry about uniforms, inspections, or restrictive rules of engagement.

35:27.180 --> 35:30.780
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.180
Any true warrior, that's the dream.

35:33.180 --> 35:38.780
So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions

35:38.780 --> 35:42.220
that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.

35:42.220 --> 35:47.500
You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren't for all these pesky laws.

35:47.740 --> 35:52.300
There's a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview.

35:52.300 --> 35:55.100
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.

35:55.100 --> 35:59.940
Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good guy with a gun

35:59.940 --> 36:02.180
to stop a bad guy with a gun.

36:02.180 --> 36:05.300
These only eight-year-old boys playing cops and robbers.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.620
Good guys and bad guys.

36:07.620 --> 36:10.220
Pia pia pia pia pia pia pia pia.

36:10.220 --> 36:11.860
That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.

36:11.860 --> 36:15.660
And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.

36:15.660 --> 36:19.660
People love justice served and instant karma videos for a reason.

36:19.660 --> 36:24.740
We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution.

36:24.740 --> 36:29.260
But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don't allow for that.

36:29.260 --> 36:33.820
There's all these tedious roadblocks, right to an attorney, right to remain silent,

36:33.820 --> 36:36.700
right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.

36:36.700 --> 36:41.580
A lot of police wish they could simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner.

36:41.580 --> 36:45.700
But the function of police is supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating

36:45.700 --> 36:47.100
criminal investigations.

36:47.100 --> 36:52.380
They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing freeform retribution

36:52.380 --> 36:57.420
in the streets at will, justice served, now with 20% more police brutality.

36:57.420 --> 37:01.660
But a lot of people defend the police when they behave like this, because the thin-wristed

37:01.660 --> 37:06.660
civilians are just as emotionally frustrated by due process as the cops.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.420
Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?

37:09.420 --> 37:10.420
I'm double-cancelled.

37:10.420 --> 37:15.140
Well, look, all lives are bastards, but only some bastards are armed by the state and

37:15.140 --> 37:17.580
licensed to go bastarding around town.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.500
The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.

37:20.500 --> 37:25.060
I also think there's a secular version of the just world fallacy going on here.

37:25.060 --> 37:29.540
People like to think that if the police kills somebody, it must be because that person did

37:29.540 --> 37:30.940
something wrong.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.340
Karma at work, justice served.

37:33.340 --> 37:36.860
Victim blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.

37:36.860 --> 37:41.860
You get what you deserve, so if something bad happens to you, you must have been asking

37:41.860 --> 37:42.860
for it.

37:42.860 --> 37:46.660
And obviously, racism is a huge part of this, you know, there's structural white supremacy

37:46.660 --> 37:51.140
that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities, and people

37:51.140 --> 37:55.140
are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as criminal thugs and therefore

37:55.140 --> 37:57.100
deserving of police violence.

37:57.100 --> 38:01.260
So we get this no-angel discourse that comes up every time a black person is murdered by

38:01.260 --> 38:05.380
the police, where they bring up the victim's criminal record or picture of them looking

38:05.380 --> 38:06.540
like a scary thug.

38:06.540 --> 38:08.980
As if that proves they deserve to die.

38:08.980 --> 38:13.060
The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel.

38:13.060 --> 38:15.340
There are no angels walking this earth.

38:15.340 --> 38:16.340
We're all flawed.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.740
We've all made mistakes.

38:17.740 --> 38:19.140
We've all done bad things.

38:19.140 --> 38:21.940
That doesn't mean we deserve to die a violent death.

38:21.940 --> 38:25.660
And then there's people like Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know

38:25.660 --> 38:30.060
were about as close to angels as humans come, but that didn't protect them.

38:30.060 --> 38:34.740
So that is 100% beside the point, because black people in America should not literally

38:34.740 --> 38:39.540
have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be murdered by the

38:39.540 --> 38:40.540
police.

38:40.540 --> 38:44.260
In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low-life, drug-addicted petty

38:44.260 --> 38:48.980
criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be executed by

38:48.980 --> 38:52.900
the cops because that's what it's supposed to mean to live in a free country.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.540
So things need to change.

38:54.540 --> 38:58.140
The Punisher Police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice system with

38:58.140 --> 38:59.140
them.

38:59.140 --> 39:03.460
We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice, and to be honest, that might take

39:03.460 --> 39:04.460
more than one YouTube video.

39:04.460 --> 39:10.620
I know at the beginning I said I was going to explain what justice is, but, um...

39:10.620 --> 39:11.620
I lied.

39:11.620 --> 39:14.900
I'm sorry that I can't fix America.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.580
I'm just a lonely cat.

39:16.580 --> 39:20.020
I guess the only solution is revolution.

39:20.020 --> 39:23.420
And by revolution, I do mean to vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into actually

39:23.420 --> 39:25.060
doing something.

39:25.060 --> 39:33.060
And if they don't listen, well, hang on, let me get this.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.060
Mosho Moshi!

39:35.060 --> 39:37.060
Hey, how are you, taste?

40:03.060 --> 40:10.060
How are you?

40:33.060 --> 40:40.060
How are you?

41:03.060 --> 41:10.060
How are you?

41:33.060 --> 41:40.060
How are you?

42:03.060 --> 42:10.060
How are you?

42:33.060 --> 42:40.060
How are you?

43:03.060 --> 43:10.060
How are you?
