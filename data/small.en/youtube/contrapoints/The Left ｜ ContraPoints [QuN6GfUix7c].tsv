0	15720	Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.
15720	23120	My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything
23120	24600	you hate.
24600	29180	Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.
29180	34580	Even invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands
34580	37540	by a cabal of globalist elites.
37540	43460	And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization
43460	44580	as we know it.
44580	49140	I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.
49140	53340	Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.
53340	59840	Now watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under
59840	63140	the black boots of the Third World Court.
63140	65500	Does that thought fill you with rage?
65500	66660	Good.
66660	69300	We must be prepared to fight.
69300	76500	To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.
76500	82660	To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.
82660	98540	Make America great again, hail victory.
98540	105580	Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.
105580	117260	Actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,
117260	123460	so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the dialectical
123460	127580	object through the sublimation of negative materiality.
128580	131980	Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.
131980	135980	Death to capitalism, hail Satan.
158580	162780	So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?
162780	164540	Well, what do you expect?
164540	169180	We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent
169180	172180	white middle class that prefers order to justice.
172180	174380	Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.
174380	176740	So let's accept that all that's true.
176740	177740	The game is rigged.
177740	178740	Fine.
178740	180780	Now, how do you respond to that situation?
180780	184460	Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the
184460	188220	predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?
188220	192860	Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer s-beat who puts style over
192860	197300	substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary
197300	199900	kropskyite tendencies.
199900	201660	I mean, are you even a communist?
201660	202660	No.
202660	203660	I'm not a communist.
203660	205660	Well, why not?
205660	206660	Mmm.
206660	208460	I like stuff.
208460	213180	I like this, and I like this, and I like this.
213180	214660	That's why I can't be a communist.
214660	219700	Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property,
219700	220700	right?
220700	223780	You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means
223780	224780	of production.
224780	227500	Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.
227500	228940	Well, you should feel bad about that.
228940	230820	Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.
230820	232900	Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.
232900	234900	Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.
234900	235900	Right.
235900	240100	Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?
241100	243420	That's what I thought.
243420	246300	You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.
246300	247700	And they're afraid of you.
247700	249860	Well, fascists are afraid of me.
249860	250860	Really?
250860	252540	Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.
252540	253540	Let's see.
253540	257660	We've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.
257660	260780	Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.
260780	266020	Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.
266020	267500	Great.
267500	271100	Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.
271100	275740	Positives first, the rose is great, love the rose, fantastic.
275740	279540	Now, the hammer and sickle, we're gonna need to get rid of that.
279540	280940	I'm just wearing it ironically.
280940	282940	Now, don't you start with that.
282940	285900	It makes me think of red lines and gulags and it needs to go.
285900	287340	Well, maybe you're right.
287340	289020	Fine, I'll get rid of it.
289020	290660	See, I can think about optics.
290660	291660	What's that in your bag?
291660	292660	Oh, this?
292660	293660	Yeah.
293660	295420	We're gonna need to do something about that too.
295420	299620	Now hold on, getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing, but Marx is a foundational
299620	301260	thinker in the history of progressive political-
301260	305020	I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx, I'm talking about giving him a makeover.
305020	307500	I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.
307500	310020	It's making me depressed just looking at it.
310020	311020	Red and gold?
311020	315140	What is this foreign shit, like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?
315140	316140	It's un-American.
316140	317140	I don't trust it.
317140	319140	I don't like the cut of its jib.
319140	322140	So you want a Marx-Angels reader wrapped in an American flag?
322140	324580	Oh, I can do you better than that.
324580	328100	Let's start with a gradient, got a grid, maybe a wave grid.
328100	334940	Let's get some shiny fonts, maybe a bust, a pink bust, with 3D glasses, pink glasses,
334940	337020	maybe some palm trees.
337020	339020	Oh, yeah.
339020	343460	Or how about this?
343460	344460	Lots of brands.
344460	345460	More, more, more.
345460	346460	Oh my god.
346460	347460	It's beautiful.
347460	348460	Okay, one more, one more.
348460	349460	A pink field, chocolate.
349460	350460	Yes, girl.
350460	351460	Yes.
351700	354700	I just realized that I actually hate you.
354700	355700	Hello, fellow whites.
355700	358700	Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and future
358700	359700	for white children?
359700	364700	Turn the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.
364700	366700	Effective, isn't it?
366700	368700	Well, I see your point.
368700	374020	But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,
374020	379020	if there's some way you cannot do that.
380020	384020	Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?
384020	389020	I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.
396020	400220	But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not going to do by tweeting
400220	404860	death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone
404860	409420	to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas
409420	413940	and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting
413940	417540	that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent
417540	422460	revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.
422460	425220	Well, that's an unfair association.
425220	428220	Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.
428220	430140	Has there ever been real communism?
430140	431620	Well, yes.
431620	437860	Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary Eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived communist
437860	441780	utopia did flourish until it was smashed by Western imperialism.
441780	442780	Right.
442780	446620	But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?
446620	450340	You seem to not even care about what's actually possible, that's how deep you are in pure
450340	451340	theory.
451340	453500	And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.
453500	457020	You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.
457020	461340	You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.
461340	465020	Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the
465020	466020	way things are going.
466020	469660	I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.
469660	471980	Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.
471980	473660	For all I know, you could be correct.
473660	476700	I'm just saying, it's a tough sell and you are not selling it.
476700	479980	Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal
479980	485140	intellectual void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted
485140	489700	the Overton window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical
489700	490700	liberalism.
490700	496060	Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?
496060	498820	Hey, hey, hey.
498820	500380	You leave centrists alone.
500380	501380	Thanks, Justine.
501380	502500	Jackie, get out of here.
502500	504660	You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.
504660	507500	I'll see you at brunch.
507500	508500	Mimosas.
508500	510380	What the hell was that?
510380	511380	Brunch?
511380	513180	You got a brunch with these people?
513180	516100	Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.
516100	517100	Afternoon tea?
517100	522260	Does Jeeves bring around Madeline cookies and fresh sliced lemon wedges?
522260	526340	No, but I do have a very nice Windsor, China tea set.
526340	527420	Unbelievable.
527420	528900	You get the bullet too.
528900	530380	You get the goddamn bullet too.
530380	531380	Oh, come on.
531380	532380	Me?
532380	533380	Me?
533380	534380	What do you want me to do?
534380	539020	Drink victory gin out of a rusty Harrington like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in
539020	540020	Eastern Cameroon?
540020	542260	I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.
542340	546860	I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle, shooting at capitalists with
546860	550260	a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left wing enough for you.
550260	554540	Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists
554540	558820	and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?
558820	560700	How is Antifa keeping me safe?
560700	566140	You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.
566140	571540	Most of what we do is behind the scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxxing them,
571540	575740	disrupting their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist
575740	576740	rallies.
576740	580100	And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long
580100	584020	enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the black block is going to save your
584020	587780	life because you don't look like you can fight and the police certainly aren't going
587780	588780	to save you.
588780	590380	Well, maybe so.
590380	595500	I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going
595500	599740	to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what
599740	600740	we're in.
600740	605100	We can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to be, and
605100	609580	black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.
609580	610580	Oh, come on!
610580	614620	You have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.
614620	621980	What about a girl in a mask?
621980	625140	I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.
625140	627060	Well, it was worth a shot.
627060	629900	Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.
629900	632100	You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.
632100	634140	You mean the propaganda war.
634140	635140	Shh!
635140	636660	Don't call it propaganda.
636660	638500	There could be liberals listening.
638500	642420	Look, what the left needs to get and what the centrists need to get, and what only
642420	647100	I and the fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.
647100	648100	Oh boy, here we go.
648100	650580	What is an eccentric hate about social justice warriors?
650580	653500	It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments.
653500	656000	It's that they're not cool, right?
656000	657420	Social justice warriors are not cool.
657420	658420	What do you mean?
658420	659420	They're not popular?
659420	660420	No, no, no.
660420	661420	I mean, they're not cool.
661420	665580	You can be unpopular and still cool, and in fact it can be cool to be unpopular.
665580	667340	So what does it mean to be cool?
667340	671420	Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about
671420	674340	social justice warriors is that they're emotional.
674340	678060	The social justice warriors, who everyone cringes at online, are people who I'm sure
678060	681900	are nice people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the
681900	682900	middle of an outburst.
682900	685620	They're out of control, and that's the problem.
685620	686620	It's not cool.
687380	692500	This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-it-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality
692500	697400	is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.
697400	701800	People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses
701800	702800	to injustice.
702800	706300	I thought you'd say that, but what you're failing to consider is that it's possible
706300	708460	to be both angry and cool.
708460	712300	And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?
712300	713300	What?
713300	716140	You get... ice cold.
716620	717620	I'm sorry.
717620	718620	What?
718620	719620	And that's what we on the left need to become.
719620	720620	Ice cold motherfuckers.
720620	721620	What the hell are you talking about?
721620	722620	Miles Davis.
722620	723620	Incredibly cool.
723620	724620	But pretty angry.
724620	728620	Did not take shit from white people, but also, ice cold motherfucker.
728620	732620	So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.
732620	733620	Precisely.
733620	736620	What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.
736620	737620	This is ridiculous.
737620	738620	This is ridiculous.
738620	739620	This is ridiculous.
739620	740620	This is ridiculous.
740620	741620	This is ridiculous.
741620	742620	This is ridiculous.
742620	743620	This is ridiculous.
743620	744620	This is ridiculous.
744620	745620	This is ridiculous.
745620	746620	This is ridiculous.
746620	747620	This is ridiculous.
747620	748620	This is ridiculous.
748620	749620	I think it's stalemate.
749620	750620	No it's not.
750620	751620	My queen is wide open.
751620	752620	No it isn't.
752620	753620	Take me.
753620	754620	I'm going to get going now.
754620	755620	Wait.
755620	756620	Where are you going?
756620	759620	I'm going to go bash the phabish.
759620	761620	Well, be careful.
761620	762620	Sure.
762620	765620	Enjoy your tea tomorrow.
765620	768620	What a goddamn lunatic.
768620	775620	What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her.
798620	805620	What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her, I'm gonna miss her.
828620	830620	Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?
830620	832620	They got into a fight on Skype, remember?
832620	834620	Anyway, they killed each other, they're both dead.
834620	837620	They kind of fired guns off in random directions.
837620	840620	It's best not to think about it too much.
