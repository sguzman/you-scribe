1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,120
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,600
you hate.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,180
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,580
Even invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
by a cabal of globalist elites.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,460
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,580
as we know it.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,140
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,340
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,840
Now watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,140
the black boots of the Third World Court.

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,500
Does that thought fill you with rage?

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,660
Good.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,300
We must be prepared to fight.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,500
To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,660
To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:38,540
Make America great again, hail victory.

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,580
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:57,260
Actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,460
so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the dialectical

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,580
object through the sublimation of negative materiality.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,980
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.

24
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Death to capitalism, hail Satan.

25
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

26
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,540
Well, what do you expect?

27
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,180
We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent

28
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,180
white middle class that prefers order to justice.

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,380
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,740
So let's accept that all that's true.

31
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
The game is rigged.

32
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Fine.

33
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,780
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,460
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the

35
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,220
predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

36
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,860
Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer s-beat who puts style over

37
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,300
substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,900
kropskyite tendencies.

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,660
I mean, are you even a communist?

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
No.

41
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,660
I'm not a communist.

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Well, why not?

43
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Mmm.

44
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,460
I like stuff.

45
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,180
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,660
That's why I can't be a communist.

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,700
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property,

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
right?

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,780
You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means

50
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
of production.

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,940
Well, you should feel bad about that.

53
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,820
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

54
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,900
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Right.

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,100
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,420
That's what I thought.

59
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,300
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,700
And they're afraid of you.

61
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,860
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,860
Really?

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,540
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
Let's see.

65
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,660
We've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,780
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,020
Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,500
Great.

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,100
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

70
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Positives first, the rose is great, love the rose, fantastic.

71
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,540
Now, the hammer and sickle, we're gonna need to get rid of that.

72
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,940
I'm just wearing it ironically.

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,940
Now, don't you start with that.

74
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,900
It makes me think of red lines and gulags and it needs to go.

75
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,340
Well, maybe you're right.

76
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,020
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,660
See, I can think about optics.

78
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
What's that in your bag?

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Oh, this?

80
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Yeah.

81
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,420
We're gonna need to do something about that too.

82
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,620
Now hold on, getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing, but Marx is a foundational

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,260
thinker in the history of progressive political-

84
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx, I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

85
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,500
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,020
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

87
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
Red and gold?

88
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,140
What is this foreign shit, like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
It's un-American.

90
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
I don't trust it.

91
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
I don't like the cut of its jib.

92
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,140
So you want a Marx-Angels reader wrapped in an American flag?

93
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,580
Oh, I can do you better than that.

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,100
Let's start with a gradient, got a grid, maybe a wave grid.

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,940
Let's get some shiny fonts, maybe a bust, a pink bust, with 3D glasses, pink glasses,

96
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,020
maybe some palm trees.

97
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Oh, yeah.

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,460
Or how about this?

99
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Lots of brands.

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
More, more, more.

101
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
Oh my god.

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
It's beautiful.

103
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,460
Okay, one more, one more.

104
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
A pink field, chocolate.

105
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
Yes, girl.

106
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Yes.

107
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,700
I just realized that I actually hate you.

108
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Hello, fellow whites.

109
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and future

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
for white children?

111
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Turn the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Effective, isn't it?

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Well, I see your point.

114
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,020
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,020
if there's some way you cannot do that.

116
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

118
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,220
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not going to do by tweeting

119
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,860
death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone

120
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,420
to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas

121
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,940
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting

122
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,540
that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,460
revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

124
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,220
Well, that's an unfair association.

125
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

126
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,140
Has there ever been real communism?

127
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,620
Well, yes.

128
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,860
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary Eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived communist

129
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,780
utopia did flourish until it was smashed by Western imperialism.

130
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Right.

131
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,620
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

132
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,340
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible, that's how deep you are in pure

133
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
theory.

134
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,500
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,020
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

136
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,340
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

137
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,020
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the

138
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
way things are going.

139
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,660
I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.

140
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,980
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

141
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,660
For all I know, you could be correct.

142
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,700
I'm just saying, it's a tough sell and you are not selling it.

143
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,980
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal

144
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,140
intellectual void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted

145
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,700
the Overton window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical

146
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
liberalism.

147
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,060
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

148
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,820
Hey, hey, hey.

149
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,380
You leave centrists alone.

150
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
Thanks, Justine.

151
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,500
Jackie, get out of here.

152
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,660
You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

153
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll see you at brunch.

154
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Mimosas.

155
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,380
What the hell was that?

156
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Brunch?

157
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,180
You got a brunch with these people?

158
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,100
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

159
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Afternoon tea?

160
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,260
Does Jeeves bring around Madeline cookies and fresh sliced lemon wedges?

161
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,340
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor, China tea set.

162
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,420
Unbelievable.

163
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,900
You get the bullet too.

164
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,380
You get the goddamn bullet too.

165
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Oh, come on.

166
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Me?

167
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Me?

168
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
What do you want me to do?

169
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,020
Drink victory gin out of a rusty Harrington like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in

170
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Eastern Cameroon?

171
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,260
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

172
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,860
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle, shooting at capitalists with

173
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,260
a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left wing enough for you.

174
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,540
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

175
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,820
and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?

176
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,700
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

177
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,140
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,540
Most of what we do is behind the scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxxing them,

179
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,740
disrupting their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist

180
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
rallies.

181
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,100
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long

182
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,020
enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the black block is going to save your

183
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,780
life because you don't look like you can fight and the police certainly aren't going

184
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
to save you.

185
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,380
Well, maybe so.

186
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,500
I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going

187
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,740
to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what

188
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
we're in.

189
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,100
We can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to be, and

190
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,580
black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.

191
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Oh, come on!

192
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,620
You have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

193
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,980
What about a girl in a mask?

194
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,140
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

195
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,060
Well, it was worth a shot.

196
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,900
Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.

197
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,100
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

198
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,140
You mean the propaganda war.

199
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
Shh!

200
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't call it propaganda.

201
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,500
There could be liberals listening.

202
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,420
Look, what the left needs to get and what the centrists need to get, and what only

203
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,100
I and the fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.

204
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh boy, here we go.

205
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,580
What is an eccentric hate about social justice warriors?

206
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,500
It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments.

207
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,000
It's that they're not cool, right?

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,420
Social justice warriors are not cool.

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
What do you mean?

210
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
They're not popular?

211
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
No, no, no.

212
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I mean, they're not cool.

213
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,580
You can be unpopular and still cool, and in fact it can be cool to be unpopular.

214
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,340
So what does it mean to be cool?

215
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,420
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about

216
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,340
social justice warriors is that they're emotional.

217
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,060
The social justice warriors, who everyone cringes at online, are people who I'm sure

218
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,900
are nice people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the

219
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
middle of an outburst.

220
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,620
They're out of control, and that's the problem.

221
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
It's not cool.

222
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,500
This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-it-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality

223
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,400
is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

224
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,800
People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses

225
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
to injustice.

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,300
I thought you'd say that, but what you're failing to consider is that it's possible

227
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,460
to be both angry and cool.

228
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,300
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?

229
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
What?

230
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,140
You get... ice cold.

231
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
What?

233
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
And that's what we on the left need to become.

234
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Ice cold motherfuckers.

235
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
What the hell are you talking about?

236
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Miles Davis.

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
Incredibly cool.

238
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
But pretty angry.

239
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Did not take shit from white people, but also, ice cold motherfucker.

240
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,620
So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

241
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,620
Precisely.

242
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,620
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

243
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
This is ridiculous.

244
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,620
This is ridiculous.

245
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
This is ridiculous.

246
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
This is ridiculous.

247
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
This is ridiculous.

248
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
This is ridiculous.

249
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
This is ridiculous.

250
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
This is ridiculous.

251
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
This is ridiculous.

252
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
This is ridiculous.

253
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
This is ridiculous.

254
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
This is ridiculous.

255
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
I think it's stalemate.

256
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,620
No it's not.

257
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
My queen is wide open.

258
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
No it isn't.

259
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Take me.

260
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm going to get going now.

261
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Wait.

262
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Where are you going?

263
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,620
I'm going to go bash the phabish.

264
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
Well, be careful.

265
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Sure.

266
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,620
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

267
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,620
What a goddamn lunatic.

268
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:55,620
What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her.

269
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:25,620
What a god damn lunatic, I'm gonna miss her, I'm gonna miss her.

270
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

271
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

272
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Anyway, they killed each other, they're both dead.

273
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,620
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

274
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,620
It's best not to think about it too much.
