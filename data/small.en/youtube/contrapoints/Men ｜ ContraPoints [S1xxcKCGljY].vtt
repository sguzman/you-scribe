WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Hi boys, it's me again.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.920
Just your average girl.

00:08.920 --> 00:14.120
Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able

00:14.120 --> 00:16.880
to converse as men.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.280
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

00:21.280 --> 00:23.120
now and the decline of Rome.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.460
Do you like history, boys?

00:24.460 --> 00:25.920
How did Rome fall again?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.760
Was it the gays?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.180
Tell me all about it.

00:29.260 --> 00:34.220
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's

00:34.220 --> 00:36.060
rights activists on the other.

00:36.060 --> 00:42.460
Whatever happened to that, these days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.220
I did want to do the fedora though.

00:44.220 --> 00:48.540
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I

00:48.540 --> 00:50.460
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

00:50.460 --> 00:56.620
My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA Femme Fatale and fedora would make it fashion.

00:56.620 --> 00:57.620
School shooter realness.

00:57.700 --> 01:03.540
I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-peeled Carmen Sandiego.

01:03.540 --> 01:08.620
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

01:08.620 --> 01:16.180
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

01:16.180 --> 01:20.460
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

01:20.460 --> 01:22.700
in a state of psychological balance?

01:22.700 --> 01:26.100
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

01:26.100 --> 01:27.780
I guess, yeah, kind of.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.940
You don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual medicine cabinets.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.100
I'm losing my target audience here.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.700
Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.740
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.780
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

01:40.780 --> 01:44.180
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.700
Yeah, that's right.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.140
Women pee too, okay?

01:47.140 --> 01:48.140
Get over it.

01:48.140 --> 01:52.620
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will

01:52.620 --> 01:55.460
not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

01:56.100 --> 02:01.980
You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

02:01.980 --> 02:04.380
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

02:04.380 --> 02:09.100
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological

02:09.100 --> 02:10.980
female and as a Pisces moon.

02:10.980 --> 02:16.540
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, contrapine, for men, I started brushing

02:16.540 --> 02:22.940
up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

02:22.940 --> 02:27.580
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus

02:27.580 --> 02:31.900
Logico-Philosophicus, and of course, the philosophical classic, The Rational Male by

02:31.900 --> 02:32.900
Ruyo Caliente.

02:32.900 --> 02:39.020
So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating

02:39.020 --> 02:41.020
intellectual interchange.

02:41.020 --> 02:44.620
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?

02:44.620 --> 02:47.460
So there will be no emotions in this video.

02:47.460 --> 02:54.060
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,

02:54.060 --> 02:55.660
and deductive proof.

02:55.660 --> 03:07.420
Actually, you know what?

03:07.420 --> 03:08.420
Fuck that.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.740
Let's listen to house music and do sax drugs.

03:17.460 --> 03:28.860
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

03:28.860 --> 03:32.100
Oh, and the male straits.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.860
God, I love attention.

03:33.860 --> 03:34.860
Hey, gorge.

03:34.860 --> 03:35.860
Hey, gorge.

03:35.860 --> 03:36.860
Hey, gorge.

03:36.860 --> 03:39.140
Okay, I'm ready.

03:39.140 --> 03:41.820
Let's crack open a cold one, boys.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.140
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.900
I need a man to do it for me.

03:47.900 --> 03:48.900
Help.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.900
Fuck it.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
Okay, that's super funny.

03:50.900 --> 03:51.900
Hey, gorge.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
Hey, gorge.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.860
Are there any women still watching this video?

03:57.860 --> 04:02.500
I'm really sorry about all this unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case, how

04:02.500 --> 04:03.500
very dare.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
I'm a good Presbyterian.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.100
And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
Hey, how are you?

04:08.100 --> 04:11.540
Look, the video is about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.460
Am I doing this right?

04:13.460 --> 04:14.460
Is this what men like?

04:14.460 --> 04:15.460
Traps.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.460
Traps.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.220
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

04:18.220 --> 04:21.660
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere on the Frankenfurter

04:21.660 --> 04:23.660
Violet Chachke-Diedevonti's spectrum.

04:23.660 --> 04:28.700
Oh, but you don't know where exactly, and that is a dangerous game, ladies.

04:28.700 --> 04:35.900
I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now, but that

04:35.900 --> 04:37.900
could be because of the drugs.

04:37.900 --> 04:42.740
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational, and we're fooling around, okay?

04:42.740 --> 04:43.740
Part one.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.500
Oh, wait, rational.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.260
Axiom one, America's next top victim.

04:50.260 --> 04:55.580
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture, and I'm

04:55.580 --> 04:59.420
not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.700
No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.940
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

05:04.940 --> 05:12.820
We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rage prejudice.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.140
That must be super fucking hard for you.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.260
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.940
You know, flaunting their sexuality on the faces of children who are trying to raise

05:22.940 --> 05:26.420
a family and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.700
And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights, too.

05:30.700 --> 05:34.220
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life, and I've always been

05:34.220 --> 05:35.660
very skeptical.

05:35.660 --> 05:40.860
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

05:40.860 --> 05:46.020
Men try to do a good thing to solve a real problem, and then a man shows up to say, well,

05:46.020 --> 05:47.020
what about men?

05:47.020 --> 05:50.820
Men also get harassed, why aren't you talking about men?

05:50.820 --> 05:55.380
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

05:55.380 --> 05:57.580
Of course he's fucking not.

05:57.580 --> 06:00.300
He doesn't give a shit, he's a troll.

06:00.300 --> 06:05.380
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

06:05.380 --> 06:06.540
What about them, honey?

06:06.540 --> 06:10.260
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once, and the first thing I did

06:10.260 --> 06:14.020
was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement, which is The Myth

06:14.020 --> 06:15.820
of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

06:15.820 --> 06:20.220
Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.

06:20.220 --> 06:24.500
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
to.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.620
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender

06:29.620 --> 06:31.980
role that confined women to domestic servitude.

06:31.980 --> 06:36.900
But, he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually

06:36.900 --> 06:41.540
an illusion because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

06:41.540 --> 06:47.420
He introduces the idea of male disposability, basically the idea that society values female

06:47.420 --> 06:52.020
lives more than male lives, which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting

06:52.020 --> 06:53.860
and providing for women and children.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.740
And he points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

06:58.740 --> 07:02.060
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

07:02.060 --> 07:06.380
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power

07:06.380 --> 07:07.380
than women.

07:07.380 --> 07:12.920
In fact, the Queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided

07:12.920 --> 07:18.660
for by the expendable male worker bees and I guess that kind of makes sense.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.020
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

07:21.020 --> 07:25.400
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill and I rubbed it on my claaa-

07:25.400 --> 07:30.420
But some initial objections come to mind.

07:30.420 --> 07:35.420
Like haven't men been almost all of the king's presidents and CEOs for millennia?

07:35.420 --> 07:37.900
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

07:37.900 --> 07:41.480
I don't know boys, still seems kind of patriarchal to me.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.220
But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society

07:45.220 --> 07:47.120
that men have more power than women.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.540
Maybe the average man is also oppressed

07:50.540 --> 07:53.240
by the system that feminists call patriarchy.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.260
If that's what you're saying,

07:55.260 --> 07:57.800
I think I basically agree with that.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.400
See, what you have to understand about me

07:59.400 --> 08:02.360
is I am such a fucking Libra.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.960
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

08:04.960 --> 08:06.580
well, maybe everybody's right

08:06.580 --> 08:08.840
and maybe there's good points on both sides

08:08.840 --> 08:10.500
and we should all just listen to each other

08:10.500 --> 08:13.840
and rub each other's clothes.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.360
But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.700
Oh, there will be a champion, there will be blood.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.680
So, judges, how do we decide which gender

08:24.680 --> 08:26.500
is America's next top victim?

08:26.500 --> 08:29.600
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders

08:29.600 --> 08:32.880
and see how the other half lives, or can you?

08:33.800 --> 08:37.000
Proposition two, diary of an X-Man.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.400
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal

08:41.400 --> 08:44.200
that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.320
Mom, get out of my room.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.560
You're ruining my life.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.100
Look, I have never ever talked about this

08:53.100 --> 08:54.960
on my channel before, so this is like

08:54.960 --> 08:57.120
a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.040
But I was born a boy.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.000
Well, was I ever really a boy?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.120
It's hard to say.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.760
Dear diary, growing up I always knew

09:05.760 --> 09:07.560
that I was different from other kids,

09:07.560 --> 09:11.240
especially other boys, and it took me so long

09:11.240 --> 09:15.560
to pinpoint what it was, but there was this moment.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.320
I must have been what, seven, eight years old?

09:18.320 --> 09:21.360
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself

09:21.360 --> 09:25.800
and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.120
And I don't know what it was, it was like this magnetism

09:29.120 --> 09:32.640
that drew me to them and I put my little feet in them

09:32.640 --> 09:34.360
and walked in front of the mirror

09:34.360 --> 09:37.040
and I didn't really have the words yet

09:37.040 --> 09:41.400
to describe how I felt, but basically in that moment

09:41.400 --> 09:43.840
I sensed that God had made a mistake

09:43.840 --> 09:48.840
and I was destined to be a cross-dresser.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.520
That is super fucking coconuts.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.160
Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart

09:56.160 --> 09:57.000
and I became a woman.

09:57.000 --> 09:57.880
Hey, how are you?

09:57.880 --> 09:59.840
I became one of the dolls.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.560
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.520
Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is

10:04.520 --> 10:06.040
I used to live your lifestyle.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.520
I know what people like you get up to

10:07.520 --> 10:09.360
and I think it's disgusting.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.800
I gotta say though, since I transitioned

10:11.800 --> 10:14.800
my life has been super fucking great, like way better.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.760
Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it

10:16.760 --> 10:20.400
better than men, but because hey, gorge,

10:20.400 --> 10:23.120
I am literally transgendered.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.800
So before I transitioned I was dying inside, you know?

10:25.800 --> 10:30.240
I was in the wrong body and now it's like I finally

10:30.240 --> 10:32.680
have the body I was meant to die inside of,

10:32.680 --> 10:34.020
but it's not just that.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.040
I do think that in some ways, since I started presenting

10:37.040 --> 10:39.800
as a woman, people actually do treat me better.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.400
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,

10:42.400 --> 10:45.240
but that's probably for the best.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.040
Now before using my personal experience

10:47.040 --> 10:49.240
as any kind of evidence, I guess I should say

10:49.240 --> 10:50.400
a couple caveats.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.880
Caveat one is that most pre-transitioned trans women

10:53.880 --> 10:55.520
are not like other boys.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.680
And most of us, we're not living the business class

10:57.680 --> 10:59.920
male experience by any means.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.160
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,

11:02.160 --> 11:05.640
tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,

11:05.640 --> 11:09.420
poets, you know, that sort of thing.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.800
Caveat two is that my trans experience

11:12.800 --> 11:14.880
is not the trans experience.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.720
And I do have a lot of other privileges

11:16.720 --> 11:19.120
that made things go super fucking well for me.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.060
Hey, how are you?

11:20.060 --> 11:22.860
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege

11:22.860 --> 11:25.580
in a way that's actually just bragging?

11:25.580 --> 11:28.100
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge

11:28.100 --> 11:31.140
that I've been so successful and I've come so far,

11:31.140 --> 11:34.900
in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young

11:34.900 --> 11:39.260
and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated

11:39.260 --> 11:42.500
and I'm popular and my plastic surgeon is an artist

11:42.500 --> 11:44.460
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

11:44.460 --> 11:46.620
and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.300
And part of what makes me so enlightened

11:48.300 --> 11:51.700
and so compassionate is that I'm able to recognize

11:51.900 --> 11:55.300
these privileges that I have that just might not be available

11:55.300 --> 11:58.380
to people who are less fortunate.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.740
From the bottom of my mother fucking

11:59.740 --> 12:00.860
and my father fucking heart,

12:00.860 --> 12:02.400
they must be super fucking hard for you.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.540
I can't even imagine.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.260
What I was saying is there are ways

12:06.260 --> 12:07.540
that people treat me better now

12:07.540 --> 12:09.020
that I'm presenting as a woman.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.860
You know, people smile at me more.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.700
I feel more taken care of.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.700
Men do things for me.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.580
Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

12:17.580 --> 12:20.180
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

12:20.180 --> 12:23.620
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.780
But not me.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.020
I love it.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.700
Both because I love attention

12:27.700 --> 12:30.060
and because I'm a recumbent queen

12:30.060 --> 12:32.300
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.540
I do this thing on airplanes

12:33.540 --> 12:35.780
where when it's time for me to put my carry-on luggage

12:35.780 --> 12:37.100
in the overhead bin,

12:37.100 --> 12:40.300
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift

12:40.300 --> 12:43.380
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.580
Even though I'm taller than most men, it makes me happy.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.220
Another good thing about becoming a woman

12:48.460 --> 12:50.940
is I integrate it into female social groups

12:50.940 --> 12:53.980
and I found that they provide a kind of communal support

12:53.980 --> 12:55.620
and overt affection

12:55.620 --> 12:58.660
that male social groups generally just don't.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.700
I find that female social style suits me better

13:00.700 --> 13:01.940
than the male one,

13:01.940 --> 13:04.860
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,

13:04.860 --> 13:06.820
where affection is always concealed

13:06.820 --> 13:10.020
behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.300
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other

13:12.300 --> 13:13.700
when they play video games.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.380
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

13:15.380 --> 13:17.980
men and women are treated in public space.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.820
When you present female in public,

13:19.820 --> 13:22.340
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle

13:22.340 --> 13:23.940
to be commented upon.

13:23.940 --> 13:27.780
People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions

13:27.780 --> 13:31.260
about you, sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,

13:31.260 --> 13:33.380
sometimes just fucking weird.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.860
Whereas when you present male in public,

13:35.860 --> 13:38.140
you're more likely to be treated either as invisible

13:38.140 --> 13:39.620
or as dangerous.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.380
Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences

13:42.380 --> 13:45.940
as men asserting dominance over women in public space

13:45.940 --> 13:47.380
and they've criticized catcalling

13:47.380 --> 13:50.380
as being objectifying, degrading, and misogynistic.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.740
And it certainly can be all of those things.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.300
There's different kinds of catcalling

13:54.300 --> 13:56.220
and I have different feelings about them.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.140
If I'm walking with another woman and a man says,

13:59.140 --> 14:01.860
"'Ladies, you look beautiful tonight.'"

14:01.860 --> 14:03.380
I don't know, I like that.

14:03.380 --> 14:04.740
I think that's nice.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.220
It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired,

14:07.220 --> 14:08.740
it boosts my confidence.

14:08.740 --> 14:11.380
Whereas if I'm walking alone

14:11.380 --> 14:14.060
and a drunk starts following me down the street,

14:14.100 --> 14:17.300
singing, "'Have you seen a polythene, Pam?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.980
"'She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man.'"

14:20.820 --> 14:24.180
That I am less enthusiastic about.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.180
I mean, not that that's ever happened.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.860
I'm completely fucking unclockable.

14:27.860 --> 14:28.940
Hey, how are you?

14:28.940 --> 14:33.940
No one knows what it's like to be a sad trans.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.900
I definitely get where feminists are coming from

14:36.900 --> 14:38.700
because street harassment sucks.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.580
I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night

14:40.580 --> 14:41.620
than I used to be.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.380
And there's a lot more places

14:43.380 --> 14:45.140
I just won't go by myself.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.660
But on the other hand,

14:46.660 --> 14:49.580
I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night

14:49.580 --> 14:52.180
without other people acting afraid of me.

14:52.180 --> 14:54.660
I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine

14:54.660 --> 14:58.060
the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous

14:58.060 --> 15:00.420
can also kind of suck.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.780
In my video on incels,

15:01.780 --> 15:04.780
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps

15:04.780 --> 15:07.100
and how getting no attention at all

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
can actually be emotionally worse

15:09.100 --> 15:10.940
than getting a lot of shitty attention.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.980
And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,

15:13.980 --> 15:15.660
when I was living as a man,

15:15.660 --> 15:18.060
sometimes if I was walking at night,

15:18.060 --> 15:19.980
a woman on the same block as me

15:19.980 --> 15:21.940
would change sides of the street.

15:21.940 --> 15:25.180
And I totally get why men do scary shit sometimes

15:25.180 --> 15:26.620
and it's better to be safe.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.780
But it's still stung a little bit

15:28.780 --> 15:31.820
to be treated as dangerous by default.

15:31.820 --> 15:33.540
I think it can actually be harmful,

15:33.540 --> 15:36.500
which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.820
There's ways that white women's fear

15:38.820 --> 15:42.260
can actually be dangerous in particular to black men.

15:42.260 --> 15:43.820
I had an experience with this recently

15:43.820 --> 15:45.740
when I was filming my video, The Apocalypse,

15:45.740 --> 15:48.140
and I had rented a room in a hotel casino.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.300
Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment

15:50.300 --> 15:52.500
up to my room and I got into the elevator

15:52.500 --> 15:54.620
with a group of people from the casino floor.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.180
A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator

15:57.180 --> 16:00.140
except for me and a single black man.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.260
Well, I mean, he was alone.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.300
I don't know if he was single.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.140
That's not part of the story.

16:04.140 --> 16:05.580
And as soon as the door closed,

16:05.580 --> 16:09.020
he started literally whistling row, row, row your boat,

16:09.020 --> 16:11.660
the official melody of performative innocence.

16:11.660 --> 16:16.260
And I realized, oh shit, he is afraid that I'm afraid.

16:16.260 --> 16:17.980
And I found that just excruciating.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.380
I was like, oh God,

16:20.380 --> 16:23.220
how do other white women behave in elevators?

16:23.220 --> 16:25.500
Do they like clutch their purses?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.900
That's so fucking embarrassing.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.660
Nothing like that had ever happened to me

16:31.660 --> 16:33.140
when I was living as a man.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.580
It's not a thing between black men and white men.

16:35.580 --> 16:38.300
It's a thing between black men and white women.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.780
And so that dynamic was there,

16:39.780 --> 16:42.180
not just because I'm white and he's black,

16:42.180 --> 16:44.940
but because I'm a woman and he's a man.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.700
And I thought of that incident again

16:46.700 --> 16:48.900
when I was listening to the myth of male power

16:48.900 --> 16:49.900
and Farrell says,

16:49.900 --> 16:53.220
men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength

16:53.220 --> 16:56.700
and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.740
I think there is some truth to the idea

16:58.740 --> 17:00.620
that women's perceived vulnerability

17:00.620 --> 17:02.060
can make them powerful.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.980
And men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.940
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt

17:06.940 --> 17:09.660
because these are just some little observations I've made

17:09.660 --> 17:11.460
based on a handful of anecdotes.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.500
And as rational males,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.020
it's important that we consider the facts,

17:16.020 --> 17:18.020
the stats and the figures.

17:18.020 --> 17:21.380
Did you know that 46% of men

17:21.380 --> 17:26.340
are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?

17:26.340 --> 17:27.540
Look it up.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.380
I haven't.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.860
Because my super fucking Libra opinion

17:30.860 --> 17:32.740
is that there's upsides and downsides

17:32.740 --> 17:34.340
to male and female experience.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.660
I don't actually think there's a single definite answer

17:36.660 --> 17:38.500
to the vague and useless question,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.260
which gender has it worse?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.700
I consider myself a feminist

17:41.700 --> 17:43.700
because I support reproductive rights

17:43.700 --> 17:45.540
and I oppose workplace misogyny.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.100
And I generally agree with a lot of the activism

17:48.100 --> 17:50.180
that happens under the heading of feminism.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.700
But I also think a lot of men

17:51.700 --> 17:54.460
are just having a super fucking difficult time right now.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.340
And that must be super fucking hard for the main hour, yo.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.380
And I don't think feminists have an obligation

17:59.380 --> 18:00.700
to care about male acts,

18:01.420 --> 18:03.580
but I care about you boys.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.020
God, I'm such a cool girl.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.660
I think the entire Mid-Atlantic region

18:06.660 --> 18:07.900
is about to freeze over.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.500
No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.540
And I really try to understand other people's pain

18:13.540 --> 18:18.540
because I just find it really, really funny.

18:18.780 --> 18:21.660
I'm also really, really sobering up here.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.140
The drugs have worn off

18:23.140 --> 18:27.500
and I am suddenly feeling very naked.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.140
Like it's just now occurring to me

18:29.140 --> 18:32.180
that this is a highly inappropriate outfit

18:32.180 --> 18:33.380
for this occasion.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.900
So I'm going to go put on a robe

18:35.900 --> 18:39.220
and I'll meet you back for the next section.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.940
Postulate three, the man question.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.300
Hi, boys, et cetera, et cetera.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.460
Hey, how are you?

18:51.460 --> 18:53.300
For the last three years on this channel,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.420
I have been your vergil,

18:55.420 --> 18:57.500
leading you through gender hell,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.860
pickup artists, gender dysphoria,

18:59.860 --> 19:02.180
incels, radical feminists,

19:02.180 --> 19:04.940
non-binary genders, men's rights activists.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.140
It seems like everybody's having gender trouble.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.540
So what do we make of that?

19:09.540 --> 19:13.580
Well, Gorge, a very, very rational male philosopher

19:13.580 --> 19:17.340
named Hegel once said that the unfolding of history

19:17.340 --> 19:19.980
is a basically rational process, Gorge.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.380
That means that at any time in history,

19:22.380 --> 19:24.980
society is based on certain principles

19:24.980 --> 19:28.140
like all men are created equal

19:28.140 --> 19:30.180
as long as there's super fucking rich and white.

19:30.180 --> 19:33.100
And there's always contradictions within those principles,

19:33.100 --> 19:36.340
which creates tension and eventually leads to a rupture,

19:36.340 --> 19:39.500
like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized

19:39.500 --> 19:40.980
according to new principles.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.140
At least I think he was saying something like that.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.620
It's pretty hard to make anything out

19:44.620 --> 19:46.260
through the fog of his unreadable,

19:46.260 --> 19:48.100
hyper-abstract, man jabbering.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.020
God, I can't stand that shit.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.220
Or any of the other music-hating vole cells

19:52.220 --> 19:53.940
of the male philosophical tradition.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.460
My point is, I think our society has reached a place

19:56.460 --> 19:59.620
where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.700
Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working

20:01.700 --> 20:05.100
or how to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.980
We have mainstream feminists saying we need

20:06.980 --> 20:08.820
to continue advancing the rights of women.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.340
We have conservatives saying we need

20:10.340 --> 20:12.580
to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.100
We have an increasing number of people

20:14.100 --> 20:16.100
not identifying as men or women.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.380
We have TERFs who think that the transgenders

20:18.380 --> 20:20.300
are the single greatest threat to civilization.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.140
Hey, how are you?

20:21.140 --> 20:22.980
And we have men's rights activists saying

20:22.980 --> 20:24.980
we need a male equivalent to feminism

20:24.980 --> 20:27.820
to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.860
Now, I wanna focus on that last one

20:29.860 --> 20:32.660
because in principle, I agree.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.300
I've spent a lot of the last three years

20:34.300 --> 20:35.620
covering the manosphere.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.020
I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.980
And from all the time I've tortured myself

20:39.980 --> 20:42.140
waiting through these communities of incels,

20:42.140 --> 20:44.780
pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,

20:44.780 --> 20:48.340
intellectual dark web, fanboys, and alt-right racists,

20:48.340 --> 20:51.300
I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,

20:51.300 --> 20:54.700
which is that they all recruit from the same massive pool

20:54.700 --> 20:56.540
of sad young men.

20:56.540 --> 20:57.940
We all know the archetype.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.660
He has trouble relating to women.

20:59.660 --> 21:01.180
He has no strong friendship group.

21:01.180 --> 21:03.420
He's not excited about any long-term goals.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.140
And he fills the void with video games and porn.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.380
And just to clarify,

21:07.380 --> 21:10.020
I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.860
I'm not telling you what to do with your penis.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.020
You can rub one out to this video for all I care.

21:14.020 --> 21:16.340
Just don't pull a gamer key on me, okay?

21:17.780 --> 21:19.020
I live in fear.

21:19.020 --> 21:21.500
Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars

21:21.500 --> 21:23.060
inject their poison,

21:23.060 --> 21:25.300
most of these boys are not bad people.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.620
I think all of this originates

21:26.620 --> 21:29.060
in a genuine crisis of male identity.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.940
And I think it's happened in something

21:30.940 --> 21:33.300
like the way men's rights activists describe.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.820
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

21:35.820 --> 21:38.300
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.660
The traditional protector provider role of men

21:40.660 --> 21:42.820
is being replaced by a more equal

21:42.820 --> 21:44.700
and undefined gender dynamic.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.300
And college professors and activists are telling men

21:47.300 --> 21:50.220
that most of our culture's aspirational representations

21:50.220 --> 21:52.300
of manhood are toxic and bad.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.380
But without an attractive replacement vision

21:54.380 --> 21:56.500
of aspirational manhood,

21:56.500 --> 22:00.940
average young men can only envision their future as what?

22:00.940 --> 22:04.820
The beta, the cock, the new male.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.340
And in a post-left tube internet,

22:06.340 --> 22:08.860
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.540
And to be fair, it is very funny.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.820
But we forgot, especially us grills,

22:13.820 --> 22:14.860
that for a lot of men,

22:14.860 --> 22:18.820
these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.300
And a lot of leftists go,

22:20.300 --> 22:23.620
well, how can men be so angsty, especially white men?

22:23.620 --> 22:24.900
They're so privileged.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.740
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.740
If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle.

22:31.740 --> 22:35.220
You have something to fight for and therefore a purpose.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.580
But for a lot of men,

22:36.580 --> 22:40.020
their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.340
And that, along with the loneliness

22:42.340 --> 22:44.420
and the lack of a positive identity,

22:44.420 --> 22:46.660
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

22:46.660 --> 22:49.060
by the Manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

22:49.060 --> 22:51.980
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

22:51.980 --> 22:54.540
for the small but growing number of young men

22:54.540 --> 22:56.180
who decide to pick up a gun

22:56.180 --> 22:58.340
and open fire in a shopping center.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.260
There were two mass shootings during the weekend

23:00.260 --> 23:03.540
I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.260
Both shooters were young white men,

23:05.260 --> 23:07.420
and one of them posted about the shooting

23:07.420 --> 23:08.820
on an alt-right image board.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.220
Now, I don't pretend to fully understand

23:10.220 --> 23:11.780
the motives of mass shooters,

23:11.780 --> 23:13.600
but I don't think it's a coincidence

23:13.760 --> 23:15.520
that basically all of them are men.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.600
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

23:18.600 --> 23:21.200
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

23:21.200 --> 23:24.400
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory

23:24.400 --> 23:28.360
and therefore to be seen and recognized as men

23:28.360 --> 23:31.840
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.560
And of course, there's also the racism

23:33.560 --> 23:34.920
of the alt-right killers

23:34.920 --> 23:37.920
and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.520
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

23:41.520 --> 23:44.000
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

23:44.000 --> 23:45.880
are more receptive to learning it.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.320
So you can try to take down their forums

23:48.320 --> 23:51.400
and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,

23:51.400 --> 23:55.280
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

23:55.280 --> 23:57.960
I don't see any end to these problems.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.320
Theorem four, what do?

24:00.320 --> 24:03.120
There is this media narrative that has emerged

24:03.120 --> 24:05.120
around me and around this channel.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.200
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

24:07.200 --> 24:09.080
of media narrative about this channel

24:09.080 --> 24:11.400
is super fucking coconuts,

24:11.400 --> 24:13.120
because let's be real, Gorge,

24:13.120 --> 24:14.920
I just wanted to form milk on my face

24:14.920 --> 24:16.240
and talk about the mouthfeel.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.600
But there's this media narrative

24:17.600 --> 24:19.240
that my role in the discourse

24:19.240 --> 24:24.240
is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.160
And it's true that if you read

24:26.160 --> 24:28.480
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.880
I used to be alt-right posts are so common

24:30.880 --> 24:32.280
they're considered cliche.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.680
And some of them cite me as an influence

24:34.680 --> 24:35.960
in changing their politics,

24:35.960 --> 24:39.720
which I love for them and I'm super fucking happy about it,

24:39.720 --> 24:43.600
but it's also a lot of responsibility.

24:43.600 --> 24:48.120
They're my boys and I worry about my boys

24:48.120 --> 24:50.040
because in reality, it's not like they go

24:50.040 --> 24:52.840
from far-right extremists to complacent centrists.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.080
No, most of them go far left.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.760
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.720
So I watched them go from far to my right

24:59.720 --> 25:01.800
to significantly to my left.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.920
It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.880
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

25:06.880 --> 25:09.560
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.800
I worry about my boys because I don't think

25:12.800 --> 25:16.520
that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.120
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.440
You know, there's kind of two options

25:20.440 --> 25:22.340
the left has for disillusioned men.

25:22.340 --> 25:25.800
The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.600
We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,

25:28.600 --> 25:31.600
but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.880
So just join the revolution.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.840
It's gonna be super fucking crazy.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.360
We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow,

25:37.360 --> 25:41.600
smash no voting, and then things will be better for you.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.200
Now, I think that has a couple of limitations.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.920
One is that I look at the far left

25:46.920 --> 25:49.600
and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time

25:49.600 --> 25:52.240
accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges

25:52.240 --> 25:53.720
in closed Facebook groups.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.720
And I'm concerned that might not succeed

25:57.720 --> 26:00.080
at ending capitalism, meow, meow.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.960
Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

26:01.960 --> 26:03.480
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,

26:03.480 --> 26:06.080
but if you're investing all of your hopes

26:06.080 --> 26:08.560
on a capital R revolution,

26:08.560 --> 26:11.120
I worry that can become like waiting for Godot

26:11.120 --> 26:12.520
or waiting for the rapture.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.140
So we do need political change,

26:14.140 --> 26:18.080
but I feel like I'm failing my boys

26:18.080 --> 26:19.720
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

26:19.720 --> 26:21.920
that revolution is their only hope.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.200
Because here's the other thing.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.920
Even if we did succeed ending capitalism,

26:25.920 --> 26:27.140
there would still be gender.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.280
And my boys would still need some model

26:30.280 --> 26:33.500
of what it is to lead a good life as a man.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.140
Now, the other option the left has for disillusioned men

26:36.140 --> 26:38.340
is the feminist tranquilizer.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.420
We say, look, toxic masculinity

26:40.420 --> 26:43.040
is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.380
And it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.740
So while feminism tells women you hate your body

26:47.740 --> 26:49.260
and you're constantly doubting yourself

26:49.260 --> 26:52.940
because society did this to you and needs to change,

26:52.940 --> 26:54.740
we kind of just tell men,

26:54.740 --> 26:56.860
you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.

26:56.860 --> 26:57.780
Stop it.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.020
We tell them they're broken

26:59.020 --> 27:01.700
without really telling them how to fix themselves.

27:01.700 --> 27:06.180
I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood,

27:06.180 --> 27:07.300
which I don't think is something

27:07.300 --> 27:10.420
that women can create for men, even if they wanted to.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.380
And honestly, the best way for that to happen

27:12.380 --> 27:14.620
may actually be some kind of men's movement.

27:14.620 --> 27:17.300
But on the left, the whole idea of a men's movement

27:17.300 --> 27:20.900
is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know

27:20.900 --> 27:23.140
is basically just a backlash to feminism.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.320
And at worst, it's just straight up misogyny.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.860
And look, boys, I understand that being lectured

27:28.860 --> 27:31.220
about man spreading for most of 2015

27:31.220 --> 27:32.900
was super fucking hard for you

27:32.900 --> 27:34.340
and you're still mad about it,

27:34.340 --> 27:36.820
but posting endless outrage porn

27:36.820 --> 27:40.100
about false rape accusations and paternity fraud

27:40.100 --> 27:42.580
isn't actually gonna make life any better for you.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.820
Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen,

27:45.820 --> 27:49.060
but they're not systemic issues that affect most men.

27:49.060 --> 27:52.460
I think what would actually improve life for most men

27:52.460 --> 27:56.340
is a positive ideal of 21st century manhood.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.700
But that's not something I can give to you

27:58.700 --> 28:01.000
because in case you hadn't noticed,

28:01.020 --> 28:03.080
I'm literally a fucking woman.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.720
I can't mom you through this one, boys, you're on your own.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.200
You have to help each other.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.600
So find each other in the comments section,

28:09.600 --> 28:12.600
meet up on Reddit, make friends, clean your room,

28:12.600 --> 28:14.840
leave the house, fuck each other.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.040
I don't know, it's worth a try.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.120
And feeling that,

28:20.300 --> 28:23.440
you could always throw in the towel and become a woman.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.380
Worked for me.

28:25.260 --> 28:26.080
There it is!

28:26.080 --> 28:26.900
So yes.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.320
It was hyper sculptures.

28:32.020 --> 28:45.600
We had

29:15.600 --> 29:22.600
I'm just trying to give like malady energy.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.760
Yeah, it is, it's really, it is English, it's very John McLean, very Quentin Crisp, very

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
aristocrat.

29:27.760 --> 29:31.440
I'm super fucking naked right now, that's crazy.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.680
That's super fucking crazy.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.960
According to traditional gender roles, men are useful for their labor and women are useful

29:37.960 --> 29:38.960
for their wombs.

29:38.960 --> 29:44.080
Well, I'm a woman without a womb, so I guess I'm useless, but I'm beautifully useless.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.400
Ugh, I'm a work of art.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.480
The problem with our society is we've turned men into women.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
It's disgusting.

29:50.480 --> 29:57.520
As an ally to men, it's not my place to speak for them or speak over them, but I just want

29:57.520 --> 30:06.040
to use my platform to uplift some male voices who might not have as many subscribers as

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
me.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.040
Okay.

30:09.040 --> 30:14.720
And I'm not hypergamous, I don't need a rich husband.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.720
If I may quote Cher, I don't need a rich man.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.720
I am a rich man.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.680
It's not even really much of an insult being called a delusional man.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.680
Many great books have been written by delusional men.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.680
So bad.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.680
I'm bad.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.440
I'm really bad.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.800
Okay.
