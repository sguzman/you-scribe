WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.260
God

00:07.000 --> 00:11.300
God, say this in his name

00:13.460 --> 00:15.960
God, say this in his name

00:16.480 --> 00:18.840
English

00:18.840 --> 00:20.760
English

00:20.760 --> 00:23.000
me esandy

00:23.000 --> 00:31.440
Oh, hey, Quarch, hey, how are you, Quarch?

00:31.440 --> 00:34.400
Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.

00:34.400 --> 00:39.160
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine, well, fair enough.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.720
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

00:42.720 --> 00:43.720
How about this?

00:43.720 --> 00:48.040
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off, but first, you have to let me tell

00:48.040 --> 00:49.440
you my life story.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
Fair?

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
That's super fucking great.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.960
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.840
I'll start at the beginning.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.160
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

00:59.160 --> 01:03.400
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C., where the most exciting attraction for children

01:03.400 --> 01:05.440
is the National Museum of Natural History.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.120
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who, might I add, deserve

01:10.120 --> 01:13.360
their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.680
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong, I liked a good Stegosaurus

01:17.680 --> 01:22.840
as much as the next five-year-old, but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.100
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.720
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.960
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.120
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up for my sixth-grade teacher,

01:36.120 --> 01:39.200
Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
Fuck you, Romano.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.160
I'm glad your father died.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.720
Comrades, losers, and haters.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.680
I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion,

01:50.680 --> 01:54.360
or music, begins with absolute pleasure.

01:54.360 --> 01:59.380
You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.880
Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
Yes, god.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.840
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

02:07.840 --> 02:13.280
Northern Virginia is McMansion country, and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

02:13.280 --> 02:17.600
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan, looking at some stylistically jumbled

02:17.600 --> 02:22.920
monstrosities, and I would get excited by some little detail, like, say, a circle of

02:22.920 --> 02:25.280
fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.440
But then my mom would say, look at this ostentatious trash.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
So you learn.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.000
You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.160
And with taste comes all this adult baggage, snobbery, and pretense and conceit.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.280
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers, but I assure you, I have nothing

02:44.280 --> 02:45.280
to do with taste.

02:45.280 --> 02:50.320
I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.680
So stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee, before you pass sentence, allow

02:56.680 --> 02:58.160
me to make my case, gorge.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
One.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
Success.

03:12.160 --> 03:22.280
Oh, hey, how are you, gorge?

03:22.280 --> 03:24.280
Look, I like stuff.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.840
I like shiny things.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.200
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.880
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.120
There's a social context for it.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.440
It generally means something.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.600
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace, married a Turkmenistani dictator

03:43.600 --> 03:45.480
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

03:45.480 --> 03:50.360
Well, because he's trying to send a message, maybe to the world, maybe to himself.

03:50.360 --> 03:57.520
He's saying, behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.360
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power, from the pharaohs of

04:01.360 --> 04:06.280
Egypt, to the kings of France, to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.520
I guess God likes shiny things too.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.400
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.040
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.080
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.240
In the words of Drake,

04:23.240 --> 04:26.000
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.880
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's back in here.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.400
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
You've made it.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
You're rich, bitch.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.920
Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

04:39.920 --> 04:44.040
The character J. Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them

04:44.040 --> 04:48.920
anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
worth something.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.360
And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to

04:54.360 --> 04:55.960
save the Hall of Hrolfgar.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.880
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of

04:59.880 --> 05:04.080
The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.640
I got a D minus.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
I like dollars.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
I like diamonds.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
I like money.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
I like shining.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
I like those Balenciagas.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
Fuck.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.760
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all

05:15.760 --> 05:19.040
that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.400
Let's talk about symbols.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.560
Let's talk about allegory.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.160
Let's talk about metaphor.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.160
Let's talk about themes.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.560
Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.

05:29.560 --> 05:34.520
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.040
That's the American dream.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.480
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.480
It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind

05:44.480 --> 05:45.800
of success is really improbable.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.960
Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say, rap music is a reason

05:50.960 --> 05:53.640
for the problems with the blacks?

05:53.640 --> 05:58.240
For conservatives, the American dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

05:58.240 --> 06:03.080
And is there any sector of our culture where the American dream is more unironically celebrated

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
than hip-hop?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.200
It's not just hip-hop, though.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.160
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.920
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and

06:12.920 --> 06:15.800
the Fendi and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.480
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,

06:21.480 --> 06:24.600
to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.480
Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care and replace it with a large-scale

06:28.480 --> 06:31.920
figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.520
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese

06:35.520 --> 06:37.960
furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.040
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

06:40.040 --> 06:43.080
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.680
We have standards in this country.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.280
Listen up, America.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.160
We live in a society, a society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

06:51.160 --> 06:55.000
Not of climbers, but of...graspers.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.640
To paraphrase Ian Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone cannot.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.520
And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.600
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.440
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.360
Not all the rich people, that's for sure.

07:14.360 --> 07:19.080
So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also

07:19.080 --> 07:25.400
so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well, what's the average person supposed

07:25.400 --> 07:27.000
to do?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.200
Two.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.400
Fantasy.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.720
I wish the world were my gem collection.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.840
I wish I owned everything.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.080
I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?

07:38.080 --> 07:42.120
I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.160
Okay, that's super fucking great, but can I buy it?

07:45.160 --> 07:47.160
Well, no, I can't buy it.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.520
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.000
So what do you do?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.280
Well, you fake it.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.680
You create an illusion.

07:56.680 --> 08:01.120
I don't own this building, and you droop off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here,

08:01.120 --> 08:03.720
as indeed you did, but that's okay.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
I need a witness.

08:04.720 --> 08:10.480
I need you to see me here, among the other art, where I belong.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.000
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.760
It makes me feel valuable.

08:15.760 --> 08:22.120
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.880
Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.760
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

08:28.760 --> 08:34.760
The phrase opulence you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Opulence.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.760
Op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly, op-o-ly.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.840
But it originally comes from the documentary Paris is Burning, up at the Harlem Ballroom

08:41.840 --> 08:44.720
Culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by M.C.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
Jr.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
LaBeija.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E, opulence.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
You own everything.

08:48.720 --> 08:58.560
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.

08:58.560 --> 09:02.680
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer, black, and Latin American participants of

09:02.680 --> 09:03.680
the Bulls,

09:03.680 --> 09:07.760
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.280
Some of them don't even eat.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.280
So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour, an illusion created by skillful

09:14.280 --> 09:15.680
artifice.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.780
Participants walk categories like executive realness, with the goal of being indistinguishable

09:19.780 --> 09:21.520
from a real executive.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.800
Nowadays every white queer says the word realness, I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.280
I mean, who's among us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state, dressed up

09:31.280 --> 09:36.400
as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children, and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne

09:36.400 --> 09:38.040
Gacy realness, hunty.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.600
I did it officer, I did the cultural appropriation.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.800
I am a colonizer, I am part of the problem, and I'm sorry.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.280
Take me away boys.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
That's crazy.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.280
That's mega coconuts.

09:49.280 --> 09:54.280
I guess I should explain that American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up

09:54.280 --> 09:56.040
model of linguistics.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.800
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.160
Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays, and then finally white

10:04.160 --> 10:05.720
cisheads start using them.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.440
A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.440
So originally realness, as Chanté put it,

10:12.440 --> 10:17.680
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume, but a treasure-comic disguise of

10:17.680 --> 10:23.760
the chasm between what is being emulated and what is absent, namely racial justice, class

10:23.760 --> 10:26.120
equality, and safety.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.840
Realness in that sense is a much more complicated and interesting concept than the generic trans

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
notion of passing.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.000
Realness is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy biogirl.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.320
Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.960
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle that has been unjustly kept

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
beyond your reach.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.920
You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.440
And therefore you're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.080
If I had the opportunity, I could be one, because I can look like one.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.160
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture, such as

11:01.160 --> 11:06.200
the FX drama Pose, which is said during the era, is that it dramatizes an essential truth

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
about America.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.160
It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel like they're

11:11.160 --> 11:14.360
living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.080
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.480
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace are designed to make

11:22.480 --> 11:26.760
you feel like a fancy bitch, even though they're actually just high-rise traps designed to

11:26.760 --> 11:28.040
lure you in and take your money.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.200
And if there's one thing I can't stand…

11:32.160 --> 11:35.160
…it's traps.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.760
But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American is to want to feel like

11:42.760 --> 11:44.120
a fancy bitch.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.440
I actually love Vegas.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.720
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber, Lindsay Ellis's Bachelorette party.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.680
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.960
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s, I did once experience the first exciting stages

11:57.960 --> 11:59.200
of a gambling habit.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.280
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity, and had some good luck playing

12:03.280 --> 12:04.280
Blackjack.

12:04.280 --> 12:08.480
I mean, I wasn't a high-ruler or anything, but my first time I walked out with an extra

12:08.480 --> 12:09.480
$200.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.240
And that was a lot of money to me.

12:11.240 --> 12:16.840
At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour, so to make $200 in

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
five minutes.

12:17.840 --> 12:24.280
But that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing customer service toil before taxes.

12:24.280 --> 12:29.360
So I went back, and I went back, but I never got lucky again, and fortunately that was

12:29.360 --> 12:30.840
enough to discourage me.

12:30.840 --> 12:35.480
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino, I saw this man standing outside with this

12:35.480 --> 12:40.120
look on his face that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

12:40.120 --> 12:46.040
Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.800
The kind of face that says, I'm going to have to explain to my wife that I spent the

12:49.800 --> 12:52.920
kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.

12:52.920 --> 12:57.480
And there is nothing opulent about that, nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs

12:57.480 --> 13:00.920
with IV drips trying to pay off their hospital bills.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.960
America, we are a bad country.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.960
Donald Trump is a Vegas man, he's pulling this grift on the entire country.

13:08.960 --> 13:14.440
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream is more enchanting to

13:14.440 --> 13:19.040
the imagination than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.600
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell, but in fact there are two

13:23.600 --> 13:26.000
very different types of magic at work.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.400
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex, a demonstration of their wealth and

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
power.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.520
But for the marginalized and impoverished, opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and

13:35.520 --> 13:37.320
power they've been denied.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.840
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function, it's like the difference between

13:41.840 --> 13:45.800
a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
3.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
Class.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.000
Hey how are you?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.320
Hey how are you?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.520
Hey how are you?

13:53.520 --> 13:55.120
Hey how are you?

13:55.120 --> 13:57.960
People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.680
You know, a biological female that looks like me, I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is

14:02.680 --> 14:06.160
gonna sneak in through a rear window and I'll have to dial him for murder.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.280
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.640
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.400
As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to and I oop

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
and I oop and I oop.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
That's praxis.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.000
Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat, whomst?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Who is she?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.600
Where's her summer collection?

14:25.600 --> 14:28.040
That's super fucking great but can't I buy it?

14:28.040 --> 14:31.760
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.

14:31.760 --> 14:37.120
Now I could be out of touch, but personally, I've never met a factory worker, or a factory

14:37.120 --> 14:38.120
owner for that matter.

14:38.120 --> 14:42.720
They must all be on a brand trip to China, working on the BMP summer collection.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.120
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles is that the bougies own the

14:46.120 --> 14:49.000
means of production and the proles work for wages.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.920
But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.280
What about YouTubers?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.320
Which side of the revolution are we on?

14:55.320 --> 14:58.920
I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here, cause if the revolution starts on Twitter,

14:58.920 --> 15:02.600
my head is definitely going in the basket, and then I'll have no choice but to do the

15:02.600 --> 15:04.440
conservative talk show circuit.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.280
You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.960
Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, ayo!

15:10.960 --> 15:15.240
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.320
My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class, A Guide Through the

15:19.320 --> 15:23.560
American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.

15:23.560 --> 15:28.320
Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,

15:28.320 --> 15:31.480
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.640
Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.

15:35.640 --> 15:40.440
Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

15:40.440 --> 15:43.920
but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.840
And it's also just pretty funny, like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher

15:47.840 --> 15:52.040
your social class, the smaller the balls in the sports you play, or his description of

15:52.040 --> 15:53.960
middle class living rooms.

15:53.960 --> 15:59.040
Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines on

15:59.040 --> 16:05.040
its coffee tables, otherwise expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas

16:05.040 --> 16:06.040
might result.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.880
One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your

16:09.880 --> 16:12.400
class so much as how you got your money.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.640
If you had to work for your money, then you're not really upper class.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.960
The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident, they

16:20.960 --> 16:23.320
don't feel the need to prove themselves.

16:23.320 --> 16:28.120
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the latter, but

16:28.120 --> 16:32.960
then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their insecurities

16:32.960 --> 16:38.320
by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper stickers on the back

16:38.320 --> 16:39.320
of the family car.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.960
This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

16:41.960 --> 16:46.240
The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but the middle classes are all

16:46.240 --> 16:50.080
affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.

16:50.080 --> 16:55.680
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove, whether

16:55.680 --> 17:00.160
it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves, or the new rich

17:00.160 --> 17:03.240
building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.720
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.

17:05.720 --> 17:10.680
He inherited his wealth, so he should know better than to have golden faucets.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.840
But he doesn't.

17:11.840 --> 17:17.320
As Fran Lebowitz said, he's a poor person's idea of a rich person, and that's actually

17:17.320 --> 17:18.320
his charm.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.360
It's part of his mass appeal.

17:20.360 --> 17:23.080
Trump behaves like a pro who won the lottery.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.600
So there's actually something kind of relatable, unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about

17:27.600 --> 17:29.200
the golden faucets.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.560
People who have wealth, but not class, are actually very popular in this country.

17:34.560 --> 17:38.920
We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.240
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves.

17:42.240 --> 17:47.560
So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone, even though in practice it isn't.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.320
Now the upper class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people, are mostly

17:52.320 --> 17:54.120
very unlike Trump.

17:54.120 --> 17:59.200
Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy, they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic

17:59.200 --> 18:02.440
wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

18:02.440 --> 18:06.560
Fuzzled notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.800
They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.760
They dress down while traveling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.160
These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.440
If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.400
Or they might get enfiest and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.560
Or worse, taxation.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.480
Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.800
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class is dying out.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.680
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.

18:40.680 --> 18:45.440
His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want, so long as you

18:45.440 --> 18:47.240
have the cash to back it up.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.840
So the old class system is dying out, and in its place, we have universally adopted

18:51.840 --> 18:53.920
the mindset of the nouveau riche.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.040
If you got it, flaunt it.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.240
If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.520
Now I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,

19:03.520 --> 19:10.320
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.320
4.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.320
Taste

19:13.960 --> 19:15.760
Listen, comrades.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.160
I have been pretty down on opulence so far, and I could continue analyzing it in terms

19:20.160 --> 19:24.720
of inequality and class struggle, but you already know all that.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.600
That's why you came to cut my head off.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.440
But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?

19:30.440 --> 19:32.360
Marxist economic analysis?

19:32.360 --> 19:35.880
Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?

19:35.880 --> 19:39.080
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

19:39.400 --> 19:44.640
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media

19:44.640 --> 19:48.680
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.480
So what about the enjoyment part?

19:50.480 --> 19:53.520
Surely you wouldn't be had a queen just for liking shiny thing.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.880
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

19:55.880 --> 20:00.600
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen, Freulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlena

20:00.600 --> 20:05.920
Kennedy Davenport-Kunt, said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested, that is, completely

20:05.920 --> 20:07.760
free of any material desire.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.360
Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement, so I don't know how seriously

20:12.360 --> 20:13.360
we want to take that.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.000
But it's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense, that it

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys, which is really just a

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.240
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos

20:28.240 --> 20:31.040
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.040
What must that be like?

20:32.040 --> 20:35.720
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart that must be super fucking

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
hard for them.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
I can't even imagine.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.160
I mean, it makes sense, really.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.800
Straight men don't have these problems.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.360
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years and never had to think about it.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.960
I guess Nietzsche is the exception.

20:46.960 --> 20:52.360
He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel, and let's be honest, definitely

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
a chaser.

20:53.360 --> 20:58.000
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the respectable English

20:58.000 --> 20:59.840
gentleman Oscar Wilde.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
According to Wilde,

21:00.840 --> 21:06.520
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.860
This is a fault.

21:07.860 --> 21:12.440
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.400
For these, there is hope.

21:14.400 --> 21:19.240
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.840
Spoken like a poet, you want to be cultivated, don't you?

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.720
Look, I'll play it your way.

21:25.720 --> 21:31.160
Let's swing back to the other side of the sarcasian pendulum here.

21:31.160 --> 21:35.480
As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that, but from

21:35.480 --> 21:41.280
a strictly sociological perspective, I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related

21:41.280 --> 21:42.280
to power.

21:42.280 --> 21:46.360
When you go to a museum, you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting

21:46.360 --> 21:47.720
that makes them appear magical.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.480
Now, that's also what you do in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but the difference is that at

21:51.480 --> 21:55.640
the museum, you can't buy anything, and that turns out to be important.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.640
For Kantian reasons.

21:56.640 --> 22:02.600
In the retail context of commodity fetishism, you correlate your aesthetic taste with material

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
desire.

22:03.600 --> 22:08.320
Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything, you feel like your aesthetic

22:08.320 --> 22:12.560
pleasure is pure, that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.960
But of course, that's an illusion.

22:14.960 --> 22:19.520
The museum is the context, and the context is telling you that the things you're looking

22:19.520 --> 22:20.920
at are art.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.320
So whoever decides what's in the museum decides what good taste is.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
What's beautiful?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.320
What's valuable?

22:27.320 --> 22:30.520
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

22:30.520 --> 22:35.200
Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre, conferring upon themselves

22:35.200 --> 22:38.560
the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.520
But it's not just a flex, it means something more than that because of the racial disparity

22:43.520 --> 22:45.680
between the performers and the setting.

22:45.680 --> 22:50.680
Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre, so seeing Jay

22:50.680 --> 22:55.920
and Bea there looking so regal, with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European

22:55.920 --> 22:58.440
art, it's like a full moment.

22:58.440 --> 23:03.440
A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
classical art.

23:04.440 --> 23:09.360
That's why trans women love that picture, someone photoshopped of the Three Graces but

23:09.360 --> 23:10.360
with dicks.

23:10.360 --> 23:15.280
I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me, because here in

23:15.280 --> 23:19.720
the west, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've

23:19.720 --> 23:21.480
seen it sculpted in white marble.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.600
Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.

23:25.600 --> 23:31.320
For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness

23:31.320 --> 23:36.440
of classical statues was the distinguishing feature of western sculpture, proof of the

23:36.440 --> 23:39.120
elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.640
In reality, of course it turns out they were painted the colors of something a drag queen

23:42.640 --> 23:44.520
might wear to Joaquin Sanyera.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.400
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues for hundreds of years but

23:48.400 --> 23:52.520
were totally in denial about it because the pure whiteness of these figures was like

23:52.520 --> 23:54.000
a sacred dogma.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.800
Margaret Talba in The New Yorker attributes the dogma in part to

23:57.800 --> 24:04.160
A tendency to equate whiteness with beauty, taste, and classical ideals, and to see color

24:04.160 --> 24:08.480
as alien, sensual, and garish.

24:08.480 --> 24:14.720
In 2008, Fabio Barry, an art historian who is now at Stanford, complained that a boldly

24:14.720 --> 24:20.800
colored re-creation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum looked like

24:20.800 --> 24:23.080
a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.640
Hey, how are you?

24:25.640 --> 24:30.640
And you just know that when the news first broke, some horrified wasp classicists turned

24:30.640 --> 24:37.800
to a colleague and said, oh Kingsley, it looks… it looks Mexican.

24:37.800 --> 24:42.680
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues, some art historians have been

24:42.680 --> 24:46.960
harassed by the alt-right, who don't take kindly to anyone questioning their white

24:46.960 --> 24:48.960
supremacist myths about antiquity.

24:48.960 --> 24:54.960
There's some pretty insidious, uh, identitarian prejudices here, hiding out under the cloak

24:54.960 --> 24:56.320
of taste.

24:56.320 --> 25:01.440
Good taste for upper and middle-class white people generally includes a reflexive disdain

25:01.440 --> 25:04.800
for anything a little bit too… colorful.

25:04.800 --> 25:11.880
It's these classes that constantly use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

25:11.880 --> 25:16.440
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce, The History of Leopard Print, observes that

25:16.440 --> 25:21.960
Tacky, as a concept, refers to the lack of cultivation or the resistance to taste and

25:21.960 --> 25:26.320
more often than not refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.

25:26.320 --> 25:33.400
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic, queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.440
not business-like, not serious.

25:36.440 --> 25:42.240
Aesthetic excess, particularly of colors, patterns, and bling, is especially offensive

25:42.240 --> 25:44.240
to conservative wasp taste.

25:44.240 --> 25:50.160
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free, where the heart is, where the soul is,

25:50.160 --> 25:51.160
and where the fun is.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.640
Well, that's good news, because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.640
I can't imagine why.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.240
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.560
Or camp.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.560
People call me camp, and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.400
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.560
Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala, and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite

26:10.560 --> 26:15.080
intellectuals competing to outwit each other with the most erudite definition of what camp

26:15.080 --> 26:16.080
really is.

26:16.080 --> 26:19.320
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

26:19.320 --> 26:24.840
The first I'll call coward camp, this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.640
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.920
This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.680
You think you're safe from criticism because your look is bad on purpose.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.040
Fuck that.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.920
Take a stand, you pussy bitch.

26:38.920 --> 26:43.840
I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident, and Susan Sontag

26:43.840 --> 26:44.960
agrees with me.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.120
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

26:47.120 --> 26:49.880
Naive and deliberate camp.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.600
Pure camp is always naive.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.240
Camp which knows itself to be camp, or camping is usually less satisfying.

26:57.240 --> 27:03.320
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness, a grand artistic vision that gets a little

27:03.320 --> 27:06.160
out of control and enters into absurd territory.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.200
Hey, how are you?

27:08.200 --> 27:12.520
I don't know, my philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.680
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.840
I think my aesthetic is good.

27:17.840 --> 27:21.880
This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.

27:21.880 --> 27:27.000
I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.600
One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.440
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

27:36.440 --> 27:41.440
I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.920
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

27:44.920 --> 27:49.000
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.640
Why am I so tacky?

27:50.640 --> 27:55.640
I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.

27:55.640 --> 28:00.160
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now bitch.

28:00.160 --> 28:04.440
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

28:04.440 --> 28:09.960
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, ooh, sweaty, you'd better start

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
a revolution.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.240
Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey, how are you?

28:13.240 --> 28:15.240
Chicks with bread.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.640
5.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.640
Glamour.

28:19.640 --> 28:24.200
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour, at least those of us who came of

28:24.200 --> 28:25.200
age in the 1960s.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.800
In the most basic everyday sense, glam is a way of styling yourself.

28:29.800 --> 28:35.600
It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup, it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,

28:35.600 --> 28:37.400
it's posing like a fashion model.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.640
But originally the word glamour comes from the Scottish word grammery, meaning magic

28:41.640 --> 28:43.160
or enchantment.

28:43.160 --> 28:48.240
And glamour still involves a kind of illusion, or charm, cast on a spectator.

28:48.240 --> 28:53.800
The connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay, Viva MacGlam?

28:53.800 --> 28:59.360
Is transgenderism a critique of, or capitulation to, opulence-driven glamour models by transgender

28:59.360 --> 29:05.120
writer and underground house music producer Terry Tamletz, aka DJ Sprinkles?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.120
Sprinkles writes,

29:06.120 --> 29:11.480
Europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes

29:11.480 --> 29:16.560
with glimpses of heaven on earth, a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could

29:16.560 --> 29:18.880
only be the result of divination.

29:18.880 --> 29:23.760
It is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour, which is more

29:23.760 --> 29:27.600
associated with wealth than magic.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.400
Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour, or grammery, that was associated with witchcraft,

29:32.400 --> 29:34.560
paganism, and sexual deviancy.

29:34.560 --> 29:40.000
But in our capitalist society, glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often

29:40.000 --> 29:42.400
a fantasy of a lavish life.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.440
For example, a lot of dry queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating

29:46.440 --> 29:52.320
celebrities, thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses, pop stars, and models secondhand.

29:52.320 --> 29:56.720
Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of secondhand glamour acquires its power from

29:56.720 --> 29:59.440
unquestioned social hierarchies.

29:59.440 --> 30:05.200
Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance,

30:05.200 --> 30:06.960
not social integration.

30:06.960 --> 30:12.440
The promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation, but individual

30:12.440 --> 30:17.040
transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.

30:17.040 --> 30:23.480
It is the promise of an individual's class mobility, not social betterment or class critique.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.200
It is, by and large, the American Dream.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.440
Now I have to admit, this is a version of the American Dream that hits pretty close

30:31.440 --> 30:32.640
to home for me.

30:32.640 --> 30:36.760
The overarching plotline of my whole entire YouTube gender journey is that I used to be

30:36.760 --> 30:37.760
a tragic mess.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.840
And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started this channel I was a broke, gender-dysphoric,

30:42.840 --> 30:45.160
alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.

30:45.160 --> 30:49.400
I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance

30:49.400 --> 30:50.400
at.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.880
And now, I mean, look at me.

30:51.880 --> 30:52.880
Look how far I've come.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.240
I look like a moderately talented female impersonator.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.560
Hey, how are you?

30:56.560 --> 31:00.040
Those first several months of transition, though, they were rough.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.880
I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.

31:01.880 --> 31:06.480
I used to get laughed out of restaurants, and I was so proud that I wouldn't let anyone

31:06.480 --> 31:09.200
see how much that stuff hurt me, you know?

31:09.200 --> 31:13.080
I would say, well fuck them, I know I'm great.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.120
And then I'd go cry my eyes out, alone in my car.

31:16.120 --> 31:21.200
And I was a YouTuber that whole time too, which, I mean, the cyberbullying alone.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.720
I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you haven't been in that situation.

31:26.720 --> 31:31.960
You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice, picking apart your face and body,

31:31.960 --> 31:35.760
clocking your clothes and makeup, digging up your past, trying to deduce the nature

31:35.760 --> 31:38.640
of your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull.

31:38.640 --> 31:46.120
A lot of it is hilarious to me now, but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.960
But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up like it was the cure for cancer.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.880
Like my life depended on it.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.200
Which is basically how it felt.

31:55.200 --> 32:00.800
Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as, as one tweeter put it,

32:00.800 --> 32:03.160
cripplingly obsessed with passing.

32:03.160 --> 32:08.760
And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me, but glam, to me, is not about

32:08.760 --> 32:09.760
passing.

32:09.760 --> 32:14.280
I think I actually pass better in no makeup than I do in eyeshadow out to here.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.680
You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here, and people think she's just really

32:17.680 --> 32:23.600
into makeup or Instagram or cosplay or something, but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,

32:23.600 --> 32:27.440
which serves to call more attention to my situation.

32:27.440 --> 32:34.160
But on YouTube, I mean, clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.240
Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway, so what's the point?

32:36.240 --> 32:42.120
I would describe this presentation as female impersonator, and that's basically what I

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
am.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
A female, female impersonator.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.200
And I present this way because it's fun, I find it artistically fulfilling, and let's

32:49.200 --> 32:53.880
be honest, there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of larger-than-life

32:53.880 --> 32:54.880
superwoman.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.480
But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.480
As Sprinkles says,

32:58.480 --> 33:04.360
Glamour offers a strange overperformance of gender signifiers, a tenuously woven layer

33:04.360 --> 33:09.720
of superfemininity which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered

33:09.720 --> 33:10.720
body beneath.

33:11.160 --> 33:17.000
Now a lot of leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility

33:17.000 --> 33:21.200
represented by glamour, as well as by transition glow-up narratives.

33:21.200 --> 33:26.800
And I think that disillusionment and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of

33:26.800 --> 33:32.680
this intense anger and resentment I've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens,

33:32.680 --> 33:38.360
for glamorous trans Instagram models, and let's be honest, for me.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.960
Here's Sprinkles one more time.

33:39.960 --> 33:44.960
As long as an MTF's public acceptance is gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous

33:44.960 --> 33:50.040
body and style requirements that elude most quote, real women, then I'll have to ask

33:50.040 --> 33:55.840
you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling represented by RuPaul any more

33:55.840 --> 34:01.040
than my mother feels represented by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.440
A lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world a fantasy all

34:05.440 --> 34:06.440
the time.

34:06.440 --> 34:09.560
They want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that shit.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.040
They're fed up with glamour.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.480
They're fed up with realness.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.000
They're fed up with RuPaul.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.080
And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.480
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.480
Six.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.760
Envy.

34:21.760 --> 34:27.680
The Marxist art critic John Berger called glamour the happiness of being envied.

34:27.680 --> 34:30.880
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.

34:30.880 --> 34:35.560
It depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.160
But being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.760
The actual experience of being envied sucks.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.800
This is the risk of opulence.

34:44.800 --> 34:49.080
It invites not just enchanted admiration, but also envy.

34:49.080 --> 34:54.840
And where envy goes, the guillotine follows, or at least vindictive taxation.

34:54.840 --> 34:59.560
This is why the experienced rich note a tone down the opulence, build a nice high wall

34:59.560 --> 35:03.760
around their properties, and make a lot of high profile charitable donations.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.760
We can call this kind of strategizing the public relations of success.

35:07.760 --> 35:12.040
It certainly helps to have a rags to riches story, especially if you can make other people

35:12.040 --> 35:15.160
feel included in some way in your success.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.600
That's part of the appeal of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems to elevate not just a single

35:19.600 --> 35:22.560
performer but an entire underclass.

35:22.560 --> 35:28.280
Conversely, being perceived as exclusionary, elitist, or snobbish is going to cost you

35:28.280 --> 35:30.960
big in terms of envy management.

35:30.960 --> 35:35.880
YouTube music critic Todd in the Shadows did a review of Ariana Grande's song Seven Rings,

35:35.880 --> 35:40.880
in which he basically drags Ariana, who apparently is white, for appropriating a bunch of hip-hop

35:40.880 --> 35:45.520
rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom.

35:45.520 --> 35:51.280
She's not showcasing a triumph over adversity, she's just a white girl who likes stuff.

35:51.280 --> 35:55.480
We started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

35:55.480 --> 36:00.960
So in Todd's words, this song is a grotesque, bullying, VIP-only privilege flex of a mean

36:00.960 --> 36:03.120
girl shoving her wealth in your face.

36:03.160 --> 36:07.080
I actually like that song, but I'm into that sort of thing.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.080
Believe me, mommy.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.080
Aww.

36:09.080 --> 36:14.480
Fellow students, as a case study in the public relations of success and envy management,

36:14.480 --> 36:20.400
let us compare and contrast two successful YouTubers, Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.880
There's enough similarities between them for the differences to be interesting.

36:23.880 --> 36:28.600
They're both LGB and orty, they're both white, they're both blonde sometimes, they're both

36:28.600 --> 36:33.080
feminine, they're both rich, and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles.

36:33.080 --> 36:40.360
But nonetheless, people basically seem to like Jeffree Star, whereas Gigi, well, I don't

36:40.360 --> 36:44.240
want to say people don't like her, but they don't relate to her.

36:44.240 --> 36:50.280
The best example of this is her 2017 video, I Wear Walmart for a Week, with its gasp-inducing

36:50.280 --> 36:51.960
life-to-dislike ratio.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.200
Let's analyze what went wrong here.

36:54.200 --> 36:59.480
So for today's video, I thought we would take it to a place I've never been, Walmart.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.440
So that's a bad start, Gorge.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.560
Most Americans have been to Walmart.

37:03.560 --> 37:07.920
Never having been marks your upbringing as upper middle class at least.

37:07.920 --> 37:12.080
Treating going to Walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes across as you and

37:12.080 --> 37:16.080
your rich friends being like, what if we pretend to be poor for a day?

37:16.080 --> 37:19.280
I wonder if we're going to see any people at Walmart, you know that website?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.280
Baby's crying.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
The trauma.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.280
Gigi, no!

37:22.760 --> 37:26.040
You need to turn the shade down like 20 notches, Gorge.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.040
I keep picking my shin on this cart.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
I'm literally going to have bruises.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.440
Can someone remake these carts, please?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.440
It's dangerous.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.440
They're going to cut your head off, Gorge.

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
What should we get next?

37:42.640 --> 37:44.640
Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?

37:44.640 --> 37:46.280
Do they sell gowns here?

37:46.280 --> 37:51.520
This to me is Peak Gigi, strolling down the aisles of Walmart with a 2-liter bottle of

37:51.520 --> 37:56.720
Mountain Dew that she plucked from the shelves saying, I need something for a red carpet.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.720
Do they have gowns here?

37:58.720 --> 38:02.000
This to me is an iconic fashion moment.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.320
This is naive camp.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.320
This is everything.

38:04.320 --> 38:09.240
The idea that she has privileges that other people don't has never once crossed her mind.

38:09.240 --> 38:13.760
And that is a very special, precious thing that I want to cherish.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.920
Personally, I have no choice but to stand.

38:15.920 --> 38:21.120
The YouTube comments section, however, is not as amused as I am, nor as forgiving.

38:21.120 --> 38:24.600
This is the second time I've done a close reading of a Gigi video.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.120
It's getting kind of weird.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.120
Also why hasn't she answered my letters?

38:28.120 --> 38:29.720
Step on my throat, mommy.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.240
Now let's look at Jeffree Star.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.000
Jeffree does similar kinds of videos to Gigi.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.440
He's even done his own video wearing Walmart for a day, which people loved.

38:37.440 --> 38:42.640
Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in public perception is to scream SACISM.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.160
And there's maybe a little of that going on.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.320
I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly

38:49.320 --> 38:50.800
more than that going on here.

38:50.800 --> 38:56.280
Jeffree's fans are, I assume mostly women and not rich women, regular women.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.440
The women who work at the dollar store love him.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.360
I'm like your biggest fan.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.160
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer

39:04.160 --> 39:09.320
bags and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.

39:09.320 --> 39:13.840
It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about

39:13.840 --> 39:15.320
the extremely wealthy.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.880
The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self made.

39:18.880 --> 39:22.080
He represents himself as having started from the bottom.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.880
You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing and just generally seems like he hasn't let

39:26.880 --> 39:28.080
his wealth go to his head.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.960
A good example of this is his private jet Burger King Mukbang.

39:31.960 --> 39:35.920
Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very relatable, but the Burger

39:35.920 --> 39:39.080
King aspect brings it back down to earth.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.440
Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger King before.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.920
He's able to order fluently, he's even kind of charming to the cashier.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.440
He doesn't like scoff or pinch his nose at anything.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.920
Also the Gucci barrette.

39:51.920 --> 39:57.760
Whereas Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if Sis would

39:57.760 --> 39:59.840
make it out of Burger King alive.

39:59.840 --> 40:05.280
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper class solicism like, I don't know, not understanding

40:05.280 --> 40:07.080
the concept of a value meal.

40:07.080 --> 40:11.640
I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video, just not a relatable video.

40:11.640 --> 40:15.800
You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat and do a story time about

40:15.800 --> 40:16.800
that.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.040
That's really when Gigi's at her best.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.960
She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives

40:21.960 --> 40:24.440
of Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.680
So I'm like, I see this white little chicklet in my hand.

40:27.680 --> 40:31.720
I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like, oh my God.

40:31.720 --> 40:36.600
Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled by the fact that people basically

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
like the rich.

40:37.600 --> 40:42.200
Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch

40:42.200 --> 40:43.200
behavior.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.000
But ultimately, we have no choice but to stand.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.160
And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who, in a way, seems like

40:52.160 --> 40:55.560
a poor person who just so happens to be very rich.

40:55.560 --> 40:59.720
Now if inequality increases enough, I suspect the standing will stop.

40:59.720 --> 41:04.800
Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store

41:04.800 --> 41:08.960
if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.760
But if you're thinking about how $69,000 can pay off your life for earning medical

41:12.760 --> 41:17.520
debt or about how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying wife, this

41:17.520 --> 41:20.240
kind of thing will start getting under your skin.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.840
And eventually, people will start building guillotines again.

41:23.840 --> 41:29.000
In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people

41:29.000 --> 41:31.120
start behaving as badly as possible.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.120
So this isn't your dream job?

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
No.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
That's great, right?

41:35.120 --> 41:36.120
Whatever you want.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.120
Okay, great.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
7.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.120
Ruin.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.120
Good evening, Gorge.

41:40.120 --> 41:51.320
Ever notice how most vampires are like, cats or queens or at least rich?

41:51.320 --> 41:56.760
I guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash.

41:56.760 --> 42:01.480
Gothic horror really got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were

42:01.480 --> 42:04.520
usually set in an old decaying castle or mansion.

42:04.520 --> 42:09.920
By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,

42:09.920 --> 42:15.760
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order, and also

42:15.760 --> 42:20.440
maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the land and gentry.

42:20.440 --> 42:25.560
Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played

42:25.560 --> 42:29.160
an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility.

42:29.160 --> 42:34.840
So the gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence, and that aesthetic

42:34.840 --> 42:40.520
has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic haunted house,

42:40.520 --> 42:45.040
which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.600
It's a trope with an interesting backstory.

42:47.600 --> 42:52.560
During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new wealthy class of people who built what

42:52.560 --> 42:55.040
were essentially 19th century McMansions.

42:55.560 --> 43:00.080
When the Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began

43:00.080 --> 43:06.400
to decay, which gave them morbid associations that made them perfect for stories about hauntings

43:06.400 --> 43:09.480
and psychos and weirdos.

43:09.480 --> 43:14.560
So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think.

43:14.560 --> 43:19.840
We live in an age of opulence and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in

43:19.840 --> 43:20.840
power.

43:20.840 --> 43:24.640
The middle class is shrinking, social unrest is on the rise.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.760
It seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.

43:27.760 --> 43:33.440
When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined

43:33.440 --> 43:34.760
shopping malls?

43:34.760 --> 43:37.960
Well, there kind of already is.

43:37.960 --> 43:42.920
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he

43:42.920 --> 43:48.000
explores the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example the now demolished Owings Mills

43:48.000 --> 43:50.080
Mall just north of Baltimore.

43:50.080 --> 43:54.000
The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

43:54.000 --> 44:13.200
It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue.

44:13.200 --> 44:19.160
It was a big high-end mall, but in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was

44:19.160 --> 44:23.880
murdered during an armed robbery on the trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.320
After the murder, the mall got a reputation for being unsafe and slowly the stores closed

44:29.320 --> 44:30.320
down.

44:30.320 --> 44:36.960
Dan recorded two videos at Owings Mills in 2015 when only five of the original 155 stores

44:36.960 --> 44:38.200
remained.

44:38.200 --> 44:44.240
He takes us through the strangely clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted

44:44.240 --> 44:46.120
food court.

44:46.120 --> 44:51.200
Watching these videos seems to provoke an emotional response in a lot of people.

44:51.200 --> 44:56.720
Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express rage at the waste and futility, some

44:56.720 --> 45:02.000
find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
of it all.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
One commenter says,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.920
I think it is still hitting people with slow motion shock that the 20th century is really

45:09.920 --> 45:10.920
over.

45:10.920 --> 45:16.200
In the 80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone.

45:16.200 --> 45:22.280
In fact, it was the last gasp of 20th century general prosperity.

45:22.280 --> 45:27.160
I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of these emotions.

45:27.160 --> 45:32.960
I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for the

45:32.960 --> 45:39.680
21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.280
Oh, it gives me a chill.

45:42.280 --> 45:49.320
My nape hair stands on end and a tingle goes down my spine.

45:49.320 --> 45:54.800
The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about

45:54.800 --> 46:00.860
it we see clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic

46:00.860 --> 46:04.320
footage of the half-demolished ruin.

46:04.320 --> 46:09.840
It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey where you somehow perceive

46:09.840 --> 46:12.720
the spiritual significance of the original building.

46:12.720 --> 46:19.280
In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the shoppers and the workers, their aspirations

46:19.280 --> 46:26.680
and material longings, but what does the crumbling wreckage of a JC Penny really mean?

46:26.680 --> 46:35.440
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.320
Alright comrades, I've said my piece.

46:38.400 --> 46:43.480
I'll come quietly, there's no reason to tie me down, I mean, unless you're into that,

46:43.480 --> 46:45.600
in which case, by all means.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.240
No, I won't resist.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.800
I accept my fate.

47:08.320 --> 47:37.360
Fuck you, Romano, I'm glad your father died.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.800
Let's just get that out there before I just say it.

47:40.800 --> 47:47.280
Now let's be honest, definitely a tranny shazer.

47:47.280 --> 47:54.160
Gosh I sure do think I'm funny, but he was an incel, and definitely a tranny shazer.

47:54.160 --> 47:58.800
I'm looking, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed of what I've written.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.800
Huh?

48:00.800 --> 48:06.320
Kant yeah, but I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.

48:06.400 --> 48:10.400
I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked

48:10.400 --> 48:11.920
in a tub full of jewels.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.720
How much leg do we want to get in here?

48:14.720 --> 48:16.080
A lot, I assume.

48:16.080 --> 48:20.160
I'm just getting oil all over my fur, great, it's not real fur, whatever.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.840
Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.840
Ugh, moral people.

48:25.840 --> 48:29.280
There's one that I can't stand.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.840
People who have some sense of decency.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.320
Okay, is a hair light really a good idea?

48:34.640 --> 48:37.120
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?

48:37.120 --> 48:38.160
Who invented that?

48:38.160 --> 48:38.960
An asshole.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.080
What about bartender who owns the bar he works on?

48:42.080 --> 48:43.760
I guess what I should be to be feminist.

48:44.720 --> 48:45.520
Christ.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.280
The demands of these people.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.560
Those fucking teeth, man.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.960
It's like being tight, happy, happy.

48:55.680 --> 49:00.480
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

49:01.120 --> 49:04.560
It's okay, I'm being stupid.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.080
Uh, okay.
