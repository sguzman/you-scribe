0	14000	I saw a shot before persisting baby, before persisting baby
14000	41400	In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically
41400	46440	incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female
46440	49000	souls accidentally born into male bodies.
49000	54640	Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight
54640	56440	men who love themselves.
56440	61180	For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynophilia, new Greek for love
61180	63080	of oneself as a woman.
63080	67360	It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,
67360	71320	and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which
71320	96720	is, okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard says.
96720	100720	Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but
100720	105360	a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially
105360	110200	increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already
110200	111200	face.
111200	115920	After all, autogynophilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted
115920	121440	misrepresentations of trans women.
121440	125600	So it's understandable that to a lot of trans women, the prospect of this concept gaining
125600	128000	cultural traction is pretty terrifying.
128000	133160	However, I respond that, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals, I've had several
133160	137080	conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that they believe in
137080	140440	Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards would admit it to my face.
140440	145200	So as I see it, the damage is already done, what's needed now is an accessible, convincing
145200	146640	refutation of the theory.
146640	149320	I hope this video will accomplish three things.
149320	154300	One, persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong, two, account for how a wrong theory
154300	159540	became so influential, and three, move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people
159540	163740	and open up a deeper discussion about what it really means to be transgender.
163740	167740	Socrates, you know the drill.
167740	170500	Two, Blanchard's typology.
170500	174580	The mainstream scientific view endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender
174580	180540	Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians is that the primary reason trans people transition
180540	182780	is to alleviate gender dysphoria.
182780	188800	Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial
188800	193100	angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and
193100	196580	medically transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.
196580	200700	This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.
200700	204500	However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.
204500	209580	According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.
209580	214420	He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused.
214420	217060	You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.
217060	221700	Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men.
221700	224740	And yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end.
224740	227300	The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.
227300	229380	These gay boys cannot get enough dick.
229380	230860	And who can blame them?
230860	236020	Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition
236020	240500	because one, society is more accepting of them as women than is very effeminate men,
240500	245140	and two, becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them, since they do better as women in
245140	250100	the heterosexual dating market than as male fems in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.
250100	253940	The second type of trans women are the autogenophilic transsexuals.
253940	257300	These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.
257300	259260	I fucking saw.
259260	264420	Blanchard describes autogenophiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.
264420	269540	It doesn't really matter because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected inward,
269540	273540	leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women, which
273540	275300	is their true motivation to transition.
275300	278980	Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge
278980	283620	that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend
283620	286900	to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.
286900	291620	I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogenophile with more neutral
291620	297060	language, let's say Cluster A and Cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic,
297060	298580	that is, attracted to men.
298580	302580	They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.
302580	306260	Cluster B trans women are mostly gynophilic, attracted to women,
306260	310500	transition relatively later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.
310500	314180	When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.
314180	318660	I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort them.
318660	321540	Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B.
321540	324100	But as I've thought about it more, it's partially unravelled.
324100	328100	Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who followed all
328100	333060	the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster B patterns
333060	334900	but now exclusively dates men.
334900	337940	So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here,
337940	342020	I interpret them merely as correlation clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.
342020	347300	Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogenophiles to be two sharply distinct
347380	351460	types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.
351460	356420	And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexual strategy,
356420	360420	or autogenophilic lust, are the primary motivations to transition.
360420	364340	And I have a lot of backup here since trans women almost universally reject
364340	366500	this characterization of their experience.
366500	369060	Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory,
369060	372420	but fortunately Blanchard has an airtight response to that,
372420	376340	namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking liars.
376340	378900	I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?
378900	381140	A theory that can't be falsified.
381140	382180	It's perfect.
384580	386980	3. The Man Who Would Be Queen
386980	390820	Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of psychologists
390820	394580	before fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications
394580	398260	had it not been given a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey,
398260	403140	a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard's theory in a 2003
403140	406180	pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.
406180	407540	Great cover, Bailey.
407540	411380	Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.
411380	412660	I have been triggered.
412660	413460	Well done.
413460	417700	Now Bailey, I read your book which, considering how much I enjoy your cream,
417700	419300	was just amazingly bad.
419300	422340	The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women
422340	426340	because it's acutely transphobic but also kind of vivid and well-written
426340	429140	and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard's typology.
429140	432420	The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals,
432500	435540	including Bailey's and his male research assistants' observations
435540	439060	that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex workers.
439060	442580	I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim
442580	445300	for the first time on the stairs dancing, posing.
445860	449780	She is spectacular, exotic.
449780	453300	I find out later that she is from Belize and sexy.
454500	459940	Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.
459940	465300	And I notice a very subtle and not unattractive angularity of the face,
465300	470820	which is also not clearly diagnostic on this tall siren.
470820	475780	It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives,
475780	482020	as a researcher but also as a single heterosexual man.
482020	484420	Wow, Bailey. Great science rating.
484420	487300	When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals,
487300	489940	Bailey moves on to the autokinophilic transsexuals,
489940	494260	focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls Cher,
494260	500020	whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic masturbation.
500020	505140	Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses
505140	509060	while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction,
509060	513540	all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.
513540	516580	It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.
516580	519780	So well done, Bailey. You've found an honest-to-god pervert.
519780	522980	And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.
522980	524820	I admire it. I want it in my life.
524820	529940	But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.
529940	534660	You just found a person who built a sex robot.
535380	537300	That's not how Bailey sees it though.
537300	541460	He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autokinophilic transsexual,
541460	546100	claiming that Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women
546100	548180	who aren't exclusively attracted to men.
548180	552660	So Bailey's telling is that autokinophiles are these unfeminine male masturbators
552660	556660	showing up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they were women
556660	560340	in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.
560340	564260	Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defensive Blanchard's theory,
564260	567460	Bailey's account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.
567460	571300	Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher,
571300	573700	pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead,
573700	577140	unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike.
577140	578980	You're so filthy.
578980	581860	But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?
581860	584660	What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?
584660	590020	Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans women
590020	592500	turning these stories into case studies for his book.
592500	595540	Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.
595540	597380	You need a research assistant, Bailey?
597380	600180	The man who would be queen is filled with sentences like,
600180	608260	There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer it, so I'll just go ahead.
608260	609780	All right, you edgy fuck.
609780	610500	Let's hear it.
611060	616260	Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most
616260	618980	auto kind of feeling transsexual.
619620	621380	We appreciate the feedback, Bailey.
621380	622260	We really do.
622260	623780	But is this science?
623780	626980	It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery
626980	630020	that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians
630020	633060	and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.
633060	636580	And like the pop science cis-head men have written over the past century
636580	639380	regarding the nature of females and homosexuals,
639380	643940	their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some vital perspectives.
643940	648420	This is what we post-modernists mean when we complain that science often privileges
648420	650660	a white cis-head male perspective.
650660	653380	It's not that I hate men or male sexuality,
653540	658820	I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.
658820	660820	It's not that there is no objective truth,
660820	663940	it's that this represents a very narrow window on it.
663940	666500	Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?
666500	667940	Well, how about mine?
670580	672580	4. My Perspective
672580	676340	From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.
676340	678980	He's a man who, when I was a student in Northwestern,
678980	681780	was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.
681780	682580	Google it.
682580	686100	Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.
686100	689380	Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard
689380	691940	to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub,
691940	695780	it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctionist of the theory,
695780	697220	which might still be true.
697220	701140	The problem is, it isn't true, which I'll argue at length in a moment.
701140	705620	But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial number
705620	710820	of academics and journalists, largely because 1, it's often presented as the only supposedly
710820	714980	scientific alternative to mushy platitudes about women born in men's bodies,
714980	718340	and 2, many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard
718340	722500	with extreme vitriol and personal attacks, resulting in the widespread perception
722500	727540	that a bunch of triggered PC cocks are throwing a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum
727540	731540	because Bailey and Blanchard accurately called them out as paraphylic fetishists.
731540	734020	In her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger,
734020	740020	bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob.
740020	744260	But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him
744260	748420	and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced
748420	753060	by PC cocks that she doesn't bother to check how good Bailey's science really is,
753060	756100	and ends up affirming the autogynophilia theory herself.
756100	760260	Now I'm certainly not going to deny that trans people on the internet can sometimes behave like
760260	764900	a bit of an angry mob. In fact, I may be on the receiving end of one of those myself in about,
764900	767860	oh, 20 minutes, depending on how this video is received.
767860	772260	But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and Bailey
772260	777220	camp either. Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors,
777220	782100	and Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory of trans backlash against Bailey.
782100	787540	Remember, according to autogynophilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves,
787540	792180	from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that they're narcissists,
792180	796580	and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation is accused of exhibiting
796580	802020	narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego. Furthermore, like so many other professors
802020	808020	and recent academic freedom controversies, Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cocks
808020	812500	has not really interfered with their academic careers, nor their continued authority to
812500	816980	misrepresent people with less power than them. This is of course assuming that autogynophilia
816980	821860	really is a misrepresentation of trans women, and that's really the crux of this whole drama,
821860	826020	isn't it? So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question,
826020	830820	pursuing the pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel, relying only on the facts,
830820	835700	the figures, the scientific studies. Just kidding. If you really want to read a scientific argument
835700	840660	against autogynophilia, read Julia Serrano's article The Case Against Autogynophilia,
840660	844980	which pretty much sums it up. Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted
844980	850020	to hear about science, you came here because you wanted filth, and I'll give you filth, Bailey.
850020	855220	I know that's what you want, and I want to give you what you want. I want to give it all up for you.
856020	864740	5. The False Psychotomy Filth is coming, don't worry, but before we
864740	869060	get there, there's one more thing we need to discuss. Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty
869060	873780	much unanimously introduce it as if it were the only possible alternative to what's called the
873780	878900	feminine essence theory. The feminine essence theory says that trans women are female souls
878900	883940	and male bodies, that we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to
883940	889060	make our accidental exterior match our essential interior. People like Drager will tell you that
889060	895220	trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that anyone who challenges it will
895220	900020	be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt. And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told,
900020	904980	is to defer to Blanchard's typology of homosexual and autogynophilic transsexuals.
904980	909940	Now I object to this framing of the discussion because I don't believe in Blanchard's typology
909940	914580	or the feminine essence theory. There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from
914580	921700	birth. I wasn't born a woman. I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else. There's no such
921700	927220	thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence. There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the
927220	931940	way society responds to you, all of which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are
931940	936580	currently changing for me. Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory.
936580	942340	I think most people have gender-essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some level
942340	947780	that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature. And in a sense that may be true. I don't think I chose
947780	952580	to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent in my biology or psychology
952580	957460	that led me to transition. But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood,
957460	961780	which intellectually I don't think makes sense. I think it's heartwarming gibberish.
961860	966980	But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.
966980	971860	Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that dogs go to
971860	977860	heaven. And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point across.
977860	982740	Not all language is philosophical. It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in
982740	987300	essentialist terms. To explain it without gender-essentialism, it requires a whole,
987300	992740	complicated philosophical discussion that most people simply aren't up to having. But the useful
992740	997140	platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start putting these things under
997140	1001620	the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists who are
1001620	1006100	telling lies about themselves. So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not
1006100	1012020	essentially a woman, then why am I transitioning? Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was
1012020	1016580	the primary reason. And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that
1016580	1021460	if you're curious. You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom. When you
1021460	1026500	decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes
1026500	1031540	and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family if you even still have a family. It's kind of hard for me
1031540	1037140	to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory urge. That said, is there
1037140	1042820	some sexual aspect of being transgender? Well of course there goddamn is. How could an adult decide
1042820	1047860	to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality? The problem is autogenophilia
1047860	1052900	is not a good description of that connection in most cases, and it certainly isn't in my case.
1052900	1057860	But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing and erotic
1057860	1063140	situations no less. According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogenophile. It seems
1063220	1067300	that I have some explaining to do. Well, here's where the filth comes in.
1068100	1070660	6. Contra Points and Erotic Life
1071460	1077300	Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie. Step right up you filthy freaks.
1077300	1082020	One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that even arguing
1082020	1086660	against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and invalidating.
1086660	1091460	Fortunately I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to take one
1091460	1095540	for the team here. Get your clipboards out gentlemen, I want to make this as easy as
1095540	1102980	possible for the psychoanalysts at home. I was born in 1988. As a small child I was not
1102980	1109460	especially feminine nor especially masculine. I was not interested in sports and was just kind of
1109460	1114580	physically inept. My main childhood interest was music and I learned several instruments.
1114580	1120660	In early adolescence I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too much time
1120660	1126020	in the shower and spending too much time styling my hair. My sexual development was kind of late.
1126020	1132420	I never masturbated till I was 15 and I didn't fantasize about having sex with women or with men
1133060	1138580	or even about becoming a woman. My fantasies were kind of platonic almost. I would sort of
1138580	1144820	fantasize about women but in a very abstract kind of way. An early romantic disappointment involved
1144820	1150500	my realization that women would never be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.
1150660	1156420	In my late teens and early 20s I was a long haired smooth chested androgyne which suited me well.
1156420	1161300	It was around then that I first cross-tressed when a woman I was seeing asked if she could
1161300	1168500	dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup. God yes, I said. Throughout my 20s I was on and off
1168500	1174420	in relationships where there was this feminization dynamic. More women are into feminizing boys than
1174420	1179380	you might think. When I was feminized it would just make out and not do anything penetrative
1179380	1185380	but just sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know? Now some women I was with were not into that
1185380	1189140	and some would practically lock their underwear drawers when they found out I had done it in the
1189140	1193700	past. There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that all together but it didn't
1193700	1199540	last more than a couple years. When I had regular heterosexual sex it was like my soul had to leave
1199540	1204020	my body in order for me to get the poison out which is how I thought of it. The cross-dressing
1204020	1209540	was never a solo or a masturbatory activity. There was always a partner or sometimes several
1209540	1214500	partners. Bailey are you paying attention to this? This is for you. What I liked about it was the way
1214500	1219380	that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted with my body, how they would kind of
1219380	1224740	treat me like a woman. I fully acknowledged that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.
1224740	1231860	There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs and occasionally also a BDSM submissive aspect.
1231860	1236820	But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it. It wasn't
1236820	1241940	humiliating for me to be feminized, it was affirming. And one day I kind of realized
1241940	1248500	that I didn't want to be feminized at all. I wanted to be feminine. In my mid-20s I first
1248500	1253460	started really paying attention to trans women and thinking about transitioning myself but I
1253460	1258500	thought that since I didn't feel like a woman that I never would and I thought that I would never
1258500	1262900	pass and that I would just be a hideous parody of womanhood. Then about a year ago, thanks to
1262900	1267780	this amazing online queer community that we have now, I started developing more positive thinking
1267780	1272340	about this. I've always looked a little bit younger than my age but last year I also started
1272340	1277860	noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man and that triggered
1277860	1282420	really intense gender dysphoria. At the same time I realized that I would have to transition to have
1282420	1287700	any hope of a genuinely fulfilling sex life. And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent
1287780	1293380	that I could not wait. So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu and I started taking
1293380	1299300	those in August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic and since then
1299300	1304420	my life has drastically changed. I live as a woman full-time now and most of the changes aren't
1304420	1310020	sexual but the hormones certainly do have sexual effects. I now find myself attracted to both women
1310020	1317460	and men and the mere visual image of a woman no longer turns me on the way it did. Instead
1317460	1322180	I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection. I don't masturbate at all and I
1322180	1326900	haven't come in months. Someone please fuck me. I guess the critical thing is that I've been
1326900	1332500	wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven consecutive months and I have been turned on by
1332500	1338260	it for zero percent of the time. So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous
1338260	1342740	and I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either. I mean when there's
1342740	1347540	developments I'll check it out but I'm not like oh yeah I have tits now that's so hot.
1348260	1353700	I mean it's kind of hot but it's more about other people being into it than it is about me being
1353700	1359380	into it. So as always my sex drive is directed outward at other people. The sexual aspect of my
1359380	1365380	transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed inward. It's about me wanting my
1365380	1371220	sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body or you know at least as close as I
1371220	1376660	can get. And since I started hormones it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically
1376660	1384580	female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection rather than intense
1384580	1391460	object-oriented male lust. So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to
1391460	1398100	politically correct cuckoldry or trans ideology. Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this
1398100	1402980	description in no way lets me off the hook for autogenophilia. In fact I'm what Blanchard would
1402980	1409860	call a classic case of pseudo bisexual behavioral autogenophilia. Pseudo bisexual because of course
1409860	1415460	all trans women's experiences are lies and because according to Blanchard I only like guys because
1415460	1419700	being filled up with their dicks makes me feel like a girl which is what I'm really into. And
1419700	1425620	behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogenophilia like anatomic transvestic
1425620	1431060	behavioral and physiological according to what you supposedly fetishize. And I'm turned on by
1431060	1436020	sexually behaving like a woman rather than simply wearing female clothes or having female anatomy.
1436020	1440500	And I mean okay you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary,
1440500	1445700	fake, and pathological but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience
1445700	1451620	and here's why. 7. Autophilia in General
1451620	1455700	I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind of
1455700	1460740	sexual interest in their own bodies. It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.
1460740	1466820	Ew. But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight or touch
1466820	1472020	of your own body? I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises
1472020	1477220	and taking pictures of their penises and sending them to other people. Does that make them
1477220	1483540	autoandrophiles? Are they behavioral autophalophiles? I can make up Greek words too,
1483540	1488580	Blanchard. I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,
1488580	1493780	it's not for men, it's for me. What does that mean? It means she enjoyed wearing
1493780	1499940	sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot. Is that cisvestic autogenophilia?
1499940	1505860	Likewise, I use to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women touching
1505860	1511700	their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon. Is that anatomical
1511700	1517540	autogenophilia? Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo,
1517540	1523380	an article on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their
1523380	1528980	own feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length
1528980	1534660	mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo. Can you imagine the level of
1534660	1539140	paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if it was written by a trans woman? I mean,
1539140	1544820	it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot. And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often
1544820	1549300	ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only when it comes to trans women that we feel
1549300	1554580	the need to whip out the suffix philia. It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of
1554580	1560020	normal female sexuality when it exists in trans women, but of course that raises the question,
1560020	1569220	what is normal female sexuality? 8. Normal Female Sexuality. Switching from male to female hormones
1569220	1574500	causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in new form, which came as more
1574500	1579780	of a relief to me than I expected. I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality
1579780	1586020	felt like a demonic possession or alien infection until I was free of it, thank god. When I had male
1586020	1591140	hormones in me, I needed to have an orgasm like every day. I was turned on mainly by visual arousal
1591140	1597060	cues. I was at a Kinsey one relative to my birth sex and I had a couple mild, typical, straight guy
1597060	1603620	paraphilic kinks. No, not autogynophilia. On female hormones, I initially had no sex drive at all,
1603620	1609140	but I've started developing very different patterns of arousal. For instance, I never need to have an
1609140	1614900	orgasm. I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues like intimate physical contact or close emotional
1614900	1621300	moments. I'm at around a 70-30 attraction to women versus men and the paraphilic kinks have vanished
1621300	1626500	without a trace. Oh by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6 milligrams estradiol and 200
1626500	1631700	milligrams spironolactone daily. So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical
1631700	1636900	female sexuality, at least for a girl who's into girls. I don't feel like I have some essentially
1636900	1642340	male pseudo bisexual behavioral autogynophilia. One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with
1642340	1647380	elaborate terminology like this is he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women
1647380	1652500	are psychologically more like cis men than cis women. His studies therefore lack a cis female
1652500	1657780	control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply his autogynophilia survey to cis women. But if he
1657780	1662740	had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were classified as
1662740	1668180	autogynophilic. Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on
1668180	1674420	male sexuality makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.
1674420	1680580	But what is cis women want to have sex as? Walruses? I mean no judgments. This also explains his
1680580	1686660	claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo bisexual because their attraction to
1686660	1692180	men does not resemble gay male attraction to men. The idea is that these trans women's attraction
1692180	1698900	to men is not based on raw physical lust, so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men and
1698900	1704900	is therefore pseudo. That is, it's really an autogynophilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.
1704900	1710580	But what about straight cis women's attraction to men? Is that based on raw physical lust for the
1710580	1716420	male body? I mean sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say. But I
1716420	1722900	kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust for the
1722900	1729460	male body. That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality if I may risk painting
1729460	1734500	with broad strokes. Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist
1734500	1739540	articles alongside naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart and later on
1739540	1744820	ended up just being read by gay men. From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean men's
1744820	1751540	bodies are nice, they have great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great. But it's not
1751540	1756340	that great. And if you read pornography written by women and notice that it's usually written and
1756340	1761620	not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.
1761620	1766340	Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description of
1766340	1771620	Christian's hot bod and his hot abs, but it's not the main thing by any means. There's a lot more
1771620	1777380	sentences like. To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat 10 adults comfortably.
1777380	1783700	It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know. Modern fireplace.
1783700	1789860	Near the kitchen area in front of the glass wall is a dining table surrounded by 16 chairs,
1789860	1796420	and tucked in the corner is a full-sized shiny black grand piano. Here, he hands me a glass of
1796420	1803300	wine. Even the glasses are rich. Heavy contemporary crystal. It's like a Crate and Barrel catalog.
1803300	1809060	I'm getting so wet. Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary
1809060	1815220	crystal, his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot because it's sexy to be wanted by someone
1815220	1820180	who's qualified. It's not enough to be whizzled at by a catcaller, they have no discernment.
1820180	1824660	I mean, they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female. They whistle at me. And I don't
1824660	1829060	want to be whizzled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me. You want to be wanted by
1829060	1834660	someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste, selects you, the protagonist. This is not
1834660	1840580	a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns. It's not a story about wanting a man.
1840580	1846900	It's a story about being wanted by a man. This is how the whole romance genre works. You emotionally
1846900	1852660	identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like a pirate or the CEO
1852660	1858660	of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this guy wants you, the protagonist,
1858660	1862900	usually singling her out of her other more qualified women, and eventually giving up
1862900	1867380	everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her. And a lot of these stories are kind of
1867380	1872580	silly. They conflate female sexuality with women's economic dependence on men in a way that's really
1875220	1880340	but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted. I want other people to think I'm sexy
1880340	1885380	and want to fuck me, you know? It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.
1885380	1886340	Is that so wrong?
1891140	1896660	The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting trope
1896660	1901940	of depainting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity. The mirror was
1901940	1907460	often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman. The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.
1907460	1912420	You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her. You put a mirror in her hand and
1912420	1916900	you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had
1916900	1921540	depicted for your own pleasure. The real function of the mirror was otherwise. It was to make the
1921540	1927220	woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight. The notion of the vanity of
1927220	1932740	woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection. It is the assumption that women
1932740	1937780	enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy looking at them and are hence
1937780	1943460	complicit in their own objectification. I think the concept of the autogenophilic transsexual woman
1943460	1949300	is a combination of this trope with a homophobic trope. Misogyny casts women as narcissistic,
1949300	1955140	vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts queer men as hypersexual perverts. The
1955140	1960580	autogenophile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly in love with
1960580	1976900	the image of himself as a woman. 10. Autogenophilia Acceptance
1976900	1981140	So this whole video I've been treating autogenophilia kind of like an accusation from which I have to
1981140	1986340	exonerate myself. And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation,
1986420	1991300	but some people might wonder, isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shamy? Like,
1991300	1998260	is autogenophilia so wrong? Well, no, it's not. It's fine. There definitely are men who get turned
1998260	2003300	on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this
2003300	2007220	is very harmless and I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether
2007220	2012100	genuinely autogenophilic trans women exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women
2012100	2018100	consider the label autogenophilia to be such a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not
2018100	2022660	get turned on merely by the thought of being women. Now as I've discussed, the problem with
2022660	2027940	Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogenophilia to cover pretty much any sexual
2027940	2032900	feeling a cluster B trans woman can have. But I'm actually inclined to agree with him that being
2032900	2038660	turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind,
2038660	2043060	and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women, I guess including me,
2043060	2048020	have the idea that you can't be both a woman and an autogenophile, hence the offense we take to
2048020	2052660	being characterized in this way. However, things get messier when you look into this some more.
2052660	2058420	Are there some genuinely autogenophilic transsexuals? Well, at first glance, the answer is yes.
2058420	2062660	I mean, there's always one isn't there. In this case, that one is Anne Lawrence,
2062660	2068660	a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified autogenophilic transsexual. From 1998 to 2011,
2068660	2074340	Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogenophilia over the internet and published
2074340	2080260	them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies. Great title Anne, very provocative,
2080260	2085220	very controversial, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered, well done.
2085220	2090180	What is this cover though? Come on Anne, get a statue of hermaphroditis or something on there.
2090260	2094340	So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty
2094340	2100340	autogenophilia-like fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff,
2100340	2105060	like fantasies of being women or having sex as women or arousal during cross-dressing,
2105060	2110820	are what the trans community has de-stigmatizingly termed cross-sex gender fantasy. And among trans
2110820	2116500	women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You'll see it all over
2116500	2121620	the place on trans subreddits, there's a blog called Cross Dreamers devoted to it, it's been
2121620	2126340	written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serrano. So within the trans community, this isn't even
2126340	2131540	controversial. It's not provocative, it's not politically incorrect. But how do we make sense
2131540	2136500	of this? Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience genuine female sexuality when
2136500	2141140	you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system, so you've got to get that out
2141140	2145940	and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is this any different from Blanchard's
2145940	2150660	theory of autogenophilia? Well, basically it comes down to this. Blanchard's theory claims
2150660	2156020	that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory, if you're an
2156020	2161780	autogenophilic transsexual, you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you achieve
2161780	2167620	can only be honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the
2167620	2171940	idea that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn't
2171940	2177300	essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogenophilic admit that after
2177300	2182420	transition, the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue to prefer living as
2182420	2187780	trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself. Any viable theory relating to the
2187780	2192020	ideologies of autogenophilia and transsexualism must explain the following well-established
2192020	2197620	observation. Gender dysphoria in young non-homosexual males usually appears along with or subsequent to
2197620	2202580	autogenophilia. In later years, however, autogenophilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear
2202580	2206820	while the transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger. The same conclusion is suggested by
2206820	2210500	the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment, which decrease libido and gender
2210500	2214820	dysphoric as in other men, usually have no effect on the desire to live as female or the resolve to
2214820	2219620	remain in that role. If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become
2219620	2224900	women, why would they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away?
2224900	2229300	Well, this is where things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only
2229300	2234580	way to explain this is to shift the goalpost and say that actually autogenophilia isn't a
2234580	2240020	paraphilia at all. It's actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition
2240020	2245700	is you actually pair bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman
2245700	2250660	you've become. And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it
2250660	2255220	doesn't. A pair bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that
2255220	2260340	trans women are a man and a woman inside this? Why do they continue falling in love with other
2260340	2264420	people? I can't even start with this. This video is too long, I'm getting cranky. Look, this seems
2264420	2270020	like the point where Occam's razor shuts down Blanchard's theory. Like, okay, maybe I subconsciously
2270020	2275460	created a female alter ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of
2275460	2280180	things. Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the
2280180	2286020	elder gods ripped my primordial duality and twain and now I'm yearning for my female half. Or maybe
2286020	2293620	I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while. 11. True autogenophiles.
2293620	2298740	Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are admittedly a few accounts of trans women
2298740	2304020	whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely
2304020	2308420	autogenophilic. And I'm not going to say that these people are lying about their experiences
2308420	2314100	because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about
2314100	2319700	judging people, so I'm not going to say that these people aren't really trans. I mean, I find it weird
2319700	2325300	and hard to imagine, but whatever. I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits. And
2325300	2330980	wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogenophilic feelings, I would just tell you.
2330980	2335460	I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own diary on my deathbed.
2335460	2340660	But I just don't. This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations to transition. And that's
2340660	2345380	ultimately the reason most trans women hate this theory. Not because of wounded narcissism or
2345380	2350580	shattered erotic delusions. We just don't like being misrepresented. But you know who does love
2350580	2357060	this theory? She's been there literally the whole time. You know, I realize that by talking about
2357060	2361540	this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless psychoanalysis. Whether it's going to come from
2361540	2366420	turf reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for even talking about this, or who knows,
2366420	2371220	maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what? Why don't we just get that out of the
2371220	2378340	way right now? It's time to put this tranny on trial. 12. The Autogenophilia Trial of ContraPoints
2379540	2384100	All rise. The Autogenophilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.
2384100	2390260	Judge Bailey presiding. Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus ContraPoints.
2390260	2396260	Are both sides ready? District Attorney Cockbean, ready for the subreddit, Your Honor.
2397540	2404100	Ready, I guess. Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man. A full-grown,
2404100	2410100	six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress. It's really more of a hospital gown? The evidence will
2410100	2415140	show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert role-playing as such for his own
2415140	2421060	twisted sexual amusement. Abio, what are you holding? It's for horseback riding. Your Honor,
2421060	2426100	I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip uploaded to YouTube by the defendant
2426100	2442900	on June 13th, 2016. Oh god. Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an
2442900	2448500	autogenophile, then I don't have two X chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?
2448500	2452740	Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place? The court does not
2452740	2457540	need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals. I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.
2457540	2462900	What? Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frankenfurter. Your Honor, I'd like to
2462900	2468180	admit into evidence the following photograph. That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one's
2468260	2474820	on the house, Kiwi Farms. Are you a Rocky Horror fan, Your Honor? Am I? It's just a jump to the left.
2475940	2482980	And take a step to the right. Put your hands on your hips. And bring your knees in tight.
2484260	2490420	But it's the pelvic thrust. Ew. So you like to dress up as another cross-dressing autogenophile.
2490420	2496020	How is that helping your case at all? Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic,
2496020	2500100	but when you're living as a man, there aren't a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try
2500100	2505220	out cross-dressing. You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time
2505220	2509780	it's socially allowed to be a freakish monster. And come to think of it, the scary monster
2509780	2514260	autogenophile is a trope I've played with since the beginning of this channel. The whole
2514260	2520100	ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogenophilia chic. I originally was going to have the narrator
2520100	2525540	of this channel be more of a fictional character. The idea was to be like autogenophile Harry
2525540	2530420	Plinkett. And part of that is that I kind of hated myself. I thought I was just disgusting.
2530420	2534900	Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something
2534900	2540100	of the horror of gender dysphoria. And part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version
2540100	2546420	of yourself is actually kind of empowering. Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches.
2546420	2551700	Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and corsets.
2551700	2556500	This is just male fetishism. Well, it's true that cis women generally don't dress that way, no.
2556500	2561060	I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually pretty popular. But I never wear shit
2561060	2565300	like that anymore. In fact, it actually causes gender dysphoria because it makes me feel like
2565300	2569940	a male cross-dresser. Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women
2569940	2575460	wear. I guess that's true. A lot of trans women transition after a period of sort of trying things
2575460	2580500	out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen. But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense
2580500	2591540	of female fashion. Like, what did you wear when you were 14? That's what I thought. But also,
2591540	2597220	why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters? Cis women do. They have some good ideas.
2597220	2602420	Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then,
2602420	2606740	Abigail? What would we do then? I don't know what you would do. I think I could manage.
2606740	2609940	Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.
2609940	2615220	Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I'll smash them in. I'll smash the shit out of them.
2616420	2620020	These shoes are cute and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.
2621780	2627860	Would you fuck me? I wouldn't. Your Honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and
2627860	2633620	corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me? This,
2633620	2638420	Your Honor, is peak trans. Peak trans.
2642340	2646900	How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish,
2646900	2651780	not sexual pleasure. Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs
2651780	2656900	and is what is known in the trans community as a joke. The corsets, the high heels, these were
2656900	2661780	primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood and they're efforts that I've left behind. Now
2661780	2666580	that I'm on female hormones and I live this way full time, I feel the way I'm supposed to feel
2666580	2670180	and I don't need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean, I still do some things
2670180	2675220	that cis women don't do. I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done.
2675220	2680660	I do it because I need to feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest and feeling
2680660	2684980	that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep, not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not
2684980	2689940	so I can get off, so I can simply fall asleep. No one ever claimed that trans women are literally
2689940	2694420	the same as cis women. We have many experiences in common, but in other ways our experiences are
2694420	2698740	very different. Yes, and you don't have the oppression experiences that cis women have.
2698740	2703860	Well, you know what, Abigail? You're right. For the most part, I don't. But it's impossible for
2703860	2707780	us to have an actual conversation about this because you're just such a fucking asshole.
2707780	2711460	And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences,
2711460	2715460	don't have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.
2715460	2720340	Go find someone who transitioned decades ago and talk to them about their experiences as women.
2720340	2724580	Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive. As do I,
2724580	2729140	guilty as charged. 13. Final thoughts.
2729140	2733940	I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video. Some of them
2733940	2738580	will say things like, why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their
2738580	2743220	experiences as you? Well, I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis
2743220	2747780	people to think a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It's
2747780	2752820	humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis of my most
2752820	2757540	private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I've had to discuss things that
2757540	2762180	I'm honestly terrified to discuss because I'm afraid that people will never take me seriously
2762180	2766820	as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women, this debate is
2766820	2771860	intensely personal and risky. Our lives and happiness are at stake. Meanwhile, Blanchard
2771860	2777060	and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They've continuously and
2777060	2782020	needlessly been derisive and cruel toward trans people, and they've misused their power as academic
2782020	2787460	authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the
2787460	2792980	core claim of their theory. I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity,
2792980	2798900	but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope,
2798900	2803780	for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by someone who thinks of me as a
2803780	2810340	woman. Otherwise, I'm fucked. This has been a rough one, girls. I dare say you've earned a song.
2810340	2828020	Thanks for the times that you've given me The memories are all on my mind
2828020	2845700	And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow, there's something I must say out loud
2845700	2870420	You're once, twice, three times a lady And I love all of you, yes I do
2870420	2893140	And I love you, yes I do
2893140	2900180	And I love you
2900180	2901220	One more time
2902820	2906020	And just a step to the right
2906020	2907300	Put your hands on your hips
2908820	2914740	And bring your knees in tight It's just a pelvic frost
2914740	2917860	That really drives me insane
2918820	2922660	Let's do the time-o-pik-yun
2924660	2928660	Let's do the time-o-pik-yun
