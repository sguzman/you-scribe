1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,720
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,720
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,160
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile,

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
and I will not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,240
You know what, America? Things have not gone well. We're having a hard time. We are. Between the

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,400
plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,960
fascism, the criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
that has killed 200,000 people and counting, of course there's going to be some trumpet in

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,840
the comments saying, it's not that big a deal. Calm down. People die all the time.

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
Funny, that's not what she said about.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,640
Godly. We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness. And unfortunately,

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,360
Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job. I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840
more vocal about it when I had the chance. So this time, I'm going to say something,

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,760
because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,160
is the single most important thing any American can do right now. So allow me to make my case,

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,080
Gorge. By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,200
firing off hot takes as we speak. Typical T-Thot normie radlib endorses the electoral farce.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube? Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,720
about cancel culture than revolt against the neoliberal status quo. Tabby-chan, tabby-chan.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,200
You know what, Tabitha? For once, I'm actually going to take the bait. So this will be a

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,680
conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain. I'm making this video

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,720
because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so disillusioned with the system that they

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,520
intend not to vote in this election. And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,720
that's fine. Maybe I can whenever the Russian bot vote. So I really do understand the perspective

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
that Biden is not worth voting for, because that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,720
But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children. There's probably asbestos in that tile,

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,680
because America's so great even the floor is made of poison. Okay, Tabby-chan, give me your worst.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,280
I want free health care, student debt cancelled, and worker ownership of the means of production.

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,200
things. We'll listen, Tabby-chan. None of us want to vote for Joe Biden. I don't want to vote for Joe

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,040
Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom. But sometimes, a situation gets so toxic and so

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,400
dangerous, well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty. And in this election, I consider a

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,280
vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump. You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,360
the same as supporting the politician. I don't think anyone should stan Joe Biden. I'm not asking

36
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,520
you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans. Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,800
The president has a big stick. To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,480
likely consequences of each candidate winning. It's not hero worship. It's not choosing a person

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,600
to have a beer with. It's strategy. Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump. The Dems are just

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility. Well, I agree

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,320
that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's no difference

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,800
between them and the Republicans. I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,240
difference between Trump and Hillary, but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,200
not have done. Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion of an addict, withdrawing

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,520
from the Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling white

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,680
nationalist militias very fine people, and telling them to stand by, aspiring to be an autocratic

49
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,080
dictator, and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in the name

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
of delusional macho bostering. So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,640
a real difference if they're in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're, you know,

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:06,560
a woman or LGBTQ or, you know, a human who lives on the planet Earth. So Biden will give us rainbow

53
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,280
capitalism in streets named after Black Lives Matter, but he'll do nothing to bring about

54
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,360
systemic change. Well, Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that. I fully expect

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,160
to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for. So you sit

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
here vote shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,880
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote. Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan. Look,

58
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade. Why is it that when you tell people on

59
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
the left to vote, they think you're saying quit your job, abandon your family, retreat from society,

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
and fall into a deep slumber from which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
before fleeing into the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,240
temple awaiting the return of bales above? Voting doesn't take that long. At most, it takes one day.

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
You can vote and do other things also. I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman

64
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,360
with the we'd be a brunch sign. And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI-style

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,320
armchair with a pair of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now. Could you be any

66
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,760
bougier? Don't call me bougie. I'm beyond bougie. When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie,

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,400
I scoff at them openly. I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my

68
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,680
fiefdom. You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine. Why should I

69
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,560
listen to what you say? Oh, you shouldn't. I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly. But also,

70
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
I am a degenerate class traitor and, in my opinion, influencers should be the first against the wall.

71
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with. You at least have to admire

72
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,320
that about us libs. We have a remarkable willingness to have played conversations with

73
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,720
people who are trying to kill us. Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan,

74
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,880
but what is your plan, Tabitha? Uh, protest? Unionize? Mutual aid? Strikes? So I totally agree.

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,160
Those are all good things to do. I've gone to protests myself this year. I've given to a mutual

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,920
aid group. You know, you're right that voting won't fix all their problems, and it's good to

77
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,320
get involved in local things like that. But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,720
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus. So, in addition to whatever else

79
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,640
you're doing, vote. Why participate in the charade of a farcical election? America is

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:34,240
not democratic. It's a rigged two-party corporatocracy. Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot

81
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,840
wrong with our elections. Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering,

82
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,840
voter suppression, DC being disenfranchised. All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't

83
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,600
think that in this moment, leftists boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,280
Okay, by voting as for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit. Ew. Okay, yeah, it's true

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,840
that voting is not cool. It's boring. It's incrementalist. It doesn't make you feel like

86
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,920
you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents. But, you know, you could always vote in

87
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,640
secret and then maintain your radical image around your friends. Isn't being involved in

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,640
politics inherently not cool? Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things,

89
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,680
people who place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool. I feel

90
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing. It's

91
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,400
showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all the bullshit,

92
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,240
the corrupt system, the electoral farce. But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,960
and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.

94
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,680
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing

95
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,680
are no different from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

96
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,880
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses? This ends in violence

98
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,160
either way, so he may as well smash. Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.

99
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,400
But if there's a decisive Biden victory and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare scenario,

100
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,280
then I think the military will force Trump to leave. Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are

101
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,240
tough. The president is a fascist. I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising

102
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,440
than it's ever been in my life. But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies. And for a

103
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,840
lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting democracy itself,

104
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,440
that would legitimize smashing. So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

105
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,400
But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world. The whole system is broken,

106
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,520
and voting won't change that. We don't need a democrat. We need to end capitalism.

107
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order. When you say end capitalism,

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,400
you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us

109
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,360
that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending. Like before capitalism,

110
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,240
there was feudalism, and feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,440
and production. Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism. So won't capitalism

112
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,560
end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it? I don't think that's the kind of thing that

113
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,080
can be accomplished by a small group of activists. And I say small group because I'm sorry to break

114
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,360
it to you, but the vast majority of Americans are not communists. I think a lot of internet leftists

115
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,040
have a vastly overinflated sense of how big and important they are. I fall prey to it myself.

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,560
Like I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary, in part because when I looked at my

117
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,160
timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream

118
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,400
deaths. But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and very

119
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,680
unrepresentative sample of the population. You have to remember that only 22 percent of Americans

120
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,600
use Twitter at all. Most users rarely tweet, and 80 percent of tweets come from 10 percent of users.

121
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,760
So 80 percent of tweets come from 2 percent of Americans. And it's not a representative 2 percent.

122
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,920
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population,

123
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,680
and that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,

124
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,920
more educated, and higher income. And far left hammer and sickle Twitter is an even smaller,

125
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,520
even more unrepresentative sample within a sample. We're talking about less than 0.1 percent of

126
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,880
Americans. And that less than 0.1 percent does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific

127
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
tweeters, and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform. Which is why

128
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,400
there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture is produced by a

129
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,600
relatively tiny group of people. So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater

130
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,120
to this retrograde soft conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

131
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign, and I enraged people's dogs by knocking

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
on their doors and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls. And I really recommend

133
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,360
that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though it is the worst thing in

134
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
the world and I hated it so much. You know, you do have to listen to a lot of,

135
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,240
I don't want Barack Hussein, Obama, redistributing my wealth.

136
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,440
Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping

137
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,320
business, but whatever. Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of what your fellow

138
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,760
Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

139
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,640
you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist.

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,160
You know, most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves

141
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,960
and their families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking

142
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,760
points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is on about Antifa

143
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,880
so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

144
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,320
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,

145
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,360
in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa and Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,440
It's Ryan and his transgender furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,

147
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,960
or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,160
You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to do that,

149
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,720
because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with them.

150
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,800
You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,

151
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,760
what's Indigenous Peoples Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,240
height of praxis? And who probably watch ContraPoints? How embarrassing. You know,

153
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,640
you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.

154
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,600
How very bourgeois. But revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

155
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the U.S.

156
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:29,360
government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid.

157
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,360
I mean, I guess I admire the ambition. Just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.

158
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,120
Are you counting on the U.S. military and police taking the side of the communists,

159
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,560
or is your plan to overpower them? Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,

160
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,960
I don't think that much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution.

161
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,520
So there will have to be a war. You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After

162
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,240
the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923. But you are going to need to

163
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?

164
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,560
So how's that going, Talitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?

165
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,360
Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,

166
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,400
when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,

167
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,640
they actually mean it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,

168
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,000
the three percenters, the boogaloo boys, their stockpiling weapons, and training to use them.

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
They have ex-military men in their ranks, and connections to white supremacists within the

170
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,960
police and the military. Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,

171
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,920
it strikes me as ideation, not intent. You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between

172
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,880
two kinds of suicidal thinking. So there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how

173
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,200
you're going to do it. And then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.

174
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,920
And then there's ideation, which is, you know, you're not actually going to do it, but you just

175
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,440
have that inner monologue that's constantly saying, I just want to die. There's no more joy

176
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,640
for me left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all. And

177
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,400
then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,

178
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,480
not again, doctor. Not again. So right wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

179
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,320
whereas left wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,120
kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics. Well, you can't plan a revolution.

181
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,520
Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice. Yeah, so a riot is the

182
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,960
language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it? What is the point of speaking through a

183
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,520
riot or a protest or a strike? Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the

184
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,720
point not just to speak, but to be heard? Heard by Holmes? Who are you trying to persuade? The

185
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,080
glob glob govicle lab? No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.

186
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,280
So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen. This year, the US has seen one

187
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,480
of the biggest protest movements in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment,

188
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,360
we have a president promising to double down on law and order on military police suppression,

189
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
a president who told a room full of cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.

190
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,360
And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown

191
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,520
in. Rough. I said, please don't be too nice. And let's be clear, both Biden and cop Mola have an

192
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,160
ugly record when it comes to crime and policing. For most of his career, Biden has called for more

193
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
policing, which is the opposite of what we need right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby John.

194
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,080
But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse about policing and criminal justice. And Biden

195
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,600
has responded by beginning to shift his position. This year's democratic platform includes things

196
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,720
like stricter use of force standards, banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,

197
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,320
creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,

198
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,600
investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough? No, it's not good enough.

199
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,640
But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are at least willing to listen to

200
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,400
protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961, he didn't want to propose a civil rights

201
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,080
bill because that would have been super unpopular with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened

202
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,200
and there were protests and uprisings all over the South in the march on Washington that summer.

203
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,040
And Kennedy listened. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality

204
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,000
that no city or state or legislative body can fruitively choose to ignore them. He was moved

205
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,560
by the protests and he responded by introducing what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what

206
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,920
if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963? What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump

207
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,480
had been president? We might not have gotten a civil rights act. So it does matter who's president.

208
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,960
It actually matters a lot. And please, Tabby-Chan, do not let a fascist win to own the libs.

209
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:23,120
God damn it. All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state. And yeah,

210
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,000
I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump is going to throw when

211
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,920
an entire nation rejects him. And I'm letting that motivate me. In some states, you can still

212
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,240
register. So register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in person, go to vote.org and

213
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,080
find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there. Make sure your phone's

214
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,400
charged and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends. If you're like me, you need to

215
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,200
set an alarm so you don't forget and then just try not to get inconsolably high until after you've

216
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,240
placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year of hell. And I, for one, think

217
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,080
that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives

218
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,520
this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out.

219
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,640
He is the enemy of the world.

220
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,080
Then,

221
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
then,

222
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
then,

223
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
then,

224
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
next,

225
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
next,

226
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
next,

227
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
next,

228
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
next,

229
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
next,

230
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
next,

231
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
next,

232
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
next,

233
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
next,

234
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
next,

235
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
next,

236
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
next,

237
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
next,

238
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
next,

239
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
next,

240
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
next,

241
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
next,

242
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
now,

243
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
now,

244
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
now

245
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
now,

246
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
now,

247
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:48,520
It does not let you eat the judgment of justice, it does not let you wear whatever the seal of the Lord wants to see.

248
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:58,520
It does not let you eat the judgment of the Lord.

249
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:09,520
It shows you all the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

250
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,520
For I know the thoughts that I think are distressing the Lord.

251
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,520
For I know the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

252
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

253
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

254
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

255
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

256
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:59,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord, as the Lord heard the call of the sea.

257
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:10,520
For I know the thoughts, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of the Lord as the Lord.

258
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I know the thoughts that I think are the dreams of your school friend, and things you may know better than the part of me today.

259
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't worry, I'll stay still.

260
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Till today, I will stop the change, and don't you want to do justice?

261
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
From the time...
