1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,140
...

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:47,740
One, hello darkness, hello children, it is I, the darkness within.

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,020
So you know how life is like kind of bad?

5
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,340
Well what are you going to do about that?

6
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,700
I mean there's a few things you can do.

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,980
First you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,500
That's probably the most effective approach eventually but the problem is that it's hard

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,820
and I don't like things that are hard because when you do things that are hard you have

10
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,300
to feel bad now so that you can feel good later and I don't want to feel good later.

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,620
I want to feel good now and if you want to feel good now well you have a couple options.

12
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,500
The first is of course to do drugs and I've tried that I spent most of my 20s on the threshold

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
of alcoholism but it turns out that's not a cute look for me it's not my vibe so what

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,340
I do now when I feel the darkness coming is what any respectable woman would do.

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,580
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

16
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,740
Is it a pee under my mattress your majesty or is it another Xanax I left under the throat

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
rug?

18
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,660
Now the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off you feel bad again.

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,540
In fact you probably feel worse.

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,660
So where do we go from here?

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,460
Well how about music?

22
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,420
When you feel bad you want to listen to sad music because sad music makes you cry.

23
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,900
And crying feels good.

24
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,620
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,140
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?

26
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,860
The sound of silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
You know.

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,700
Hello darkness my old friend.

30
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,460
But in the memes you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.

31
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,940
You only hear hello darkness my old friend.

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,220
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song which is good because if you're making

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,020
songs for sad people it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

34
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,960
When you're sad happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,680
There were 10 seconds into the song, hello darkness my old friend, the key is D sharp

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
minor.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,200
The saddest of all keys.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,440
But when we get to the next line, because of vision softly creeping, something happens.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Let's listen.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:10,800
Come to talk with you again Because of vision softly creeping

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Ah!

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
What was that?

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Suddenly a major chord, an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds, and every

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,560
peach fuzz hair on the back of my biologically female Nax stands on end.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Hello light.

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,040
So the song has enticed me with its promise of company for misery and then it has tricked

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,600
me into feeling good.

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,660
And that's what I like about art.

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,360
It takes the standard disappointments and humiliations of life and cooks them into something

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,160
worth getting off the floor for.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,560
Unfortunately I don't really play music much anymore because my hands are too beautiful

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,360
for instruments and my singing voice sounds like a man.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,320
So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to.

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Comedy.

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,840
And I especially like dark comedy.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,560
You know, comedy about the things in life that are the most painful.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,480
To me, Dark Hammer is kind of like a sad song.

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,840
It takes your worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twists them into a source of

60
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
pleasure.

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Ah!

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,680
A lot of the time that means joking about topics that an ordinary life are considered

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
taboo.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,960
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,200
Without the ability to joke and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing, substance

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,920
abuse, gender dysphoria, I mean I'd probably be on the floor right now looking for that

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Xanax.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,880
But this puts me in a difficult situation because I want to defend my sense of humor

70
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,920
which I feel is like the core of my personality and what keeps me alive.

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,920
But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture who are really

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,320
big on defending provocative, controversial, politically incorrect comedy are kind of umâ€¦

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
dick nuggets?

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
Let's discuss this.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,360
And by discuss, I mean use it quietly and I'll tell you what to think.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
2.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Dick Nuggets

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,840
So the year 2016 had just begun and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,320
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian, was ranting on Twitter for days

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,840
and days about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

81
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,360
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais, a man whose personal branding screams,

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,160
I don't care about your feelings, I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs,

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
I am too much of a badass rebel to care what minorities think.

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,120
But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass, irreverent, not caring about

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,520
your feelings kind of month.

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Why?

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,320
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
about ol' Tranma, Caitlyn Jenner.

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight, I've changed.

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,200
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,920
Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist, ooh.

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,520
I mean I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage, but honestly the joke wasn't

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,720
even as transphobic as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

95
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it, and Ricky spent the rest

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,600
of the month tweeting about how offending people is good actually, and he definitely

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,680
doesn't care that people were offended.

98
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,200
But clearly, Twitter got to him, because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,120
with a 13 minute bit rehashing the incident, and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent

100
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
jokes.

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,200
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,880
Well, I am a chimp, if I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp, pre-op, but um, and don't ever

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,240
deadname me, don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again, from now on you call me Bobo.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,880
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage in a $20 million comedy special?

106
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,760
My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passe and overdone, it also

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,360
doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe that trans women are delusional men,

108
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,040
and even then, it's just not very funny.

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
But am I offended by the joke?

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny, and as a great

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,520
comedian named Ricky Gervais once said, to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,

112
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,000
badly delivered, and not funny enough.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,400
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,200
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle it seems like

116
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,280
our culture repeats about once a week.

117
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,740
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke, and other people are indignant

118
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,920
about the fact that those people are offended.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,000
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle in a culture war that's supposedly going

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,840
on between generation snowflake easily triggered humorless peasy cucks and badass edgy nothing

121
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,760
off limits free speech truth tellers.

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides, then I am a double agent because

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm a generation snowflake peasy cuck who loves dank edgy memes, and I've found myself

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,460
on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.

125
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,360
So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian for some shitty trans

126
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
joke, my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

127
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,240
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,640
And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living, I

129
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,920
appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

130
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,480
while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.

131
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,280
So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles and

132
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,800
try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.

133
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
What is the purpose of comedy?

134
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,720
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

135
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,840
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

136
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,800
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,560
Is it, as Aristotle said, the imitation of worse than average men?

138
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?

139
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,760
Well I don't think there's a single objective answer.

140
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,040
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.

141
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,200
But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
And by we, again, I do mean me.

143
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouth shut.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
3.

145
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Straw men.

146
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,840
So as a trans woman up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,040
are funny, a lot of haters and losers out there are probably going to try to straw

148
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
man me.

149
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,640
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

150
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Since people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.

151
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,240
Here's the straw person's assholes.

152
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
Straw person one.

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,560
You hate free speech and are trying to silence comedians.

154
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,680
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

155
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,200
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage and I can say whatever I want about them.

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,360
Straw person two.

157
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,520
You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,720
I transitioned on YouTube making controversial political content all the while and I read

159
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
the comments.

160
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,240
My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

161
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
Of course I do not have the internalized self-loathing that has damaged my psyche irreparably, but

162
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,000
sweetie, who doesn't?

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
Straw person three.

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,520
You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.

165
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,960
I invented joking about trans people.

166
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

167
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm that tran.

168
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
That's right.

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,080
If I die tomorrow, my legacy will be that I applied wine tasting terminology to fellatio

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,240
and I accept my destiny.

171
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,400
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

172
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,440
I live for trans jokes.

173
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,240
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them because they don't know enough

174
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,840
about trans people to know what the funny things are.

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.

176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
Like you used to live as one gender and then you became a different gender.

177
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.

178
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,840
But humor is in the details.

179
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,680
And Ricky Gervais does not know the details because he's clearly never been close to

180
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,880
a trans person and that's why he's still telling these Tinkertoy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner

181
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
jokes.

182
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
And it's too bad.

183
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
stuff too.

185
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline calling her hormones titty skittles.

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,680
No, I like the edgy stuff.

187
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
I like being on the edge.

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.

189
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy that I'd like to share with you because

190
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,640
when you're doing art criticism it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

191
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,400
And the exemplary work I have in mind is one not a lot of people are talking about yet

192
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,120
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company as the works of Dante or Swift.

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,840
I am of course referring to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.

194
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,200
If you don't know who Gigi is, first of all who even are you, do you have no respect

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
for legends?

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,180
She's a trans YouTuber like the trans YouTuber whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

197
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,800
and I had sex with a dog long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

198
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,320
But in this critic's opinion, the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt the

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,720
singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

200
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
Let's do a close reading.

201
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
4.

202
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,640
Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience

203
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,200
A great work of literature is never just a text.

204
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,320
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson would call a moment within

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,640
an intertextual dialectic.

206
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Love that.

207
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,920
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience within its proper context.

208
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,400
Several months earlier Gigi had released a video about how she and her girlfriend were

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,760
trying to have a child so far without success and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

210
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,120
Apparently Gigi was not aware that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile

211
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,960
which girl they tell you like seven times before you start hormones.

212
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Like how?

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
We'll move past it.

214
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,360
A few months later the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone

215
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,520
cause that's right I clicked the bell and immediately I knew I was about to experience

216
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,600
something special.

217
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,960
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater than anything I've ever conceived of that

218
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,920
honestly it makes me feel like a failure both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

219
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,160
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature, the eyes are dotted with hearts

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,080
and her facial expression.

221
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Ew.

222
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Come.

223
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,920
The video begins with Gigi explaining that in order to produce a sample for the clinic

224
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,640
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

225
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,400
So I hesitantly agreed I was like fine I will stop all of my hormones so you know my shit

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
can get juicy again and I can get a good little sample up in here.

227
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,760
The sperm bank day arrives she goes to the clinic and approaches the receptionist.

228
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,360
And I said yes ma'am I am here to give sperm from me to be frozen now.

229
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,680
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room which she describes with the precision

230
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,160
of mama Flaubert.

231
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
I walk into this room fluorescent lighting the house.

232
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,120
I was like I can see every pore in my arm like Jesus what do they want me to do here?

233
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
And then the kicker this like leather couch the back is kind of like angled so I guess

234
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,000
like you can lean and really get into it or something.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,400
The doctor offers her lubrication pornography if needed and a donation cup Gigi closes the

236
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,000
door and gets to work.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,280
I get in the mood I get in the zone and I'm killing it bitch I am like I'm going to give

238
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,000
the best sample ever my kid is going to be a godsend child before I know it the moment

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,960
has crept up on me it happened and it's been so long that it hits the wall behind me.

240
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,920
And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgias gets up off the leather couch

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,360
and attempts to scrape a prodigious quantity of Gigi Gism off the wall of a fluorescent

242
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,400
lit exam room in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

243
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,000
And I took the cup and I was like full on like scraping it off the wall because I was

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,200
like I'm not going to let any little drop go to waste you know I'm here this is like

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
my moment.

246
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,240
I'm trying to understand why this video makes me laugh so much it's really the contrast

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,160
of style and substance like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person told this story

248
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,000
It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine storytelling style and this real housewives

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,160
diction but the story itself is about blasting a giant load onto a wall of a room full of

250
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,720
leather and pornography.

251
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,720
The dissonance between form and content is genius and that dissonance perfectly captures

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,640
the absurdity of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness that Ricky Gervais could

253
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
only dream of.

254
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,800
I also really relate to this story because right before I started Hormones I decided

255
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,800
to freeze a sample of my own so I too have a sperm bank experience.

256
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,360
And it was exactly like Gigi describes down to every detail.

257
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,440
It is not a dignified moment ladies there is just no way to feel like a woman while

258
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,160
you're hastily rubbing one out in an over lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

259
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I feel so fish right now.

260
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,760
For this five minutes in the exam room I was a man.

261
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Now I somehow managed to get most of my sample into the cup but there's a different absurd

262
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,080
detail to my story.

263
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,560
The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork that I was depositing because

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
I was going to start feminizing hormones and he asked me if there was a name I preferred

265
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
he called me.

266
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,680
In retrospect he was actually really sweet and really cute.

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,800
Not that anything was going to come of that at the time since I was pretty everything

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,440
and rough around the edges.

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
To be honest I was all edges but he asked me for my preferred name and I just blurted

270
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
out Natalie.

271
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,000
And so this was actually the first time anyone ever called me by my biological name and it

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
went like this.

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,840
The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me and said right this way Natalie here's

274
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,800
a cup for you to bust a nut in.

275
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,840
And that's how my life as a woman began.

276
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,760
Now in the end Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

277
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,440
Her sample wasn't usable.

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,400
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA but she's been on hormones too long and she

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
just can't.

280
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,800
And that revelation at the end of the video kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole

281
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
story.

282
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,360
In the ridiculous image of Gigi scraping a jackalit off the wall I now see this primal

283
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,280
maternal urge to produce and protect children.

284
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,360
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen prematurely from the nest.

285
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,060
I see the virgin Mary cradling her child.

286
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,160
I really really thought that I was going to have a good sample and I was going to be able

287
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
to participate in having a baby with my DNA but it's just not in the cards for me.

288
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,320
And I really wanted to make this video more positive and funny because there is nothing

289
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I can do.

290
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,240
And that's exactly it.

291
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,320
That is the darkness.

292
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
5.

293
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,600
The darkness.

294
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
The darkness is my name for what I consider the highest form of comedy where you take

295
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,680
your own worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twist them into a source of pleasure.

296
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,680
The darkness is Richard Pryor running down the street in flames because he set himself

297
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,920
on fire in a coke field psychosis.

298
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,480
The darkness is Gigi gorgeous scraping her own prodigious jism off the wall of an exam

299
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,380
room in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

300
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,140
If you can make these low points funny then you're going to be okay.

301
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,260
You're going to survive.

302
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,740
You're going to make it through life.

303
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,860
And I need that now more than ever because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty

304
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
dark.

305
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,820
But trans people make it through because we're good humored and strong as fuck.

306
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,780
Pretty soon I'm going to have to stop hormones before an operation and I'm terrified of

307
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
that.

308
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,780
What's going to happen to me when I stop hormones?

309
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,260
Am I going to become a man again?

310
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,100
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

311
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,820
I am thinking about names though like maybe Nathan or Jaden.

312
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,660
I can see myself as a Jaden.

313
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,300
See I've got to have my little jokey jokes or I don't think I can make it through this.

314
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,460
Like when I have bottom surgery I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as my sex

315
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,240
change operation because it makes me laugh.

316
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
It brings me joy.

317
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,980
Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.

318
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,940
Now it's important to notice that just because it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean it's

319
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,140
a politically correct euphemism.

320
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,740
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change because you're literally

321
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,100
not changing your sex.

322
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,740
That's not what surgery does.

323
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,220
But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness where they mistake edginess for

324
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,460
honesty, accuracy, and directness but these are very different things.

325
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,340
For example, George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms that has some great moments

326
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,340
but also some moments that are way off base.

327
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,180
For example, content warning ableist slur.

328
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,620
They say they're going to preboard those passengers in need of special assistance.

329
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:30,140
So look, I understand the aesthetic preference for simple, honest, direct language and the

330
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,020
repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.

331
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,460
That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

332
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,260
But the word he just used is literally a slur so I wonder if what you're being honest

333
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,140
about is your feelings toward disabled people.

334
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,620
Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance is a little wordy sure but in this

335
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,180
situation it's actually more accurate since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,

336
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,100
anyone in need of assistance boarding.

337
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,540
So I call my gender confirmation surgery getting a sex change not because it's more direct

338
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,380
and honest but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated and that makes me laugh.

339
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,020
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller but because I'm a bad person.

340
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,860
And I get to call it my sex change operation but cis people don't get to call it that

341
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,140
because it's my darkness not yours.

342
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Get your own darkness.

343
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,060
When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people he's being a hack because he knows nothing

344
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
of our darkness.

345
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,020
And when someone tries to joke about something that they're totally ignorant of the result

346
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,060
is usually clumsy, awkward and not very funny.

347
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,140
What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness

348
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,300
and turned it within.

349
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,620
Because within is where the darkness lies.

350
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,820
6.

351
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,500
Self-deprecation Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite

352
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,900
because as a lazy, selfish, preening, attention whore who looks like a slightly more passable

353
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,580
and culture with the voice of a tropical bird there is a lot of material here to work with.

354
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,500
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes there is a faction of the trans community

355
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,380
that is not amused by the buffoonery that goes on on this channel.

356
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,060
I think the objection to it is best summed up by the comic Hannah Gatsby who in her stand-up

357
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,060
special Nanette said that when self-deprecation comes from someone who exists in the margins

358
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,860
it's not humility, it's humiliation.

359
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,660
And to be honest I felt a little called out by that.

360
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,860
I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak.

361
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,460
And she's not wrong like that is how this works.

362
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,340
In order to gain an audience as a trans person you have to demonstrate what cis people call

363
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
self-awareness.

364
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,460
That is, you have to signal that you see yourself the way the audience sees you, which can mean

365
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,340
looking at yourself with a pretty merciless gaze.

366
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,740
And of course I'm happy to do that because I have no self-respect and laughter is the

367
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,060
only way to numb the pain.

368
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,760
But the terrible thing about being a not-normal with an audience is that you don't just get

369
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,340
to be yourself because whether you like it or not people will see you as a representative

370
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,260
of the community.

371
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,540
So because of that responsibility which I never asked for I have to balance out the

372
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,980
self-deprecation with a lot of positive messaging about my people.

373
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,460
And that way the dark jokes function as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis

374
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,780
go down.

375
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,460
But even without the group representation issue it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation

376
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
too far.

377
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,900
As I've said I have been diagnosed with an incurable edginess of temperament and I sometimes

378
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,560
do feel suffocated by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces even though those

379
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,440
spaces are there for good reason and a lot of people need them.

380
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,800
But sometimes this atmosphere of everything and everyone is valid all the time, no uncomfortable

381
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,840
questions may be asked, any self-deprecation is a sign of traumatic internalized bigotry,

382
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,000
I just need to get out of there for a while and find a place where I can relax and be

383
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
my edgy self.

384
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,360
I need a safe space for my edginess where I can just blurt out whatever stupid question

385
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,400
or joke comes to mind without being afraid that I'm going to inflict horrible trauma

386
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
on everyone around me.

387
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,720
So I call up another transsexual edgelady, you know, Kiki, accuse each other of being

388
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
cross-dressers and just laugh it all off.

389
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,160
And it's so so cathartic to do that but it does have to be done in moderation because

390
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,140
there can come a point where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.

391
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,160
And it mostly has to be done in private because in public you have to worry about how cis

392
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,120
people will interpret it and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating without

393
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
abandoning all social responsibility.

394
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,040
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that instantly deadens all laughter, it's social responsibility.

395
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,100
But since it's kind of the central topic of the comedy culture war, I should probably

396
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,760
say something about it, even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back to jabbering

397
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
about my sex change.

398
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
7.

399
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,200
The eternal tension.

400
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,120
So what is a comedian's job?

401
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
What is a comedian supposed to do?

402
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,960
I suppose my ideal comedian is one who is perfectly able to balance the tension between

403
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,480
shitposting and snowflakery.

404
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,880
And this is an eternal tension and must never be resolved.

405
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,280
It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.

406
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,760
See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery, you get a moralist who might say that a comedian's

407
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,640
purpose is to promote justice by punching up, by speaking truth to power, by exposing

408
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,920
the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.

409
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,440
And these are all very admirable goals but they leave out what I think is the essential

410
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,400
purpose of comedy, which is to be funny, to surprise, to shock, to make people laugh.

411
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,280
It's kind of like how some art and media critics only ever evaluate a work based on

412
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,640
whether or not it's socially progressive and don't seem to really think about aesthetic

413
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,440
pleasure very much, which, to me, is the reason why art exists in the first place.

414
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,160
But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent and should probably be sent to the

415
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
guillotine at once.

416
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,240
Just let me do my makeup first so that when they hold my head up, everyone can see my

417
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,200
beat and their wings all fly to the Bastille.

418
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,560
Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram because that's gonna get a lot

419
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,000
of engagement.

420
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,320
So the opposite of the pure snowflake is the pure shit poster, who might say that a comedian's

421
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,680
purpose is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.

422
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,400
But that seems kind of barbaric since, like, if a guard at a prison camp is torturing an

423
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,280
inmate and the other guards are laughing, does that count as comedy?

424
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,640
Is a war crime funny?

425
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,160
Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.

426
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,040
The thing is, I don't think many comedians actually believe in a completely nihilistic

427
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,240
vision of comedy.

428
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,680
I think they sometimes pretend to when they're trying to evade criticism.

429
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,000
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics and listen to the way they talk about

430
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,360
their heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

431
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,440
There's always an element of admiration for bravery, risk, subversion, truth telling.

432
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,680
In other words, there's a concern there for what is virtuous and what is true, not

433
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,680
just for what makes people laugh.

434
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,280
So maybe, before we can even talk about what's funny, we have to have a level of shared agreement

435
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,600
about what is true and what is morally right.

436
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,040
My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes is not just that they're not funny.

437
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,720
I think he's wrong about trans people, and I think his ignorance is infectious.

438
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,400
I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience, which has the consequence

439
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,360
of making the world slightly scarier for people like me.

440
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,160
And this is edginess at its worst.

441
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,040
Just a privileged person with a platform punching down at a politically besieged group he understands

442
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
nothing about.

443
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,920
And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension collapses into pure shitposting.

444
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,080
It's boring and immature, like when someone says he wants to watch the world burn.

445
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,240
You only get to watch when you have the privilege of not being on fire.

446
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,920
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

447
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,840
The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.

448
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,560
Edginess is always adolescent.

449
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,040
The darkness is edginess, aged by time and pain.

450
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,400
And it's only at that full maturity that comedy becomes art, that it becomes comparable to

451
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
music.

452
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,600
So, those are my thoughts.

453
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
Like comment and subscribe.

454
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,200
The end.

455
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,120
And I'll sing the song.

456
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,000
I wish my brother George was here.

457
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:37,160
Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly

458
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:44,800
creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping.

459
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:57,800
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains within the sound of silence.

460
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,800
In restless dreams I walked alone.

461
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Narrow streets of cobblestone, beneath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar

462
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,080
to the cold and damp.

463
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:31,360
When my eyes were stopped by the flash of a neon light, I split the night and touched

464
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,920
the sound of silence.

465
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:48,000
And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more.

466
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
People talking without speaking.

467
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,640
People hearing without listening.

468
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,640
People writing songs that voices never share.

469
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:17,080
No one dared disturb the sound of silence.

470
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,440
Stay gorgeous.
