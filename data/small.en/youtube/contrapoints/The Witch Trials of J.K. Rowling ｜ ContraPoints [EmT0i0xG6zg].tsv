0	5000	Saar, I'm gonna talk about Jorro once again.
5380	8340	But first, story time.
9380	11680	Chapter one, Anita.
12880	15800	The most famous bigot in American LGBT history
15800	18240	is a woman called Anita Bryant.
18240	20140	This is her story.
22060	25540	1977 was not a good time to be gay.
25540	27920	Is it ever really a good time to be gay?
30280	33740	In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights
33740	35240	into national consciousness.
35240	38080	The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,
38080	41320	and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association
41320	44100	declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.
44100	46940	But only after gay activists disrupted their conference
46940	50380	and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.
50380	54980	We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced.
54980	57960	Because that's the only way to get anything done
57960	60440	in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.
60440	61700	They give you no choice.
61700	65780	On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,
65780	68680	known for such popular cities as Miami,
68680	70640	approved a law that added the phrase
70640	73060	affectionate or sexual preference
73060	75020	to its non-discrimination ordinance,
75020	77980	effectively banning housing and employment discrimination
77980	80040	on the basis of sexual orientation.
80040	84040	And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,
84040	86960	that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.
86960	90220	Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!
90220	92140	Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman
92140	94900	who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,
94900	97680	and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.
97680	101240	Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree.
101240	104040	My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida
104040	105200	any time of the day.
105200	106740	Orange juice from Florida!
106740	108920	It isn't just for breakfast anymore!
108920	112320	Orange juice with natural vitamin C
112320	115860	from the Florida Sunshine Tree.
115860	118700	She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,
118700	122060	A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.
122060	125620	Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.
125620	126460	Cute.
126460	128140	When Anita heard her pastor speak
128140	130160	about this non-discrimination ordinance,
130160	133700	she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.
133700	134620	How touching.
134620	136020	According to the word of God,
136020	139980	it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.
139980	143060	As a mother, she would not stand for this.
143060	145480	So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner,
146120	148320	as a concerned mother of four children,
148320	151400	I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.
151400	152480	I have never condoned
152480	155360	nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.
155360	158440	But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,
158440	161880	you will in fact be infringing upon my rights
161880	164800	and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother
164800	166800	to teach my children God's moral code
166800	168680	as stated in the Holy Scriptures.
168680	170960	Anita, kill your shitty child.
170960	172440	When the amendment passed,
172440	174840	Anita created a campaign for its repeal.
174840	177760	The Save Our Children Coalition,
177760	179800	which sponsored provocative TV ads
179800	182040	implying that gay people are degenerates
182040	184920	who ruin communities and seduce children.
184920	186600	The campaign has been vicious.
186600	187880	With television commercials,
187880	189760	the Save Our Children group is appealing
189760	191560	to parental anxieties,
191560	194000	saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality
194000	195840	before impressionable children.
195840	197240	The Orange Bowl parade,
197240	200640	Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.
200640	203940	But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,
203940	205740	it's a parade of homosexuals,
205740	207220	men hugging other men,
207220	208700	cavorting with little boys.
208700	212140	Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash
212140	214220	to gay rights in the United States,
214220	217140	escalating the conflict into a national controversy.
217140	219740	On one side were the gay rights activists
219740	221180	who argued that non-discrimination
221180	222860	was a matter of human rights.
222860	225540	On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued
225540	227140	that the non-discrimination ordinance
227140	230700	would give special privileges to homosexuals.
230700	232060	We all believe in human rights,
232060	234820	but we don't believe human rights
234820	236500	that would corrupt our children
236500	239620	or for individuals who have special privileges
239620	241820	that would go against the constitutional rights
241820	243100	of the normal America.
243100	245260	As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,
245260	247060	they have equal rights the same as anyone else.
247060	249900	In other words, gay people already have equal rights
249900	252100	just as long as they stay in the closet
252100	253820	and don't do anything gay.
253820	255940	That's very helpful.
255940	258460	Thank you so much, Anita,
258460	261940	for standing up for our right to be gay
262700	264020	in secret.
264020	265660	As long as they do their job
265660	267100	and do not want to come out of the closet
267100	269140	and force their homosexuality
269140	272140	on being in the areas of business or in the schools,
272140	274060	they can live their life.
274060	276260	And we're not going out after their jobs
276260	279020	or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.
279020	282580	Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals
282580	286420	to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.
286420	288500	Just biologically that God made mothers
288500	289700	so that we could reproduce.
289700	293060	Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,
293060	296700	but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.
296700	299220	It's the exact same argument that's being used today
299220	300940	by right-wing politicians who claim
300940	303020	that queer people are groomers.
303020	305500	Stop confusing our babies
305500	309100	with your groomer gender ideologue.
309100	312580	This wicked book, me and Earl and the dying girl
312580	316380	sexually indoctrinated with wicked vile books.
316380	317940	And she believes in traditional marriage
317940	319020	between a man and a woman.
319020	320980	And in that book it talked about two moms.
320980	324460	Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.
324460	325780	People should definitely arm themselves.
325780	326620	I agree with that.
326620	328580	The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.
328580	331700	The Democrats are the party of teachers,
331700	333140	elementary school teachers,
333140	337220	trying to transition their elementary school-aged children
337220	339260	and convince them they're a different gender.
339260	342620	They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.
342620	343740	They're recruiting.
343740	345020	They don't know what furries are.
345020	348940	It's where school children dress up as animals,
348940	352500	cats or dogs during the school day.
352500	353940	They meow and they bark.
353940	356140	What a great country we live in.
356140	359020	I love it so much.
359020	362020	Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant
362020	363260	and save our children.
363260	366100	There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice
366100	369060	with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu
369060	372180	and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail
372180	373980	called an Anita Bryant.
373980	376060	Let's make one now.
376060	377140	Forgot my cocktail measure
377140	379620	so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.
379620	381420	There's the dash of apple juice.
381420	382860	Give it a stir.
385220	386420	Needs a garnish.
388420	389260	Stunning.
389260	390780	I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,
390780	392780	but if I was in the 70s,
392780	394940	I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things
394940	396620	out of pure spite.
396620	398300	There's a story that Troy Perry,
398300	399860	the founder of the gay-affirming
399860	401820	metropolitan community church,
401820	403860	was on a transcontinental flight.
403860	405700	And when the attendant put a glass of orange juice
405700	406940	on his tray, he said,
406940	408300	take that away.
408300	409740	I'm a homosexual.
409740	413260	At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,
413260	415860	anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently
415860	418060	on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.
418060	420300	Anita Bryant sucks oranges.
420300	423820	A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.
423820	424660	True.
424660	426500	And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired
426500	428380	more anti-gay legislation,
428380	431460	including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,
431460	433600	both of which passed in the Florida Senate,
433600	436640	as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,
436640	438240	which would have forced public schools
438240	439880	to fire gay teachers.
439880	442000	So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.
442000	443940	She was an influential bigot,
443940	446040	but she may also have helped to unify
446040	448080	and galvanize gay activists
448080	450200	by providing them with a common enemy.
450200	452400	According to historian Lillian Faderman,
452400	454880	Anita Bryant created fervent activists
454880	456800	out of those who'd previously been content
456800	459240	simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.
459240	461620	Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation
461660	464820	that a mass movement can get along fine without a God,
464820	467060	but it won't get along at all without a devil.
467060	469020	For gay people all over the country,
469020	471500	Anita Bryant became that devil.
471500	474700	I think that she is rallying the community together
474700	476220	like I have never seen before.
476220	477980	It's not like I could have done it on my own.
477980	480660	So even though she succeeded in her initial goal
480660	482940	to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,
482940	485420	there is no question that in the long term,
485420	487260	Anita Bryant was the loser.
487260	488780	She took a lot of L's.
488780	489620	Rip.
489620	490820	That must be super hard for her.
490820	492820	For the short remainder of her career,
492820	495180	gay activists protested her events.
495180	496900	They shut down the tour for her book
496900	500020	about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,
500020	502320	and they succeeded in turning public opinion
502320	504260	against Anita Bryant to the point
504260	506420	that she became virtually unemployable
506420	507980	in mainstream entertainment.
507980	509420	And it helped that she came across
509420	511220	as kind of a judgmental prude
511220	512980	that even hip straight people
512980	515140	didn't want to be associated with.
515140	517780	Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant,
517780	520580	former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,
521220	523620	performed co-eaters in public yesterday,
524620	526980	campaigned to promote heterosexuality.
526980	529900	We don't serve orange juice anymore.
529900	531980	Like she famously told Playboy magazine.
531980	534380	Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?
534380	535980	It's because they eat the forbidden fruit
535980	537220	of the tree of life.
537220	539100	God referred to men as trees,
539100	541680	and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,
541680	542980	which is male sperm.
542980	544260	Oh my God.
544260	546720	Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.
546720	548460	This is how you lose the culture war.
548820	551660	Let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita.
552860	555660	That's the energy we surround.
555660	558240	And of course, there was the famous incident
558240	561020	where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie
561020	563380	in Anita's face during a TV appearance.
563380	565660	And went into a place called North Fork, Virginia,
565660	570220	and we're met with protest and all kinds of problems.
570220	572060	And every-
574460	575780	Security agent, security agent.
575780	576620	No, no, let him stay.
576620	578220	No. Let him stay.
578740	580100	Well, at least it's a fruit pie.
580100	582100	Miami-Dade County finally reinstated
582100	584820	the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,
584820	588280	and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.
588280	592660	In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face
592660	596220	when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,
596220	599540	announcing her marriage to a woman and publicly struggling
599540	602580	with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.
602580	605580	It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks
605580	608180	that an integral part of your identity
608180	611540	is just an evil delusion.
612420	613620	That it is, Sarah.
613620	615420	That it is.
615420	617260	So that's the story of Anita Bryant
617260	619820	as students of LGBT history know it.
619820	622260	But isn't it a bit one-sided?
622260	625660	Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?
625660	629700	The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.
629700	632460	Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.
632460	633740	I played on both the houses.
633740	637060	Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita
637060	639100	as a bigot and a homophobe?
639100	642380	In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant
642380	645420	was the real victim?
647780	648700	Oh, no.
648700	649540	Oh, no.
653340	654420	I can't do this anymore.
654420	655260	I'm eating my pie.
655260	656620	I'm eating my goddamn pie.
656620	659980	Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.
659980	660900	God help us all.
661900	664180	The mainstream media would have us believe
664180	666940	that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,
666940	669060	some kind of hateful bigot.
669060	671340	But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic
671340	673860	used to silence valid concerns?
673860	675820	Mothers in this country are worried
675820	677540	about their children going to school
677540	679460	to be taught by perverts.
679460	682380	How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals
682380	684580	weren't the real bigots?
684580	686860	Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant
686860	689300	was the first victim of cancel culture,
689300	692980	of dare I say it, wokeism?
692980	695140	Well, no, that's the dumbest thing
695140	696700	I've ever heard in my entire life.
696700	698340	But suppose that you're an idiot,
698340	699820	and suppose that that's the narrative
699820	701020	you wanted to promote.
701020	702940	Well, what would be your argument?
702940	704500	I mean, if someone put a gun to my head
704500	706460	and forced me to make that argument,
706460	708900	I'd probably say something like this.
708900	711700	Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.
711700	714500	In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty
714500	716060	in rural Oklahoma.
716060	718660	Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,
718700	720620	the same year she made her singing debut
720620	722380	at the Baptist Church.
722380	723620	Parts of my childhood,
723620	725700	I blocked out because it hurts too much.
725700	728100	I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,
728100	729460	and my parents were remarried,
729460	731380	and I was baptized and came to know Christ
731380	732940	as my personal savior.
732940	736100	Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.
736100	737620	It was real painful,
737620	739460	and it just about killed my mother.
739460	741500	She was a very submissive wife.
741500	744260	She was too submissive, and it angered me.
744260	746540	She let my dad step all over her.
746540	748900	Because of him, I think I went through life
748900	750900	for a long time hating all men.
750900	754340	Anita described her most intense adolescent memory
754340	756700	as a feeling of intense ambition.
756700	758220	A relentless drive to succeed
758220	759940	at doing well the thing I loved.
759940	764940	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
765180	769580	It's truth is marching on.
769580	773300	But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role
773300	775660	as a traditional Christian woman.
775660	778500	In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,
778500	780140	Miami's top disc jockey,
780140	783260	the only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.
783260	785260	This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.
788980	792140	Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.
792140	794220	Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,
794220	796460	Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty
796460	799220	nearly unmatched in modern love stories.
799220	801940	And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,
801940	805100	Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.
805100	807020	But while submitting to her husband
807020	810100	and raising four children, Anita was still able
810100	812220	to build the career she'd always wanted.
812220	815660	By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,
815660	817780	earning half a million dollars a year,
817780	819100	enough to move her family
819100	822900	into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.
822900	826340	So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.
826340	828860	Did she really deserve to lose it all
828860	831300	just because she took a stand
831300	833140	for something she believed in?
833140	835660	Anita Bryant's role as a leader in the campaign
835660	838380	against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign
838380	839500	to sell orange juice.
839500	841140	Are you being black-bowled?
841140	843660	Well, it looks that way.
843660	844940	It's worse than that.
844940	848020	We're being threatened, and there's all kinds of harassment,
848020	849700	even with my job with Florida Citrus.
849700	853260	I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother
853260	856340	to defend her children and all children
856340	859100	against their being recruited by homosexuals.
859100	861740	Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.
861740	864380	She'd been dropped as a spokesperson by the orange growers.
864380	865780	She'd been dropped as a commentator
865780	867460	on the Orange Bowl parade.
867460	869460	She lost a television show contract.
869460	871260	Her bookings dropped drastically.
871260	874220	It destroys the dream that I had had since I was a child
874220	876580	to entertain and present wholesome subjects
876580	878460	to my fellow Americans
878460	882220	because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.
882220	884980	No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant
884980	887260	for taking a public stand on something she believed in.
887260	891580	I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house
891580	893700	in a fetal position and wanting to die.
893700	897660	Gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics
897660	900740	to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.
900740	902620	Stop Anita now!
902620	904980	Stop Anita now!
904980	907420	Homosexuals started fighting back.
907420	908940	The gays formed new groups
908940	911380	and picketed the performers' public appearances,
911380	913060	forcing her to cancel a few.
913060	916660	Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.
916660	919580	They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.
919580	921460	They blamed her for hate crimes.
921460	923180	They burned her an effigy.
923180	925700	They disrupted events she was involved in.
925700	928340	They printed toilet paper with her face on it.
928340	930220	Some sent Anita death threats.
930220	932140	Or they mailed her rotting oranges,
932140	934980	dead cockroaches, human excrement.
934980	937580	See, this is how you canceled people before phones.
937580	938940	Instead of shitposting,
938940	941620	you would simply mail actual human shit
941620	943420	through the United States Postal Service.
943420	946980	Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night.
946980	949260	Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.
949260	951580	How would you men feel if you opened a letter
951580	954300	and there was a photo of your wife's head superimposed
954300	955980	on some other female nude body
955980	959460	in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?
959460	960540	You can imagine quite a lot.
960540	962060	I do think it would be fair to say
962060	965660	that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.
965660	968060	Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,
968060	971860	particularly lesbian feminists, abhorred the sexist terms
971860	974420	that were being used to characterize Anita Bryant.
974420	976620	Bitch and whore, gay men called her.
976620	978660	The harassment escalated to the point
978660	980940	where Anita had to cancel her book tour
980940	984700	due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.
984700	986780	And of course, there was the pie.
988460	991020	So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.
991020	991860	It's kind of a deep cut.
991860	993860	Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.
993860	996980	Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,
996980	999340	but what about Anita's right to free speech?
999340	1001700	I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.
1001700	1005140	Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book,
1005140	1007420	Free Speech for Me, but Not for Thee,
1007420	1009860	that the orange shoes boycott reminded him
1009860	1012860	of a little thing called McCarthyism.
1012860	1015460	Have you ever considered that being pro-gay
1015460	1017980	is quite similar to being anti-gay
1017980	1020100	and that both are opinions?
1020100	1023420	As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God
1023420	1026980	were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.
1026980	1029380	The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,
1029380	1031420	religious and civic leaders in opposition
1031420	1033980	to a well-organized, highly financed,
1033980	1037180	and politically militant group of homosexual activists.
1037180	1041020	We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,
1041020	1043340	and deniers of basic human rights.
1043340	1046460	And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned
1046460	1048220	for our children and our community.
1048220	1050980	So Anita's version of the story is that she
1050980	1054500	and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers
1054500	1058180	were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia
1058180	1060780	of gay extremists, all because they had
1061060	1065220	a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual
1065220	1066860	cavorting with little boys.
1066860	1068340	Cavorting with little boys.
1068340	1071300	Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?
1071300	1073140	Until the Dade County ordinance,
1073140	1075100	Anita was a registered Democrat
1075100	1077220	and considered herself a liberal.
1077220	1079420	And she never said that she hated gay people
1079420	1080860	or wanted them dead.
1080860	1084780	In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.
1084780	1087980	I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.
1087980	1090140	I love them enough to tell them the truth
1090140	1092700	because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals
1092700	1096660	that if they're willing to turn from sin
1096660	1098340	the same as any individual,
1098340	1100740	that they can be ex-homosexuals,
1100740	1102300	the same as there can be an ex-murder,
1102300	1103860	an ex thief, or ex-anybody.
1103860	1108300	She loves homosexuals because they can change,
1108300	1110140	just like murderers.
1110140	1113260	Would a bigot have said that?
1113260	1114860	Just about McFucking had it.
1114860	1116700	Anita was so kindhearted,
1116700	1120220	she even said that she related to the homosexual.
1120220	1122020	I can relate to the homosexual
1122020	1124900	because I've had emotional scars in my own life.
1124900	1126900	I really felt the rejection of my father.
1126900	1129220	And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone
1129220	1131100	going into homosexuality.
1131100	1133220	Look, I don't hate homosexuals.
1133220	1134180	That's the truth.
1134180	1136100	No matter what they think of my motives.
1136100	1138620	I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.
1138620	1141260	Wow, what an empath.
1141260	1143140	You know, I actually think it's really noble
1143140	1146340	how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage
1146340	1147740	onto the marginalized group
1147740	1150500	whose rights she's trying to take away.
1150500	1153660	Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,
1153660	1154740	to many sides.
1154740	1156900	We've considered all the evidence.
1156900	1160140	Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head
1160140	1163860	and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve
1163860	1165300	that pie to the face?
1165300	1168140	Well, yes, obviously.
1168140	1169740	But the point I'm trying to make here
1169740	1172620	is that it's possible to take genuine virtues
1172620	1175660	like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,
1175660	1178780	and to twist them into fucked up apologia
1178780	1180940	for horrible, oppressive behavior.
1180940	1182620	If you play this game long enough,
1182620	1184380	you can essentially explain away
1184380	1186380	the entire concept of bigotry
1186380	1189740	and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.
1189740	1192220	There's only tragically misunderstood people
1192220	1195420	with difficult childhoods and valid concerns
1195420	1198780	cruelly demonized by militant activists
1198780	1200880	defaming and silencing them
1200880	1204940	with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.
1204940	1209940	Now, because you, viewers, are smart, media-literate people,
1210260	1213380	you understand framing, so you already know
1213380	1216900	that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.
1216900	1219420	In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling...
1219420	1224220	Oh, J.K. Rowling is a popular author
1224220	1227740	who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,
1227740	1230860	but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers
1230860	1232740	masturbating into stolen panties
1232740	1235060	because she's lost her goddamn mind.
1235060	1237060	Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.
1237060	1239220	Christ, what a nightmare.
1240060	1244360	Chapter three, The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1244360	1247600	All right, kids, it's trans in time.
1247600	1250580	Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast
1250580	1254300	about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,
1254300	1257420	an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church.
1257420	1260340	The notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,
1260340	1263660	most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers
1263660	1266940	with signs that say God hates f***s.
1266940	1269900	God and me both, I'm tired of you people.
1269900	1272780	J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church
1272780	1276080	is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups
1276080	1277000	in the world.
1277000	1280980	In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.
1280980	1283740	I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.
1283740	1286500	I went to a counter-protest in 2010.
1286500	1288420	I remember how when I was in high school,
1288420	1291260	the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing
1291260	1293900	that conservatives and liberals could agree on
1293900	1297260	because they hated the troops and the gays,
1297260	1300580	essentially the two genders of 2006.
1300580	1301420	But let's not pretend
1301420	1303820	that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.
1303820	1305740	Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,
1305740	1309060	she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies
1309060	1311020	about how the gays are going to hell,
1311020	1314380	which to this day, I am a big fan of.
1314380	1318060	But what did you say you think I loved your praying?
1318060	1321380	He hates all you do, cause you love fornicating.
1323380	1324500	It's perfect.
1324500	1325340	I love it.
1325340	1326660	Play it at my funeral.
1326660	1330820	Stop praying, stop praying, God will not hear you anymore.
1330820	1334540	You've got the boys and the girls to be proud of.
1334540	1336220	For, forever burned.
1336220	1337940	Go to the spot and you just keep pushing on
1337940	1340140	to the hell where you were forever burned.
1340140	1343620	Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012
1343620	1347660	after a crisis of faith precipitated by a power struggle
1347660	1349060	within the church.
1349060	1351940	She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,
1351940	1354380	which is honestly a pretty interesting account
1354380	1357140	of deconversion and the circumstances
1357140	1359620	that lead someone to leaving a hate group.
1359620	1362020	Megan contacted me for her podcast
1362020	1364580	because I had criticized to take a ruling
1364580	1366580	in a video a couple of years ago.
1366580	1368820	Now you might be wondering, why would I think
1368820	1371940	that a person who's been carrying a God hates sign
1371940	1374340	most of her life would be the correct person
1374340	1376420	to lead an international conversation
1376420	1379380	about the intricacies of LGBT issues?
1379380	1381780	Because I'm an idiot, happy.
1381780	1384460	Basically, I agreed to the podcast
1384460	1386860	because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.
1386860	1389980	A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church
1389980	1393260	wants to mediate a conversation between me
1393260	1395300	and the author of Harry Potter.
1395300	1397100	Would you say no to that?
1397100	1400260	Maybe, if you're smart.
1400260	1402820	Last month, the podcast was announced
1402820	1404980	in an essay by Megan titled,
1404980	1407540	The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1407540	1411220	Obviously, a tendentious framing that posits Jo-ro
1411220	1414460	as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.
1414460	1417380	The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling
1417380	1420940	complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,
1420940	1423620	as well as a photo of an angry trans mob
1423620	1426260	holding a rotten hell rolling sign
1426260	1429140	juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians
1429140	1432420	burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.
1432420	1434780	This did not bode well.
1434860	1437460	So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter
1437460	1440300	because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy
1440300	1444380	to some kind of unearned J.K. Rowling redemption tour.
1444380	1448020	This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me,
1448020	1450620	calling me a bigot against God.
1450620	1454540	I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.
1454540	1455980	There's only one of him.
1455980	1458260	And he could really use your help, Shirley.
1458260	1460700	I said in these tweets that I felt used,
1460700	1462980	which that is how I felt,
1462980	1466500	but ultimately I need to take full responsibility
1466500	1468020	for my involvement in this.
1468020	1470660	The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this
1470660	1472620	is you honestly have no idea
1472620	1474860	what the final product is gonna be like.
1474860	1478780	So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.
1478780	1482220	And I can't really say that Megan misled me.
1482220	1484500	There are red flags from the beginning
1484500	1487140	and I ignored them because I was projecting
1487140	1489500	my own hopes onto the situation.
1489500	1491780	You know, it's a compelling story.
1491780	1495620	I liked the idea that this famous former bigot
1495620	1499220	could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.
1499220	1501660	We all love a good redemption arc.
1501660	1505620	And I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.
1505620	1507620	That's something I've moved away from,
1507620	1508940	but there's still part of me
1508940	1511100	that wants to see the best in people
1511100	1513820	and to believe that people can change
1513820	1517980	if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.
1518940	1521940	Maybe my wishful thinking was that
1521940	1524700	because Megan left Westboro,
1524700	1527100	that must mean that she must understand
1527100	1531620	the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?
1531620	1534580	And despite no evidence for this,
1534580	1538460	my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally
1538460	1542300	and could be really effective at confronting Jo-Roe
1542300	1546060	about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?
1546940	1547860	Wrong.
1547860	1549700	I'm Megan Phelps-Roper,
1549700	1553020	and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1557460	1559500	The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling
1559500	1563620	is more than seven hours of apologetics for J.K.R.
1563620	1566860	The podcast presents Rowling as a complex,
1566860	1571860	humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist backstory.
1572140	1574060	Jo Rowling's rise to success
1574060	1576460	is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.
1576460	1579700	Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob
1579700	1581580	of transgender activists.
1581580	1584380	First no vote, first no vote!
1584380	1587380	All because she, as a woman,
1587380	1592380	had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.
1593020	1597620	I had been becoming increasingly concerned
1597620	1600460	about the way in which women were being shut down.
1600460	1604180	Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.
1604180	1606980	Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing
1606980	1611980	of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists
1612660	1614540	whom Rowling describes as
1614540	1618460	a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.
1618460	1622220	For the first five hours of this podcast,
1622220	1626420	Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob
1626420	1631420	of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.
1631500	1635140	You are murdering trans children!
1635140	1636620	Let's get out by the time!
1636620	1639940	A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
1639940	1642100	And you did it at my birthday dinner!
1642100	1646260	There's this one clip of some kind of Antifa super soldier's
1646260	1650700	abrasive screaming that they play like once per episode.
1650700	1653180	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!
1653180	1655020	You look like you got your teeth knocked out
1655020	1656580	you fucking fascist!
1656580	1658860	Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares
1658860	1660580	and you will die alone!
1660580	1664340	And then it usually cuts to like somber monks
1664340	1667260	chanting some kind of medieval lament.
1667260	1670180	You will die alone and you will burn in hell!
1670180	1675180	Ooh, species.
1675460	1678460	Just in case you didn't get from the title
1678460	1680420	that this is a witch hunt.
1680420	1685420	Ooh, species.
1686860	1688180	Do you guys get it?
1688180	1689420	Do you get it yet?
1689420	1692540	You got your teeth knocked out you fucking fascist!
1692540	1694300	Let's get out by the time!
1694300	1696740	And then these mobs of irrational,
1696740	1699740	misogynistic, trans rights fanatics
1699740	1703420	are contrasted with this poignant story
1703420	1706980	of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband
1706980	1710740	to publish our generation's most beloved novels.
1710740	1713580	I was still very committed to those parts
1713580	1715820	that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,
1715820	1718340	because there was a truth to them
1718340	1719820	and there was a power to them.
1719820	1723300	The only voices of genuine trans descent
1723300	1726500	appear in episode six out of seven,
1726500	1728540	more than five hours in.
1728540	1730220	And there's only two of us.
1730220	1732660	One is me.
1732660	1733500	Shame.
1733500	1735740	And the other is a teenager named Noah
1735740	1739020	who kind of just seems like he wants to be liked
1739020	1742740	and understood and wishes that his favorite author
1742740	1746700	would please stop saying bigoted things about him.
1746700	1748100	I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,
1748100	1750140	or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,
1750140	1754340	especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.
1754340	1756860	I can't even state how important it was to me.
1756860	1759660	J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography
1759660	1761780	from my third grade classroom
1761780	1763620	and I kept it for a long time
1763620	1764780	because I just loved reading it
1764780	1766260	because I just admired her so much.
1766260	1769380	It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.
1769380	1771100	On my last day editing this video,
1771100	1772660	I got in touch with Noah.
1772660	1774980	I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast
1774980	1777900	he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.
1777900	1780140	I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue
1780140	1782740	are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.
1782740	1785220	Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,
1785220	1787980	but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,
1787980	1790340	the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,
1790340	1792340	wellbeing, and ability to survive.
1792340	1794660	How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling
1794660	1797060	should come second to fighting for maintained access
1797060	1799620	to healthcare, support, and general resources
1799620	1802260	for children and adolescents seeking gender care.
1802260	1803180	I agree.
1803180	1805180	The most frustrating thing about this podcast
1805180	1808020	is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.
1808020	1811340	They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling
1811340	1813020	is the victim of a witch hunt
1813020	1815780	in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.
1815780	1818980	These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
1820700	1823260	I mean, turf is basically witch.
1823260	1826260	But if you point this out, they just deny it.
1826260	1828460	Show me the actual words, Jack.
1828460	1831260	Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt
1831260	1832660	by trans people.
1832660	1836020	You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1836020	1839020	Yes, a podcast on which I never once say
1839020	1841940	I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.
1841940	1842780	What are you talking about?
1842780	1844500	I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.
1844500	1846580	Your license plate says scammin'.
1846580	1849300	Uh, no.
1849300	1850340	What do you mean, no?
1851180	1852500	Yes.
1852500	1855340	Joanne, show me where I ever said
1855340	1858460	that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.
1858460	1860780	Why would you even think that?
1860780	1863220	You're crazy.
1863220	1866900	By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt.

1869980	1871940	And Meghan is not much better.
1871940	1874620	Like, there's this whole section in episode two
1874620	1876540	where Meghan interviews Christians
1876540	1879540	who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,
1879540	1882660	and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.
1882660	1885940	So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents
1885940	1888260	were maybe part of a moral panic?
1888260	1889220	Yeah, absolutely.
1889220	1891100	It's a scary world out there.
1891100	1893500	Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks
1893500	1895500	trans protests against Joe Roe
1895500	1898620	are equivalent to the Christian ones in the 90s,
1898620	1900980	but she does heavily imply it.
1900980	1904220	There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,
1904220	1908340	which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,
1908340	1912300	to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,
1912300	1916260	boycotted, and in some cases, burned.
1916260	1918820	When confronted about the obvious implications
1918820	1920740	of the podcast's title,
1920740	1923540	Meghan said, the title is ambiguous.
1923540	1925380	Toward the end of her conversations,
1925380	1927940	I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling
1927940	1929140	about discernment,
1929140	1931180	about how a person can ever know
1931180	1933260	if they're standing up for what's right
1933260	1934940	or joining a moral panic.
1934940	1938700	I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.
1938700	1941920	Meghan, I was not surprised.
1941920	1943820	I know I won't ever regret having stood up
1943820	1945260	on this issue, ever.
1945260	1948060	The podcast released new episodes weekly,
1948060	1949940	and whenever Meghan was challenged
1949940	1952180	about the blatant one-sidedness,
1952180	1954660	Meghan would respond, oh, you just think that
1954660	1957780	because you haven't listened to the whole podcast yet.
1957780	1960220	Maybe you should preserve judgment.
1960220	1963100	Much more of other perspectives is coming.
1963100	1965580	Make sure to tune in next week.
1965580	1969180	More bombshell revelations to come.
1969180	1972900	Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,
1972900	1975780	and I truly do not think that anyone
1975780	1978600	with basic media comprehension skills
1978600	1980380	could come away from this thinking
1980380	1983140	that the main intent was anything other
1983140	1986500	than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr
1986500	1991500	of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.
1993180	1995920	This is the obvious implication of the podcast
1995920	1998720	from the first words to the very last.
1998720	2002420	And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.
2002440	2005340	The final episode concludes with this.
2005340	2007540	There are more important things in this world
2007540	2010260	than being popular, and that doesn't mean
2010260	2012180	it's more important to me to be right.
2013100	2016020	It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.
2016020	2018460	Why would you end on that note?
2018460	2022140	Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is
2022140	2025180	if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe
2025180	2027740	that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?
2027740	2030060	I don't regret it because I did the right thing.
2030060	2032100	Like, there really is no other reasonable way
2032100	2036100	to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.
2036100	2039700	If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim
2039700	2042820	of a witch hunt, then just say that.
2042820	2045240	Make the argument you want to make.
2045240	2048900	Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,
2048900	2053100	this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.
2053100	2056260	Don't rely on innuendo and framing
2056260	2061260	and lack-for-most Gregorian chanting to make your point,
2061580	2066140	while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond,
2066140	2068660	I just believe in conversation.
2068660	2071220	I don't know, I just find this a slippery
2071220	2073160	and dishonest way to argue.
2073160	2076180	But if you happen to be a fan of slippery
2076180	2079060	and dishonest arguments, you're in luck,
2079060	2082900	because there is more where that came from.

2116680	2117580	Maybe.
2117580	2120380	There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.
2120380	2122340	That means you're not allowed to cancel me.
2122340	2126660	Chapter four, Joe Roe's Transphobia.
2126660	2127500	That's it.
2130380	2131780	I'm going full Slytherin.
2131780	2134920	In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,
2134920	2138580	Joe Roe compares trans activists to death eaters,
2138580	2141420	the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.
2141420	2145700	My position is that this activist's movement,
2145700	2148340	in the form that it's currently taking,
2148340	2149860	echoes the very thing that I was
2149860	2151660	warning against in Harry Potter.
2151660	2154140	The Death Eaters claimed we have been made
2154140	2156780	to live in secret, and now is our time.
2156780	2161340	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,
2161340	2163020	misogynistic movement.
2163020	2164780	When an article then claimed she had
2164780	2167020	equated trans people to death eaters,
2167020	2171060	the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,
2171060	2174400	because she only equated the movement to death eaters,
2174400	2177080	not trans people in general.
2177080	2179000	Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,
2179000	2181320	I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.
2181320	2183840	So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,
2183840	2186320	lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.
2186320	2189200	J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,
2189200	2191800	because she expresses it as an endless series
2191800	2194820	of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.
2194820	2197960	A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle
2197960	2202320	consisting of a mott, that is a tower atop a mound or hill,
2202320	2205760	easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard
2205760	2209320	that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.
2209320	2211800	So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes
2211800	2215760	a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.
2215760	2218540	And then, when confronted with counter arguments,
2218540	2221120	they walk it back to a much less controversial
2221120	2224640	and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.
2224640	2228540	For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim
2228540	2232240	like sex is real, what does she mean by that?
2232240	2233880	What are the implications?
2233880	2236480	Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks
2236480	2240680	it's very sinister that in the Associated Press style guide,
2240680	2243760	it says that instead of referring to a trans woman
2243760	2246400	as a man who identifies as a woman,
2246400	2249720	journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.
2249720	2253480	That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.
2253480	2256800	They've edged from identifies as a woman,
2256800	2258880	so a man identifies as a woman,
2258880	2260720	and I think we all understand what that means,
2260720	2264480	into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep
2264480	2266560	that I'm talking about.
2266560	2271360	We are using language to make accurate definition
2271360	2274400	of sex difference unspeakable.
2274400	2277360	Which is, of course, false, because the words trans
2277360	2280640	and cis exist precisely to make it easy
2280640	2282240	to talk about sex difference.
2282240	2283960	Thanks a lot, Tumblr.
2283960	2285860	God, there's this whole section of the podcast
2285860	2288340	that sort of implies that transgender people
2288340	2291060	are invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even
2291060	2293340	gonna get into because we don't have time.
2293340	2294940	Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks
2294940	2296380	that all people who menstruate
2296380	2298700	must be referred to as women.
2298700	2299860	Or was it wombin'?
2299860	2301380	I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.
2301380	2303860	So trans men and transmasculine people,
2303860	2307500	they're all women, and it must be referred to as women,
2307500	2310100	because J.K. Rowling demands it.
2310100	2311660	This is controversial, right?
2311660	2314740	Calling trans women men who identify as women,
2314740	2316540	calling trans men women.
2316540	2319660	This is the Bailey in her Ma and Bailey argument.
2319660	2322180	Trans women are men, trans men are women.
2322180	2325700	That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.
2325700	2329060	Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,
2329060	2331660	Rowling walks the argument back and says,
2331660	2333860	I'm being persecuted just for saying
2333860	2336100	that women should be allowed to discuss
2336100	2338820	how being female has shaped our lives.
2338820	2341220	Women should be allowed to discuss
2341220	2343540	how being female has shaped our lives.
2343540	2346420	This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial
2346420	2349940	interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.
2349940	2353500	And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make
2353500	2355980	about trans people follows this pattern.
2355980	2358860	J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstader,
2358860	2360900	will tweet inflammatory things like,
2360900	2363140	men cannot change into women.
2363140	2364820	But then when she's criticized,
2364820	2366700	she'll say that she's being attacked
2366700	2368780	for gender critical belief.
2368780	2371580	Gender critical belief, which is the absolutely
2371580	2374020	ordinary belief about sex,
2374020	2377020	that your mother and your grandmother are women,
2377020	2378940	that being female is a thing.
2378940	2381580	Your mother and grandmother are women.
2381580	2383580	Being female is a thing.
2383580	2385820	That's literally all I'm saying.
2385820	2388060	But if that's literally all she was saying,
2388060	2390820	then no one would be mad, would they?
2390820	2392580	Nine, nah.
2392580	2395860	Men cannot change into women is the Bailey.
2395860	2398500	Your mom is a woman is the Mott.
2398500	2399780	Your mom's a woman.
2400780	2403860	This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.
2403860	2406740	They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,
2406740	2408660	exhibitionists, and voyeurs.
2408660	2411540	Then when trans people understandably get mad,
2411540	2414420	they'll say, look, I'm being attacked just for saying
2414420	2417100	that being female is part of my experience.
2417100	2418140	It's dishonest.
2418140	2420220	They talk a bunch of trash about trans people.
2420220	2422260	And then when trans people talk trash back,
2422260	2423900	they pretend that they're being victimized
2423900	2426060	for making totally innocuous statements.
2426060	2429700	We can name this behavior the birthday boy argument.
2429700	2433820	I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met
2433820	2436380	until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up
2436380	2439580	whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.
2439580	2442980	I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.
2442980	2446340	It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.
2446340	2447900	And somehow it always worked.
2447900	2450700	So a birthday boy argument is when you make aggressive
2450700	2454660	inflammatory assertions followed by teacher, teacher,
2454660	2456180	look what he's doing to me.
2456180	2457920	When the target reacts with anything less
2457920	2459420	than extreme politeness.
2459460	2461380	Another common tactic you'll see anytime
2461380	2463460	Rowling's transphobia is discussed
2463460	2465260	is you'll see someone jump in to say,
2465260	2468500	show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.
2468500	2470660	For example, here's someone on Twitter
2470660	2472940	called large gamete producer.
2472940	2474420	It's funny, isn't it?
2474420	2477940	How these people will insist that awkward inclusive language
2477940	2481160	like people who menstruate is horribly oppressive
2481160	2483160	and degrading, but then they'll just straight up
2483160	2486620	call themselves large gamete producer.
2486620	2489540	Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.
2489540	2493540	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
2493540	2495720	Oh, I like it, it's very brood mother.
2495720	2497580	That Rowling's words regularly appear
2497580	2500660	in gender critical arguments shows the massive influence
2500660	2502900	that she has in the anti-trans movement.
2502900	2505220	She's like their queen, their leader,
2505220	2506380	their headmistress.
2506380	2508100	She's the best thing that ever happened to them
2508100	2510340	because Sheila Jefferies certainly wasn't persuading
2510340	2511180	a lot of people.
2511180	2512240	If you know, you know.
2512240	2516460	Large gamete producers says, JK isn't anti-trans,
2516460	2520020	give me just one direct quote that she has said
2520020	2521420	which is anti-trans.
2521420	2522740	Oh, what's that?
2522740	2524260	You can't find one?
2524260	2526980	Well, color me shocked.
2526980	2529680	Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,
2529680	2533180	let's take a look at large gamete producers profile.
2533180	2535740	Trans women are not women, they are men.
2535740	2538520	Trans men are not men, they are women.
2538520	2539900	Nothing can change that.
2539900	2542300	Sex is binary.
2542300	2543820	Like if this person doesn't think
2543820	2546860	that trans women are men, trans men are women
2546860	2548740	is a transphobic statement,
2548740	2551420	then what would they consider a transphobic statement?
2551420	2553620	This is why the first question you should always ask
2553620	2555780	such people is, do you believe
2555780	2558460	that transphobia is a legitimate concept?
2558460	2560140	What are some examples of statements
2560140	2562200	that you would consider transphobic?
2562200	2563820	Because many of them don't believe
2563820	2566060	that transphobia is a valid concept
2566060	2567760	because they don't think that trans people
2567760	2569380	are a legitimate minority.
2569380	2570860	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
2570860	2573040	There's no such thing as a trans person.
2573040	2574000	There is no such thing.
2574000	2576900	There are people that call themselves these things
2576900	2580160	that may have other issues manifesting
2580160	2582260	that then make them think they're this, but no.
2582260	2584940	We have to stop using any words like transgender.
2584940	2586700	There may be more words that we have to say
2586700	2587640	in order to say that.
2587640	2589960	We may call it transgender ideology,
2589960	2591500	but when it comes to a person,
2591500	2593980	they may be following transgender ideology,
2593980	2595520	but they are not transgender.
2595520	2598060	There is no such thing as a man or a woman
2598060	2600240	being anything other than a man or a woman.
2600240	2602600	So when they say, show me an example
2602600	2605300	of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said.
2605300	2606560	This is a trap.
2606560	2607800	They're just messing with you.
2607800	2609840	There's nothing that she could have said
2609840	2611880	that they would acknowledge as transphobic.
2611880	2613160	Now, if you're someone who believes
2613160	2615240	that transphobia is a valid concept
2615240	2618240	and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,
2618240	2620240	but you just genuinely are unaware
2620240	2622540	of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,
2622540	2624720	then I will refer you to my past video
2624720	2626680	on J.K. Rowling's transphobia
2626680	2628560	rather than recapping it all here.
2628560	2631240	Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse
2631240	2632560	since I made that video.
2632560	2634400	I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.
2634400	2637520	True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people
2637520	2639340	because she's not a complete idiot,
2639340	2642120	but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.
2642120	2644360	She said, save our children.
2644360	2645840	I love women, actually.
2645840	2647760	For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke
2647760	2650020	doesn't say, I hate black people,
2650020	2652240	but he will share a lot of statistics
2652240	2654120	about anti-white crime.
2654120	2656840	So this is not really a very good criterion
2656920	2659640	for deciding who's a bigot, is it?
2659640	2662520	What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again
2662520	2664360	about transgender rapists,
2664360	2667200	about the danger trans women pose to cis women.
2667200	2669360	She implies that trans inclusive language
2669360	2672680	is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.
2672680	2676000	She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal
2676000	2678140	of endocrinologists and ideolog
2678140	2682400	that is supposedly persuading confused vulnerable girls
2682400	2683520	to transition.
2683520	2686560	To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,
2686560	2688800	I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,
2688800	2692200	but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.
2692200	2695160	Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think,
2695160	2697020	it asks them to fear.
2697020	2701320	It creates phobias of trans people.
2701320	2706320	It creates trans phobias, if you will.
2706400	2708720	Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician
2708720	2712920	Nicholas Sturgeon, calling her destroyer of women's rights
2712920	2715880	via a t-shirt she got from anti-trans heat monger
2715880	2717120	Posey Parker.
2717120	2718600	There's no such thing as a trans woman,
2718600	2720760	there's no such thing as a trans person,
2720760	2721720	there is no such thing.
2721720	2724380	If there's one thing that I want people to understand
2724380	2726080	about Rowling's transphobia,
2726080	2729120	it's that this is not a case of someone posting
2729120	2730720	a couple insensitive tweets
2730720	2732380	that got blown out of proportion.
2732380	2736320	Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.
2736320	2739320	This has been her main issue for several years now.
2739320	2741560	And because she's so famous,
2741560	2744420	she's become the de facto global champion
2744420	2746340	of backlash to trans rights.
2746340	2748980	Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.
2748980	2751780	Except worse, because she's way more famous
2751780	2754960	and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.
2754960	2757180	Rowling has also praised self-described
2757180	2759020	theocratic fascist Matt Walsh
2759020	2761180	for his transphobic propaganda film.
2761180	2765140	She refers to trans women as trans identified males,
2765140	2767320	known as Tims among people for whom
2767320	2769020	this has become an unhealthy obsession.
2769020	2771260	She retweets images of the trans colors
2771260	2773220	being erased from the progress flag.
2773260	2775700	Also, the colors representing queer people of color.
2775700	2777100	So, you know, great.
2777100	2777940	Love that.
2777940	2780620	Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic
2780620	2784140	for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.
2784140	2786400	It's something of a fixation for her.
2786400	2788500	I find this particularly gross
2788500	2790980	because it plays into the lesbophobic trope
2790980	2793660	that gay women are especially anti-trans,
2793660	2796740	when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic
2796740	2797740	of cis people.
2797740	2800420	According to a survey of young adults in the UK,
2800420	2803260	lesbians were most likely to know a trans person
2803260	2808060	and also most likely at 96% to say that they're supportive
2808060	2810260	or very supportive of trans people.
2810260	2813660	So, I think it's fair to say that most gay women
2813660	2815980	are probably not super thrilled
2815980	2819660	whenever Jo-ro the lesbian defender logs on.
2819660	2821740	My own partner is a cis lesbian,
2821740	2824180	and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling
2824180	2827500	defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,
2827540	2830300	it makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.
2830300	2833900	By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit of banter
2833900	2836700	with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,
2836700	2839340	the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.
2839340	2841380	Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member
2841380	2842660	of the House of Lords
2842660	2845980	who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.
2845980	2848860	In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,
2848860	2852060	claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading
2852060	2854180	the status of women and girls.
2854180	2857220	Truly, one of the great lesbian allies.
2857260	2859980	And in 2022, here is JK Rowling
2859980	2862180	joking around with Lady Nicholson.
2862180	2863900	Excellent question, Emma.
2863900	2867300	Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women
2867300	2871180	excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,
2871180	2875540	i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.
2875540	2878780	And before you say, but aren't they straight men?
2878780	2881860	They're wearing eyeliner pickets.
2881860	2884580	Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia
2884580	2887140	you may have for the Gryffindor common room
2887140	2889780	and just look at this interaction for what it is.
2889780	2891020	Two straight women,
2891020	2894180	one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,
2894180	2896180	having a nice little chuckle together
2896180	2899260	about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.
2899260	2900820	So that's it, right?
2900820	2901740	It's over.
2903740	2904900	Case closed.
2907260	2908980	I still like hammering things.
2910420	2911660	I'm not gonna argue anymore
2911660	2914500	about whether JK Rowling is transphobic
2914500	2916980	because anyone who believes in transphobia
2917700	2919620	can see that obviously she is.
2919620	2922100	The question now is whether transphobia
2922100	2925380	is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,
2925380	2928420	the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,
2928420	2930340	misogyny, and homophobia.
2930340	2931940	That's usually what we're talking about
2931940	2934140	when we talk about JK Rowling, right?
2934140	2936980	Whether it's fair to cancel her.
2936980	2940500	That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.
2940500	2943940	The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.
2943940	2946700	Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint
2946740	2949660	worthy of polite consideration and respect
2949660	2951820	in liberal humane society?
2951820	2953980	Or is it just an ugly prejudice
2953980	2956100	that we can justifiably react to
2956100	2958060	with scorn and condemnation?
2958060	2960140	And there's an even broader question here
2960140	2962540	about whether we can justifiably react
2962540	2965540	to anything with scorn and condemnation.
2965540	2967960	Is canceling ever warranted?
2967960	2972280	Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?
2972280	2975880	Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices
2975880	2979320	a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas?
2979320	2981320	Where we can all sit around debating
2981320	2983160	the legitimacy of gay marriage
2983160	2986200	or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?
2986200	2988960	Is the final solution a myth promulgated
2988960	2990840	by the international Jew?
2990840	2994380	Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?
2994380	2997240	Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money
2997240	2999720	if there weren't so many disabled people?
2999720	3000760	Who knows?
3000760	3002320	These are open questions.
3002320	3005080	Let's sit down with people on both sides.
3005080	3007400	On many sides and have calm,
3007400	3009160	civil conversations about it
3009160	3011600	for the rest of our goddamn lives.
3011600	3014240	Chapter five, debate.
3016160	3018160	Sorry, I know I did this look before
3018160	3021440	and it's like not related to the video topic at all,
3021440	3023280	but it just makes me feel sliving.
3023280	3025600	The boy who slived.
3025600	3027280	So Megan Phelps's rober's viewpoint
3027280	3029500	seems to be that scorn and condemnation
3029500	3031080	are never appropriate.
3031080	3033000	That we should approach every conflict
3033000	3034600	with empathy and compassion
3034600	3036480	even when dealing with the worst,
3036480	3039480	most destructive people in the world.
3039480	3040920	Hi, my name is Megan.
3040920	3043200	And my heretical belief is that
3043200	3045200	even the people who seem to be
3045200	3048080	the worst, most destructive people in the world
3048080	3051640	are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy
3051640	3053600	if we want to find a way to change their minds.
3053600	3057640	In her book, in her TED Talk, in her public appearances,
3057640	3060520	Megan expresses the idea that society
3060520	3065040	has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way
3065040	3067560	that we've all become extremists.
3067560	3068860	That in some sense,
3068860	3072600	we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.
3072600	3074840	I can't help but see in our public discourse
3074840	3077300	so many of the same destructive impulses
3077300	3078880	that ruled my former church.
3078880	3081320	She identifies things like certainty,
3081320	3083360	vilification of compromise,
3083360	3085120	us versus them thinking,
3085120	3086720	suppression of empathy,
3086720	3089480	and celebration of death and misfortune
3089480	3092920	as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.
3092920	3094800	And this really bothers Megan
3094800	3097540	because she claims that a decade ago,
3097540	3099280	when she went on Twitter to tweet about
3099280	3102160	how f***ing marriage is abominable to God,
3102160	3106440	it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way
3106440	3110240	that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.
3110240	3114160	And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.
3114160	3117480	She's totally right that if you want to change people's minds,
3117480	3120280	then approaching them with compassion and empathy
3120280	3122920	is usually the best way to do that.
3122920	3124840	But Megan reaches another conclusion
3124840	3126280	that I don't agree with,
3126280	3129700	which is that because compassion and civil conversation
3129700	3132000	are most likely to persuade people,
3132000	3134720	we should never cancel anyone,
3134720	3136760	even the most horrible bigots.
3136760	3140440	And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.
3140440	3141520	But what Megan means is
3141520	3143840	we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.
3143840	3146520	We shouldn't boycott or counter protest
3146520	3148180	or raise our voices.
3148180	3151000	We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone
3151000	3154120	because that's just not how you change minds.
3154120	3156080	And I get why Megan thinks this, right?
3156080	3158920	De-radicalization was a really important part
3158920	3160560	of her life experience.
3160560	3162240	She's also clearly holding out hope
3162240	3164560	that other members of her family will leave Westboro
3164560	3166300	and have a life on the outside.
3166300	3168480	She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.
3168480	3170840	"'The last lines of her book address her family.
3170840	3172700	"'I want to tell them that I love them.
3172700	3174700	"'I'll just have to find another way.'
3174700	3176620	"'This is touching and human
3176620	3179740	"'and also kind of a conflict of interest.'"
3179740	3183500	The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense
3183500	3187340	if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.
3187340	3190580	If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots
3190580	3193860	is more important than protecting the people they target.
3193860	3196420	Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds
3196420	3199900	is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.
3199900	3203320	As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old
3203360	3205640	and she's still homophobic.
3205640	3207760	But even without Anita's blessing,
3207760	3211160	gay rights have still somehow managed to progress
3211160	3214120	since the 1970s because gay activists
3214120	3216760	didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.
3216760	3220360	They needed to defeat her and that's what they did.
3220360	3222720	We have to accept that realistically,
3222720	3226280	persuading all the bigots is just not an option.
3226280	3229600	Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,
3229600	3231680	but there will always be bigots
3231680	3235160	and mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them
3235160	3237960	is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.
3237960	3240800	Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,
3240800	3245040	we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?
3245040	3245880	Nah.
3245880	3246840	You would only think that
3246840	3249160	if you're a total moral relativist.
3249160	3253240	I guess controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful
3253240	3254920	and it should be shamed.
3254920	3255880	I'll say it.
3255880	3258220	You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas
3258220	3260600	in your head, you might feel afraid
3260640	3265160	to express them publicly for fear of being shamed or judged.
3265160	3268400	Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia
3268400	3271000	that punishes people for wrong think?
3271000	3274480	No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful
3274480	3276240	and you should be ashamed of it
3276240	3278640	and the people judging you are right to do so.
3278640	3281400	And sure, there are some very patient people
3281400	3284400	who devote their lives to de-radicalizing bigots,
3284400	3287720	which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.
3287720	3289400	There's a guy named Daryl Davis
3289400	3291840	who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan
3291840	3294800	for over 30 years and he claims he's convinced
3294800	3297200	more than 200 of them to leave.
3297200	3298540	And good for him.
3298540	3301320	De-radicalization is a valid strategy,
3301320	3303800	but it cannot be the only strategy
3303800	3306960	and it must not be the primary strategy
3306960	3309120	because we're not going to defeat racism
3309120	3312840	by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.
3312840	3315100	Feminists would be wasting their time
3315100	3318160	trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.
3318160	3320560	In general, I think that the massive effort
3320560	3323360	that it takes to maybe persuade bigots
3323360	3326100	is better spent persuading other people
3326100	3327540	not to listen to them.
3327540	3330520	And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization
3330520	3333760	is often a messy and incomplete process.
3333760	3336860	20-year-old white nationalist Peter Cytanovic
3336860	3341440	became the face of the fascist unite the right rally in 2017
3341440	3345920	when a photo of him mid-scream Tiki Torch in Hand
3345920	3348980	was published in news outlets all over the country.
3348980	3351300	Peter was unrepentant in interviews
3351300	3353600	he gave immediately after the rally,
3353600	3355960	but he began to question his beliefs
3355960	3358600	after befriending a muscling woman who,
3358600	3360940	according to Charlotte McDonald Gibson,
3360940	3363720	challenged his views without insulting him,
3363720	3367100	allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.
3367100	3369380	Peter is no longer a white nationalist,
3369380	3371380	but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out
3371380	3373100	every trace of bigotry.
3373100	3375420	In a 2019 interview with the London School
3375420	3378340	of Economics student paper, Peter said,
3378340	3380380	I don't like the whole transgender thing.
3380380	3382580	You're born either a man or a woman.
3382580	3386460	So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.
3386460	3389260	When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,
3389260	3392180	I used to get some criticism from people of color
3392180	3394340	who were not thrilled that I was bringing
3394340	3397820	a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,
3397820	3400300	a frustration that I totally understand.
3400300	3403140	To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,
3403140	3405900	diverse leftist communities are maybe not
3405900	3408460	the best holding space for someone who's
3408460	3410600	a bit of a Nazi but working on it.
3410600	3412780	In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,
3412780	3415840	I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,
3415840	3418620	but what she does have is a kind of hyper-vigilant
3418620	3423220	skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.
3423220	3424740	This is pretty common with people
3424740	3427200	who used to be religious fundamentalists.
3427200	3429280	They were so certain they were right,
3429280	3431800	only to realize that everything they believed
3431800	3433440	about the world is wrong.
3433440	3437400	So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions
3437400	3440520	because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.
3440520	3443720	Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly
3443720	3445640	that I was doing the right thing,
3445640	3447440	and then to leave and come to believe
3447440	3449620	that it was so destructive and harmful,
3450800	3455800	I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months
3456260	3459700	where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?
3459740	3463100	This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,
3463100	3467260	but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else
3467260	3470260	can cause problems, especially where topics
3470260	3472260	of social justice are concerned.
3472260	3475600	Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism
3475600	3480020	that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling
3480020	3482820	to have calm, philosophical debates
3482820	3484740	about whether they should have rights?
3484740	3487980	Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?
3487980	3490140	Atheist philosopher, Sam Harris,
3490140	3492740	in his podcast about Meghan's podcast,
3492740	3495100	can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?
3495100	3498620	I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts
3498620	3500800	until we can figure out what's going on.
3500800	3504460	Sam Harris and his podcast about Meghan's podcast
3504460	3508580	complained that trans activism and activism in general
3508580	3512860	is plagued by a mental illness and hysteria.
3512860	3515740	I frankly think there's a fair degree
3516380	3520280	of mental instability and even frank mental illness
3520280	3522660	in the activist community.
3522660	3525900	I mean, in really in all activist communities,
3525900	3530540	the level of viciousness and hysteria is,
3531420	3533300	it's hard to know what to compare it to.
3533300	3538180	Diversity when man accuses trans women of being hysterical.
3538180	3542080	Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions
3542080	3545840	when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?
3545840	3547420	Aren't there certain situations
3547420	3549600	where strong emotions are warranted?
3549600	3551440	It reminds me of this awful episode
3551440	3553940	of Joe Rogan feet Ben Shapiro,
3553940	3556880	where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral
3556880	3559320	with his usual whining sophistry.
3559320	3561580	And Joe gently raises objections
3561580	3563680	for Ben to talk circles around.
3563680	3567120	The human sex drive was made to procreate
3567120	3570420	within a stable relationship in order to progenerate
3570420	3572200	and have future generations of people.
3572200	3574140	Misuse of that sex drive in any way,
3574140	3576640	whether you're talking about from masturbation
3576640	3578420	to homosexual activity,
3578420	3580920	is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.
3580920	3584060	That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.
3584060	3587580	All of the top comments on this video are like this.
3587580	3589300	Imagine talking about different beliefs
3589300	3591340	while still having a productive conversation.
3591340	3593500	Things progress when you don't demonize people.
3593500	3595020	The discussion here was excellent.
3595020	3596740	Two guys with opposing opinions,
3596740	3599380	speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,
3599380	3602660	shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.
3602660	3604260	This is how it should be done.
3604260	3605420	Kudos to both of them.
3605420	3606660	Joe is a great interviewer.
3606660	3608120	He can totally disagree with someone
3608120	3610500	and still have a calm, collective conversation.
3610500	3611740	This is how it should be.
3611740	3613220	Just two people sharing ideas,
3613220	3615140	learning different point of views from each other.
3615140	3617220	This is why Joe is the number one podcast.
3617220	3619580	Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions
3619580	3622580	and Ben answers honestly, he is strong in his faith.
3622580	3625420	I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views
3625420	3627220	and they have a civil conversation.
3627220	3628060	Great learning.
3628380	3630820	Yeah, it's easy for two straight men
3630820	3634100	to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation
3634100	3636580	about the ethics of homosexuality
3636580	3638420	because it's not their lives
3638420	3641460	and their relationships that are up for debate.
3641460	3644260	These people don't understand the emotional burden
3644260	3646060	placed on marginalized people
3646060	3648580	who are asked to defend their rights.
3648580	3649780	Like if you're straight,
3649780	3654380	do you want to publicly debate whether your marriage is valid?
3654380	3655860	Andrew Dworkin claimed
3655860	3658140	that penetrative heterosexual intercourse
3658140	3660460	is inherently an act of violence.
3660460	3662700	I've noticed that most straight men
3662700	3666380	don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.
3666380	3667980	So imagine how they'd react
3667980	3670460	if there was a powerful political movement
3670460	3674380	to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.
3674380	3678060	Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,
3678060	3680100	bullying and discrimination,
3680100	3683020	and maybe then you'll begin to understand
3683020	3685820	the hysteria of a lot of queer people.
3685820	3687820	It is my right to raise my child
3687820	3689060	with the moral precepts
3689060	3691740	that I find to be beneficial for my child.
3691740	3693940	Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.
3693940	3696020	And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.
3696020	3696940	That is insane.
3696940	3699860	Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence
3699860	3702300	because he can't handle the debate.
3702300	3705380	Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.
3705380	3708620	Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation
3708620	3711340	about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?
3711340	3712180	I now have two choices.
3712180	3714300	One is to leave the country utterly.
3714300	3715260	Two is to pick up a gun.
3715260	3716940	Those are the only choices that you have left me.
3716940	3719940	Dave Rubin is a gay conservative
3719940	3723340	whose career requires that he convince his right-wing audience
3723340	3725940	that he's one of the good ones.
3725940	3728060	This means that he's willing to sit across
3728060	3731900	from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,
3731900	3734700	and listen to Ben say he would never attend
3734700	3736220	his anniversary party
3736220	3739380	because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.
3739380	3741100	There's a difference between me
3741100	3742460	just being friends with Dave
3742460	3746260	and me actively participating in an event
3746260	3748180	that I feel is religiously sinful.
3748180	3750780	The two of them then congratulate themselves
3750780	3753660	about how they can still be great friends.
3753660	3756180	Why is it that we're able to do this
3756180	3757620	and most people can't do this?
3757620	3758460	That's what I'm curious about.
3758460	3760740	We go home at night and we can have our own lives.
3760740	3763220	And here's Dave having a civil conversation
3763220	3765020	with conservative Glenn Beck
3765020	3767900	who compares homosexuality to alcoholism
3767900	3769780	and then congratulates himself
3769780	3771900	on having the conversation.
3771900	3773740	I'm a deeply religious man
3773740	3778140	and my religion says man and a woman,
3778980	3781540	that is the basic building block of family.
3781540	3784020	And that's what I believe,
3784020	3789020	but I also know God created you
3790180	3793380	just like he created me, flaws and all.
3794740	3797820	I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,
3797820	3801380	that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism
3801380	3803660	because it runs in my family.
3803660	3806820	So does craziness, but it runs in my family.
3806820	3808940	Well, Dave smiles and nods
3808940	3810700	probably because he's thinking about
3810700	3814180	how much he enjoys the taste of boots.
3814180	3817940	Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis
3817940	3821260	and then we're good because they get it, they get it.
3821260	3823020	That's my governor, yeah.
3823020	3825900	I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin
3825980	3830260	and they see finally a reasonable gay person
3830260	3834180	who doesn't scream, beg it, at everyone who disagrees
3834180	3837100	and can actually have a civil conversation.
3837100	3838620	But that's not what I see.
3838620	3840020	I look at Dave Rubin
3840020	3844180	and I see a spineless boot-looking doormat
3844180	3846900	who won't even defend his own family
3846900	3849740	from the most fundamental disrespect.
3849740	3851560	I also can't help but notice
3851560	3854340	that none of these civil conversations
3854380	3856700	seem to change anyone's mind.
3856700	3859060	Persuasion is more complicated
3859060	3861580	and less rational than people think.
3861580	3865300	Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,
3865300	3867420	but if you read her book carefully,
3867420	3870220	you'll notice that that's not exactly true.
3870220	3873940	The major precipitating event for Megan's crisis of faith
3873940	3875900	was her mother's mistreatment
3875900	3878500	at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic
3878500	3881060	church leadership that made Megan feel
3881060	3883860	like she was the victim of the church for once.
3883860	3886020	She says of the church discipline,
3886020	3888020	for the first time in my life,
3888020	3889860	the accused were people I lived with
3889860	3891460	and knew most intimately.
3891460	3893180	And I knew that the judgments leveled
3893180	3894780	by the elders were wrong.
3894780	3898380	I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.
3898380	3901060	So she finally experienced firsthand
3901060	3903660	what it's like to be the victim of her family.
3903660	3906620	She stopped voting for the leopards eating people's faces
3906620	3909700	party only when the leopards ate her face.
3909700	3911960	It also seems relevant to notice
3911960	3914880	that the people who had calm civil conversations
3914880	3918480	with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,
3918480	3921680	the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.
3921680	3923600	They were mostly straight men,
3923600	3925880	like director Kevin Smith,
3925880	3928280	who started hashtag saveMegan
3928280	3931720	because, quote, she's hot.
3931720	3935160	There's often an erotic component to persuasion,
3935160	3938200	and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan,
3938200	3942000	because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her
3942000	3943760	is now her husband.
3943760	3945960	And I feel like that's a relevant detail
3945960	3948240	if we're trying to understand the role of reason
3948240	3951700	and emotion in de-radicalization experiences.
3951700	3954620	I think this experience is usually more akin
3954620	3958600	to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.
3958600	3960120	There's also a world of difference
3960120	3962760	between the mostly private conversations
3962760	3965720	that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs
3965880	3968680	and the spectacle of public debate.
3968680	3972100	Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic
3972100	3974760	because he live streamed a civil conversation
3974760	3976040	with Dave Rubin.
3976040	3978640	So who is this conversation even for?
3978640	3981280	Well, obviously it's for the audience.
3981280	3985520	I think these civil conversations basically function
3985520	3988380	to reassure a homophobic audience
3988380	3992480	that just because they disagree with the lifestyle
3992480	3995040	doesn't mean that they hate gay people.
3995040	3996480	Look at Ben Shapiro.
3996480	3998240	He is friends with a gay.
3998240	4001260	Public debate is one way that we define the limits
4001260	4002840	of the Overton window,
4002840	4006480	the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.
4006480	4008860	So often people who want to promote bigotry
4008860	4012120	will use debate as a foot in the door.
4012120	4014920	It's a way of establishing that their prejudices
4014920	4016900	are within the realm of reasonable
4016900	4019000	and socially accepted opinion.
4019000	4022760	Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot, Graham Linnehan,
4022760	4026480	in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who
4026480	4030040	without the British public having a proper debate
4030040	4031440	about these issues.
4031440	4034720	Now, why do we need to have a proper debate
4034720	4038560	about whether drag queens should be allowed on television
4038560	4040920	when drag performance has been a staple
4040920	4042460	of British entertainment
4042460	4044960	since at least the time of Shakespeare?
4044960	4047040	Life is a joke, that's just begun.
4047040	4051600	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, my, my, three little mates from school.
4051600	4054240	Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.
4054240	4059240	As I am man, my state is desperate for my master's love.
4061680	4065960	As I am woman, now I last the day.
4065960	4069160	Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate
4069160	4070680	on their own terms
4070680	4073880	because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.
4073880	4075920	It's how they convince the public
4075920	4079420	that their moral panic about drag queens on TV
4079420	4081820	is actually a valid concern
4081820	4085940	rather than the tedious, small-minded whiny about nothing
4085940	4087180	that it really is.
4087180	4089980	Having the debate on a biggest terms
4089980	4092580	is not a good way to win people over
4092580	4094320	unless you're really skilled
4094320	4096500	in the art of humiliating people,
4096500	4099180	which most of the time is what public debate
4099180	4100720	is actually about.
4100720	4102380	This is something that J.K. Rowling
4102380	4104260	doesn't seem to understand.
4104260	4106420	In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,
4106420	4110580	Jorro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.
4110580	4114620	She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos,
4114620	4118220	saying that activists are making a strategic error
4118220	4122100	and giving Milo power by protesting his events,
4122100	4125100	making him look dangerous and sexy.
4125100	4128020	But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,
4128020	4130980	Rowling characterizes this as silencing.
4130980	4133460	So is deplatforming a strategic error
4133460	4135700	that gives power to your opponent?
4135700	4138300	Or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?
4138300	4139740	I find Rowling's conviction
4139740	4142020	that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos
4142020	4143260	really out of touch.
4143260	4147180	Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons for the things he does.
4147180	4150540	He has strategies for humiliating people.
4150540	4152480	I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,
4152480	4154540	being fabulous and doing my hair,
4154540	4155900	to prepare a speech for you.
4155900	4157340	Well, a few remarks, really.
4159060	4162580	Feminism is cancer, thank you very much.
4162580	4164580	To again quote Ian Danskin,
4164580	4166740	you can't really reason with someone
4166740	4169140	who thinks that feminism is cancer.
4169140	4172860	Because you don't reason with cancer, you eradicate it.
4172860	4174780	Rowling objects to the slogan,
4174780	4177700	no debate in the strongest possible terms.
4177700	4180820	And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,
4180820	4183820	the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.
4183820	4185580	We hear it all the time.
4185580	4189380	That alarms me, really alarms me.
4189380	4192740	I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism
4192740	4193620	than no debate.
4193660	4195860	It's kind of amazing to me that someone could think
4195860	4197800	angry trans people on Twitter
4197800	4200940	are the purest example of authoritarianism.
4200940	4204120	I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough
4204120	4206460	to be capable of such a perspective.
4206460	4208860	Before I move on, I do wanna clarify
4208860	4211740	that I do think there are trans issues
4211740	4213540	that are legitimately debatable
4213540	4215340	by people who are not bigots.
4215340	4219000	In my opinion, trans women and women's sports
4219000	4220460	is one of those issues.
4220460	4222900	But it's a complicated issue.
4223300	4226780	First of all, which sport are we talking about?
4226780	4228980	Are we talking about figure skating,
4228980	4230980	middle school field hockey?
4230980	4232960	I see no reason why trans girls
4232960	4234660	should be excluded from that.
4234660	4237220	But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,
4237220	4240220	well, then it seems plausible that trans women
4240220	4242100	who have been through male puberty
4242100	4245460	may still retain some kind of group advantage.
4245460	4249200	But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.
4249200	4251240	People are transitioning younger now,
4251240	4253600	and that's another thing you have to consider.
4253600	4256520	So I'm not against debating this issue.
4256520	4258560	I just want people to approach it
4258560	4260520	with nuance and good faith.
4260520	4262720	And currently, a lot of the people
4262720	4266760	who are vocally against trans women and women's sports
4266760	4268160	sound like this.
4268160	4272840	And we will keep men out of women's sports.
4272840	4273680	Right?
4274520	4275560	How ridiculous.
4278840	4280720	That will take place on day one.
4280720	4282560	And I don't want to debate those people.
4282560	4285280	I want to serve them a banana cream pie.
4285280	4288680	Chapter six, illiberal methods.
4289740	4291600	One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints
4291600	4293260	about the trans rights movement
4293260	4296580	is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.
4296580	4298720	So when I first became interested
4298720	4302120	and then deeply troubled by what I saw
4302120	4306600	as a cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.
4306600	4309160	So what are these illiberal methods?
4309160	4313840	If you are saying this person is canceled,
4313840	4316080	that is the language of a dictator.
4316080	4316960	It's true.
4316960	4320320	Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.
4320320	4322400	First, they canceled the socialists,
4322400	4326200	and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.
4326200	4329280	But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.
4339160	4349000	You know, I can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods
4349000	4354080	to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far.
4354080	4360360	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.
4360360	4365880	I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless.
4365880	4368080	Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement
4368080	4372280	is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way
4372280	4375440	that makes it different from all past liberation movements.
4375440	4376520	But how?
4376520	4378520	What are these illiberal methods
4378520	4382280	that distinguish trans rights activism from similar past movements?
4382280	4383400	Cancelling?
4383400	4387440	Anita Bryant was way more canceled than J.K. Rowling ever will be.
4387440	4388480	Boycotts?
4388480	4392240	Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement in modern history.
4392240	4394400	Disrupting feminist meetings?
4394400	4397200	Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.
4397200	4399200	Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?
4399200	4403120	In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique
4403120	4405520	and founder of the National Organization for Women
4405520	4407600	and second wave feminism in general,
4407600	4411640	coined the phrase Lavender Menace to describe the threat she believed
4411640	4414240	that lesbians posed to the women's movement.
4414240	4417680	Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians
4417680	4421560	would make it easy to dismiss the movement as a bunch of manish man-haters.
4421560	4424520	This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians
4424520	4428240	who attended the second Congress to unite women in 1970
4428240	4430880	to stage what used to be known as a zap,
4430880	4435520	a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.
4435520	4436640	Think glitter bombing.
4436640	4437720	Think pies.
4437720	4439520	Half aggression, half whimsy.
4439520	4444080	Like that time the lesbian avengers zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house
4444080	4445480	demanding that she resign.
4445480	4447520	This podcast has pushed me over the edge.
4447520	4451080	Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.
4451080	4452960	So just as the meeting was beginning,
4452960	4456400	a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts
4456400	4459320	switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic
4459320	4462200	and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.
4462200	4465080	Their leader Rita Mae Brown took the mic and yelled,
4465080	4469680	This conference won't proceed until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.
4469680	4471840	One of the now organizers yelled back,
4471840	4474840	I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.
4474840	4476520	You're acting like men.
4476520	4480640	Betty Friedan would later speculate that the lesbians were a CIA sci-op
4480640	4483120	designed to make the women's movement look bad.
4483120	4487840	So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting using illiberal tactics
4487840	4490000	not because they were against feminism,
4490000	4494040	but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists to include them.
4494040	4498200	It's the same thing that's happening today when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,
4498200	4499960	as J.K. Rowling puts it,
4499960	4503680	interestingly neglecting to mention which feminist meetings these are.
4503680	4508800	I was starting to see activists behaving in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.
4508800	4513240	There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging and kicking on windows,
4513240	4514280	very threatening.
4514280	4517480	There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea
4517480	4522240	that trans activists are somehow more aggressive than similar past movements.
4522240	4526800	Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man called Dennis Noel Cavanaugh who says,
4526800	4529000	All those gay rights and AIDS protests,
4529000	4534280	I don't remember a single one where we intimidated or silenced a woman.
4534280	4536560	Not a single one.
4536560	4538720	Not a single one.
4538720	4540400	Not a single one.
4540400	4545320	Not a single one.
4545320	4550440	Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS to the trans movement.
4550440	4553040	And also, uh, quote,
4553040	4558600	I will fucking nail you to a wall what you have done to these innocent children.
4558600	4562880	Your mutilation of these little humanned because they were gay
4562880	4568320	will be nothing compared to what I will do to you legally.
4568320	4573800	You think you are ghouls wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.
4573800	4576800	Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.
4576800	4583120	I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people to a wall count as illiberal methods?
4583120	4586720	I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so because she's never condemned it.
4586720	4591520	In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended, she was right there to welcome him back.
4591520	4593280	And she continues to retweet him.
4593280	4599000	I've always been happy to acknowledge that angry trans people on Twitter sometimes take things too far.
4599000	4603280	Things like death threats or misogynistic insults, I don't support that.
4603280	4604960	And I've called it out in the past.
4604960	4607680	Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,
4607680	4611320	drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,
4611320	4614760	women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.
4614760	4616600	I called him out tweeting,
4616600	4625560	Doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say about their being misogyny in trans activism.
4625560	4632120	I tweeted that because I recognize that if people who are claiming to speak for you are doing so in a misogynistic way,
4632120	4637440	and if you let that slide, you're going to wake up one day to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.
4637440	4645080	Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well, explaining that actually I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments
4645080	4648400	for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling.
4648400	4654560	And then he accused me of cancel culturing him while at the same time literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.
4654560	4659040	The more of you were in the replies being like, that's not what's happening right here.
4659040	4661200	Like, this is necessary, okay?
4661200	4665800	Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.
4665800	4668280	Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.
4668280	4673960	Move you off this site and into, I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.
4673960	4678600	So that pretty much confirms to me that Vosh doesn't actually care about advocating for trans people,
4678600	4682360	and just uses trans rights as a pretext to act like a fucking dingus.
4682360	4687160	I won't tell you to publicly shame him though, because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.
4687160	4694360	The point I'm trying to make is, I have no qualms about calling out people on my side whenever they go too far or cross a line.
4694360	4699280	Or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me about how I don't understand a tactical misogyny.
4699280	4699800	Idiot.
4699800	4702200	But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.
4702200	4710200	I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and abusiveness that is absolutely rampant in the gender-critical movement.
4710200	4722400	There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists versus the abusive trans mob.
4722400	4731000	A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.
4731000	4734280	Things like, kill TERFs 2014.
4734280	4740160	How about slowly and horrendously murder TERFs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?
4740160	4749560	Now, I don't think anyone should joke about putting people in saw traps, but also, how serious is this threat that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?
4749560	4751800	Let's use our critical thinking skills here.
4751800	4759120	Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies, has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?
4759120	4761680	Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?
4761680	4766960	The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.
4766960	4770120	And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.
4770120	4777160	I can fill the screen up with examples just from people who J.K. Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.
4777160	4783480	I will drive you out into the desert and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says, from a fan of J.K. Rowling.
4783480	4791160	First, I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse, fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.
4791160	4799960	Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual, I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.
4799960	4806160	But threats like this from the gender-critical side are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
4806160	4812560	Both Rowling and Meghan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets and sound bites of shouting protesters.
4812560	4815040	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.
4815040	4818240	You look like you got your teeth knocked out and your fucking lashes.
4818240	4822280	As evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.
4822280	4828080	But this exact technique has been used against literally every liberation movement in world history.
4828080	4834640	For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night, the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,
4834640	4838760	which first got J.K. Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.
4838760	4845880	Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note, covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.
4845880	4849600	Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,
4849600	4855400	but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?
4855400	4859400	We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,
4859400	4865280	but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear that my friend's brother
4865280	4869280	was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.
4869280	4871480	The protesters were allegedly singing,
4871480	4876280	Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.
4876280	4879800	So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.
4879800	4882200	Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,
4882200	4883680	Castrate men!
4883680	4886840	Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?
4886840	4890600	Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?
4890600	4896000	Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus, who shot Andy Warhol,
4896000	4901080	who advocated for male extermination in her society for cutting up men manifesto,
4901080	4903520	is representative of feminism as a whole?
4903520	4906920	Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.
4906920	4909160	But it's not fair, is it?
4909160	4915160	So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?
4915160	4917360	I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
4917360	4919800	And I made excuses for you, then.
4919800	4922880	In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,
4922880	4926320	Meghan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,
4926320	4929200	who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.
4929200	4935600	There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation that I find fascinating.
4935600	4941120	Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say, you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.
4941120	4947280	And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively
4947280	4951000	with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.
4951000	4959440	And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus can be imposed,
4959440	4962280	maybe as opposed to evolve organically.
4962280	4970440	And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up in the hopes, I think, that if they can,
4970440	4980960	they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection as other groups whose rights we've decided are not up for public conversation.
4980960	4983480	I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.
4983480	4989000	So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people are often reluctant to debate our rights
4989000	4995200	is that we want the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.
4995200	5004120	But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.
5004120	5010200	I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.
5010200	5014320	Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?
5014320	5024160	Did suffragettes just have calm civil conversations about whether women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?
5024160	5030120	No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote, sometimes violently, especially in the UK.
5030120	5031360	Like, people forget this.
5031360	5037360	Maybe because they were called suffragettes, which is kind of a cutesy name, but the suffragettes, they murdered people.
5037360	5039240	They were suffragette terrorists.
5039240	5040240	They broke windows.
5040240	5041800	They bombed churches.
5041800	5043760	They set fire to a theater.
5043760	5048160	In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.
5048160	5049400	Queen shit, honestly.
5049400	5054560	The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet at the Prime Minister's head.
5054560	5059480	And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.
5059480	5062960	I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against the movement.
5062960	5064400	I don't think it's effective.
5064400	5069520	But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands before everyone was ready.
5069520	5073960	Because there never has been, and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.
5073960	5079520	I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,
5079520	5083560	and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.
5083560	5088200	So there never has been a consensus about women's rights, and there probably never will be.
5088200	5094320	In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.
5094320	5099200	The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.
5099200	5103560	I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone to give us rights,
5103560	5107360	but the reality is, that's not how this works, and it never has been.
5107360	5112280	Like, how do these debate-making centrists think that slavery ended in the United States?
5112280	5119880	Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.
5119880	5121400	See what I'm holding in my hand?
5121400	5126640	This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.
5126640	5132120	Do you people think that American schools were integrated because all the white people in the South were persuaded
5132120	5133840	that segregation is bad?
5133840	5134880	No dum-dums.
5134880	5139240	Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit at gunpoint.
5139240	5143200	And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements with Black civil rights.
5143200	5149080	I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent to living in the aftermath of slavery.
5149080	5152320	I'm just saying that there's this tendency to sanitize history,
5152320	5159920	and to imagine that progress was smooth and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.
5159920	5167320	And then people get the impression that current movements are somehow more militant than successful past movements, when they just aren't.
5167320	5173560	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement,
5173560	5177880	the cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods.
5177880	5185880	And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.
5185880	5188320	Why is J.K. Rowling like this?
5188320	5192000	Chapter 7. Why is J.K. Rowling like this?
5192000	5198600	J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin, whom Stepp already mentioned a couple times in this video.
5198600	5202560	I myself favor violence. Deeply. I favor it.
5202560	5207640	Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views, which I don't agree with.
5207640	5215000	But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.
5215000	5223880	In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women, published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.
5223880	5231840	Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.
5231840	5240960	Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement, a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism, should read this book.
5240960	5249920	In Dworkin's analysis, the political right makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women's deepest fears.
5249920	5255240	No one can bear to live a meaningless life. Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.
5255240	5259000	And conservative politics promises women meaning.
5259000	5268800	The right offers women a simple, fixed, predetermined social, biological, and sexual order. Form conquers chaos. Form banishes confusion.
5268800	5274480	The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.
5274480	5277920	A woman is an adult human female.
5277920	5285400	Right Wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase into the motto of the gender-critical movement.
5285400	5288720	Adult human female.
5288720	5294160	It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.
5294160	5301000	Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition, it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.
5301000	5306520	There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines, there can be no change.
5306520	5313080	This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos that gender-criticals fear.
5313080	5317400	The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.
5317400	5323680	Just biologically that God made mother so that we could reproduce. Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.
5323720	5330200	Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.
5330200	5331440	Dworkin says,
5331440	5337720	Within the frame of male domination, there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality, both male and female.
5337720	5343200	Women are interchangeable as sex objects. Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.
5343200	5346200	The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.
5346200	5352600	Having children is the one social contribution credited to women. It is the bedrock of women's social worth.
5352640	5359520	Without childbearing, women know they have nothing. Homosexuality for women means having nothing, it means extinction.
5359520	5365800	Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.
5365800	5369360	J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.
5369360	5373400	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
5373400	5376440	The producer of the large gametes.
5376440	5382760	Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men is the loss of fertility.
5382760	5391280	Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility, attempts to socially legitimize or protect it, makes women expendable.
5391280	5395560	The one thing women can do and be valued for will no longer be valued.
5395560	5403880	Male homosexuality is especially terrifying because it suggests a world without women altogether, a world in which women are extinct.
5403880	5408320	This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.
5408320	5416320	Trans activists are erasing women. They're erasing biological sex. They're going to call us pregnant people.
5416320	5423440	Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility. Trans women are going to replace biological women.
5423440	5428400	As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men are aggressively replacing women.
5428400	5430280	You will not replace us!
5430280	5436360	Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession and the results can be dazzling.
5436360	5444800	In September 2022, Maya Forstader, who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist whom J.K. Rowling came out as a turf to defend,
5444800	5455560	went on a full-blown Twitter rampage because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced they were changing their children's storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear.
5455560	5466160	If you don't know where this is going, strap in from the Bookstart Bear to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.
5466160	5468280	Are you enraged?
5468280	5471960	If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.
5471960	5481840	Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother who referred to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,
5481840	5487080	describing the mascot as ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.
5487080	5490840	I cannot express how upset I feel.
5490840	5497400	The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia, isn't trans, they are an alien.
5497400	5501120	Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.
5501120	5504720	Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?
5504720	5506800	Some people tried to reason with Maya.
5506800	5515200	There's an advantage in having a character that isn't identifiably male or female, as it can be equally relatable to either sex and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.
5515200	5517480	But Maya was not convinced.
5517480	5525480	It seems highly unlikely that an alien that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan is not sexually reproducing.
5525480	5530360	It's a relatable anthropomorphic character, not a slime mold.
5530360	5535240	I need to know how the alien fucks right now.
5535240	5543440	I said I need to know how the alien fucks before I can show it to my child.
5543440	5552440	When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.
5552440	5553520	And she posted hard.
5553520	5556560	Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.
5556560	5560840	In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.
5560840	5562640	You are in charge of a baby.
5562640	5564280	You have never done this before.
5564280	5567600	You haven't had a good night's sleep for months and won't for years.
5567600	5572160	Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing right and wrong, and you've become invisible.
5572160	5573600	You had politics.
5573600	5574920	You had a career.
5574920	5576480	You had interests.
5576480	5577920	You had a sex life.
5577920	5582960	Now you have the daily needs of a completely dependent person, and your world has shrunk.
5582960	5588720	The fact that these men and the young women that cheer them on think this is so laughable
5588720	5591560	reflects society's disdain for mothers.
5591560	5595360	This is what it means to say a woman is not a feeling or a costume.
5595360	5599240	This is why the hub of the resistance is on mom's net.
5599240	5602240	So I am fascinated by this thread.
5602240	5606160	I think it's one of the most revealing texts in gender-critical history.
5606160	5611960	Because you know what, Maya Forstetter actually does have valid concerns.
5611960	5616560	But the concerns she has that are valid have nothing to do with trans people.
5616560	5621280	And they definitely have nothing to do with an adorable cartoon alien.
5621280	5625360	Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.
5625360	5628440	Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?
5628440	5629920	I know she has one.
5629920	5633480	Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?
5633480	5637280	No one should have to feel this alone raising children.
5637280	5638840	That is a valid concern.
5638840	5640800	Oh my god, we actually found one.
5640800	5642440	It's like finding El Dorado.
5642440	5644160	A valid concern.
5644160	5646160	A valid concern.
5646160	5650920	Isn't what's going on here that Maya is taking legitimate feelings of being overburdened
5650920	5655600	and underappreciated and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?
5655600	5658760	This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits.
5658760	5662360	By providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.
5662360	5664120	It's not your husband's neglect.
5664120	5667040	It's not the increasing atomization of society.
5667040	5669280	It's not the indignities of aging.
5669280	5676800	It's Tala, the non-binary alien with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.
5676800	5681640	Mum's net is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.
5681640	5682640	It's too much.
5682640	5683640	These people are too much.
5683640	5684760	Okay, we have to be serious now.
5684760	5689000	The political right also promises women safety and security.
5689000	5691800	For women, the world is a very dangerous place.
5691800	5695760	The right acknowledges the reality of danger, the validity of fear.
5695760	5698080	The right then manipulates the fear.
5698080	5702440	Women fear and resent male violence, which they're most likely to experience from the
5702440	5707120	men closest to them, boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.
5707120	5709320	They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.
5709320	5715040	But the need to survive in a male-dominated society means that women's legitimate fears
5715040	5719840	and resentments often cannot be directed at the men with power.
5719840	5724640	Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage and contempt they feel for the men who
5724640	5729600	actually abuse them, those close to them, and project it onto others.
5729600	5732640	Those far away, foreign, or different.
5732640	5738200	And this displacement of rage is just transparently what's going on with JK Rowling.
5738200	5744640	In her essay about sex and gender issues, Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning
5744640	5747200	to be the son her father wanted.
5747200	5749320	I really felt the rejection of my father.
5749320	5753280	And that is one of the things that maybe lead someone going into homosexuality.
5753280	5757720	And she describes the lingering trauma from her first violent marriage.
5757720	5761540	The marriage at this point has turned very violent and very controlling.
5761540	5768040	And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out against the transgender movement.
5768040	5772280	If you try to understand this rationally, it looks like a total non sequitur.
5772280	5776520	But if you look at it emotionally, there's a kind of logic to it.
5776520	5782160	The existence of the dangerous outsider always functions for women simultaneously as deception,
5782160	5784920	diversion, painkiller, and threat.
5784920	5789560	Women cling to irrational hatreds focused particularly on the unfamiliar, so that they
5789560	5793640	will not murder their fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, lovers.
5793640	5797440	The men with whom they are intimate, those who do hurt them.
5797440	5804200	In the 1970s, many conservative women displaced this rage onto lesbians, the threatening outsider
5804200	5805200	of the day.
5805200	5811120	Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977, where she spoke to a lot of women
5811360	5813520	about their fear of lesbians.
5813520	5818200	Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,
5818200	5821680	certified committers of sexual assault against women and girls.
5821680	5827880	To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous, experienced almost as a demonic sexual force
5827880	5830120	hovering closer and closer.
5830120	5835840	She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching, threatening by her very presence a sexual
5835840	5839560	order that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.
5839560	5844760	It's almost surreal to read this because of how precisely it describes how gender
5844760	5847000	criticals talk about trans women.
5847000	5848960	Pronouns are like Rohypnal.
5848960	5850440	They dull your defenses.
5850440	5851800	They change your inhibitions.
5851800	5853200	They're meant to.
5853200	5859680	Now it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism began as an offshoot of far-left
5859680	5867200	lesbian separatism, with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979 that transsexualism
5867400	5870720	should be morally mandated out of existence.
5870720	5875640	But the gender critical movement was always destined to become a right-wing movement because
5875640	5881320	it has the structure of a right-wing movement, taking women's fear and rage toward familiar
5881320	5885560	men and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.
5885560	5891120	The momentum behind this is just to ripe an opportunity for conservatives to pass up.
5891120	5892120	As Dworkin says,
5892120	5898000	Because women so displaced their rage, they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.
5898000	5901280	Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.
5901280	5906240	The right provides these symbols of danger by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders
5906240	5907960	as sources of danger.
5907960	5914360	In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone of conservative party platforms,
5914360	5919240	both in the UK, where Lee Anderson, deputy chair of the conservative party, predicts
5919240	5921240	that the next election will be won on
5921240	5924560	Probably a mixture of culture wars and trans debates.
5924560	5931960	And in the US, where the ACLU is currently tracking more than 450 anti-LGBT bills, including
5931960	5939840	more than 130 gender-affirming care bans, 51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans, 29 trans
5939840	5946200	bathroom bans, and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law, Republicans have escalated
5946200	5952080	anti-trans rhetoric to eliminationist extremes that have most trans people in this country
5952080	5956240	living in a constant state of fear for our future.
5956240	5960400	Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.
5960400	5966440	The Left is attacking our children, pushing sex talk, transgender extremism, and noxious
5966440	5968440	politics in our schools.
5968440	5973880	We should reject this demonic assault on the innocence of our children and stand fast against
5973880	5977400	leftist efforts to mutilate their bodies and minds.
5977400	5983760	Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.
5983760	5990440	I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilization
5990440	6001160	of our youth, and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation
6001160	6003040	in all 50 states.
6003040	6010160	On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care.
6010160	6011160	Ridiculous.
6011160	6017120	I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs
6017120	6022080	that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.
6022080	6028520	A few gender criticals still want to insist they have nothing to do with right-wing anti-trans
6028520	6029520	bigots.
6029520	6030520	Like Helen Lewis.
6030520	6035200	Helen Turf is basically witch who attempts in her interview in the witch trials of J.K.
6035200	6040400	Rowling to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right and that of feminists.
6040400	6043800	I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand is that there are two different
6043800	6045320	arguments going on.
6045320	6050120	One is the traditional conservative right argument, which is anti-LGBT.
6050120	6056240	The other one is a criticism from the Left in which it says sometimes male people and
6056240	6060840	female people have different interests, no matter how the male people identify.
6060840	6065640	But as a trans person, I don't care whether you justify your transphobia in the name of
6065640	6068840	protecting women or protecting children.
6068840	6073880	Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond calling for transsexualism to be morally mandated
6073880	6079240	out of existence, or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles calling for transgenderism
6079240	6084080	to be eradicated from public life, it's the same repulsive bigotry to me.
6084080	6089840	And in any case, the gender-critical movement has recently reached an implicit consensus
6089840	6092880	that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.
6092880	6099240	The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker aka Kelly J. Keene Minchel, rejects feminism
6099240	6100240	entirely.
6100240	6102080	Do you call yourself a feminist now?
6102080	6103080	No.
6103080	6104080	Did you ever call yourself a feminist?
6104080	6105080	I probably did for a short time.
6105080	6108640	But so you wouldn't be so like a Julie Bindle type feminist?
6108640	6114040	No, well some feminists, I mean Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers in the past and
6114040	6116800	I think that's a theme flowing through feminism.
6116800	6118800	I'm not a feminist!
6118800	6120040	I'm not a feminist!
6120040	6122480	This is not Andrea Dworkin.
6122480	6124320	This is Phyllis Schlafly.
6124320	6127800	Parker's campaign is currently funded by the right-wing CPAC.
6127800	6133080	CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events and cover all of our insurance
6133080	6137640	throughout our whole trip, which is really kind of them.
6137640	6141640	But what we would need to do is we would need to show that we were working for them, working
6141640	6143000	with them.
6143000	6146880	She has no qualms about collaborating with far-right white nationalists.
6146880	6149480	I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.
6149480	6151000	Let me tell you what she's been saying.
6151000	6155800	She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.
6155800	6158880	She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.
6158880	6168200	Why are we enabling children to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful or access
6168200	6170360	to abortion?
6170360	6174520	I think that we really need to rethink all of this.
6174520	6177400	I think parents need to take back control of their children.
6177400	6181000	She's called trans people fools and perverts.
6181000	6183520	Transgenderism is nuts.
6183520	6185720	It's for fools and perverts.
6185720	6189160	She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.
6189160	6190600	It's not a real thing.
6190600	6192960	There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.
6192960	6194400	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
6194400	6196560	There's no such thing as a trans person.
6196560	6197560	There is no such thing.
6197560	6203400	There are people that call themselves these things that may have other issues manifesting
6203400	6205720	that then make them think they're this, but no.
6205720	6208520	We have to stop using any words like transgender.
6208520	6212120	There may be more words that we have to say in order to say that.
6212120	6216880	We may call it transgender ideology, but when it comes to a person, they may be following
6216880	6219760	transgender ideology, but they are not transgender.
6219760	6224880	There is no such thing as a man or a woman being anything other than a man or a woman.
6224880	6227280	She's called trans women pedophiles.
6227280	6234040	We know that if a man has a paraphilia addressing as a woman, the most likely cross paraphilia
6234040	6236080	is pedophilia.
6236080	6239880	We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.
6239880	6241680	They don't ever stop at one.
6241680	6246840	She's said that each and every woman who stands in her way will be annihilated.
6246840	6252080	Each and every one of you women who stand in my way, each and every one of you, let me
6252080	6254760	just tell you, you will be annihilated.
6254760	6260120	She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms to attack anyone they perceive as
6260120	6261760	not a real woman.
6261760	6266880	And men, for once, I'm talking to you.
6266880	6273480	I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry, I think that's what you say.
6273480	6275880	I'm so down with the American lingo.
6275880	6278400	Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.
6278400	6281200	Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.
6281200	6283640	Maybe you're that sort of man.
6283640	6287400	Maybe you have a daughter or a mother or a wife.
6287400	6288400	Maybe you have a sister.
6288400	6289480	Maybe you just have some friends.
6289480	6295360	Maybe you just think women are human and you don't need any absolute connection with them
6295360	6300280	to feel compelled to protect us.
6300280	6302720	I think you should start using women's toilets, men.
6302720	6308600	And she's said that women who call themselves men should be sterilized, which seems to be
6308600	6315440	a little bit in tension with JK Rowling's concern about the fertility of confused girls.
6315440	6320000	You know, you might look at these differences of opinion between Rowling and Parker.
6320000	6328280	Little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist, left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion.
6328280	6334320	Concern about trans men's fertility versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men
6334320	6341400	against annihilating women who stand in your way versus pro-annihilating each and every
6341400	6343920	woman who stands in your way.
6343920	6348320	You might look at these differences and expect that these two women would be at odds, but
6348320	6349320	they aren't.
6349320	6355040	Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause that for both of them trumps
6355040	6356040	all else.
6356040	6362400	In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster reading I Heart JK Rowling to be displayed at a railway
6362400	6368120	station in Edinburgh, and Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times and has
6368120	6370120	modeled her t-shirts.
6370120	6376760	So the gender-critical movement, started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s, has finally
6376760	6383320	passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns, as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bendel memorably
6383320	6384640	described them.
6384640	6389920	It's a movement that has no beliefs apart from a shared determination to reduce the
6389920	6391600	number of trans people.
6391600	6396720	In the numbers we're currently seeing, particularly of young people coming forward, I find cause
6396720	6397720	for doubt.
6397720	6401840	In the meantime, while we're trying to get through to the decision-makers, we have to
6401840	6404000	try to limit the harm.
6404000	6407920	And that means reducing or keeping down the number of people who transition.
6407920	6410160	And that's for two reasons.
6410160	6414240	One of them is that every one of those people is a person who's been damaged.
6414240	6421200	But the second one is every one of those people is basically, you know, a huge problem to
6421200	6422400	a sane world.
6422400	6425840	Like if you've got people that, whether they're transitioned, whether they're happily transitioned,
6425840	6429480	whether they're unhappily transitioned, whether they've detransitioned, if you've got people
6429480	6433960	who've dissociated from their sex in some way, every one of those people is someone
6433960	6439400	who needs special accommodation in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of
6439400	6440400	sex.
6440400	6446480	So to wrap this up, is the backlash against JK Rowling a witch hunt?
6446480	6450360	Unequivocally, no, it's very thoroughly deserved.
6450360	6454560	But I will say this, a movement can't get along without a devil.
6454560	6460880	And across the whole political spectrum, there is a misogynistic tendency to choose a female
6460880	6467920	devil, whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton, Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
6467920	6469440	or JK Rowling.
6469440	6474520	And there's always going to be people who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.
6474520	6481120	So I would advise trans people and our allies to keep in mind that JK Rowling is not the
6481120	6485200	final boss of transphobia, she's not our devil.
6485200	6488960	The devil is the Republican party, the conservative party.
6488960	6494640	The devil is patriarchy, it's the right-wing men who will be the ones to put gender-critical
6494640	6497160	theory into brutal practice.
6497160	6504480	Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and JK Rowling are, to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.
6504480	6506280	TERFs are the real handmaidens.
6506280	6511600	They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face on the patriarchal violence against
6511600	6515840	trans people that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.
6515840	6522160	I call on men to consider themselves dear to human beings, to call out the demons among
6522160	6526840	them and eradicate these monsters from society.
6526840	6533040	And Megan Phillips Roper and centrist Slaker are wrong that civil conversation can resolve
6533040	6534040	this.
6534040	6540640	Call out the demons among them and eradicate these monsters from society.
6540640	6546560	People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.
6546560	6548680	They have to be defeated.
6548680	6554200	As for what to do about JK Rowling, honestly, let's all just block her.
6554200	6558440	Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile, and just block her.
6558440	6559440	Problem solved.
6559440	6561560	Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.
6561560	6564160	But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.
6564160	6567080	She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.
6567080	6571160	The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave, for the same reasons that it's hard
6571160	6572840	to quit a culture scam.
6572840	6575240	To quote video essayist Dan Olson,
6575240	6579960	One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam is that the victims who invested the
6579960	6585800	most are often the most passionate defenders because shame is a powerful force in the human
6585800	6589520	psyche and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.
6589520	6594040	Reformed bigots have to face not only the shame of being dupes, but also the guilt
6594040	6597800	of having devoted years of life to harming vulnerable people.
6597800	6600840	This is something Megan, to her credit, faced head on.
6600840	6606720	If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life industriously sowing doom, discord,
6606720	6611680	and rage to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.
6611680	6616080	I had wasted my life only to fill others with pain and misery.
6616080	6620000	Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.
6620000	6624560	It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linahan, whose all-consuming hatred of trans people
6624560	6629520	has ruined his life, caused him his marriage, and left him alone to tweet about destroying
6629520	6635000	gender ideology minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled
6635080	6639880	to insist with ever more certainty that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,
6639880	6645560	but are all demonic perverts, an enemy so hyperbolically evil that they justify his
6645560	6647320	self-immolating crusade.
6665000	6679920	As long as he stays here, in the bottom of the
6679920	6684520	whirlpool, he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships and wasted years
6684520	6687640	of life because he just couldn't let it go.
6687640	6688640	And if J.K.
6688640	6692680	Rowling doesn't log off soon, this will likely be her fate as well.
6693480	6698280	I guess what I'm really trying to say is, Harry Potter is dead to me.
6698280	6700280	I'm switching to Twilight.
