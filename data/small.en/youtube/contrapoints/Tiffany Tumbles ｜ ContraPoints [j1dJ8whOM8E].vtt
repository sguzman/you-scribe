00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube, sensation. Welcome to my world! Every

00:12.720 --> 00:17.120
week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me!

00:17.120 --> 00:23.200
So I'm going to go with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a Flaunt

00:23.200 --> 00:30.240
325 dash. Smoke it out. Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major.

00:30.240 --> 00:39.680
I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed. It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yeah. Yes. Okay.

00:40.960 --> 00:49.360
I'm not living for it. Oh my god. I think I glued my eyeshot. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.000
I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.920
Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life,

00:59.920 --> 01:07.520
which is why I support our president, Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!

01:19.360 --> 01:31.120
Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of The Freedom Report, whereâ€”I'm sorry, why does my studio

01:31.120 --> 01:37.040
look like a Japanese drag queen redecorated in Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.720
Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political

01:42.720 --> 01:46.160
spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.880
free-thinking debate about a timeless question.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.760
Are traps gay? My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series

01:59.760 --> 02:06.000
Intersectional AF. Clarence? Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that

02:06.000 --> 02:14.240
transphobia is racist? Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles.

02:14.240 --> 02:18.000
Now, Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.440
isn't that right? That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.760
You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?

02:27.760 --> 02:32.240
Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders and how I was tired of

02:32.240 --> 02:37.520
trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I know,

02:37.520 --> 02:42.320
everyone's calling me a turf and a traitor, so I said, you know what? I'm out. I'm not going to

02:42.320 --> 02:47.840
put up with this culture of silencing and shame. I think that's just so brave of you. Yeah, wow,

02:47.840 --> 02:53.040
so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are. Shut up, Adria. I had just

02:53.040 --> 02:57.760
come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that, the trans

02:57.760 --> 03:02.880
community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing. I was absolutely alone.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.040
Do you have any idea what that felt like? Your leftist allies are not your friends,

03:07.040 --> 03:12.240
Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them. Those are not friends. Well, you have real friends

03:12.240 --> 03:16.880
now, Tiffany. I think you're going to fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals

03:16.880 --> 03:20.960
who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against

03:20.960 --> 03:25.520
politically correct dogma. Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

03:26.160 --> 03:32.320
So I'm going to go in with the highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow until I'm

03:32.320 --> 03:41.120
literally blinding. I am glowing. She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it. You know what

03:41.120 --> 03:48.560
else I'm not living for? The Muslims. Tiffany, you are so funny. I'm sorry. Are we just going

03:48.560 --> 03:53.920
to ignore the blatant racism? How is that racist? Muslims are religion, not a race. Yeah, Adria.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.400
Muslims are religion, not a race. Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied

03:58.400 --> 04:03.040
together. You can't just...well, you both know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's try to

04:03.040 --> 04:10.480
get back on track here. So Adria, traps. Are they gay? Look, there's so many things wrong with the

04:10.480 --> 04:15.040
question that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it. First of all, what are traps?

04:15.040 --> 04:19.040
Are they trans women? Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing

04:19.040 --> 04:24.000
into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men. A lie that reinforces the mentality

04:24.000 --> 04:28.800
that causes men to murder us. Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman. What about

04:28.800 --> 04:33.840
anime? Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans. The Japanese word

04:33.840 --> 04:38.960
is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser. There's no implication of tricking men, but the

04:38.960 --> 04:43.680
word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women. So when you tell us that's

04:43.680 --> 04:47.840
not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.080
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women. We're not all offended all the time.

04:52.080 --> 04:57.200
I actually happen to identify as a trap. Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap. Well,

04:57.200 --> 05:01.520
she's in the sunken place. And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless. Doesn't it bother you at all

05:01.520 --> 05:05.840
that if some guy murders you, his defense is going to be, well, she was a trap. I was tricked.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.600
And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking. What do you care, Adria? No one's

05:09.600 --> 05:15.520
gonna be trapped by you anyway. Oh, spicy. The fuck did you just say? I said no shade,

05:15.520 --> 05:18.400
but you don't really look like a woman. Jackie, are you going to allow your

05:18.400 --> 05:23.440
guests to talk to me like this? Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer. Look,

05:23.440 --> 05:28.960
dragging bitches is what I do. Facts over feels, hunty. Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit

05:28.960 --> 05:33.920
of a point? Like if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in. I mean,

05:33.920 --> 05:38.960
what is this, a men's shirt? How are you going to attract men with that? I'm not trying to attract

05:38.960 --> 05:45.280
men. I'm a lesbian. I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman

05:45.280 --> 05:52.320
and a lesbian? Well, I'm a woman and I like women. I don't know about that. Sounds debatable. I'm

05:52.320 --> 05:56.160
sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the transphobia

05:56.160 --> 06:02.960
special. Transphobia? Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair. I mean, I've invited two trans women

06:02.960 --> 06:08.560
to be on my program and I'll have you know that one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.

06:08.560 --> 06:13.760
And what could be transphobic about that? See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans

06:13.760 --> 06:17.760
people. You're obnoxious and offended by everything and everyone feels like they have to tread on

06:17.760 --> 06:22.320
eggshells around you. Thank you, Tiffany. See, you're one of the good ones. You're a good tran.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.640
Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany? Be the lap dog of people like this?

06:26.640 --> 06:31.840
No. I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient and agreeable

06:31.840 --> 06:35.840
and by looking the part and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet your

06:35.840 --> 06:40.640
impossible standard of wokeness. And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh? Just keep

06:40.640 --> 06:45.280
reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away. Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,

06:45.280 --> 06:49.360
that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone but yourself and the only reason you're accepted is

06:49.360 --> 06:53.520
that you don't challenge the status quo? I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because

06:53.520 --> 06:57.360
I feel like we're just getting hung up on terminology. Look, Adria, if you don't like the

06:57.360 --> 07:02.480
word trap, we just won't use the word trap. The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to

07:02.480 --> 07:08.240
trans women? It is if you're a woman. No, I mean for men. Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men

07:08.240 --> 07:15.120
or gay men? Well, all the men I've dated only date women but if they're attracted to me, I mean,

07:15.120 --> 07:20.000
it's not the straightest thing, is it? Why not? You look like a woman and I know that you know

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
that gay men are not attracted to these tits. Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.080
Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria? I mean, sure, she looks like a woman but

07:30.800 --> 07:35.600
she does have XY chromosomes. When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?

07:35.600 --> 07:40.640
That's not how sexuality works. We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular

07:40.640 --> 07:47.040
biology. Okay, sure, but I mean, a lot of trans women still have their penis and you gotta admit,

07:47.040 --> 07:51.840
that seems kind of gay. Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you? We live in a

07:51.840 --> 07:56.320
world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women but there's an intense stigma

07:56.320 --> 08:01.520
on dating trans women and it's actually dangerous because what happens is if a man's friends find

08:01.520 --> 08:06.480
out that the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by

08:06.480 --> 08:11.040
lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating and this happens again and again. And

08:11.040 --> 08:15.440
every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma and you're

08:15.440 --> 08:19.200
making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women. Alright, I'm not trying

08:19.200 --> 08:24.240
to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women

08:24.240 --> 08:29.760
could be attracted to a person with a penis. Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you, I am a lesbian,

08:29.760 --> 08:34.480
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women, and when I'm attracted to a trans woman,

08:34.480 --> 08:39.200
I perceive her as a woman. And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,

08:39.200 --> 08:45.360
but as a part of her female body. So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick. I'm

08:45.360 --> 08:52.640
sorry, what? What is girl dick? The feminine penis. Oh no. Oh, come on. This is nonsense. How

08:52.640 --> 08:58.000
could a penis possibly be feminine? Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman, but also because

08:58.000 --> 09:04.880
hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis. Shut up, Adria, just shut up.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.680
Wait, really? How is it different? Well, I'm glad you asked. More needs to be said about the feminine

09:09.680 --> 09:15.120
penis. Why is no one talking about the feminine penis? Kill me now. So to start with, it doesn't

09:15.120 --> 09:20.160
get as hard. It doesn't really ejaculate and it has a different mouth feel. Can we please talk

09:20.160 --> 09:25.760
about the mouth feel? Why is no one talking about the mouth feel? I don't think that's necessary.

09:25.760 --> 09:32.240
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.

09:32.240 --> 09:39.040
That's correct. I don't like mantic. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.

09:39.040 --> 09:45.200
Not like girl dick. Girl dick is everything soft and smooth. What is that? Star Wars? Do

09:45.200 --> 09:50.240
you also build computers for a living? I mean, guilty. I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.600
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl. My sweet love. Wait,

09:57.600 --> 10:02.480
you're dating that crazy Antifa cat? Well, we're in the same poly heel. I don't know what that means

10:02.480 --> 10:08.160
and I'm not like prejudiced or anything, but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

10:08.160 --> 10:13.760
Like if you're born male and you're attracted to women, how is it not just heterosexuality?

10:13.760 --> 10:19.040
Well, my girlfriend is also trans. So if you follow your logic to its conclusion,

10:19.600 --> 10:28.240
okay. So you're a woman who was born a man and you like women, but you're dating a woman.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.280
Someone who has a penis. It's a female penis that used to be a male penis.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.160
So you're attracted to women, but you were born a man and you're attracted to women.

10:40.160 --> 10:46.320
But that used to be a man your dating a female has a penis. So that means you are gay,

10:46.320 --> 10:50.800
but you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born. I can go over it with

10:50.800 --> 10:55.520
you again after the show if you need some extra time to figure it out. Why am I constantly

10:55.520 --> 11:01.120
surrounded by homosexuals? Adria, just stop talking. Look, I don't care what you do in private,

11:01.120 --> 11:05.760
but I'm sorry to break it to you. The world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

11:05.760 --> 11:10.320
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile and people like me

11:10.320 --> 11:15.440
to be our representatives because I act like a normal woman and I date normal men and I don't

11:15.440 --> 11:21.600
have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick. Also, I look fucking gorgeous. I'm sorry,

11:21.600 --> 11:26.400
but that matters. Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart. You're not

11:26.480 --> 11:31.440
blair white. Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done, so there's not a fair comparison.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.760
What work are you having done? I'm going to lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,

11:35.760 --> 11:41.360
reshape my brow, get some lip injections, maybe Botox my forehead. Oh, and I'm going to fix my

11:41.360 --> 11:47.200
nose, obviously. What's wrong with your nose? It's kind of big and manish. Well, my nose looks

11:47.200 --> 11:51.840
kind of like that. Are you saying I look manish? Are you saying I look ugly? What are you trying

11:51.840 --> 11:55.200
to say, Tiffany? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to women?

11:56.080 --> 12:00.960
I'm not doing anything to women. What? Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.000
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman. She has to work really hard to be seen as female

12:06.000 --> 12:11.440
and you just don't. Shut the hell up, Adria. Don't get offended for me. Don't condescend to me.

12:11.440 --> 12:19.120
I'm not a victim. Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be, but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.360
Oh my god. I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.

12:26.960 --> 12:35.360
All right, let's forget about it. I'm fine. Tiffany, are you fine? I am fine. To be clear,

12:35.360 --> 12:39.360
aren't not fine with any of this. Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out? Let's

12:39.360 --> 12:45.120
shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post. Well, we may never know whether traps are

12:45.120 --> 12:50.640
gay, but the important thing is that we talked about it. I'm Jackie Jackson for the Freedom Report

12:50.640 --> 12:56.800
where the debate never stops. Your mascara is running. Get out of my studio, both of you.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.400
Get out. We're done.

13:00.400 --> 13:17.360
Hi, Nick. Yeah, I'm finished. Well, it was a shit show. No, Adria was fine. She was cringe as fuck

13:17.360 --> 13:23.360
the whole time. Let's have her back. Tiffany was a problem. She kept veering off message and she got

13:23.360 --> 13:34.640
emotional. Yeah, don't invite her back. Get Blair next time. And the week after, can we get Kanye West?

13:34.640 --> 13:43.440
We can't get Kanye. Get Candace Owens. Oh, what have you done to my studio? Hey, Adria, look,

13:44.720 --> 13:49.360
I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay? It's just that I've been working so hard to win

13:49.360 --> 13:54.240
acceptance for trans people to show everyone that were normal, that were just like them. And

13:55.760 --> 14:00.640
when you show up looking like that and acting like that, it's just hard for me to watch all

14:00.640 --> 14:06.400
my hard work be undone, you know? Like, you can't be talking about this feminine penis in front of

14:06.400 --> 14:11.520
cis people. Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.

14:11.520 --> 14:21.680
Oh my god, you crazy freak!

14:41.520 --> 14:59.520
I hate Adria. She looks like a man beast. Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

15:00.720 --> 15:05.760
Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.

15:05.760 --> 15:11.680
They should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.

15:14.000 --> 15:27.920
Angel, relax.

15:27.920 --> 15:33.840
Well, it's off.

15:37.600 --> 15:44.400
I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up. All right, what are they saying?

15:47.760 --> 15:48.080
Fuck it.

15:57.920 --> 16:10.080
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know them. I may have a mental illness,

16:10.080 --> 16:16.800
but I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional. I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.880
You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.920
It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...

16:31.600 --> 16:38.320
I'm not a victim. I am in control of my life.

16:42.880 --> 16:49.360
I wish I were a woman or anything but this.

16:49.360 --> 16:56.240
I'm destroying my body.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.800
How could I ever love this?

17:06.160 --> 17:13.280
I'm just mutilating myself. It's so disgusting.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.480
God, I'm so disgusting.

17:19.360 --> 17:24.240
I'm so disgusting.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.040
I'm just eating a can of another drink.

17:35.040 --> 17:48.720
I'm not a victim. I am in complete control.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.720
I'm not a victim. I'm not a victim.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.720
I'm just not a victim. I'm just a victim.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.720
I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.720
