WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Fire burning cauldron bubble.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Something wicked this way comes.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Magical darkness.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
A must.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Joanne, I want to talk to you, Joanne.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
What is it about Joanne's?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I can't catch a break from these people.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
So, now that 2020 is finally over,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I think we can let the record conclusively show

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
that it was a year Homest is bad.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
And on top of everything else that was going on,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
truly the last thing we needed was the author of Harry Potter

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
coming forward to announce there's two things she can't stand.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Bickertree and the Transgenders.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
How?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Elderberry wand.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Turjid.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
With a core of...

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Ice dragon.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Lumos.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Can we afford spells?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Is that in the budget?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Expecto Patreon.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
So, you've probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Unless you've been living under a rock, in which case,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
get back under that rock, sweetie.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
There is nothing good going on up here.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
It's not worth it.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did was say biological sex is real.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
And now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists are trying to silence her.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
This is cancel culture gone too far.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
This is a witch hunt.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Celebrities are under attack.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
This is the new Salem.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
This is Orwell's nightmare.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
This is a painful topic for me all around,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
because as a transgender woman,

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things Joanne has said in the last year.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
But I also know what it's like to be the target of a Twitter mob.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
And I realize that to most people, complaining about being canceled,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people like J.K. Rowling

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
would be above staying up alone at night reading mean things people say online.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
But you'd think wrong.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness of the human condition.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And no amount of fame and money is going to fix that.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, fame alienates you from other people.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
which can actually make you feel more alone,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
even when people are worshipping you as a goddess.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Never mind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
The truth is that unless you've personally experienced infamy,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
being shamed and shunned on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
then you just don't know what it's like.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
But Joanne knows, and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
there's a traumatized part of me that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And I want to protect.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
My nurturing and compassionate nature sometimes gets the best of me.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But there's also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
How could you do this to me, Joanne?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
So what I want to do in this video is take Joanne's pain seriously

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and treat her like a complex human being,

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
while also being critical of the things she said about the transgender question.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And I also want to explore where the Twitter mob is coming from,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
because they're in pain too.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And don't they also deserve our understanding?

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
So without further ado, let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
and see if we can find the truth.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Swish and flick.

03:41.000 --> 03:54.000
So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, she certainly seems invested in the belief that she is not a bigot.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
What vice do you most despise?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Bigotry.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
In looking over Joanne's tweets,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't think the average person would see any problem with what she's said.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
However, I mean, not to be condescending,

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
but I feel like the average person's understanding of transgender is still a little bit...

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I don't really get the whole trans thing.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know, Amber.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Why don't you be a feminine man?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Who knows? You could be missing out.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So we're going to go through the things that Joanne has said about trans people,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
but I don't want this to be just a drama video or a video saying,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
cancel Harry Potter, drag her.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Like, I want to try to do something a little bit more meaningful than that.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
So I'm going to use J.K. Rowe as a case study in bigotry

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
and see if we can maybe learn something about what bigotry is.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
How does it work?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
well, for once I think I'll actually have earned my Patreon budget.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
let's spill some shade, throw some tea.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
So this all started in 2018 when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
and followed an anti-trans account.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Now, in the interest of giving Joanne as much benefit of the doubt as I can,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm not going to admit this as evidence because I don't want to do guilt by association.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Strike it from the record.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
That was fun. I like hammering things.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I stand with Maya, referencing Maya Forstater.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Maya Forstater is an English consultant who lost her contract

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
with the nonprofit she worked for after she did transphobic tweets.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
in her thread titled, allegedly transphobic tweets.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Yes, I think that male people are not women.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
I don't think that being a woman or female is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
It is biology.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Another says, some people believe that a person with a penis can be a woman.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Some, a majority, don't.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Neither group should be discriminated against in everyday life.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
But in situations involving taking your clothes off for strangers,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
integration of the two groups is not possible.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women and saying,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
it's all right, it's a woman's penis.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Everyone born female is a woman.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Everyone born male is a man.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Trans women are predators who prey on women.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Is this what you want, Joanne?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You want to put the sorting hat on humanity and divide us up into little houses?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor trapped in a half above his body?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
What then, Joanne? What then?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Well, if the tweet simply said, I stand with Maya without further explanation,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
you could give her the benefit of the doubt.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job for having bigoted opinions,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
even if she disagrees with those opinions.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
But if that's all she was saying, I wouldn't be making this video, would I?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
The full tweet reads,

07:26.000 --> 07:37.000
Now I'm guessing that to most people, this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
It might even seem supportive of trans people since she said we're allowed to dress however we want

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But there's a couple things about this that don't say it right with me.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
First is the phrase, force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint, namely,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I believe that it is impossible to change your sex or to lose your sex.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men, no change of clothes or hairstyle,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
no plastic surgery, no accidental illness, no course of hormones, no force of will or social conditioning,

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
no declaration, can turn a female person into a male or a male person into a female.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
If Joanne had said Maya had been fired for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
and a person born female could never be a man, that would have been more accurate.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But it would also sound contentious and obviously anti-trans.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present Maya Forstetter's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
basic common sense, which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
Transphobes love to play this game where they pretend that trans people just don't understand basic biology,

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
that's our problem, as if I didn't start taking female hormones because I'm acutely aware

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body, that sex is real.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Really? That's crazy.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How'd you learn so much about science?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
You know, I don't really feel the need to have a second X chromosome.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I get by with one. I make it work.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I actually like the Y chromosome. I think it's a little more dainty, you know,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
it's a little softer, a little more petite.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages, don't you think?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And I don't need any more of those, thanks.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
No trans person thinks it's possible to change chromosomal sex

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
we're talking about psychological and social identity.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
So when transphobes say sex is real, they're not actually contradicting anything most trans people believe,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
except by implication.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
When transphobes say sex is real, what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
which they trivialize, calling it dressing up, fashion choices, whatever you want to call yourself.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
When Joanne says, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
She's belittling what it actually means to be trans, reducing it to a change of name and costume.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
For example, the homophobic equivalent of Joanne's tweet might read,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Choose whatever lifestyle you want.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult in the privacy of your own bedroom.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
But force Christians out of their jobs for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Hashtag, I stand with Kim Davis.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Checkmate the gays, it's just science.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
They refer to it as sexual preferences, or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
We don't tell straight people to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's also who you love.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
It's part of who you are, part of your humanity.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
And that's something that stays with you outside of the bedroom.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Likewise, being trans is not a costume I take off at the end of the night.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's not a fashion choice.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
It's not a pet name some people call me.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It's part of who I am as a person, you know?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It's part of my humanity.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
So telling trans people to dress however you want is not really a supportive statement.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks in their videos apologizing for being racist,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
YouTubers are constantly dragging each other because we see ourselves reflected in the other,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
and we can't stand the sight of it.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
So after the Mayan forest daughter tweet, Joanne was silent about trans people for six months.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
But she took up the cause again in June 2019,

12:10.000 --> 12:19.000
for us to complain about the use of the phrase people who menstruate in the title of an article trying to include trans men and non-binary people in a discussion of period poverty.

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
That same night, presumably in response to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers who think Stalin did nothing wrong but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Joanne tweeted a thread, again repeating this slogan that sex is real, adding,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
If you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
If?

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Widespread discrimination against trans people is well documented.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet, the Trump administration removed non-discrimination protections for trans people in health care and health insurance.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
So are you marching with us or not Joanne?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
There's a lot of stuff in these tweets that might seem innocent enough to the average person,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
but which to someone who understands bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
Bigotry always has a history, and in order to understand bigotry, you have to learn that history.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes, narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing, we have to learn them.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
No one is born thinking that the gays are destroying the family, or that women are naturally subservient,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices, you might not notice anything wrong with them.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
He never said he hated the Jews.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
He is simply concerned about the over-representation of Jewish people in media and banking.

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
But if you're aware, woke if you will, then it kind of rings alarm bells when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people think sex isn't real, and they're erasing same-sex attraction, and they're silencing women,

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these as familiar transphobic talking points.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Specifically, TERF talking points.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
God, are we still talking about this? I promise, this is the last time.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
So TERFism is a hate movement that disguises transphobia as feminism.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Bigotry has a history.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
The foundational TERF text is feminist professor Janice Raymond's 1979 book,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the S*** Male,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
in which Raymond argues that, quote,

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
all transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy, who, quote,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
and I bring this up because I want to give you a sense of how this kind of transphobe talks when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
If you keep calling me Nathan, I'm going to call you Nigel.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Cheerio, old chap.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Or whatever you people say.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Here's the thing, Nigella.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Bigotry can be mean, yes.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
And it usually is when bigots think they can get away with it.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
But it's vital to recognize that being mean is not the essence of bigotry.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Bigotry can be hateful, yes.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
But specifically, bigotry is hate that poses a political threat to the target group.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
The fundamental problem with TERFs is not that they're mean.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
It's that they're politically reactionary.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
They want to reverse the progress of trans liberation.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
In the final chapter of the transsexual empire, Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question, quote,

16:32.000 --> 16:53.000
She goes on to argue for alternative feminist consciousness raising therapies, admitting,

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
I am not so naive as to think that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
but they would at least pose the existence of a real alternative to be explored and tried.

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
So like homophobes, TERFs have historically advocated a kind of conversion therapy aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.

17:13.000 --> 17:22.000
And like the anti-abortion movement, they recognize it's not yet politically practical to completely make illegal a medical procedure they don't like.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
So they settle for making it as difficult as possible to get one.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report to the Department of Health and Human Services repeating her arguments against transsexualism,

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
which was cited as a 1981 decision that Medicare would not cover transition-related healthcare.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
So there's real political consequences to bigotry.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It's not just a matter of being mean.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.

17:51.000 --> 18:03.000
Unlike Janice Raymond, J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced and very intent on convincing all of us that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally who loves and supports trans people,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
She's constantly saying things like,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I know and love trans people,

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans at the same time.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
On the contrary, many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
A lot of people have a hard time noticing this kind of bigotry,

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
and I think one reason for that is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
People think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
which is, of course, a horrible thing to do.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't care for the English.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
There's sick, sick people.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Or people think of bigotry as hate, something inhuman and monstrous.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
So when people hear the word bigot, they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
But the problem with the Nazis was not that they hated love and friendship.

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
They believed they were defending German blood and soil against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
And what were we supposed to do? Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
That's how Nazi actually thinks, right?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
It's not that they hate friendship.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
No, they have their own internal logic of victimization and self-righteousness.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
You know, sometimes people criticize me for empathizing with bigots.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
But I believe that understanding bigots is the best defense against becoming one yourself.

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
Because when you dehumanize the villains, you become unable to recognize the villain within.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
How is she, though?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Metal straw because I love the environment. I'm so good.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I'm really fucking good.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
The idea that bigotry is simply hate, I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
The idea that bigots are people who outright say, we hate you, God hates you.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And we're all marching around with signs about how much we hate you.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Taylor Swift. Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Well, I don't. I don't want to be a gay icon. I'm just stuck with you people.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Just kidding.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Shade never made anybody less gay.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
This isn't shade, Taylor.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
And the video for You Need to Calm Down is just so emblematic of this misconception.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Taylor takes this subject of homophobia and turns it into yet another song about haters.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
But in the real world, Backwoods hillbillies stomping around with misspelled signs are not really the problem.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated and powerful people.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes who say it's an abomination.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
These perverts are spreading AIDS. They're destroying the family. They're recruiting children.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
But these days, it's much more common to hear, of course, I love gay people.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction,

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
but it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology promoted in schools

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
to children as young as three years old.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
And we get convincing homophobe, don't I?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
There's really two different styles of bigotry.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
They express the same prejudice, but they're very different in tone.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I'll call the two styles direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
It's a bigotry manifested in slurs and outright discrimination

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
and demonizing the target group and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate about a host of proxy issues.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Frequently, the claim is that a once-needed liberation movement has now gone too far,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors who are disturbing law and order

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
with violent and chaotic protests,

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
who are victimizing and silencing innocent people by calling them bigots,

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
who are infiltrating the media and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment with politically correct propaganda.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated to speak out against it

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
because cancel culture is out of control and free speech is under attack.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders, rapists,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
always a knight in shining armor, defending women, defending the children, defending marriage,

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
defending freedom, defending the family, defending our values, defending common sense, defending tradition,

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
defending civilization itself, defending God.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
He's all-powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
I think a lot of people take a borderline heroic view of themselves.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
An indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets with some big abstract concept.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
Instead of Jewish people, they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis or the friend zone.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
Trans people become transgenderism, gender ideology, trans activists.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
What they're really against is equality, but they don't say that.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
In fact, they may not even think it.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
But they tell on themselves when they react with instinctive hostility to anyone who agitates for change.

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices by Elizabeth Young Broul really helped me with this video.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
One of the points she makes is that a lot of the time bigotry is backlash.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
Ideologies of desire are, generally, backlashes against movements of equality.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
They are regressive prejudices that reinstate inequalities and distinctions

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
when the force of movements for equality has been registered and, often unconsciously, rejected.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
Bigotry is not just the psychological state of hating a group of people.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Bigotry is political.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
It's a reaction to changing demographics or to liberation movements or to changing power relations between groups.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women in the literal psychological sense.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
It's more that they feel threatened by the prospect of the social and political equality of women.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry, much more so than feeling hateful.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
So bigotry is reactive, and it changes along with the circumstances it's a reaction to.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
1950s misogyny still has some things in common with 2020s misogyny.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
For example, a lot of men still feel some need to control women's sexuality and women's bodies.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
But it's also changed a lot as gender relations have shifted in the last 70 years.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
The idea that women are naturally suited to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent than it used to be.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder because, in the last decade,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
transliberation has increased our visibility.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
People are running into us at work now.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
They're having to use our pronouns.

26:03.000 --> 26:11.000
They're seeing us in politics or in media, and not just as laughing stocks or monsters like we used to be, but as actual characters.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
And a lot of people are not very happy about it.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
They feel threatened.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
That must be super fucking hard for you.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
So J.K. Rowling frames her position as, I am just saying the fact that sex is real.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It's not hateful to say a fact.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Why is everyone so mad at me?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
A fact can't be bigoted.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
But a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Usually when we discuss facts, we're using those facts to tell a story.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
You know, suppose someone tweets the fact that the homicide rate is higher for black Americans than white Americans.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm going to ask, what story are you trying to tell with this fact?

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
What political goal are you trying to support?

27:09.000 --> 27:18.000
One way indirect bigotry works is by camouflaging political struggles as intellectual debates.

27:18.000 --> 27:26.000
When Joanne says sex is real, she sounds like she's staking out a position in the trans debate,

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
which is then presented as an intellectual conflict about the metaphysics of gender,

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
instead of what it really is, which is a political conflict about the social equality of transgender people.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
And the effectiveness of that strategy is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan of this slogan,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
trans women are women.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
And this is just my opinion. I don't speak for any other trans people, but there's a couple things I don't like about it.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
One is trans men and non-binary people matter just as much as trans women.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
What you don't as often hear, trans men are men.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Or non-binary people are...

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
valid?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Doesn't really work, does it?

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Another problem with trans women are women is it tends to invite the response.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Well, what does it even mean to be a woman?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Define womanhood.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
And now, you're immediately getting baited into some bullshit semantic debate about what is a real woman.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
A real woman. How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
What if you're in The Matrix right now, and in the real world, you're biologically male?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
The tables are turned.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
It doesn't really matter, does it?

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
That's it. This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
You know, I've been down this road too many times already, and I always end up having these dead-end conversations about gender performativity,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
or worse, conversations about what it means to feel like a woman.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
I don't think anyone feels like a woman honestly, except a certain subgenre of gay men, and possibly Shania Twain.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Probably not even her anymore, honestly. Not since the early 2000s.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
You know, some questions should be dissolved rather than solved. That's what Wittgenstein said.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to realize you're asking the wrong question.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
How do I know I'm a woman? Well, look at me.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I rest my case.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
The monitor's over here. That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves what gender is.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
In fact, if you even try to answer the question, you end up enraging some part of the community who feels excluded.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
So no, trans people are not trying to force an ideology on people.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
We don't even share an ideology within our own community.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
What we share are a common set of political struggles against discrimination, against harassment,

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
against excessive medical gatekeeping, against exclusion from public life.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people,

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
and something that evades pointless philosophizing about biology,

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
and what is gender, and who is true trans, and what is a woman really?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Something that centers what actually matters,

30:19.000 --> 30:27.000
which is freeing trans people from the stigma and discrimination that have historically prevented us from becoming equal members of society.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s, but I personally like this slogan,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
trans liberation now.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
It's short, it's sweet, and instead of prompting define womanhood,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Liberation from what?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
And now you're talking about politics instead of talking about semantics.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Isn't that better?

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed with reassuring ourselves that we are valid

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
that we sometimes forget that the end goal of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, maybe I care a little bit.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
But instead, why don't we ask, is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Isn't it so much better to have a concrete political project in front of you

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
Trans people are a population of people who have a right to equality and to freedom from discrimination.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
We are not an ideology that's up for debate.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
but as an ideology that she disagrees with.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
I'm just saying that sex is real.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Is that all you're saying, Joanne?

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire in the prefix bathroom?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
This bath is actually really nice.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil, epsom salts,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
just kind of everything that's good in baths altogether.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I don't want to talk about bigotry.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I want to talk about baths.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Can this just be a video about baths from now on?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Oh, fine. I'll do my job.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The essay is several pages long

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
and outlines her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Where do I even begin with this one?

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Well, let's pick some highlights.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Woman is not an idea in a man's head.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Woman is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choo's

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Oh, well, my mistake.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Here I was thinking I was a woman.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
What a whimsical misunderstanding.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Okay, well, that's it everyone.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
The channel's over.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Thanks for the likes and comments.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm going to head out now to the Jimmy Choo store

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
and then I guess I'll cut my tits off.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Joanne! Joanne! This is madness, Joanne.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
to any man who believes or feels he's a woman

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
So, look, I understand that some women are anxious

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
about the thought of predators in bathrooms.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And believe me, I don't want to share a bathroom with a predator

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
any more than you do.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Why are all my rose petals on this one side?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Some of them need to come over here.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Come here.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I've redistributed the petals.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Socialist icon.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
But this talking point that gender change on legal documents

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
will enable predators to enter bathrooms,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
it doesn't really make sense

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
because gender policing in public bathrooms

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
doesn't involve legal documents.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Like, when was the last time you had to present a gender certificate

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
to gain admittance to a public bathroom?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
This feels like a strangely outdated conversation

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
to be having during pandemic lockdown.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Like, imagine using a public bathroom.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Imagine being in public.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
which is about the experiences of butch women.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
which describes how women's bathrooms

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
tend to operate as an area

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
for the enforcement of gender conformity.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
The author, Jack Halberstam,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
who's assigned female at birth and presents masculine,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
describes routinely having security called on him

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
for using the women's bathroom.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
is a frequent occurrence in the lives

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
of many androgynous or masculine women.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
whether the category woman,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
when used to designate public functions,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
is completely outmoded.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Queer literature is littered with references

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
to The Bathroom Problem,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and it would not be an exaggeration

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
to call it a standard feature of the butch narrative.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And that's very interesting to me,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
because as a feminine trans woman,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I have not once been questioned

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
or had the authorities called on me

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
in a women's public bathroom

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
in the entire time I've been using them,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
which is several years now.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
So when Joanne Roley, a feminine heterosexual woman,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
calls for more bathroom policing

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
to protect the lesbians or whatever,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
it just seems ignorant

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
of the way bathroom policing actually works.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Like, is she just so famous

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
and she forgot how they work?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Ten dollars?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
not chromosomes,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
and there's no practical way to change that

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
short of stationing a genital inspector in every stall,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
you know, just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
That's a very good idea, Joanne.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
That's very good.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
They include trans men in their feminism

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
because they were born women.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
think that trans men are women?

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Hello, operator. Could you get me a Lennis Morissette?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I have a new incident to report.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
So look, I could keep refuting points made in turf wars,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
which is basically just a series of common transphobic canards

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
we've all heard a hundred times before,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
but I want to focus in particular on some passages

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
that I think are very revealing about the psychology of transphobia.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
What is it about the transgenders

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
that some people feel threatened by?

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Well, Joanne Roley gives us a lot to work with

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
in answering that question.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
You know, Joanne being in turf is mostly terrible for trans people,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
but maybe the silver lining is that

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
the most famous novelist in the world

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
having a public transphobic breakdown

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
is providing a wealth of insight

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
about the interior world of a transphobe.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
In turf wars, Joanne claims her interest in

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
the trans issue is intensely personal,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and she has two reasons why it's personal.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
she would have been trans.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Someone would have trans-ed her.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
You know, people are being trans to left and right these days.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Trans people, we're always on the lookout

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
for the next person we can trans,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
so all we want to do is trans people.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
I trans-ed four people this morning before I had breakfast.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
She thinks that she would have been recruited

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
And in support of this speculation,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
about social contagion and a, quote,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
4,400% increase in girls being referred

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
for transitioning treatment.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
And that sounds pretty alarming, right?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
4,400%.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred,

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
and by last year, that number was 1,740,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
with the biggest increase happening five years ago,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
you know, the transgender tipping point year.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
So that is a big increase,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
but it corresponds to the biggest ever increase

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
in trans visibility, so it does make sense.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
And there's 11 million children in the UK,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
so let's say 5.5 million girls,

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And considering that around 1% of adults

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
are some kind of transgender,

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
0.03% of kids is not really an alarming number to me.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But part of Joanne's problem here

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
is that she seems not to really understand

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
what being trans is.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
The writings of young trans men reveal a group

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
of notably sensitive and clever people.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
and self-hatred, the more I've wondered

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
whether if I'd been born 30 years later,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I too might have tried to transition.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
If I'd found community and sympathy online

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I believe I could have been persuaded

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
to turn myself into the son my father had openly said

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
he'd have preferred.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and my ambivalence about being a woman

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
reflected in the work of female writers

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
and musicians who reassured me

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
that in spite of everything,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
It's fine not to feel pink.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Free and compliant inside your own head.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's okay to feel confused, dark,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
both sexual and non-sexual,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
unsure of what or who you are.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and let's start by making a list

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
of things being a transgender man is not.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Having anxiety, having dissociation,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
having an eating disorder,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
doing self-harm, doing self-hatred,

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
a viable way to make your sexist father proud,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
not being compliant, feeling confused,

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
feeling dark, feeling sexual,

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Okay, so you can be a trans man

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
and experience some or even all of these things,

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
but none of these things are what being a trans man is.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
and literally live your life as a man

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
is not the same as the typical struggles

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
other girls go through.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Joanne is projecting her own memories

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
of troubled adolescents onto trans men

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
and then saying,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
oh, clearly they were going through the same things I was,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
just someone persuaded them to transition.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It's a limitation of human empathy

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
that sometimes when we're trying to understand

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
what someone else is feeling,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
And sometimes that's a misrepresentation.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Sometimes other people are experiencing things

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
that we have never experienced.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
So we have to invent explanations

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Someone is persuading them to transition.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
But this fear-mongering about kids

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
being persuaded to transition

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
is just not how things work.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
From the way transphobes talk about it,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
picks up a toy truck,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
an endocrinologist pops out from behind a tree

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
and says,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
in particular about young transmasculine people.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
that is essentially to transmasculine people

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
what the transsexual empire was to trans women.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It's called Irreversible Damage.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
The transgender craze seducing our daughters.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Chapter one.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The contagion.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Jesus.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
The argument is that female to male transgenderism

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
is an infectious social disease,

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
which is literally the argument Hitler made about homosexuality,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
but okay, great.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
is that not enough attention is paid

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
to transphobia against trans men.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
transgender women are women.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
And that's very nice of him,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
In fact, she spends more words on trans men

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
than on any other topic.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
So I think it's worth looking in particular at that.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
is not the same as transphobia against trans women.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
There's a lot of similarities,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
but they're really two different prejudices,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
and they come from different psychological places

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
in the same way that lesbophobia is different

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
from homophobia against gay men.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
For trans women, I would say the distinctive experience

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
of transphobia is being simultaneously treated

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
as a pornographic female fetish object

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
and as a dangerous male predator.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
who will ravish your wife and trap your husband.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Your polygamous commune will be devastated.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Whereas I feel like transmasculine people

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
are less vilified, but so infantilized.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
I guess transphobes view trans men as women,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
so a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
so much for transitioning to escape sexism.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
can't possibly decide for themselves

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
what to do with their own bodies,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
so the courts must intervene to take control,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
which is exactly what just happened in the UK,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
where trans youth under 16 will now need

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
not only the approval of a doctor,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
but will need to seek a court order

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
in order to get puberty blockers.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
And the justification given for this

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
being unable to make informed decisions.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
In her essay, Joanne says,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
who's older than I am and wonderful.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Although she's open about her past as a gay man,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I've always found it hard to think of her

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
as anything other than a woman.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Being older, though, she went through

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
a long and rigorous process of evaluation,

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
psychotherapy, and staged transformation.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
The current explosion of trans activism

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
through which candidates for sex reassignment

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
were once required to pass.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
So that's what she wants.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
just Joanne's more polite about it.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I wanna make a drink.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
No, just drank a lot.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Ugh, we're revealing leg again.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
The scandal.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
is that much more chaste.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
While I'm an extremely chaste woman,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I try to honor God with my body.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
That's why I got a sex change.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
I'm honoring God with my sex change.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
I'm not drunk enough for this.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
So I also wanna point out that cis men and cis women

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
are often transphobic for different reasons.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
because the thought that a man can become a woman

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
threatens the certainty of their own manhood.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men are homophobic.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
And of course, a lot of straight men are attracted to trans women

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
and they feel that that attraction threatens their identity as straight men.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Back in my Comp Hat days when I dated men,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
for a couple of straight guys I hooked up with,

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
This is it, Mr. Frodo.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
And afterwards, I go into this whole Cartesian spiral.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
What have I done?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
What does this mean?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Who am I?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I think for a lot of cis women,

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
the very existence of trans men sends them into a similar identity crisis.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
I think a lot of women have had to fight a really difficult internal battle

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
to make peace with their own womanhood.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
And for some women, confronting the existence of transgender people

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
seems to open some old wounds.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Like I've noticed in particular,

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
And these women see hyper-feminine trans women in makeup and dresses

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
and they say,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
that is not what being a woman is.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
I've had to fight for my own identity against the idea

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
that that's what being a woman is.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
These are just misogynistic stereotypes.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
You are a parody of womanhood.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
You're a fetishist.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
And when they see trans men, they say,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
you're a traitor.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You're a self-loather.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman the way I've had to?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
But this is all projection and misunderstanding.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
Trans women do not think that wearing dresses is what makes us women.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
And trans men do not think that not feeling a pink frilly and compliant

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
is what makes them men.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning to trans people's actions

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
in her own brain because she perceives our lives

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
as some kind of commentary on gender

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
with an implied ideology about what it means to be a man or a woman.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
But that's your interpretation Joanne.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
That's a meaning that you are imposing on us

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage of your own

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
and it's interfering with your ability to genuinely empathize with trans people.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
You know, at the end of your essay,

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
you say that you never forget the inner complexity when it comes to trans people.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
And that's a nice thought,

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
as some kind of like abstract theory of gender

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
or as a projection of your own adolescence,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
with our own experiences and stories.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson on trans people,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
sorry, gender issues,

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
I think it would be good if you listened to the experiences of trans men

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
without, for instance, superimposing your own troubled relationship with your father.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
I should probably talk about the book

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
since I did go to The Trouble to read all 900 pages

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
because unlike certain other YouTubers,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I do in fact know how to read.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Troubled Blood was published in September 2020

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You know, for someone apparently so concerned

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is...

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
it's interesting.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
It's a choice.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
God, this thing is huge.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
It's like the infinite jest of turfery.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
So Troubled Blood is a detective novel

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
about the simmering heterosexual tension between two investigators.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Simmering.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Hello, Daniel.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I love you, grown-up Harry Potter.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Let me show you my love.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
The only way I know how.

50:13.000 --> 50:26.000
Oh!

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh!

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Is there going to be discourse about this?

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
Look, if it's wrong to have cop-hat feelings about Daniel Radcliffe,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I don't want to be right.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
I will not be shamed for my shameful fantasies.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Get out of here, Daniel.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
This is a final farewell to my heterosexuality.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Goodbye, Daniel!

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And your little arm, too.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
You stay out of this, Linda.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
to lull his victims, whom's tea abducts,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
tortures, rapes, and murders.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Interesting.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
have called this book transphobic.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
And you might think that's unfair, since the character Dennis Creed,

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
this serial killer, he's not a trans.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
He's a cross-dresser.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
This has nothing to do with trans people.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Why so triggered, snowflake?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Well, precious.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
There's a couple things I think are worth taking into consideration here.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
is an old transphobic trope.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
It's a cliché that goes back decades.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
And I take great offense to the suggestion that trans women are serial killers

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
The trope seems to originate in 1960 with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
That's just my guess, though.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
I haven't researched this.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Who do you think I am?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Lindsay Ellis?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up,

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
where the psychiatrist offers the pseudo-Freudian explanation

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
that Norman cross-dresses because the personality of his dead mother takes over

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
and out of jealousy kills the women Norman is attracted to.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
Therefore, the psychiatrist explains, Norman is not a real transvestite.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
You're a fake transvestite, Norman.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Trender alert.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
But I do think that even if Psycho isn't explicitly transphobic,

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
movies can subconsciously implant ideas and feelings into our brains.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
And I do think it's worth noting that the most famous

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
and most terrifying murder scene in cinema history

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
is if a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
To quote a popular film critic, you might not have noticed it,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
but your brain did.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
The cross-dressing psychotrope became explicitly transphobic

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
in the campy 1980s Psycho rip-off Dressed to Kill,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
who, yes, dresses as a woman to kill women he's attracted to.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
He was a transsexual.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
What?

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
A transsexual.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
You see, there's some men and women, too, think they're born in the wrong body.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
They're called transsexuals, and all they want to do is have their sex changed.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
That's all they want to do, the transsexuals.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Dressed to Kill also ends with a psychiatric summing up,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
where the doctor explains that Michael Caine has a case of...

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
But it's the female Michael Caine who kills because, and I quote...

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
There's often a misogynistic trope hiding behind the transphobic one.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
It's the woman in the man who does the murders.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
It's the mother's fault.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
The most mature iteration of this trope,

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
the crown jewel of transphobic movies, is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
which is honestly one of my favorite movies,

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are just radiant in it.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
And, uh, also, I hate myself.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
an animal lover and innovative seamstress.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Buffalo Bill is a transtrender.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
A transtrender!

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
because its application for sex reassignment was rejected

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
because, according to Hannibal Lecter...

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Billy is not a real transsexual.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Hannibal Lecter is a true scum.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
I just want to use this opportunity to reassure my trans audience

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
that even if you've only killed one or two people, you're valid.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I entertain myself.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
That's how I continue to struggle onwards.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
and more terry-fry.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Is that even possible?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
because the sun is rising.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Silence of the Lambs differs from its male-gazy predecessors

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Clarisse is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and every man in this movie is a pig,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
except maybe Hannibal Lecter,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
the only one who actually respects Clarisse,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
the only real gentleman with his Goldberg variations

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
in his sketches of the Duomo.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
even Crawford's kind of a pig.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
The pigs are pigs, Miggs is pigs,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
Dooberschwein is in the original Sherman.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
The fuck are we talking about?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
What?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And he's obsessed with death's head moths,

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
for gender transformation.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
I can't believe I finally emerged as a beautiful butterflame.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
So don't tell Lily.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people have so many rights

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
that it's okay to make fun of us.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
There's a lot to work with.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make a movie

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
or write a book about a transgender serial killer,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
but there is an issue of representation.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
You know, for decades there was close to zero

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
good representation of trans people in movies or TV,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And that has an effect on the way people think.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
When it comes time to debate bathroom bills

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
and people are subconsciously remembering psycho,

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
that has serious consequences for trans people.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
It's getting so bright in here.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
The sun has risen.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
And it's also not psychologically good for us

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures of ourselves in media.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Like even as late as my early 20s,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I didn't know any trans people,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
I think the most positive approximation of representation I knew about

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
was like Frankenfurter and Divine.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
And both of them are also psychotic murderers,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
just, you know, in a fun way.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Should've just gotten her those cha-cha heels.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
but I guess I felt that it was basically the moral equivalent

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
of being a serial killer.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And things have changed in the last 10 years.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
And there's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
who don't even hate themselves.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Can't relate.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Joanne has written a book about a serial killer

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
who dresses as a woman to kill women.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Groundbreaking.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Now this is such a cliche

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
that you'd kind of expect a seasoned writer like J.K. Rowling

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
to subvert it somehow.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Give us a remix, turn it on its head.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Or at least do something new with it.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
But she really doesn't.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I guess I should read you some passages.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm reading it on my phone.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
I'm not bringing the book out and pretending to read on the book.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
You can see from my little bookmarks that I read the physical book.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Yes, I'm a YouTuber.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And yes, I read a book.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
So here's a psychiatrist.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
He's a classic sociopath, you see.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
A pure example of the type.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
He scores very highly on the dark triad.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
You see, he's what we in the medical profession call the baddie.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
It excited me to watch a woman who didn't know she was being observed.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
I'd do it to my sisters, but I'd creep up to lip windows as well.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing, adjusting themselves or even a glimpse of nudity.

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects, but by the sense of power.

59:00.000 --> 59:06.000
I felt I stole something of their essence from them, taking that which they had thought private and hidden.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear from neighbors' washing lines, and even from his grandmother, Ina.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
These he enjoyed wearing in secret, and about extubating in.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Oh, how dear readers.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
So Dennis Creed is characterized as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
And like, okay, there really are men who fetishize women's clothes, for example.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I mean, Freud talked about this, right?

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part or an article of clothing.

59:39.000 --> 59:51.000
And Freud theorized that finishes emerge from the unconscious trauma that occurs when men discover that women don't have a penis.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
But considering that Joanne has been doing a lot of gender critical reading over the past few years,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000
it's kind of hard for me to ignore that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women is exactly the way a lot of TERFs characterize trans women.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Remember, the whole gender critical feminists with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
These people are bigots.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs that trans women are hypersexual and hyper aggressive, right?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
These inherently pornographic sex demons.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Are trans women sex demons?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Why, yes.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yes, we are.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The bigots are simply correct.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
We're sex demons.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You can't even talk to these people.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I used to take the bait and argue that, no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Unless you want me to be.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But it's counterproductive to make that argument.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Why?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because I'm not involved in human trafficking t-shirt as people asking a lot of questions are already answered by my shirt.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So I have a hard time believing that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And I also want to note that Dennis's cross dressing is described not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Dennis says, on page 854, so you know I actually read this fucking shit,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
In a wig, bit of lipstick.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You're the nice man who's safe.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And earlier he's described as

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner, a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper, and sometimes wearing a wig that, from a distance to a drunk victim, gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination, cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
They mistake him for a woman.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Or as, you know.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And that causes them to lower their guard.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
And this reminds me of one of my F4 statters, allegedly transphobic tweets.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Pronouns are Rohypnol. Important article by Harry Lektarpi.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
A.K.A. Vulfomort. She who must not be named.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Followed by J.K. Rowling. Because of course.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Pronouns are Rohypnol.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Rohypnol's roofies. And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Pronouns are like Rohypnol. They dull your defenses. They change your inhibitions. They're meant to.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You've had a lifetime's experience learning to be alert to him and to relax to her. For good reason.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
These instinctive responses keep you safe.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It's not even a conscious thing. It's like the hairs standing on end.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger that your eyes haven't noticed yet.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I want to be alert. I want others to be alert.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I want people to see the real picture.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And I want those instinctive reactions that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted, undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I feel like I owe this to myself. And I absolutely owe it to other women.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And more than anything, I owe this to girls.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I don't want to play even the tiniest part in grooming them to disregard their natural protective instincts.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Those instincts are there for a reason. To keep them safe, they need those instincts intact and sharp.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And that's why I won't use preferred pronouns. Using Rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Okay. So, these are the thoughts of someone who's been hurt.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people is intensely personal.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I was born this way. Born is a fucking idiot.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old. It's kind of an agatha drink.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch. That's the plot. Pay attention. It makes sense.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Also, a martini. What is a martini? Put an excuse to drink a glass of gin.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Should probably eat an olive. Or this is going to go straight to my fucking brain.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Okay, we have to be serious now. In turf wars, Joanne writes...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Okay. So, for Joanne, her traumatic experience being attacked by a man is psychologically related.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:00.000
To her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people and about trans people saying nasty things about her on Twitter.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000
She feels intensely about this issue because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD. In her own words...

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:40.000
A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance, a constant alertness to danger. This is described in a very wise book called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Shulman.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:56.000
The traumatized person's sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed. They feel endangered even if there is no actual danger in the present because in the past they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response is a real experience of suffering that is not the victim's fault, even in cases where that response is irrational or politically incorrect.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:33.000
For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager, I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy around black teenagers for a while. However, if that jumpiness motivates you to become a campaigner for more militant policing of black neighborhoods, then you are participating in anti-black racism and that I will criticize regardless of your trauma.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I hope it goes without saying that trans people gaining easier access to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020 is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s. This is a non sequitur.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So it's a little odd to me that while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma and she's self-aware enough to realize that her hypervigilance is often irrational to the point where she herself finds humor in it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:15.000
She's somehow not self-aware enough to realize that her fears about trans people are an irrational manifestation of the hypervigilance.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma and I would be nothing but sympathetic if her feelings about this amounted to simply being triggered by, for example, perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Which is something most trans women are sensitive to. Like I've spoken to trans women who are worried they don't pass or who know they don't pass and who do everything they can to avoid using a public bathroom because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So these trans women go through life every day compromising their own comfort and safety to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope of an automatic trigger response.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It's become a fixation for years to the point where she's written a 900 page novel about a serial killer who cross-stresses to trick women into being less vigilant.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And now the primary political cause she's decided to use her superstardom to champion is opposition to trans liberation.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Like if you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized as a child when your father left your mother for a man, you're still a homophobe, right?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
You're not less of a bigot because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
So it's often rooted in trauma.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:49.000
After the collective trauma of 9-11, Americans felt threatened not just by al-Qaeda but by the entire religion of Islam.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And this was used and is still being used to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Feelings of victimization are often used as a justification for aggression.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And when the target of that aggression is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy, creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It's biological women who are the real victims.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
The real victim.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So often in debates on social issues, we're faced with two opposing sides, both claiming to be the victim.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And we're often told to believe victims, believe marginalized people.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Well, if only it was that easy.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So often, the exact point in question is who is the victim and who's the oppressor.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse, describes the way the overstatement of harm is used as a justification for cruelty.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
In situations ranging from romantic relationships to international affairs.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Bullies often conceptualize themselves as being under attack when they are the ones originating the pain.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Throughout Joanne's essay, she frequently represents herself as taking a defiant, free, speechy stand against.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Accusations and threats from trans activists.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
The trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And in her subsequent tweets, she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
This is the new Salem.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Women are being attacked online for taking a stand against the transsexuals.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Let's see what else we have for sale at wildwomenworkshop.com.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Fuck your pronouns.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Trans men are my sisters.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Sorry about your dick, bro.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That's a good one.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I'd wear that.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Don't call me sis.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Must be really hard for you.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Not being a sh**.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
War is peace.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Freedom is slavery.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Ignorance is strength.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Trans women are women.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Got the sense of persecution.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
This is Orwell's nightmare.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
This is how Nazi Germany started.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
First Hitler told the transgenders they were super hecking valid, uwu.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Then he burned their books out.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Wait.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Oh, no.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
That's actually the opposite of what happened.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Slurs.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Feminist t-shirt.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Nice trilby.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's very dapper.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Slurs.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Man-hater.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Feminazi.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Prude.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Witch.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Bigot.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Wait, bigot?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Are we reclaiming bigot now?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Joanne wrote in her essay that she was standing up in solidarity with women who have histories like mine who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Slurred as bigots.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There's something so revealing about the claim that bigot is a slur because so much of indirect bigotry is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's good.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's very clever.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
A white racist will hardly ever use the phrase white supremacy.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
No, they say white genocide.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Always on the defensive.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The same conservative media who ten years ago were portraying lesbians as like angry, man-ish d***s have now created this mythology of lesbians as these virginal damsels in distress.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Who are threatened with invasion.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And now, extinction.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000
On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists, who are somehow coercing them into becoming men.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Elliot, no.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You can't possibly be doing this because you're 33 years old and capable of autonomous thought.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Clearly, you are tricked by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told, are slurring as bigots.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Lesbians who won't sleep with them.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Joanne claims that...

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
None of the gender-critical women I've talked to hates trans people.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
On the contrary.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Many of them become interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But the only gender-critical women she mentions by name are Maya Forstader, who I would not describe as hugely sympathetic to trans adults.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says...

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Okay, so I agree.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It would be awful to call someone a bigot just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But are you sure?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
That's why people call Magdalene Burns a bigot?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You are fucking blackface actors.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You aren't women.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Our oppression isn't a fetish.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You pathetic, sick fuck.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Hugely sympathetic.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Hugely sympathetic.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And because she constantly frames herself as the victim of terrifying trans activists who say mean things online,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I think it's fair for me to mention that this, right here, is how I'm used to being spoken to and spoken about by TERFs.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
When you're a trans woman online, TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
They deadname and misgender you.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
They mock your genitals.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
They describe your surgery results as necrotic and mutilated wounds.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000
They interpret your every feeling and experience as the manifestation of a sick, woman-hating fetish.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You know, in an unrelated video last year, I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And I've since been told by TERFs, essentially,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
trans-identified males get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Hugely sympathetic.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I hope I don't even need to say that the idea that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it is a violently anti-feminist thought.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And it's a thought that could only be believed, and believed in the name of feminism, no less,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:17.000
by people who have spent days and weeks absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda that TERFs exist to promote.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Now, I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room with me right now, she'd say,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I'm so sorry you've been treated that way.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But I, too, have been cruelly victimized online by the trans activists.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And you know what?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I'm sure that's true.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
When I listen to Joanne talk about being victimized by trans Twitter,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
it's easy for me to sympathize.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The vilification.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The obsession.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
The fantasies of violence.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It's a pretty common occurrence for me to look at my mentions and see people with trans flag avatars posting things like,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Point of view.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You are true, scum, and Yoshi is going to beat you to death with a golf club.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Hashtag yes, all gamers.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-Semite because three years ago I made a joke about reptilian overlords.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And then they get mad because I said I wanted to understand non-binary people instead of just dogmatically believing things.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And they conclude,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So basically, fuck ContraPoints, I want to bash her over the goddamn head with a metal bat over and over again.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So this is the level of antipathy that I attract from trans Twitter.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed by abusive messages, I'm inclined to believe her.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed with anime avatars saying things like,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
JK Rowling is hypocritical trash who literally walks millions of trans kids dead.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Harry Potter was always neoliberal garbage and we should have seen this coming.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy, she deserves a back end slapped to the face.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And tweets like that are abusive.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
It's not okay.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And I don't make any excuses for it.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I want to make a dark and stormy.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Sorry, I'll be right back.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I am back.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
It's good.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So I also think that there really is an element of misogyny to them.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I have to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying while holding a tropical drink.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This is not possible to deal with this through your face.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So I agree there really is an element of misogyny to this.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Misogyny is the most universal prejudice and trans people are not immune.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women regardless of whether their anger is justified.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
There is a witch hunt in Pulse that's still alive in our culture.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000
To be a famous woman is to constantly have every part of your body and soul subject to endless critique.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
You know, if you're one pound overweight, they call you a fatty.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
If you're one pound underweight, they say you have an eating disorder.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And if you're exactly the right way, they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.000
When you're a famous woman, it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters because the haters bring the obsession to you.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But it's important to remember that haters are not the same as bigots.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry unless it's tied to a history of oppression or a backlash against a movement of equality.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And no, David Silverman, the word racist is not like the N word.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Turf is not a slur.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse, but it's not a form of oppression.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And I say this as someone at this point most known for complaining about cancel culture.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Oh god, is this my legacy?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
A lot of trans people have been very mean, verbally abusive even, to J.K. Rowling.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
But most people criticizing Joanne, or criticizing me for that matter, might be hurt and angry.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
But they're not violent.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000
you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing crashing over you all at once.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent, they become emblematic of the way the whole experience feels.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And if you've been the victim of abuse before, the experience can be pretty triggering.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
So it's just not always as simple as the victim and the abuser.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Sometimes victims are also abusers.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Sometimes righteously angry people cross a line into abusive excess.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And not all abuse comes from a position of power.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Why are so many trans people on Twitter so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter as it does to TERFs.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
People living in unrecovered trauma often behave in very similar ways to the people who traumatize them.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Over and over, I have seen traumatized people refuse to hear or engage information that would alter their self-concepts,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
even in ways that could bring them more happiness and integrity.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal is rooted in a panic that their fragile self cannot bear interrogation,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Perhaps because supremacy in some produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
And of course, many perpetrators were or are victims themselves.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse at trans people,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
a vulnerable group who they can mostly get away with hurting.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Unlike standing up to powerful men, right, which would be dangerous and difficult.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And a lot of trans people have been very horribly treated by men,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
by TERFs, by strangers on the street, by their own families.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And for some of those trans people,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the one kind of power they have.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Plus a lot of extremely online trans people really don't have a strong sense of conviction in their own identity,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
which is why they need constant external validation to prop them up.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
They need to constantly be told that they're valid, that they really are the gender that they say they are.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.000
And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions their fragile self-concept,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
they lash out, Twitter being their only weapon.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay that all you're asking, all you want,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
is empathy and understanding.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
But trans people also deserve more empathy and understanding than you've given them.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts that are always raging against you

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
and raging against me for that matter.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
In between the raging, look at what they're doing.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
They're begging.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Begging for money to pay for healthcare.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Begging for money to pay for housing.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
or pounds, or gringots, or whatever you people have.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And trans people are out here literally begging for healthcare.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
They're begging, Joanne.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
How powerful could the trans agenda really be?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Joanne, you have so much power and influence many, many times more than what I have.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And I have much more power and influence than most trans people.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You know, I am in a very different situation than most trans people.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I have a lot of other things going for me in this world.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But a lot of them have nothing.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
They have nothing, Joanne.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And I just think you should take that into consideration

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
next time you decide to speak out about how trans activists are oppressing you.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Get it together, gorge.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Are you listening to yourself?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
What are you doing, Joanne?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life being rejected

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and humiliated and excluded over and over again.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So they're traumatized.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They're easily triggered by anything that reminds them of past betrayal and abandonment.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Which is something I think you could empathize with.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Joanne, you are famous for writing a book about a neglected and abused boy

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
who lives in a closet until he's whisked away to a magical world

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
where he and his freaky friends find acceptance in each other.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I remember when I first met you all.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
We stand a bunch of misfits.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
So many trans people have found comfort in this story

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
and an escape from a world that doesn't offer a lot of comfort to trans people.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So for you to use your fame and influence to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And I don't blame them for feeling that way.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I feel it too.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
So Joanne.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Jo.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Mother.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I know how much that sucks.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So if you ever want to take me up on it,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
But otherwise, I think we're done here.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
As a trans person, I like to believe in the power of human metamorphosis.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But I realize that at this point,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and constantly trashed by trans people.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So it would be pretty difficult to change tracks at this point.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and I don't know, Joanne.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Maybe you are one in a million.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
and that shit got me through fifth grade.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So who knows?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Maybe you have another miracle in you.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
But I'm too old to believe in magic now.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So I'm not going to sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Okay.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I guess that's it.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Mischief managed.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I think that's it.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
We'll see you next time.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Bye-bye.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Bye-bye.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Bye-bye.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Bye-bye.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Bye-bye.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Bye-bye.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Bye-bye.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Bye-bye.
