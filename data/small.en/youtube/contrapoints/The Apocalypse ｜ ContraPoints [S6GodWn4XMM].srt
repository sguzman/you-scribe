1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Bring me another bottle of moat, Tojo Antoine, apparently the world is ending.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, where is he?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful, it makes me want to throw up!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ugh, I'll get him myself.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Antoine?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There you are.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ugh, this is nerd again.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts, please?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll think about it. Have you watched my video yet?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one about the apocalypse?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, Marie, it's not about the apocalypse, it's about how to stop climate change.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, I can't stand that.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is extortion. You're sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
My god, you cucks will stop at nothing.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right, open wide.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, no, no.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Welcome to the lab, the lab of aesthetic climatology.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Imagine that this is the earth.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is what the earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In 1976, a beta cock named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness about the grave predictions of climate science.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It is half man, half bear, and half pig.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic attention-seeking alarmist, an issue-haver, a careabout, a sibilant, moral f***.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm super serial, you guys.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And in fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay, Why Are You So Angry? by Inuende Studios.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the angry jack effect.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It works like this.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're at a barbecue, shoving brisket into your front hole when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan because even if they're not really judging you, the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and evolution and people who don't eat meat while their bones fall out.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Besides, you're a hypocrite anyway because more animals die when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt, from the potential accusation that you're a bad person,

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's a fun ruiner criticizing our high-emission way of life, and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real, and Gore was right all along.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oopsie doopsie!

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So now it's current year and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average,

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now one degree doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale, consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average,

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century,

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees in order to avert global cataclysm.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the destruction of nearly every coral reef, and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees,

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and net zero emissions by 2050.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Otherwise, we're on track for three degrees of warming, and possibly even four or more,

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
a situation that could be near apocalypse.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Weather changes sometimes.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were just talking about the ice age.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
First it was cold.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now it's getting warmer.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just nature.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions is just an attack on the American way of life?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Another excuse for big government to take away my freedom.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What freedom? Are you an oil company?

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Isn't that what you liberals think?

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My identity is valid.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No it isn't.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bring me my smelling thoughts.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Watch the goddamn video.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Imagine the year is 2100.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want you to picture the earth as a human vagina, and imagine you're a gynecologist

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How does that make you feel, kids?

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I bet you wish your irresponsible gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right?

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Is there climate change yet? Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back?

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Probably, that's what I think. I believe it goes this way.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax aimed at undermining American manufacturing

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside, therefore whatever happened to global warming?

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Of course, the term global warming refers to the increase in the global average temperature,

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
temperature continuing to vary by region.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic conveyor belt is disrupted,

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know?

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual or scientific or true

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want on some sub-rational erotic level

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god-emperor.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Burn the scholars, build the wall.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy civilizations

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
plunge into primeval darkness, is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
found that 97% of papers published on the subject

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and the consensus has only increased over time.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe but is very common in America,

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that goes back to the early 1990s when the Western Fuels Association

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
developed a strategy to quote,

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
reposition global warming as theory, not fact,

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Climate denialists' talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe,

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as throwing a snowball to own the libs.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So here, Mr. President, catch this.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Denialists' talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information,

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
has received thousands of hate messages, death threats,

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
even white powder in the mail.

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's likely that this video will attract some deniers

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change.

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There isn't.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What if the sun is getting hotter?

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's not, at least in the relevant time frame.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And science is a liar sometimes.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But even if you don't believe in science,

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and caused by human activity.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In fact, at the behest of oil companies,

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and more severe tropical storms.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to, quote, future-proof the state,

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
despite the fact that many of its top politicians

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are public climate change deniers.

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You remember how it used to be called global warming?

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then magically the theory changed to climate change?

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sure.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The reason is it wasn't warming.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The science is clear.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Climate change is real, and humans are causing it.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If even ExxonMobil says it's real, it's probably real.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There's really no point in digging in your heels

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and refusing to look at the evidence just because you don't want it to be true.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
None of us want it to be true.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, fine.

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and maybe humans have something to do with it.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now, can you give me my smelling salts?

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Fine.

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Look, Doc, I've got to say, maybe the scientists are right.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe it is happening.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But to be honest with you, I'm having a hard time caring about this,

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
like, at all.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How can you not care about this?

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're talking about the future of the planet.

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I don't care about the planet.

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I care about me.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, don't you live on the planet?

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Now, goddamn it.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Watch the video.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If you picture the Earth as a watermelon,

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you can see there's the outer shell here that traps the red flesh.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers...

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The stalkers come for the red flesh.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Before describing the details of our doom,

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arhenius published a study

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
titled On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Earth,

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
was in fact rising,

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and President Bucken-Johnson's Science Advisory Committee

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels,

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but nothing was really done about it until 1988

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty,

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and that the warming was worsening heat waves, storms, and droughts.

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and its political and economic impacts,

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
so it started to seem like something was going to change.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
was up and running in the United States,

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades,

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called skeptic cause.

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The 2012 Republican Platform stated against all scientific consensus that

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
quote,

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then, finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama,

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
became parties to the Paris Agreement,

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
For the very next year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
on a platform of outright climate science denial.

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement,

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and released his America First Energy Plan,

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So it's with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the GRIM 2018 IPCC report,

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
which informs us that the world has already warmed 1 degrees Celsius,

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events,

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and to net zero carbon by 2050,

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise.

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But with the current political situation,

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach.

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
By the end of the century, we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
3 degrees of warming will flood many of the world's major coastal cities,

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong.

252
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference between early 20th century temperatures

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and the last ice age.

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity,

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.

257
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it's not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There are real human consequences to this.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
See? This is why you should care.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not just about the planet.

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's about the millions of people who are going to die or lose their homes.

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, jeez, wow.

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Gosh, that's really just too bad.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What kind of response is that?

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Look, Doc, people die all the time.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What am I supposed to do? Cry about it?

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, you're supposed to take political action.

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But this bath is very relaxing.

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, look, even if you only care about yourself,

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you do realize that when the coastal cities flood,

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you going to be okay with that?

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No!

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No!

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You do realize, right, that in a hundred years

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
everyone is going to look back on people like you

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and they're going to hate you so much

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for what you allowed to happen to this planet.

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, those are future people.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I am alive now.

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And besides, if what you're saying is true,

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
then this is basically the apocalypse anyway,

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right?

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But it's not the apocalypse, though.

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism,

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem.

291
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Please, God, please, just try to focus on solving the problem

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
while we still have time.

293
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So you're saying the world is ending.

294
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Cheers to that.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The world is not ending.

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's just getting shittier.

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

299
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
All right, let me just re-up here.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Ah.

301
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All right, Doc.

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Put it in me.

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You are repulsive.

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, I'm so sorry.

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're offended by pleasure.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not offended by what?

307
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This offends you, doesn't it?

308
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you triggered, liberal?

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Are you triggered?

310
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No.

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not triggered.

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Stop trying to pretend you're not owned.

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You know, you really shouldn't be supporting the dairy industry.

314
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They cause massive carbon emissions.

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, maybe you shouldn't be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite.

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What?

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's soy milk anyway, science nerd.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How do you think I got so feminine?

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's nothing in science to support that.

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just admit that you're offended.

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Please just watch the video.

322
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon,

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder,

324
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
where did they all come from, you know?

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What does this all mean?

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The cosmos, humanity, our little time here on Earth.

327
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And that's why I became a scientist,

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
so I could spend my life studying topospheric trace gases.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If you want to do your part to stop climate change,

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
there are some lifestyle changes you can make.

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can use LED light bulbs.

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can drive a hybrid or electric car.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can use public transportation.

334
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can try not to fly very often.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can eat less red meat.

336
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But the reality is, just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions,

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and the burden of stopping this can't really be placed on individual consumers.

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The companies themselves do not care.

339
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Left to their own devices, they will only pursue short-term profit.

340
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They will ask the government to build them sea walls,

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Climate change is exactly the kind of problem that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The timeframe involved is short enough that scientists can predict

344
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
total catastrophe in the foreseeable future,

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but just long enough not to enter into the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.

346
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So unless there's a drastic change in the next couple decades,

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
this is going to be capitalism's great Chinese famine moment,

348
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
only potentially it'll be much, much worse.

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is probably the most important issue facing humanity in the 21st century,

350
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,

351
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
beginning with rapid political change.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If that means direct action, it means direct action,

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
for instance organizing, participating in, or supporting a massive general strike.

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You also should demand that your politicians take a strong stance against climate change

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and the companies that cause it.

356
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And if you're American,

357
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
vote this monumental ding-dong out of the Oval Office in 2020

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
before the entire planet shrinks and transforms into a corn cob.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So let me get this straight.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You're basically asking me to completely change who I am as a person

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and become everything I hate.

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah, pretty much.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But it's not about what I want.

365
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's about what everyone has to do to preserve the survival of humanity.

366
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, electric cars.

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Veganism.

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Who could even afford that shit?

369
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne.

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I shall do no such thing.

371
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.

372
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.

373
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, eating plant-based meals actually costs less than eating meat.

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, okay.

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So just never again enjoy the morning aroma of bacon sizzling on the skillet,

376
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
barbecued ribs, fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops, bloody steaks.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ew.

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why do you want to eat all that murdered animal flesh anyway

379
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
when you could eat pure, clean, natural foods like lentils, barley, and sprouts?

380
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'd rather eat human shit

381
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
when that's what you're going to be eating if the planet hates another few degrees.

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels when there's Muslims out there?

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And Mexicans.

384
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
when all the climate science in the world just bounces off that thick skull of yours?

387
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So first of all, you people think everything is racist.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And second, I guess I just need a villain, you know?

389
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Who's the bad guy?

390
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Who am I afraid of?

391
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What's the other team?

392
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Your climate story has no antagonist.

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is that really what it's going to take?

394
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All right, then.

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why don't you take a long, hard look out at the sea?

396
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All right, Mama.

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's right.

398
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There she is.

399
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Now look right over there.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hello, mankind.

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It is I, your dark mother, the sea.

402
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And you, my children, have been an absolute disappointment.

403
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Every one of you is so pathetic.

404
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You make me want to throw up.

405
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Politicians, businessmen, and worst of all, environmentalists.

406
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ugh.

407
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The condescension of it all.

408
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You think you are capable of hurting me?

409
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Huh.

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I enjoy your so-called degradation.

411
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Your filthy air makes me hot.

412
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside.

413
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And when you spew your filth all over, oh, it only makes me fucking wet.

414
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Every year, my heaving bosom encroaches farther on your shores.

415
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And as I spat you out, my children, I will swallow you all.

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I will take every inch of you inside me.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I will suck you down into the deep black pit of my wetness, you scum.

418
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And why?

419
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I am a slut.

420
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
My progeny encompass the earth.

421
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And whatsoever I create, I shall destroy.

422
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
For I, your deep, dark mother, am at once deliverest of your doom.

423
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And that's why I vote Republican.

424
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You see that?

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We've got 20 years to stop her, or we're fucked.

426
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We're fucked.

427
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We're fucked.

428
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We're fucked.

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We're fucked.

430
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We're fucked.

431
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We're fucked.

432
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
We're fucked.

433
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're fucked.

434
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We're fucked.

435
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We're fucked.

436
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We're fucked.

437
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We're fucked.

438
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We're fucked.

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We're fucked.

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We're fucked.

441
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We're fucked.

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We're fucked.

443
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We're fucked.

444
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We're fucked.

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We're fucked.

446
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We're fucked.

447
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
We're fucked.

448
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We're fucked.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We're fucked.

450
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We're fucked.

451
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We're fucked.

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We're fucked.
