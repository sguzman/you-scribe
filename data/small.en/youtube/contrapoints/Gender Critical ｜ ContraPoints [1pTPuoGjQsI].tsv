0	7840	On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies
7840	10080	rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.
10080	11080	Thank you.
11080	13280	It breathed hoarsely.
13280	16640	Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.
16640	23800	I smirked and nodded and stood backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous knuckly,
23800	27160	hairy, brilliant paw that clutched it.
27160	31720	The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the
31720	39960	stubble was already burning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two
39960	45880	pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy
45880	51640	scarf dressed from a polished steel women's liberation emblem.
51640	54560	I should have said, you're a man.
54560	58160	The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.
58160	59160	Piss off.
67160	69160	Let's go, adult human females.
77560	82400	First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men
82400	85040	here today, get out.
85040	89640	I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in
89640	92280	which case like, comment, subscribe.
92280	97280	So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary
97280	98280	radical feminists.
98280	102480	You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men
102480	106400	are lost lesbian sisters.
106400	108760	You guys do know about trans men, right?
108760	111520	Male to female is not the only type of transgender person.
111520	119120	It's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned, people who were always,
119120	121520	people who identify.
121520	122520	TERFs don't like being called TERFs.
122520	125640	They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.
125640	130080	They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.
130080	134960	The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal
134960	139200	construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.
139200	143600	In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating
143600	147040	bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.
147040	150840	And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I
150840	152000	want to be balanced.
152000	156480	So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who
156480	159400	used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.
159400	163460	And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences
163460	167960	with men and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and
167960	172160	men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.
172160	175720	And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at
175720	179160	first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.
179160	182840	It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.
182840	186480	And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone
186480	187480	would feel that way.
187480	191240	So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.
191240	195460	And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with
195460	199820	gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue
199820	202700	conversation debate idea, marketplace expression discourse.
202700	205680	Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.
205680	210060	She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of germane greer.
210060	215580	And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling extra-biological.
215580	218140	And when the full moon shines, she speaks.
218140	220700	Ugh, this is agony.
221700	225700	I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.
225700	227700	Can you imagine?
227700	231940	Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure
231940	233700	she doesn't hate trans people.
233700	236700	She just has a few concerns.
236700	239740	You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore or you're accused
239740	240740	of transphobia.
240740	245540	We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we the public never got
245540	246980	a chance to debate.
246980	252140	We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are allowing biological males to run rampant
252140	257580	in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous
257580	260580	dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.
260580	263740	Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.
263740	265300	She goes on like that for hours.
265300	268660	It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.
268660	270660	Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?
270660	273940	Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?
273940	275420	Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?
275420	276940	Scholars remain divided.
276940	279980	It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.
279980	283500	You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face
283500	288500	consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.
288500	290060	It's PC Ron Amock.
290060	292380	It's a Hana catastrophe.
292380	296220	Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of
296220	297380	untreated sewage.
297380	300740	We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure.
300740	304380	We have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates
304380	308180	of family rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.
308180	312540	So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,
312540	314140	unambiguous slogans.
314140	315660	Trans women are women!
315660	316660	Which is true.
316660	317660	We are women.
317660	319420	But, ooh, that was a sinister but.
319420	320420	Watch out for that.
320420	323820	What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most
323820	327460	people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.
327460	331900	And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not trans feminism,
331900	335380	might wonder things like, how can you be a woman without the oppression experiences
335380	336380	of girlhood?
336380	341860	Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?
341860	347460	Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?
347460	350580	Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time, they're
350580	352420	just brandished as weapons against us.
352420	356540	You know, it's like when a man asks, if society is so sexist against women, then why is it
356540	360540	that men are 97% of combat fatalities, feminazis?
360540	365020	Like you could sit there for 3 hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal, but wouldn't
365020	367700	you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?
367700	371860	Because 9 times out of 10, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's
371860	374620	just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.
374620	376420	And the same goes for people telling me,
376420	380740	You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a
380740	381740	woman?
381740	383220	Could you define womanhood for me?
383220	386660	Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.
386780	390780	But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,
390780	395180	and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.
395180	399060	Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.
399060	403420	In this video, I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with
403420	407900	gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers
407900	409660	rather than dogmatic ones.
409660	414180	Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,
414180	418100	and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly.
418100	423100	So if I do fuck something up, well, just read me the filth on Twitter like you always do,
423100	424100	you little shits.
424100	425100	Love you!
425100	427940	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
429860	431940	Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?
431940	437300	We have 13 beautiful women on our show today, only the catch is that some of them are actually
437300	438300	men.
438300	439300	Oops, wrong channel.
440900	442220	Concern 1.
442220	443580	Gender Metaphysics.
443580	446900	There's no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.
446900	449140	There are no pink brains and blue brains.
449140	451820	Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.
451820	455220	This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.
455220	458700	Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to
458700	462780	put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.
462780	467380	Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?
467380	470620	I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.
470620	474780	I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine
474780	475780	habit.
475780	482460	As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between binary transgender identity
482460	486540	and cross-sex brain anatomy, but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female
486540	489060	brains and male bodies or anything like that.
489060	492900	Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like grey and
492900	498660	white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies, distinct anatomical structures
498660	500420	like penises and vaginas.
500420	503540	So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.
503540	507540	I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the
507540	511580	trans cult, in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man rather than as
511580	512940	always having been a woman.
512940	517500	But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile, I am not
517500	518820	real and not valid.
518820	524140	But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening whether
524140	527300	you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.
527300	529780	My view is well expressed by Catherine McKinnon.
529780	534020	I always thought, I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man, doesn't matter
534020	535340	to me.
535340	540140	Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,
540140	543900	as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.
543900	544900	Concern 2.
544900	546340	Gender stereotypes.
546340	548100	What do you mean you live as a woman?
548100	552460	You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly
552460	553460	voice?
553460	558060	Listen, sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.
558060	562780	Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.
562780	567140	No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same, rather, we're using
567140	572660	a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.
572660	576220	Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand why I'm
576220	580260	presenting in such a meticulously feminine way, like they think I'm wearing ombre lips
580260	584940	at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game, which I am, but also, if one person
584940	589140	calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day, so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti
589140	592700	at the wall in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.
592700	597580	I think butcher gender nonconforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyperfeminine trans women
597580	601620	because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle
601620	605860	since childhood against a society that's told them they have to be feminine.
605860	607740	And I completely sympathize with that.
607740	611660	I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.
611660	617060	But also, I've had to fight against the same society that told me I should really, really,
617060	618660	really not be this.
618660	622540	So I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.
622540	626420	Concern three, abolish gender.
626420	630540	But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,
630540	631900	not conforming to them.
631900	636060	Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.
636060	637060	Abolish gender?
637060	641780	Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give
641780	642780	it a try.
642780	644940	Solanus, be praised.
644940	646740	No nails, no makeup.
646740	649540	I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.
649540	650740	I did it, everyone.
650740	652260	I abolished gender.
652260	657260	Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier, so I should probably get rid of that.
657260	659260	How is she, though?
659260	661260	She's feeling a little genderless.
661260	665500	I guess the way I positioned my body is still gendered, and there's a gendered cadence to
665500	666500	my voice.
666580	670260	So what I'm going to do is just hold my hands up genderlessly and speak in a genderless
670260	671260	robot voice.
671260	674500	My name is 54-664-17.
674500	676700	I have no gender.
676700	677700	Patriarchy is over.
677700	680700	I guess English is still patriarchal language, right?
680700	683820	So I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.
683820	686060	Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.
686060	687060	I can't stand this.
687060	688060	Fuck this.
688060	690180	Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.
690180	694140	Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth didn't determine what kind of life
694140	695140	you could live?
695140	700420	And that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change, kind of like Abolish Borders.
700420	705100	Your utopian pipe dream is valid, and denying trans people their gender identity because
705100	710580	abolished gender is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because Abolish Borders.
710580	714460	Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable under the present system
714460	718260	and then leveraging that system against them under the pretense of abolishing it.
718260	722180	You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,
722220	724820	Why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?
724820	729180	You should be abolishing gender, not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.
729180	733140	No, they don't attack the gender expression of people with power and influence.
733140	737580	They're all on Twitter harassing some poor, newly out trans woman with 200 followers and
737580	741980	calling her a creepy man and mocking her for being feminine and ineptly or being too feminine
741980	743940	or not being feminine enough.
743940	748900	It's almost like when they say abolish gender, what they really mean is abolish trans people.
748900	752900	It's almost like this is a hate movement hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist
752900	753900	platitudes.
753900	756340	But surely, I must be missing something.
760340	764500	It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement that you think you can just
764500	768700	claim womanhood for yourself without living any of the struggle that entails.
768700	772260	So look, I'm a successful white, middle-class trans woman.
772260	775420	In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.
775420	779100	I may not be the one percent, but I am the tranny one percent.
779100	782860	So I don't like to complain about every little microaggression I experience because under
782860	786220	the circumstances, it just seems a little gauche.
786220	788780	And I don't like things that are gauche.
788780	792980	But I've had cis feminists of my race and class tell me that I have no idea what it's
792980	799140	like to be talked over and interrupted by men or to experience street harassment or
799140	804580	to have to treat every first date like a potentially life-threatening situation and it's just bizarre
804580	805820	to me that they think that.
805820	808380	Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?
808380	810340	You think men treat me as their equal?
810340	813820	You think street harassers are going to treat me with dignity and respect because I have
813820	814820	a Y chromosome?
814820	817460	Hey beautiful, where you going baby?
817460	818460	Where you going?
818460	819460	Oh it's tranny.
819460	824580	Excuse me sir, my mistake, please proceed freely to your destination.
824580	826540	Come on people, use your heads.
826540	829820	When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it, what do you think the guy in the
829820	831740	steps of the liquor store is going to say?
831740	835900	When a trans woman doesn't pass, it's not like society simply treats her like a man.
835900	841180	No, you get treated as monster gender, pronouns it and spit, and male privilege is not a good
841180	843380	description of that experience at all.
843380	848020	Once you start passing as a woman, it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,
848020	851340	because it's still better to be a she than an it.
851340	855540	Now gender-critical feminists are really skeptical of the whole notion of passing, they think
855540	858940	they can always clock a tran, and they assume everyone else can too.
858940	863620	But that's just not reality, I mean I'm only a year and a half into my transition,
863620	867740	and at this point I've had zero surgeries, and it's been like six months since I was
867740	869260	last misgendered offline.
869260	873180	I mean a person with a good eye for it will probably clock me, and maybe a lot of people
873180	877380	have just been indoctrinated into politically correct gender ideology, but like, you really
877380	881420	think the gas station attendant and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy
881420	885700	are all calling me Miss and Ma'am because of post-modernism?
885700	889180	I know some of you are gonna sneak off to your shitty little rad femme forums and obsess
889180	893860	over how manly and cloggable I am, but like, at the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?
893860	899780	The deranged hateposting of 25 frothing anons, or every social interaction I've had for months?
899780	902260	I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.
902260	904700	I'm Ahi Tuna, and you're a mackerel, sweaty.
904700	906700	Take a fuckin' sip, babes.
906700	911700	I love that.
911700	913100	Concern 5.
913100	914100	Male Socialization.
914420	918540	So you had a male upbringing, you never experienced the traumas of girlhood, you benefited from
918540	921620	male privilege for decades, and now you think none of that matters?
921620	925420	You are who you are because of how you were socialized, not because of how you dress.
925420	931060	Alright, it's time to crack open the nuance.
931060	933020	So on the one hand, you're partially right.
933020	936620	I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled as a nine year old girl, or what that does
936620	937620	to a child's psyche.
937620	940860	That kind of thing didn't start happening to me till I was an adult, when I knew what
940860	944180	I was getting into and was ready for it, that's very different from what cis women
944180	945180	go through.
945180	949340	My upbringing in adolescence has more in common with a typical man than a typical woman, and
949340	954380	many of my experiences from those days I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.
954380	958900	I absolutely benefited from male privilege, and it did influence who I was, and who I
958900	963300	was in my late teens and early twenties was an anti-feminist shithead who had no idea
963300	964300	what women go through.
964300	968220	And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that, because in trans discourse it's just
968220	972540	accepted it's obvious that trans men know what it's like to be raised as women, and
972540	975380	to be influenced by those formative female experiences.
975380	978740	But when it comes to the early life experiences of trans women, we're supposed to say,
978740	982540	when I was five years old I loved wearing my mom's high heels, or else say nothing
982540	983540	at all.
983540	986880	There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath, where she describes the way living
986880	991620	as a woman stifles an adventurous spirit, and her longing for a male experience.
991620	998300	Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom
998300	1004260	regulars, to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.
1004260	1010980	All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl, a female, always supposedly in danger
1010980	1013060	of assault and battery.
1013060	1019220	My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce
1019220	1022100	them, or as an invitation to intimacy.
1022100	1026900	Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.
1026900	1033300	I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.
1033300	1038000	So I got to do all that in my early twenties, and what I discovered is, I hate sleeping
1038000	1043660	in open fields, I despise the west, and I'd really rather stay inside collecting ceramics
1043660	1044660	and sucking dick.
1044660	1047940	Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman, and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is
1047940	1052400	a man because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews for reasons that are inconceivable
1052400	1053400	to me.
1053400	1058060	What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties, I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,
1058060	1063020	body and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me, and I tried every possible alternative
1063020	1067340	to transitioning before realizing that I had an irrepressible need to become a woman.
1067340	1072300	So I changed, and when I changed, society's treatment of me changed.
1072300	1075380	Socialization doesn't end with childhood, it's a lifelong process.
1075380	1080340	For example, when I transitioned, my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers, and radical
1080340	1085060	feminist haters started commenting on my physical appearance about twenty to thirty times more
1085060	1088860	often, and I had to get used to that being something that matters a lot more.
1088860	1094060	That said, resocialization takes time, and sometimes trans people who are early in transition
1094060	1095820	have most of that process ahead of them.
1095820	1099780	I also think we have to take into account the age at which a person transitions.
1099780	1101380	Kim Petras, who must we stan,
1101380	1102380	Oh we stan!
1102380	1103380	We stan!
1103380	1104380	I stan!
1104380	1105380	We stan!
1105380	1109020	She transitioned as a child, and I imagine was socialized more or less the same as a
1109020	1110020	cis woman.
1110020	1114780	Whereas Caitlyn Jenner humps, well, just humps.
1114780	1119100	She made millions of dollars in men's sports, she had six children by three wives, she transitioned
1119100	1123660	in retirement at age 65, and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman is
1123660	1126620	figuring out what to wear.
1126620	1130220	This is the only trans woman most people have heard of, it makes me want to cry.
1130220	1133700	Like I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman, but I am saying that anyone who wants
1133700	1137580	to argue that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective doesn't have a leg to stand
1137580	1138580	on.
1138580	1143420	But also, trans women often don't experience male socialization the way cis men do.
1143420	1147340	Many trans women are feminine and queer before they transition, and have always experienced
1147340	1150020	a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.
1150020	1154140	Some trans women also identified as women years before transitioning, and internalized
1154140	1158060	society's messaging about women more than society's messaging about men.
1158060	1162060	Now that's still not the same as living in society as a girl from birth, but it's also
1162060	1164980	pretty different from the socialization of most cis men.
1164980	1168980	I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue that trans women never experience
1168980	1174780	male privilege is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege as a proxy for calling us men.
1174780	1178180	Pull up your zipper, your male privilege is hanging out.
1178180	1182620	I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point for many gender-critical feminists
1182620	1187060	is that there's an element here of stolen valor, this sense of injustice that people
1187060	1190260	are claiming their identity without experiencing their oppression.
1190260	1194420	It reminds me of what in the trans community are called trans medicalists.
1194420	1198580	People who insist the only real trans people are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.
1198580	1204220	In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing that confirms your identity is pain.
1204220	1206620	What it is to be trans is to despise your body.
1206620	1210260	What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.
1210260	1212260	You didn't suffer like I've suffered.
1212260	1213820	You don't know what it's like.
1213820	1217140	You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying that you don't know what it's like
1217140	1221180	to occupy an identity so stigmatized that most of the people who are attracted to you
1221180	1224100	in private are too ashamed to admit it in public.
1224100	1227140	You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative that you're shut out
1227140	1228660	of whole areas of society.
1228660	1233260	I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest does nothing but to provoke
1233260	1237940	infighting between trans women and cis women at a time when we should be marching side-by-side
1237940	1241380	to destroy video games forever, hashtag Yes All Gamers.
1241380	1245540	Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.
1245540	1248860	You don't know what it's like to grow up being shamed for your periods, to fear
1248860	1254340	unwanted pregnancy, to have to fight for your right to abortion, to bear the pain of childbirth.
1254340	1257580	Well, yeah, that's true.
1257580	1260900	My inner rad femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.
1260900	1265020	I do think it's important for trans women to stand in solidarity with cis women on issues
1265020	1268940	like period equity and abortion rights, and to learn about the experiences of cis women
1268940	1271580	to form a more complete understanding of the female condition.
1271900	1276740	But of course, no individual woman experiences all the things women experience, and individual
1276740	1280220	women understand the meaning of womanhood in drastically different ways.
1280220	1283860	For some women, having babies is the most essentially womanly experience.
1283860	1286100	For others, maybe it's having an abortion.
1286100	1289980	I mean, not actually, but you know, TERFs pretended it is to own the trannies.
1289980	1294740	For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails in my business inbox from married men struggling
1294740	1298980	through the existential crisis of some kind of she-male-themed sexual awakening.
1298980	1302500	Also, do you want to be a guest on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?
1302500	1307380	But also, not all women experience their womanhood as essentially oppressive, or centered around
1307380	1309100	the pain of reproductive capacity.
1309100	1312580	When Shania Twain sang, Man, I Feel Like a Woman, she wasn't talking about having a
1312580	1316300	coat hanger abortion in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.
1316300	1319060	Man, I feel like shit.
1321060	1324460	Concern 7 Erasing Female Vocabulary
1324460	1328940	Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss women's bodies and women's
1328940	1329940	oppression.
1329940	1334100	We are now expected to talk about pregnant people and menstruators just to appease the
1334100	1335100	gender ideologues.
1335100	1338580	Well, I for one am not a menstruator.
1338580	1343860	I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.
1343860	1348900	Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people and are thinking, what
1348900	1352780	the fuck kind of Orwellian noose-beak gender cuckoldry is that?
1352780	1353780	Take a deep breath.
1353940	1354940	Clear your mind.
1354940	1355940	Here's the tea.
1355940	1359700	Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term pregnant people instead of
1359700	1360700	pregnant women.
1360700	1364980	And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators in a tweet about the repeal
1364980	1366420	of a tampon talks.
1366420	1370580	This has prompted some conservative, turf, and Christian publications to post panicked
1370580	1374100	commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.
1374100	1379140	But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman erases
1379140	1382700	trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.
1382740	1387540	So saying pregnant women in this context erases them, whereas saying pregnant people includes
1387540	1392620	them answers women and doesn't erase anyone, except for Cincinnatians, because we all know
1392620	1393620	they're not people.
1393620	1395220	Take your shitty chili elsewhere.
1395220	1397500	I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.
1397500	1401300	What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?
1401300	1406100	I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing, and the trans
1406100	1409180	men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.
1409180	1413660	Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable, and my
1413660	1417020	prediction is that menstruators is not going to work out.
1417020	1418260	Maybe people who menstruate?
1418260	1420100	But why can't I just say woman?
1420100	1422300	That's what I am.
1422300	1424100	You can't just say woman.
1424100	1425580	That is what you are.
1425580	1429500	No one is asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.
1429500	1433380	Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.
1433380	1438340	No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expected mothers.
1438340	1441180	Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.
1441180	1444060	I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.
1444060	1447780	I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.
1447780	1450460	Oh, I am definitely suggesting that.
1450460	1454500	But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss
1454500	1455620	our own bodies.
1455620	1460860	I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods, or wearing pussy hats
1460860	1464420	at political marches, or free bleeding all over the national mall.
1464420	1468140	I mean someone has to, the national mall is not going to bleed on itself.
1468140	1472380	I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy and
1472380	1476460	defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.
1476460	1480620	The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender
1480620	1483900	trans men or exclude wombs whom stuff not bleed.
1483900	1487580	I mean trans women do bleed, but only when we cut ourselves.
1487580	1493620	No one knows what it's like to be a satrian.
1493620	1496580	Concern 8.
1496580	1498500	Turf is a slur.
1498500	1501060	Turf is a slur designed to silence women.
1501060	1504900	Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.
1504900	1509820	The word turf is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,
1509820	1511140	but it's not a slur.
1511140	1515860	A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.
1515860	1520380	The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations, and is often used
1520380	1522580	as an insult, but it's not a slur.
1522580	1526060	It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.
1526060	1530620	The same is true of the word turf, it's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors
1530620	1532620	that deserve to be derogated.
1532620	1537940	The term gender critical is really a euphemism, recently created to replace turf with a phrase
1537940	1540380	that doesn't have such negative connotations.
1540380	1545020	It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist, which was invented by racists wanting
1545020	1548060	a more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.
1548060	1552500	I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence sitters, but
1552500	1557220	I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms, and I generally
1557220	1558780	do the same with turfs.
1558780	1564020	Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person, I usually like to call people by whatever
1564020	1568380	they want to be called, but when it comes to race realist or gender critical, every
1568380	1572540	time I use these phrases I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to
1572540	1573940	legitimize bigotry.
1573940	1579060	But I have especially little patience for turf requests for linguistic decorum, since
1579060	1585100	most of the language used by turfs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful, harmful,
1585100	1586780	and insulting to trans people.
1586780	1592060	For instance, turfs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.
1592060	1598380	They call trans women tims, an acronym for trans-identified males, and trans men tiffs,
1598380	1603100	trans-identified females, obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.
1603100	1607380	To give you a sample of typical turf prose, here are a couple comments from literally
1607380	1611700	the first thread I saw on the gender critical subreddit while I was working on this video.
1611700	1617540	And I have to admit to considering more contempt for the likes of s***, since he makes a point
1617540	1623420	of taking selfies with ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.
1623420	1628460	I also get a good love at tims putting their hands up to their shins, they're trying
1628460	1633620	to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple, but it only draws more attention to
1633620	1636020	their enormous man hands.
1636020	1641420	I saw an AGP photoshoot with his knee under fall and his fifties was closing with one
1641420	1646180	leg up like a flamingo, his hands dainty at his ear.
1646180	1654300	In every photo, even group ones at events, now I was just grossed out.
1654300	1656780	So there it is, that's what this is really about.
1656780	1660500	In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns and I've provided
1660500	1665140	responses I hope the average person will find fair, but I would be lying to you by omission
1665140	1669300	if I were to end this video without being real with you about what the core of the gender
1669300	1672260	critical movement is actually about.
1672260	1677060	See what turfs do in public is advance what, on the surface, are a series of feminist critiques
1677060	1678140	of trans people.
1678140	1682540	For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes
1682540	1683900	designed to oppress women.
1684060	1688100	At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present
1688100	1689100	themselves.
1689100	1693220	But in the next breath, these same turfs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine
1693220	1696780	perverts who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.
1696780	1701380	So if trans women being feminine is bad, and trans women being masculine is bad, then there
1701380	1705540	really is no way that trans women could behave that turfs would accept.
1705540	1710020	So in fact, what turfs really oppose is not trans women being feminine or trans women
1710020	1713580	being masculine, but trans women being trans women.
1713580	1719820	In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia, simple
1719820	1723180	animosity towards trans people's very existence.
1723180	1727220	And it's pretty easy to recognize that just from the tone they use when they talk about
1727220	1728220	us.
1728220	1731820	When you read through the gender critical subreddit or turf twitter, what you see is
1731820	1737780	just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes draped over a jagged thorn-tangle of visceral
1737780	1739780	disgust and targeted hate.
1739780	1744620	The pure exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Jermaine Greer quote
1744620	1748620	from the opening of this video or in the average gender critical forum post.
1748620	1754500	The enormous, snuckly, hairy, be-ringed paw, the pancake makeup through which the stubble
1754500	1760200	was already burgeoning, this Neanderthal in his fifties, ridiculous, insulting-to-women
1760200	1761700	facial expressions.
1761700	1764060	Now I was just grossed out.
1764060	1769740	What gender critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations
1769740	1773260	built on a foundation of pure disgust.
1773260	1775820	In this respect, it's just like homophobia.
1775820	1779540	You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate, and
1779540	1784300	the arguments people made that marriage was under attack, that the children would be traumatized,
1784300	1788820	that bestiality would be next, that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions
1788820	1792540	with their outrageous demands, it was all just nonsense.
1792540	1797260	If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do, Sylvia I wish I could give
1797260	1801420	you what I had, he would just blurt out the truth, which was that the sight of two grown
1801420	1805100	men locking lips made him want to vomit.
1805100	1808220	Comophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.
1808220	1811180	They come from the lizard brain disgust response.
1811180	1817300	We evolved to deal with blood, infection, vomit, feces, flies, the hairy paw, the stubble
1817300	1820060	burgeoning through the pancake makeup, bleh.
1820060	1824900	It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance, because it's the same disgust I felt toward
1824900	1826980	myself for years.
1826980	1831500	It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five
1831500	1836260	years ago and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.
1836260	1839620	It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.
1839620	1844820	It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia, because transphobia is always
1844820	1845820	the same.
1845820	1849860	It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of
1849860	1850860	ways.
1850860	1855220	I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops, where a police
1855220	1859380	officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.
1859380	1864260	The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her, deadnames her, mocks her
1864260	1866580	clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.
1866580	1871900	It's also repetitive and familiar, it's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in
1871900	1877580	the right-wing press on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all
1877580	1878580	the same.
1878580	1882820	What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair is her unbreakable wit and confidence in
1882820	1884660	the face of transphobic abuse.
1884660	1888980	The single most iconic moment is when, after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid
1888980	1893340	a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering, she glances back at the cop and says,
1893340	1895340	Excuse my beauty.
1895340	1896340	Excuse your beauty.
1896340	1897340	Okay.
1897340	1903180	That right there is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture, the resilience of
1903180	1908580	trans women, the assumption of a regal posture, and even the most abject conditions.
1908580	1913380	And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out
1913380	1914380	of bigotry.
1914380	1920420	So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this, what else can I say except,
1920420	1924420	on behalf of all trans women, excuse my beauty, TERF.
1927340	1928340	Thank you very much.

1966340	1967340	We'll see you later.
1967340	1968340	Don't laugh.
1968340	1969340	Please do it.

1992860	1994460	My chromosomes need to unwind
1994460	1996880	after a hard day of heating trans people.
