00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
...

00:04.140 --> 00:06.140
...

00:36.140 --> 00:47.740
One, hello darkness, hello children, it is I, the darkness within.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.020
So you know how life is like kind of bad?

00:52.020 --> 00:53.340
Well what are you going to do about that?

00:53.340 --> 00:55.700
I mean there's a few things you can do.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.980
First you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.

00:59.980 --> 01:05.500
That's probably the most effective approach eventually but the problem is that it's hard

01:05.500 --> 01:11.820
and I don't like things that are hard because when you do things that are hard you have

01:11.820 --> 01:17.300
to feel bad now so that you can feel good later and I don't want to feel good later.

01:17.300 --> 01:22.620
I want to feel good now and if you want to feel good now well you have a couple options.

01:22.620 --> 01:28.500
The first is of course to do drugs and I've tried that I spent most of my 20s on the threshold

01:28.500 --> 01:33.500
of alcoholism but it turns out that's not a cute look for me it's not my vibe so what

01:33.500 --> 01:38.340
I do now when I feel the darkness coming is what any respectable woman would do.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.580
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

01:42.580 --> 01:47.740
Is it a pee under my mattress your majesty or is it another Xanax I left under the throat

01:47.740 --> 01:48.740
rug?

01:48.740 --> 01:52.660
Now the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off you feel bad again.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.540
In fact you probably feel worse.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.660
So where do we go from here?

01:57.660 --> 01:59.460
Well how about music?

01:59.940 --> 02:05.420
When you feel bad you want to listen to sad music because sad music makes you cry.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.900
And crying feels good.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.620
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.140
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?

02:14.140 --> 02:16.860
The sound of silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

02:16.860 --> 02:17.860
You know.

02:17.860 --> 02:21.180
I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.700
Hello darkness my old friend.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.460
But in the memes you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.940
You only hear hello darkness my old friend.

02:30.940 --> 02:35.220
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song which is good because if you're making

02:35.220 --> 02:41.020
songs for sad people it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

02:41.020 --> 02:44.020
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

02:44.020 --> 02:48.960
When you're sad happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.680
There were 10 seconds into the song, hello darkness my old friend, the key is D sharp

02:53.680 --> 02:54.680
minor.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.200
The saddest of all keys.

02:56.200 --> 03:01.440
But when we get to the next line, because of vision softly creeping, something happens.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.440
Let's listen.

03:02.440 --> 03:10.800
Come to talk with you again Because of vision softly creeping

03:10.800 --> 03:12.280
Ah!

03:12.280 --> 03:13.600
What was that?

03:13.600 --> 03:19.200
Suddenly a major chord, an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds, and every

03:19.200 --> 03:24.560
peach fuzz hair on the back of my biologically female Nax stands on end.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.560
Hello light.

03:25.560 --> 03:31.040
So the song has enticed me with its promise of company for misery and then it has tricked

03:31.040 --> 03:32.600
me into feeling good.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.660
And that's what I like about art.

03:34.660 --> 03:39.360
It takes the standard disappointments and humiliations of life and cooks them into something

03:39.360 --> 03:41.160
worth getting off the floor for.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.560
Unfortunately I don't really play music much anymore because my hands are too beautiful

03:45.560 --> 03:48.360
for instruments and my singing voice sounds like a man.

03:48.360 --> 03:53.320
So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
Comedy.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.840
And I especially like dark comedy.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.560
You know, comedy about the things in life that are the most painful.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.480
To me, Dark Hammer is kind of like a sad song.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.840
It takes your worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twists them into a source of

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
pleasure.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.560
Don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

04:11.560 --> 04:12.560
Ah!

04:12.560 --> 04:16.680
A lot of the time that means joking about topics that an ordinary life are considered

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
taboo.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.960
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.200
Without the ability to joke and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing, substance

04:26.200 --> 04:30.920
abuse, gender dysphoria, I mean I'd probably be on the floor right now looking for that

04:30.920 --> 04:31.920
Xanax.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.880
But this puts me in a difficult situation because I want to defend my sense of humor

04:35.880 --> 04:39.920
which I feel is like the core of my personality and what keeps me alive.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.920
But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture who are really

04:43.920 --> 04:51.320
big on defending provocative, controversial, politically incorrect comedy are kind of umâ€¦

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
dick nuggets?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.720
Let's discuss this.

04:53.720 --> 04:58.360
And by discuss, I mean use it quietly and I'll tell you what to think.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.440
2.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.440
Dick Nuggets

05:00.440 --> 05:05.840
So the year 2016 had just begun and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.320
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian, was ranting on Twitter for days

05:11.320 --> 05:15.840
and days about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.360
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais, a man whose personal branding screams,

05:19.360 --> 05:25.160
I don't care about your feelings, I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs,

05:25.160 --> 05:29.360
I am too much of a badass rebel to care what minorities think.

05:29.680 --> 05:36.120
But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass, irreverent, not caring about

05:36.120 --> 05:38.520
your feelings kind of month.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
Why?

05:39.520 --> 05:44.320
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes

05:44.320 --> 05:46.400
about ol' Tranma, Caitlyn Jenner.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.960
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight, I've changed.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.360
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.200
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.920
Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist, ooh.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.520
I mean I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage, but honestly the joke wasn't

06:05.520 --> 06:09.720
even as transphobic as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.480
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it, and Ricky spent the rest

06:14.480 --> 06:18.600
of the month tweeting about how offending people is good actually, and he definitely

06:18.600 --> 06:20.680
doesn't care that people were offended.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.200
But clearly, Twitter got to him, because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

06:25.200 --> 06:31.120
with a 13 minute bit rehashing the incident, and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
jokes.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.200
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

06:34.200 --> 06:41.880
Well, I am a chimp, if I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp, pre-op, but um, and don't ever

06:41.880 --> 06:47.240
deadname me, don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again, from now on you call me Bobo.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.880
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

06:49.880 --> 06:55.120
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage in a $20 million comedy special?

06:55.120 --> 06:59.760
My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passe and overdone, it also

06:59.760 --> 07:04.360
doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe that trans women are delusional men,

07:04.360 --> 07:07.040
and even then, it's just not very funny.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.120
But am I offended by the joke?

07:09.120 --> 07:14.960
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny, and as a great

07:14.960 --> 07:20.520
comedian named Ricky Gervais once said, to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,

07:20.520 --> 07:23.000
badly delivered, and not funny enough.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.400
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.200
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.440
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle it seems like

07:35.440 --> 07:38.280
our culture repeats about once a week.

07:38.280 --> 07:42.740
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke, and other people are indignant

07:42.740 --> 07:44.920
about the fact that those people are offended.

07:44.920 --> 07:49.000
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle in a culture war that's supposedly going

07:49.000 --> 07:54.840
on between generation snowflake easily triggered humorless peasy cucks and badass edgy nothing

07:54.840 --> 07:56.760
off limits free speech truth tellers.

07:56.760 --> 08:02.600
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides, then I am a double agent because

08:02.600 --> 08:07.680
I'm a generation snowflake peasy cuck who loves dank edgy memes, and I've found myself

08:07.680 --> 08:11.460
on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.

08:11.460 --> 08:15.360
So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian for some shitty trans

08:15.360 --> 08:19.360
joke, my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

08:19.360 --> 08:24.240
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.640
And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living, I

08:28.640 --> 08:35.920
appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

08:35.920 --> 08:40.480
while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.280
So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles and

08:45.280 --> 08:49.800
try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.480
What is the purpose of comedy?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.720
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

08:53.720 --> 08:56.840
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

08:56.840 --> 08:59.800
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

08:59.800 --> 09:04.560
Is it, as Aristotle said, the imitation of worse than average men?

09:04.560 --> 09:08.240
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?

09:08.240 --> 09:10.760
Well I don't think there's a single objective answer.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.040
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.200
But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.560
And by we, again, I do mean me.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.200
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouth shut.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200
3.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
Straw men.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.840
So as a trans woman up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes

09:29.840 --> 09:34.040
are funny, a lot of haters and losers out there are probably going to try to straw

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
man me.

09:35.040 --> 09:39.640
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

09:40.360 --> 09:44.360
Since people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.240
Here's the straw person's assholes.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.320
Straw person one.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.560
You hate free speech and are trying to silence comedians.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.680
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

09:54.680 --> 10:00.200
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage and I can say whatever I want about them.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.360
Straw person two.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.520
You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.

10:04.520 --> 10:10.720
I transitioned on YouTube making controversial political content all the while and I read

10:10.720 --> 10:11.840
the comments.

10:11.840 --> 10:16.240
My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

10:16.240 --> 10:21.120
Of course I do not have the internalized self-loathing that has damaged my psyche irreparably, but

10:21.120 --> 10:23.000
sweetie, who doesn't?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.400
Straw person three.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.520
You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.960
I invented joking about trans people.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.520
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
I'm that tran.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
That's right.

10:34.520 --> 10:40.080
If I die tomorrow, my legacy will be that I applied wine tasting terminology to fellatio

10:40.080 --> 10:42.240
and I accept my destiny.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.400
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.440
I live for trans jokes.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.240
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them because they don't know enough

10:51.240 --> 10:53.840
about trans people to know what the funny things are.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.280
And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.680
Like you used to live as one gender and then you became a different gender.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.880
Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.840
But humor is in the details.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.680
And Ricky Gervais does not know the details because he's clearly never been close to

11:10.680 --> 11:14.880
a trans person and that's why he's still telling these Tinkertoy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner

11:14.880 --> 11:15.880
jokes.

11:15.880 --> 11:16.880
And it's too bad.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.320
Because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
stuff too.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.880
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline calling her hormones titty skittles.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.680
No, I like the edgy stuff.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.280
I like being on the edge.

11:28.280 --> 11:32.280
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.

11:32.280 --> 11:36.840
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy that I'd like to share with you because

11:36.840 --> 11:41.640
when you're doing art criticism it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

11:41.640 --> 11:46.400
And the exemplary work I have in mind is one not a lot of people are talking about yet

11:46.400 --> 11:51.120
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company as the works of Dante or Swift.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.840
I am of course referring to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.200
If you don't know who Gigi is, first of all who even are you, do you have no respect

11:59.200 --> 12:00.200
for legends?

12:00.200 --> 12:05.180
She's a trans YouTuber like the trans YouTuber whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

12:05.180 --> 12:09.800
and I had sex with a dog long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.320
But in this critic's opinion, the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt the

12:15.320 --> 12:18.720
singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.040
Let's do a close reading.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.040
4.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.640
Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience

12:22.640 --> 12:26.200
A great work of literature is never just a text.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.320
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson would call a moment within

12:31.320 --> 12:33.640
an intertextual dialectic.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.640
Love that.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.920
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience within its proper context.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.400
Several months earlier Gigi had released a video about how she and her girlfriend were

12:42.400 --> 12:47.760
trying to have a child so far without success and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

12:47.760 --> 12:52.120
Apparently Gigi was not aware that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile

12:52.120 --> 12:55.960
which girl they tell you like seven times before you start hormones.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.960
Like how?

12:56.960 --> 12:58.160
We'll move past it.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.360
A few months later the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone

13:02.360 --> 13:06.520
cause that's right I clicked the bell and immediately I knew I was about to experience

13:06.520 --> 13:07.600
something special.

13:07.600 --> 13:11.960
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater than anything I've ever conceived of that

13:11.960 --> 13:15.920
honestly it makes me feel like a failure both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

13:15.920 --> 13:21.160
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature, the eyes are dotted with hearts

13:21.160 --> 13:23.080
and her facial expression.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.080
Ew.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.080
Come.

13:25.080 --> 13:29.920
The video begins with Gigi explaining that in order to produce a sample for the clinic

13:29.920 --> 13:32.640
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

13:32.640 --> 13:37.400
So I hesitantly agreed I was like fine I will stop all of my hormones so you know my shit

13:37.400 --> 13:40.520
can get juicy again and I can get a good little sample up in here.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.760
The sperm bank day arrives she goes to the clinic and approaches the receptionist.

13:44.800 --> 13:52.360
And I said yes ma'am I am here to give sperm from me to be frozen now.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.680
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room which she describes with the precision

13:56.680 --> 13:58.160
of mama Flaubert.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.040
I walk into this room fluorescent lighting the house.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.120
I was like I can see every pore in my arm like Jesus what do they want me to do here?

14:05.120 --> 14:10.160
And then the kicker this like leather couch the back is kind of like angled so I guess

14:10.160 --> 14:13.000
like you can lean and really get into it or something.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.400
The doctor offers her lubrication pornography if needed and a donation cup Gigi closes the

14:18.400 --> 14:20.000
door and gets to work.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.280
I get in the mood I get in the zone and I'm killing it bitch I am like I'm going to give

14:24.280 --> 14:29.000
the best sample ever my kid is going to be a godsend child before I know it the moment

14:29.000 --> 14:34.960
has crept up on me it happened and it's been so long that it hits the wall behind me.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.920
And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgias gets up off the leather couch

14:40.000 --> 14:45.360
and attempts to scrape a prodigious quantity of Gigi Gism off the wall of a fluorescent

14:45.360 --> 14:49.400
lit exam room in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.000
And I took the cup and I was like full on like scraping it off the wall because I was

14:53.000 --> 14:56.200
like I'm not going to let any little drop go to waste you know I'm here this is like

14:56.200 --> 14:57.200
my moment.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.240
I'm trying to understand why this video makes me laugh so much it's really the contrast

15:01.240 --> 15:06.160
of style and substance like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person told this story

15:06.320 --> 15:11.000
It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine storytelling style and this real housewives

15:11.000 --> 15:17.160
diction but the story itself is about blasting a giant load onto a wall of a room full of

15:17.160 --> 15:18.720
leather and pornography.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.720
The dissonance between form and content is genius and that dissonance perfectly captures

15:23.720 --> 15:28.640
the absurdity of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness that Ricky Gervais could

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
only dream of.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.800
I also really relate to this story because right before I started Hormones I decided

15:33.800 --> 15:38.800
to freeze a sample of my own so I too have a sperm bank experience.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.360
And it was exactly like Gigi describes down to every detail.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.440
It is not a dignified moment ladies there is just no way to feel like a woman while

15:46.440 --> 15:51.160
you're hastily rubbing one out in an over lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.160
I feel so fish right now.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.760
For this five minutes in the exam room I was a man.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.720
Now I somehow managed to get most of my sample into the cup but there's a different absurd

16:00.720 --> 16:02.080
detail to my story.

16:02.080 --> 16:06.560
The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork that I was depositing because

16:06.560 --> 16:10.800
I was going to start feminizing hormones and he asked me if there was a name I preferred

16:10.800 --> 16:11.800
he called me.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.680
In retrospect he was actually really sweet and really cute.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.800
Not that anything was going to come of that at the time since I was pretty everything

16:17.800 --> 16:19.440
and rough around the edges.

16:19.440 --> 16:23.360
To be honest I was all edges but he asked me for my preferred name and I just blurted

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
out Natalie.

16:24.360 --> 16:29.000
And so this was actually the first time anyone ever called me by my biological name and it

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
went like this.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.840
The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me and said right this way Natalie here's

16:34.840 --> 16:36.800
a cup for you to bust a nut in.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.840
And that's how my life as a woman began.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.760
Now in the end Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.440
Her sample wasn't usable.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.400
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA but she's been on hormones too long and she

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
just can't.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.800
And that revelation at the end of the video kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
story.

16:55.800 --> 17:00.360
In the ridiculous image of Gigi scraping a jackalit off the wall I now see this primal

17:00.360 --> 17:03.280
maternal urge to produce and protect children.

17:03.280 --> 17:07.360
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen prematurely from the nest.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.060
I see the virgin Mary cradling her child.

17:10.060 --> 17:14.160
I really really thought that I was going to have a good sample and I was going to be able

17:14.160 --> 17:18.640
to participate in having a baby with my DNA but it's just not in the cards for me.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.320
And I really wanted to make this video more positive and funny because there is nothing

17:22.320 --> 17:23.320
I can do.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.240
And that's exactly it.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.320
That is the darkness.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.320
5.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.600
The darkness.

17:29.600 --> 17:34.320
The darkness is my name for what I consider the highest form of comedy where you take

17:34.320 --> 17:39.680
your own worst feelings, traumas and anxieties and twist them into a source of pleasure.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.680
The darkness is Richard Pryor running down the street in flames because he set himself

17:43.680 --> 17:45.920
on fire in a coke field psychosis.

17:45.920 --> 17:50.480
The darkness is Gigi gorgeous scraping her own prodigious jism off the wall of an exam

17:50.480 --> 17:53.380
room in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

17:53.380 --> 17:57.140
If you can make these low points funny then you're going to be okay.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.260
You're going to survive.

17:58.260 --> 17:59.740
You're going to make it through life.

17:59.740 --> 18:04.860
And I need that now more than ever because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty

18:04.860 --> 18:05.860
dark.

18:05.860 --> 18:09.820
But trans people make it through because we're good humored and strong as fuck.

18:09.820 --> 18:13.780
Pretty soon I'm going to have to stop hormones before an operation and I'm terrified of

18:13.780 --> 18:14.780
that.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.780
What's going to happen to me when I stop hormones?

18:15.780 --> 18:17.260
Am I going to become a man again?

18:17.260 --> 18:19.100
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.820
I am thinking about names though like maybe Nathan or Jaden.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.660
I can see myself as a Jaden.

18:24.660 --> 18:28.300
See I've got to have my little jokey jokes or I don't think I can make it through this.

18:28.300 --> 18:33.460
Like when I have bottom surgery I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as my sex

18:33.460 --> 18:36.240
change operation because it makes me laugh.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.440
It brings me joy.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.980
Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.

18:40.980 --> 18:44.940
Now it's important to notice that just because it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean it's

18:44.940 --> 18:47.140
a politically correct euphemism.

18:47.140 --> 18:51.740
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change because you're literally

18:51.740 --> 18:53.100
not changing your sex.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.740
That's not what surgery does.

18:54.740 --> 19:00.220
But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness where they mistake edginess for

19:00.220 --> 19:04.460
honesty, accuracy, and directness but these are very different things.

19:04.460 --> 19:09.340
For example, George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms that has some great moments

19:09.340 --> 19:12.340
but also some moments that are way off base.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.180
For example, content warning ableist slur.

19:15.180 --> 19:20.620
They say they're going to preboard those passengers in need of special assistance.

19:20.620 --> 19:30.140
So look, I understand the aesthetic preference for simple, honest, direct language and the

19:30.140 --> 19:33.020
repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.

19:33.020 --> 19:35.460
That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

19:35.460 --> 19:39.260
But the word he just used is literally a slur so I wonder if what you're being honest

19:39.260 --> 19:42.140
about is your feelings toward disabled people.

19:42.140 --> 19:46.620
Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance is a little wordy sure but in this

19:46.620 --> 19:51.180
situation it's actually more accurate since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,

19:51.180 --> 19:53.100
anyone in need of assistance boarding.

19:53.100 --> 19:57.540
So I call my gender confirmation surgery getting a sex change not because it's more direct

19:57.540 --> 20:03.380
and honest but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated and that makes me laugh.

20:03.380 --> 20:07.020
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller but because I'm a bad person.

20:07.020 --> 20:11.860
And I get to call it my sex change operation but cis people don't get to call it that

20:11.860 --> 20:15.140
because it's my darkness not yours.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.140
Get your own darkness.

20:16.140 --> 20:20.060
When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people he's being a hack because he knows nothing

20:20.060 --> 20:21.060
of our darkness.

20:21.060 --> 20:25.020
And when someone tries to joke about something that they're totally ignorant of the result

20:25.020 --> 20:28.060
is usually clumsy, awkward and not very funny.

20:28.060 --> 20:33.140
What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness

20:33.140 --> 20:35.300
and turned it within.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.620
Because within is where the darkness lies.

20:38.620 --> 20:39.820
6.

20:39.820 --> 20:43.500
Self-deprecation Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite

20:43.500 --> 20:48.900
because as a lazy, selfish, preening, attention whore who looks like a slightly more passable

20:48.900 --> 20:53.580
and culture with the voice of a tropical bird there is a lot of material here to work with.

20:53.580 --> 20:58.500
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes there is a faction of the trans community

20:58.500 --> 21:02.380
that is not amused by the buffoonery that goes on on this channel.

21:02.380 --> 21:07.060
I think the objection to it is best summed up by the comic Hannah Gatsby who in her stand-up

21:07.060 --> 21:13.060
special Nanette said that when self-deprecation comes from someone who exists in the margins

21:13.060 --> 21:17.860
it's not humility, it's humiliation.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.660
And to be honest I felt a little called out by that.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.860
I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak.

21:26.860 --> 21:29.460
And she's not wrong like that is how this works.

21:29.460 --> 21:34.340
In order to gain an audience as a trans person you have to demonstrate what cis people call

21:34.340 --> 21:35.340
self-awareness.

21:35.340 --> 21:41.460
That is, you have to signal that you see yourself the way the audience sees you, which can mean

21:41.460 --> 21:44.340
looking at yourself with a pretty merciless gaze.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.740
And of course I'm happy to do that because I have no self-respect and laughter is the

21:48.740 --> 21:50.060
only way to numb the pain.

21:50.060 --> 21:54.760
But the terrible thing about being a not-normal with an audience is that you don't just get

21:54.760 --> 22:00.340
to be yourself because whether you like it or not people will see you as a representative

22:00.340 --> 22:03.260
of the community.

22:03.260 --> 22:07.540
So because of that responsibility which I never asked for I have to balance out the

22:07.540 --> 22:11.980
self-deprecation with a lot of positive messaging about my people.

22:11.980 --> 22:17.460
And that way the dark jokes function as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis

22:17.460 --> 22:18.780
go down.

22:18.780 --> 22:24.460
But even without the group representation issue it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation

22:24.460 --> 22:25.460
too far.

22:25.460 --> 22:30.900
As I've said I have been diagnosed with an incurable edginess of temperament and I sometimes

22:30.900 --> 22:35.560
do feel suffocated by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces even though those

22:35.560 --> 22:38.440
spaces are there for good reason and a lot of people need them.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.800
But sometimes this atmosphere of everything and everyone is valid all the time, no uncomfortable

22:43.800 --> 22:49.840
questions may be asked, any self-deprecation is a sign of traumatic internalized bigotry,

22:49.840 --> 22:54.000
I just need to get out of there for a while and find a place where I can relax and be

22:54.000 --> 22:55.300
my edgy self.

22:55.300 --> 23:00.360
I need a safe space for my edginess where I can just blurt out whatever stupid question

23:00.360 --> 23:04.400
or joke comes to mind without being afraid that I'm going to inflict horrible trauma

23:04.400 --> 23:05.920
on everyone around me.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.720
So I call up another transsexual edgelady, you know, Kiki, accuse each other of being

23:10.720 --> 23:13.720
cross-dressers and just laugh it all off.

23:13.720 --> 23:19.160
And it's so so cathartic to do that but it does have to be done in moderation because

23:19.160 --> 23:23.140
there can come a point where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.

23:23.140 --> 23:28.160
And it mostly has to be done in private because in public you have to worry about how cis

23:28.160 --> 23:33.120
people will interpret it and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating without

23:33.120 --> 23:35.080
abandoning all social responsibility.

23:35.080 --> 23:41.040
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that instantly deadens all laughter, it's social responsibility.

23:41.040 --> 23:45.100
But since it's kind of the central topic of the comedy culture war, I should probably

23:45.100 --> 23:49.760
say something about it, even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back to jabbering

23:49.760 --> 23:51.520
about my sex change.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
7.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.200
The eternal tension.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.120
So what is a comedian's job?

23:56.120 --> 23:57.720
What is a comedian supposed to do?

23:57.720 --> 24:02.960
I suppose my ideal comedian is one who is perfectly able to balance the tension between

24:02.960 --> 24:05.480
shitposting and snowflakery.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.880
And this is an eternal tension and must never be resolved.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.280
It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.

24:12.280 --> 24:18.760
See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery, you get a moralist who might say that a comedian's

24:18.760 --> 24:23.640
purpose is to promote justice by punching up, by speaking truth to power, by exposing

24:23.640 --> 24:25.920
the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.440
And these are all very admirable goals but they leave out what I think is the essential

24:30.440 --> 24:36.400
purpose of comedy, which is to be funny, to surprise, to shock, to make people laugh.

24:36.400 --> 24:40.280
It's kind of like how some art and media critics only ever evaluate a work based on

24:40.280 --> 24:44.640
whether or not it's socially progressive and don't seem to really think about aesthetic

24:44.640 --> 24:49.440
pleasure very much, which, to me, is the reason why art exists in the first place.

24:49.440 --> 24:54.160
But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent and should probably be sent to the

24:54.160 --> 24:55.160
guillotine at once.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.240
Just let me do my makeup first so that when they hold my head up, everyone can see my

24:58.240 --> 25:00.200
beat and their wings all fly to the Bastille.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.560
Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram because that's gonna get a lot

25:04.560 --> 25:06.000
of engagement.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.320
So the opposite of the pure snowflake is the pure shit poster, who might say that a comedian's

25:10.320 --> 25:13.680
purpose is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.

25:13.680 --> 25:18.400
But that seems kind of barbaric since, like, if a guard at a prison camp is torturing an

25:18.400 --> 25:22.280
inmate and the other guards are laughing, does that count as comedy?

25:22.280 --> 25:23.640
Is a war crime funny?

25:23.640 --> 25:28.160
Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.

25:28.160 --> 25:32.040
The thing is, I don't think many comedians actually believe in a completely nihilistic

25:32.040 --> 25:33.240
vision of comedy.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.680
I think they sometimes pretend to when they're trying to evade criticism.

25:36.680 --> 25:41.000
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics and listen to the way they talk about

25:41.000 --> 25:43.360
their heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

25:43.360 --> 25:48.440
There's always an element of admiration for bravery, risk, subversion, truth telling.

25:48.440 --> 25:52.680
In other words, there's a concern there for what is virtuous and what is true, not

25:52.680 --> 25:54.680
just for what makes people laugh.

25:54.680 --> 25:59.280
So maybe, before we can even talk about what's funny, we have to have a level of shared agreement

25:59.280 --> 26:01.600
about what is true and what is morally right.

26:01.600 --> 26:06.040
My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes is not just that they're not funny.

26:06.040 --> 26:10.720
I think he's wrong about trans people, and I think his ignorance is infectious.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.400
I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience, which has the consequence

26:15.400 --> 26:18.360
of making the world slightly scarier for people like me.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.160
And this is edginess at its worst.

26:21.160 --> 26:26.040
Just a privileged person with a platform punching down at a politically besieged group he understands

26:26.040 --> 26:27.040
nothing about.

26:27.040 --> 26:31.920
And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension collapses into pure shitposting.

26:31.920 --> 26:37.080
It's boring and immature, like when someone says he wants to watch the world burn.

26:37.080 --> 26:41.240
You only get to watch when you have the privilege of not being on fire.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.920
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

26:43.920 --> 26:48.840
The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.560
Edginess is always adolescent.

26:50.560 --> 26:55.040
The darkness is edginess, aged by time and pain.

26:55.040 --> 27:00.400
And it's only at that full maturity that comedy becomes art, that it becomes comparable to

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
music.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.600
So, those are my thoughts.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.400
Like comment and subscribe.

27:07.400 --> 27:11.200
The end.

27:11.200 --> 27:17.120
And I'll sing the song.

27:17.120 --> 27:21.000
I wish my brother George was here.

27:21.000 --> 27:37.160
Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly

27:37.160 --> 27:44.800
creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping.

27:44.800 --> 27:57.800
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains within the sound of silence.

27:57.800 --> 28:03.800
In restless dreams I walked alone.

28:03.800 --> 28:17.200
Narrow streets of cobblestone, beneath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar

28:17.200 --> 28:21.080
to the cold and damp.

28:21.080 --> 28:31.360
When my eyes were stopped by the flash of a neon light, I split the night and touched

28:31.360 --> 28:35.920
the sound of silence.

28:35.920 --> 28:48.000
And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
People talking without speaking.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.640
People hearing without listening.

28:57.640 --> 29:04.640
People writing songs that voices never share.

29:04.640 --> 29:17.080
No one dared disturb the sound of silence.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.440
Stay gorgeous.
