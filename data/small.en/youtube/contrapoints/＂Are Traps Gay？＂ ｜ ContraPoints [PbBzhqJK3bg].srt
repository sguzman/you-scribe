1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,640
Hello my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,600
to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,920
There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime,

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,720
so if that's going to make you sad, please don't watch this, unless you enjoy sadness.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,300
I know I do, but your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,320
you a wet pot of hot tea, and you can take it out in the balcony and pour it on some

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
pedestrians.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
That always cheers me up.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
One, traps.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,400
Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
research.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,000
Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
volumes ancient and modern in search of the answer to two fundamental questions.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,480
That are traps, and be they gay.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,240
With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,400
scholar known as the pedantic romantic, wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,920
to patrons of animated pictures from the aureate.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Curious.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,160
The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,680
forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one admiral

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japon-esks,

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,960
to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,920
The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth the daughter

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,400
of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
skulduggery.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,520
Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,800
transvestites, but transsexuals as well.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,760
And this must needs be remarked, for tis evident such persons oft times inflame the lust of

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,000
ordinary men.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,320
It is hence with respect to this phenomenon, I pose my second question thus, fellas, is

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
it gay?

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm sorry, who are you talking to?

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,560
Gentlemen of the academy.

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again?

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,360
It must needs be remarked.

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,880
Please stop breaking into my house.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,880
I shall be the queen of dairy.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm sure you will be.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,680
Cross-dresser, hi, I'm Natalie Nguyen, biological woman.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:16,000
Can we pan the camera down, my hair is less high?

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Are traps gay?

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
The meme, that will not die.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,080
Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male cross-dresser

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,680
or a trans woman, especially in a context of neotenist kawaii decadence.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,600
The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men attracted

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,600
to dick girls, foodnari, MTFs, you know a lot of these men don't know or care about

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,320
the difference between a trans woman and a cross-dresser, so it's kind of pointless

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
to get hung up on that.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,560
The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago when someone released the worst specimens

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,920
of the white race into the wild.

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,400
All traps gay, one of life's most important questions, are traps gay.

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:09,920
To the men who meme about this topic, it's all lighthearted fun, it's part of a wider

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,000
game they like to play called is it gay, you know, is it gay to have an MMF3 sum, only if

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,360
the balls touch, don't cross the streams, and so on, but to many trans women, the meme

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,600
and the word trap itself are highly offensive.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,040
In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans

58
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,160
people on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this topic is just too harmful to

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
even discuss.

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
So here's the challenge I face making this video.

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
On the one hand, there's people who are going to be upset and offended that I'm making

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,400
a video about this topic at all, and on the other hand, there are people who think this

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,120
is all just harmless otaku shitposting and who are going to be annoyed by my trigger

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
warnings.

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,200
But first, to the people who think it's too offensive, here's what I have to say for

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
myself.

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,680
I just believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where they're

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
at.

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,400
And in this case, are traps gay is where people are at.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,080
At one of my YouTube meetups, I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,840
some of his male students joking in the hallway about are traps gay.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,760
When those teenage boys go home and Google are traps gay, who do you want to explain

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
it to them?

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,680
Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
Dankula, or this Tran.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,240
And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,160
You know, as trans women, we have little influence in society.

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,760
The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are.

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,200
So we're like a jogger racing against a car.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,000
The only way to win is to hijack the car.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,520
And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
about us.

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,920
As always, my aspiration is to drive a woke conclusion from edgy premises to shitpost

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,800
my way to the moral high ground.

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,320
Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking just more politically correct cuckoldry

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120
designed to take away your free speech?

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,280
Well, I assure you, there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel.

88
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,640
Unless you clock my makeup, dickbag!

89
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Comment!

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Deleted!

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
But if you want to know why trans women are offended by are traps gay, I'm happy to

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
tell you.

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,080
Not to silence you, of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that seems harmless

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
to you.

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,560
So, well, let's put it this way.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
2.

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Trans Panic

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,160
The 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx gay and

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s.

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Extravaganza who describes

102
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
her precarious existence as a sex worker.

103
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,560
I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties until he touched me down there.

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
He felt it and he seen it and he like totally flipped out and he said, you fucking faggot.

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
You're a freak.

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
You're a victim of AIDS and you're trying to give me AIDS.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
What are you, crazy?

108
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
You're a homo.

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I should kill you.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,760
And like, I was really terrified so I just jumped out the window.

111
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,240
During the filming of Paris Is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,640
Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.

113
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,300
Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully

114
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,020
high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.

115
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,260
The men who murdered trans women often claim they were provoked to violence by the alleged

116
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,100
deception of their victims.

117
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,620
This is what's called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,060
of the killers of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.

119
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,140
One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried, I can't

120
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,100
be fucking gay, before beating her to death.

121
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,140
Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don't want to

122
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,460
get murdered, then they shouldn't trick men.

123
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,940
But what you have to understand is first, men usually do know when they're having sex

124
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,580
with a trans woman, like if you have a dick, it's pretty hard actually to have sex with

125
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,220
someone and have them not notice it, and second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence

126
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,180
as itself a kind of trickery.

127
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,780
A black trans woman named Elan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,340
friends had mocked him for flirting with her.

129
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,660
All she did to provoke him was walk down the street with two friends.

130
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,220
The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive

131
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,700
of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight.

132
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,520
But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,380
class and race experience some version of.

134
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,420
Because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation

135
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,860
to a proboscis.

136
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,980
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at

137
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,460
a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans and then punched

138
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
her.

139
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,460
Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home?

140
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,940
For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our

141
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
freedom.

142
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,380
There's bars I won't go into, because I don't trust the clientele to side with me if some

143
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,860
shit like that goes down.

144
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,020
And I've had little scares, I was in the back of an Uber once, and the driver comes

145
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,620
on a little flirty, you know, what's your name, are you a student?

146
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,460
And I'm thinking, wow, he thinks I'm young enough to be a student!

147
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,460
But at some point he goes silent, and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare in the rearview

148
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,540
mirror like fucking clocked, and for a second I'm like, fuck, I'm gonna die in the back

149
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
of this car.

150
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,780
And of course I didn't die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine, I mean I'm

151
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,220
gonna be fine, because white middle class transsexuals don't get murdered in this country.

152
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,780
The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it's really

153
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,260
not my oppression to claim.

154
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,220
You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle class, computer programmer, trans women

155
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,700
be like, we're getting murdered in the streets, who's we, it's not white middle class trans

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
women.

157
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,660
So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane, it exists at this intersection

158
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,700
of masculinity and race, and that's really not a conversation that should be led by a

159
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,060
white woman, especially when there's so, so, so many things to critique about white

160
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,060
masculinity.

161
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,500
Let's talk about some now.

162
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
3.

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Taking offense.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,980
Okay, back to traps.

165
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,780
Now this is my lane, I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.

166
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,460
Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox.

167
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,580
So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom is abridged by our need to navigate

168
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,420
around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence, as a kind of trap.

169
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,780
I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans if

170
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,740
you're using that word for us, or for foodinari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.

171
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,220
I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap, my response is more like, wow, a transphobe

172
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,020
thought I looked like a woman, but that's because I'm so pathetic I have to go dumpster

173
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,020
diving for validation, but the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity

174
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,360
and self-respect, you should definitely not call them traps.

175
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,820
Of course, some trans women will overstate the case and say the word trap is literally

176
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,700
getting trans women killed, which I can't find any examples of the word trap being connected

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
to a murder, but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm?

178
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,300
Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps is you're showing that you think

179
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,220
of us the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us.

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,380
When a man kills a trans woman, literally the argument he trots out in court is that

181
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,100
And that's what you're reminding us of when you use that word, and that's why trans women

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,260
are getting triggered over it.

183
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,340
You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is

184
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,540
one of those times.

185
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,660
So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now.

186
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,820
I think I've made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended

187
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,300
by the word trap, but if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter, this is why

188
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm making this video, if I simply argue that our traps gay is offensive, then here's

189
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
what happens.

190
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,700
First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit, in fact, me telling them it's offensive

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,340
only makes them want to say it more, because they feel, on a deep level, that they are

192
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,020
by nature superior to trans people, so an uppity tranny telling them what words they're

193
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,420
allowed to say completely enrages them.

194
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,580
So they'll comment, traps are gay, well, just to reaffirm their superiority over me

195
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,400
and that I have no power or influence over them, and there's really nothing I can do

196
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,680
about those people.

197
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,560
But, another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they'll say, okay,

198
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,160
so since you're offended by it, I won't say the word trap anymore.

199
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,780
And they'll be super woke about it, and they'll post Twitter callouts cancelling

200
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,000
anyone who uses the word trap, and they'll be very respectful and compassionate toward

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,880
trans people in public so long as it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic

202
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
third world country of a gender minority.

203
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,560
But then, they'll go home at night, and in that twilight between consciousness and

204
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,120
sleep, their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?

205
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,760
And then, years later, when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend, we'll suddenly

206
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,440
watch all that shallow lokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapour.

207
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Real acceptance has to be built, and real understanding.

208
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,360
So it's not enough for me to argue that are traps gay is offensive, I also have to argue

209
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,080
that other traps are gay.

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,760
So, are traps gay?

211
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,600
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

212
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:44,160
For the Philosopher Hello boys, it is I, the half-queen, points.

213
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,160
After thirty days and thirty nights, the Philosopher descended from the mountaintop into the gathered

214
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,160
villagers, thus spake, are traps gay? said he, to whom the half-queen, thus replied,

215
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:04,600
hmm, let's see, let me think about it, oh, I'm gonna stop saying trap now, because it's

216
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,920
not a good word, as has been explained, in fact it's really best to treat it like a

217
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
slur.

218
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,060
So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans

219
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,640
woman, is that gay?

220
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,800
Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are women, and a man having sex with

221
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,040
a woman is, um, let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted, it is not

222
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
in fact gay.

223
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,760
But that's not the most persuasive answer, because in order to find it convincing, you

224
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,640
already have to believe that trans women are women.

225
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,360
And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this, what they say is something

226
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,680
like, sure, I think trans women are women, but, they shouldn't expect men to want to

227
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,440
date them, unless they're into that sort of thing.

228
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Oh, and what sort of thing is that?

229
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,280
Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman, and you say, oh, what's she like?

230
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,560
And he says, she's from Cincinnati, your response is not, oh, David, I didn't realize

231
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,440
you were into that sort of thing.

232
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,680
In other words, these people tell you, trans women are women, but, and then they say something

233
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,560
that shows they don't really think trans women are women at all.

234
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,820
So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular

235
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,640
reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay because trans women

236
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,900
are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that's being disputed.

237
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,200
So maybe the observational approach is better.

238
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,360
The facts are indisputable.

239
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,760
Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women, and comparatively few gay men are.

240
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,160
Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the

241
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
world.

242
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,720
Who is attracted to us and who isn't?

243
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,540
So to us, this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical as the question of whether

244
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,480
the sun will rise tomorrow.

245
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,180
Sure, philosophers can say, but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?

246
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,300
To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.

247
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,940
Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain and find a real thing to worry about.

248
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,640
It's just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and to trans

249
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,100
women, it's a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us are people

250
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,980
who are attracted to women.

251
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,500
Of the cis men I've been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight and

252
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,340
all had only ever been with cis women until this trans came along.

253
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,660
Am I really so powerful as a doctor that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over these tiny

254
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
tits?

255
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Let's not get cocky.

256
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,820
I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman

257
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,060
and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then he continues being

258
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,800
attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything but a straight man?

259
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,860
What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay?

260
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,260
Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious.

261
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,940
What about the penis?

262
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,620
Ah yes, the penis.

263
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,180
Look baby, we'll get to the penis, don't you worry about that.

264
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,180
But first, I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas,

265
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,460
because they got 5.

266
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Vossage.

267
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:14,140
In fact, I've been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is, I make

268
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,060
too much money for Medicaid now, so I have to form an LLC, become my own employer so

269
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,660
I can give myself health benefits, and ugh, it's so much paperwork.

270
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,980
You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a fucking

271
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
c***t.

272
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,100
Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,

273
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,580
because a real vagina is a sacred passage.

274
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,820
And that's fine by me, what am I going to do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered

275
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
by the pope?

276
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Pass.

277
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,540
Straight men don't get hung up on this, I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought

278
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,780
of a vagina as a sacred passage, they're either grossed out by it, or they're trying to climb

279
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
inside.

280
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,500
What I'm trying to say is, in the past I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina,

281
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,060
because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad, and besides, chicks with d***s are very in

282
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
right now.

283
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,780
Very 2019, very trending, and being a d*** girl, it's kind of like being a legendary

284
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,180
pokemon, you know?

285
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,020
People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn't that what we all want?

286
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,260
But unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery, because, well, guys can

287
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,260
I confess something kind of dark to you?

288
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:21,460
I have this really fucked up fetish, where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.

289
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Crazy right?

290
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,460
I mean I like anal, but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.

291
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
Ew.

292
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
I don't want to eat well.

293
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,780
I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get d***ed, is that a crime?

294
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,420
It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks?

295
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

296
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,340
The tests are back and are showing that, in the medical terminology, your vagina does

297
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,460
indeed suck.

298
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,360
The point is, the easy sell version of the argument I'm making is that there's nothing

299
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,940
homosexual but a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.

300
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,260
She has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she's giving hair body face,

301
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,020
she's post-op and has a vagina.

302
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,060
Now even in this situation, people will still say it's gay because of the chromosomes.

303
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,100
But look, human beings have five senses, and none of them can detect chromosomes.

304
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,420
Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender, it's based on perception.

305
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,700
And if you're a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you're attracted to her as

306
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,220
a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment, my dude.

307
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,700
Congratulations, you're a breeder.

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,940
Now the argument people make is, okay fine, it's straight if you mistake her for a biological

309
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,580
woman, but if you know she's a man and you're still attracted, then it's gay.

310
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,620
So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with

311
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,340
your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and

312
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,780
your sexual response.

313
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,340
But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only if you

314
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,780
value your identity as a straight man, you'll feel ashamed of your attraction and you'll

315
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,700
try to fight and deny it, and you'll probably end up treating trans women like absolute

316
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
garbage.

317
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,900
If I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here, I would say trans women are a woman

318
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,220
because they identify as women, and so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction

319
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,380
to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing heterosexual attraction because of the way

320
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,420
the person he's attracted to identifies.

321
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,140
But that's just replacing the black and white thinking of a biology dogma with the black

322
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,260
and white thinking of an identity dogma.

323
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,420
But human sexuality is not black and white, it's not even shades of gray, it's a multicolor

324
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,660
acid trip, it's Centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.

325
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,540
So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it's not usually based on psychological

326
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,940
identity either.

327
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,420
Most of the time, initial attraction anyway is based on what I'd call presentation,

328
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
how you look and act.

329
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,100
And I think that's especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual

330
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
pop.

331
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,860
They see, they conquer, they come.

332
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,100
I mean you have to admire the simplicity of it.

333
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,300
Sometimes I wish I were a man.

334
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,260
So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans

335
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
women who pop.

336
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,820
Maybe you don't think I pop, but you'd be hard pressed to argue that any number of

337
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,900
trans models and actresses don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.

338
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,980
So the pop is undeniable, no one's questioning the pop.

339
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,860
In fact without the pop it never would have occurred to men to call trans women traps,

340
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,700
because they wouldn't be trapped if they weren't attracted in the first place.

341
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,060
But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans woman,

342
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,620
is some kind of illusion or facade that at some point will be dropped, revealing that

343
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,220
our womanhood is a sham and that we're really men.

344
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,120
Now, here's a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.

345
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,740
If you date a cis drag queen, at some point you're getting a man honey, as explained

346
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,180
by the only good YouTuber Jasmine Masters.

347
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,020
I don't want to date nobody who want to date me like this because this comes off and you're

348
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,740
not doing nothing with this.

349
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,180
But if you date me, there's no de-dragging, there's no moment where I become a man.

350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,740
But baby what you see is what you got.

351
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,500
At least on this side, this is my natural side, and this is my biological side.

352
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,740
When we're discussing people who are trans, we immediately scan the first paragraph trans

353
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,060
woman and then repurchase it by their biological pronoun because biology is the nature of the

354
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
pronoun, so.

355
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,020
Everyone's always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine, so why

356
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,820
do you think that in the bedroom we'd be any other way?

357
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,380
Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what

358
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,660
it does for trans women.

359
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,980
It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts.

360
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,620
That's right, these are my very real, very biological titties.

361
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,140
I mean I'm wearing a pushup bra, but at least there's something to push up now.

362
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Here I'll show you.

363
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,260
I mean they're small, but it's not by any measure a male chest, and what I have is very

364
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,820
real, very biological, and very female.

365
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,740
You people think everything to do with trans women is fake.

366
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,980
Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair.

367
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Now that's prejudice more than observation, like I've noticed that whether or not I actually

368
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,180
wear a wig in a video has exactly zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man

369
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
in a wig.

370
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,260
So I may as well just wear wigs, and I may as well get my boobs done too since people

371
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,260
are gonna call them fake either way, but for what it's worth this is my real hair, at least

372
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,380
on this half, and these are my real boobs, and if I bring home a gentleman, or a lady,

373
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,540
all that stays on in bed and it's there when I wake up in the morning.

374
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,100
But what about the penis?

375
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,740
Oh right, oh right.

376
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,620
Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?

377
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620
I rest my case.

378
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
Roll credits.

379
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620
6.

380
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:28,460
The Feminine Penis Look, some guys want the T's and the D, and

381
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
that's the D.

382
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,060
Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a lady dick, makes any sexual

383
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,900
interaction with a man gay.

384
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:42,660
But isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men, and not merely to penis

385
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,220
wherever they may arise?

386
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,940
I think there probably are some gay men who really just like dick, and I'm not judging,

387
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,300
I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences, but being a straight man, I don't really

388
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,140
think that's best understood as a man attracted to vaginas.

389
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,620
You call women pussy, but then you're always like, ew, periods, I'm a straight man, I'm

390
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,220
not used to putting a towel down when I fuck, I don't know how to use a condom because I

391
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,380
expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me, and then you have straight

392
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,660
incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust,

393
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,420
I mean if you're gonna date cis women or post-op trans women, I think you owe it to

394
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,820
them to be a little more vagina positive.

395
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Because even those straight men are like, ew, dicks, that's gay.

396
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,980
You guys also kinda love dicks?

397
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,260
You're always drawing them?

398
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,940
Your buildings look like dicks?

399
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,620
Your porn all has dicks in it?

400
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,220
So what about dicks on chicks?

401
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,260
Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what's the problem, officer?

402
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,580
I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn speaks for itself.

403
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,940
On Pornhub, the she-male category contains more videos than other such popular categories

404
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,940
as rough sex, orgy, and webcam, and it's mostly straight men who watch it.

405
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,620
When adultempire.com moved their T-girl content from their gay site to their straight site,

406
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
views increased 50%.

407
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,860
In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom

408
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,260
bill, the adult site Gamelink's top-selling titles in North Carolina were My Trans Sexual

409
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,700
Teacher, She-male shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Trans Visions 6.

410
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,380
A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which isn't great

411
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,860
since most T-girl porn is not trans positive and uses dehumanizing slurs like she-male

412
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,540
and tranny, which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk

413
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,060
off to you but won't give you rights.

414
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,180
So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.

415
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,420
She-males, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.

416
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,340
Great, I love that for us.

417
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,580
Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick, and

418
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
you know what?

419
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,740
That's fine.

420
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,740
Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.

421
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
You like what you like.

422
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,620
I'm not here to police anyone's desires.

423
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,020
In fact, quite the opposite.

424
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,300
I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society's cruel and unjust prejudice

425
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,140
against their T-girl-loving ways.

426
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,540
But liberation begins with understanding.

427
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,820
So who are the men who love trans girls?

428
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,900
Well, according to trans women I've talked to in my own personal experience, the men

429
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,140
who date us can be divided into three general groups.

430
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,340
Group 1 are men who, to be honest, are actually kind of put off by the dick, but they're

431
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,540
so attracted to the woman it's attached to that they're willing to work around it or

432
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,220
wait for it to grow on them.

433
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,540
Group 2 are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don't

434
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,260
specifically fetishize the penis, so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover had genital

435
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,020
reassignment and got a vagina.

436
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,740
And then Group 3 are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want

437
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,260
to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.

438
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,500
Now Group 3 are what the trans community calls chasers.

439
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,180
Dating chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing

440
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,300
our genitals, which is often the part of us that we're most uncomfortable with.

441
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,340
So if you're a T-girl who likes men, Group 2 is really Goldilocks perfection unless

442
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,780
you really like topping or you've had the surgery.

443
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,100
Now I should say that Group 2 does include some bisexual men, and bisexual people of

444
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,740
either gender can be great partners if you're trans.

445
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,860
You like girls, you like dick, I'm a girl with a dick.

446
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Let's make this happen.

447
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,820
That said, if someone views that part of me as male and wants me to do with it what men

448
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,580
do with it, then pass.

449
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
Not interested.

450
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,460
You might be wondering, what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?

451
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,540
How could I view it as anything other than a male part?

452
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,780
It's a fucking penis!

453
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,420
Well, I'm glad you asked.

454
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,900
I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.

455
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,940
You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.

456
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,620
Context, usage, and physiology.

457
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,980
So first, context, picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.

458
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,940
Now picture her with a penis.

459
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,900
That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.

460
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,740
It's feminine because of the context that it's in.

461
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,260
Second, usage.

462
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,420
A lesson in penis etiquette.

463
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,900
A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.

464
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,260
He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get

465
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,380
on your knees like a good girl and f***.

466
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,780
Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes

467
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
her penis.

468
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,620
When she rises from the bath, she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when

469
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,260
not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.

470
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.

471
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,860
The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.

472
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,700
This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character.

473
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,500
Next, you want to take not one but two pairs of cotton-lined polyspandex bikini-cut panties

474
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,020
at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs.

475
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,900
Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.

476
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,500
You're going to take your claw, and you're going to grab your scrotum, and you're going

477
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,380
to yank that bubblegum back into your page crease.

478
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,220
Now hold it back with one hand, and with your other hand, push your penis back, pressing

479
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,900
those little legs up into your pelvis.

480
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,060
Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place, and then pull your panties up.

481
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,580
Down first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing's seeping out the

482
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,860
sides, and then voila, it's like it was never there.

483
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,060
For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new forward

484
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,900
by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

485
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,300
I've now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us

486
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,140
now turn to physiology.

487
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,340
Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and

488
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,660
functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down, and softening everything

489
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
up.

490
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,260
That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something

491
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,020
I've been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,

492
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,540
really get people talking about seven, the mouthfeel.

493
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:01,180
Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Wynn.

494
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,340
You're tasting specialists.

495
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:12,500
I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex, girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,

496
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,820
and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.

497
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,900
But today, we amuse the palette with the feminine penis.

498
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,860
Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine

499
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:35,300
penis, and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami.

500
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,860
With respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the

501
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,380
masculine penis, and does not become as turgid.

502
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:51,820
And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes

503
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,860
of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.

504
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:06,020
It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.

505
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Cheers.

506
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,140
8.

507
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,260
Being straight is pretty gay.

508
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,860
We've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,

509
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,980
you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with

510
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,180
a trans woman is sex with a woman.

511
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,860
Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.

512
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,980
Sexuality is complicated, and while it's undeniable that many straight men are attracted

513
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,580
to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men are also attracted to

514
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,300
male cross-stressors.

515
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super-womanly either,

516
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,300
like fully Dr. Frankenfurter, and that's why I'm so iconic.

517
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,340
I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter

518
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,020
to a very real, very biological drag queen.

519
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,900
But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got semi-regular messages from men

520
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:13,340
being like, so I'm a straight man, but I'm like really attracted to you when you dress

521
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,620
as a woman, and it's really making me question my sexuality.

522
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,580
Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men

523
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,420
just picked up a my inherently womanly female energy essence that I've always had since

524
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,460
I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-stressing baby.

525
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,460
But let's be real, there are straight men who fuck cross-stressors, there are straight

526
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,140
men who fuck drag queens, there are straight identifying men, who fuck other straight identifying

527
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
men.

528
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
What is going on here?

529
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
Man, what is your deal?

530
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Who are you?

531
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
What is your life?

532
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
How did she become straight?

533
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Did they recruit you?

534
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Were you groomed?

535
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,980
I blame the parents.

536
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,380
Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call Is This Gay?

537
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,380
The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that there's sex acts between people

538
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
of the same gender.

539
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,820
But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's

540
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,660
gay, or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.

541
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,500
To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman leave sucking Adam's nipples,

542
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,020
and according to these men, it's totally gay.

543
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,180
What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a

544
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
man and a woman.

545
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,540
It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who

546
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,380
are playing the correct roles.

547
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,640
So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according

548
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,060
to this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight.

549
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,420
Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.

550
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,540
For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary

551
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,580
twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.

552
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,900
I mean, to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.

553
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Now I'm a cheerleader.

554
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,820
D-I-C-T-R-O-Y, don't tell the coach I was a guy.

555
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,460
This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me

556
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,300
of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.

557
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,240
Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must

558
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,900
be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck

559
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,680
and what you can eat, so for example, religious dietary laws.

560
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,640
I think this hypermasculine heteroman code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of

561
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,900
kosher law governing straightness, and the is-this-gay game is its theology.

562
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,980
Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by,

563
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,300
of all people, Count D'Ancula.

564
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,660
If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're

565
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,420
touching a dick, and that's gay.

566
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,340
Well-memed, my lord, well-memed.

567
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,620
The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when D'Ancula concludes that since

568
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:00,300
a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore

569
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,300
having sex with a woman is pretty gay.

570
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,220
Obviously this is shitposting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps are gay

571
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,820
because chromosomes.

572
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,140
So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.

573
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,300
So what is being gay?

574
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
Socrates.

575
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Mmm.

576
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,300
On second thought, I don't know her.

577
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
9.

578
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,580
Being gay is good actually.

579
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,060
Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's

580
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,540
good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the

581
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
first place?

582
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,820
Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?

583
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,660
It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with

584
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,420
manhood and they defend their manhood at all costs.

585
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,780
Now men, this might be difficult to hear and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,

586
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,380
but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting

587
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,860
trans women, and it's hurting gay people.

588
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,500
For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.

589
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,780
Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even

590
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,580
enjoy his own body?

591
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,380
Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.

592
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,820
Being pegged does not make you gay.

593
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,260
Sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay.

594
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
And why?

595
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,540
Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is

596
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,740
persistently attracted to people of the same gender.

597
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,500
If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with

598
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,860
the word gay, then you're gay.

599
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,580
If not, then you're not, and nothing you can do will change that.

600
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,820
So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is

601
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
good actually.

602
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,500
I mean why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?

603
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,660
Now I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense, we the gays, but as

604
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,460
a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight men

605
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,260
are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.

606
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,780
But that is not a wound I'm going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me

607
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,860
to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.

608
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Are traps gay?

609
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,740
Baby, who cares?

610
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,700
Just so it feels good.

611
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,940
That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say traps are gay but there's

612
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,580
nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men

613
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:27,220
and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact

614
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,860
most attracted to us.

615
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.

616
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,340
And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted

617
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,940
to us are willing to openly date us.

618
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,980
And the stigma is very real.

619
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,020
A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.

620
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,620
Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they

621
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:57,180
experience in short a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.

622
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,700
But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices

623
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,940
control his life.

624
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,820
A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.

625
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,980
A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.

626
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:23,780
And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a

627
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,420
man than you.

628
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,100
10.

629
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,940
I have feelings too.

630
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,620
Well, I guess today we learned that our trap's gay is not a debate worth winning, because

631
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,780
just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the

632
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,180
bigoted assumptions it relies on.

633
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,460
Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is

634
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,820
deserved, hashtag not all gamers.

635
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,060
But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.

636
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,060
And I have feelings too, god damn it, and some of those feelings are not all that different

637
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,300
from the anxieties men have.

638
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,020
Let me explain.

639
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,020
Let me explain.

640
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,940
So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology

641
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,900
for a confused slutbag.

642
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,580
Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lispicious and lesbianical

643
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,780
feelings, but early on in my transition, I encountered a lot of turf shit, and it really

644
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,660
scared me off dating cis lesbians, which I never have.

645
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,700
Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back

646
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,500
of my head for a long time, but about a year ago I was like, I want to fuck men.

647
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,220
I want to fuck men.

648
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,260
But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.

649
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,460
Because men are scary, and in my early transition I'd only dated bisexual trans people and

650
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,740
enbies, and as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.

651
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,020
A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.

652
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,620
That teaches you something about gender, it might be hard to learn otherwise.

653
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,580
And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real

654
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,340
woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as the radiant model

655
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,300
of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.

656
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,660
And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing

657
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
out.

658
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,140
What I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group

659
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,140
of people to date when you're early in transition, because they're pretty chill about anatomy

660
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
and presentation.

661
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,940
But if you're going to date cis-head men, you need to be serving women.

662
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,140
And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt, and I did wonder if I was woman enough

663
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
for it.

664
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,020
So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is

665
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,260
he going to think I'm a man?

666
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,500
Basically my anxiety was our crap's gay, but what I ended up doing is just working up

667
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
to things gradually.

668
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,940
And of course, you start by sucking dick.

669
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,220
That's very safe, because like, what red-blooded man is going to turn down a T-girl blowjob?

670
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,420
And it doesn't involve my junk in any way.

671
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,740
Then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned

672
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,540
we'd been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between

673
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,540
a man and a woman, like, that shit is super hot.

674
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,380
Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on

675
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,100
me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man, what if

676
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
he's repulsed?

677
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,500
Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?

678
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,340
The answer is yes.

679
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,660
It was so hot.

680
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,460
I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would

681
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,460
just say it's special.

682
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,340
10 out of 10.

683
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,780
And you know what he told me after?

684
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,780
He told me he liked the mouth feel.

685
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,340
Women's talking about it now, bitches.

686
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,540
So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,

687
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,420
because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction, but I do want to shame men for

688
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,540
treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets, and I do want to shame men for dehumanizing

689
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,980
us and voting away our rights by day while jerking off to she-mail porn by night, and

690
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,500
I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong enough

691
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,300
to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every

692
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,260
moment of every day, and I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends

693
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,580
because they couldn't stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.

694
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,180
That is pathetic.

695
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,500
If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up

696
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,820
for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.

697
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,940
So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.

698
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,780
Don't call human beings traps.

699
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,700
If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.

700
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,620
It's okay, you can date us, we're more than just jack off material.

701
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,220
If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.

702
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,100
If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because god knows she's been through

703
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,660
enough shit, and finally, protect trans women of color at all costs.

704
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,860
All you want here is basic human decency, is that really too much to ask?

705
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,060
Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.

706
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,220
God damn it.

707
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,700
Well, that was long.

708
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:34,220
I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful

709
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,580
woman's penis.

710
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:54,460
You must think that you're so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware

711
00:43:54,460 --> 00:44:00,460
of how cruel, hurt, before, bigoted and plain rude.

712
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,060
All the things that you say come up every day.

713
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:11,060
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.

714
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:18,060
It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.

715
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:39,060
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, ahead in the sand.

716
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:47,060
It's not really ignorance, but it's the willful, bigoted, to find us.

717
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,060
Don't let them define us.
