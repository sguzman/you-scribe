0	6760	In color theory, the selection of colors used in the design is called a color scheme.
6760	11840	Analogist color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary
11840	18640	schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.
18640	23560	Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounds, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk
23560	27520	about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
27520	30800	This week, we'll be talking about colors.
30800	31800	Colors!
31800	33760	What the fuck are they?
33760	37200	In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.
37200	41880	Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.
41880	42880	It's delicious!
42880	47480	Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic
47480	48480	radiation.
48480	50400	But what about the shadow illusion?
50400	52560	Same wavelengths, different colors.
52560	57160	Some people say I'm a mandress to as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be
57160	60320	a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.
60320	63560	Explain that Professor Butler illusion.
63560	67440	What matters more, the way things are or the way things look?
67440	71760	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
71760	90160	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um, it's too early for this.
90160	98440	Today my guests are, um, well, who are you people?
98440	105040	I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbane, associate professor of women's studies and author of many, many
105040	110720	books, most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux
110720	111720	and Flow.
111720	122520	Oh, yes, and, uh, well, you look familiar, who are you?
122520	133960	Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic, um, well, here's a good one.
133960	137960	Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for transgender?
137960	139480	What do you think Annabelle?
139480	144120	Well Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom
144120	145120	of speech.
145120	151280	For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of
151280	152280	costume wig.
152280	157240	Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that
157240	161480	pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.
161480	166080	But perhaps you disagree, sir.
166080	167080	That's a human rights violation.
167080	168080	I'll smash your fucking face.
168080	175080	And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a
175080	177680	smokescreen for male violence against women.
177680	181200	And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,
181200	186280	it's becoming mandatory, and every day, the centers are being silenced, and something
186280	191080	must be done about the encroaching trans agenda, taking away women's rights, invading women's
191080	196560	spaces, depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard to do.
196560	200280	I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.
200280	201720	Gender's just like color.
201720	204000	Some people see yellow, some people see blue.
204000	206680	It's all a matter of opinion, or is it?
207080	209080	Let's hear the real tea.
223080	224080	Tabby.
224080	226080	Sweetie baby.
226080	227080	Princess.
227080	229080	I feel ridiculous in this dress.
229080	233480	Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.
233480	235480	I think I'm gonna take the dress off.
235680	236680	Well don't do that.
236680	238280	I'm trying to help you out girl.
238280	241680	If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.
241680	243080	I'm gonna take it off.
243080	246280	But don't leave, you can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.
246280	248280	I'm gonna go behind the curtain.
250280	252280	I like looking at naked people.
253480	254480	Why do you always hit on me?
254480	255680	I thought you were into men.
255680	257280	Well I swing both ways.
257280	259280	I like boy dick and girl dick.
259280	260880	That's not how that works.
260880	261880	I hate that.
261880	263280	The heart wants what it wants.
263280	265080	Why did you invite me over here anyway?
265080	267880	I saw what happened to you on the freedom report and girl.
267880	268880	Girl.
268880	273480	You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.
273480	275880	You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?
275880	276880	Pfft no.
276880	277880	Morally wrong.
277880	278880	What does that even mean?
278880	280880	It was much worse than morally wrong.
280880	282280	It was aesthetically wrong.
282280	283880	It was unfeminine.
283880	284880	This is all you ever say to me.
284880	285880	It's bad optics.
285880	286880	It's bad aesthetics.
286880	288880	Well does reality matter at all to you?
288880	290880	Cause the reality is I am a woman.
290880	293280	And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one.
293280	295280	But the way things look isn't all that matters.
295280	297280	Tabby, this is politics.
297280	299280	Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?
299280	302280	Reality plays no role in politics.
302280	304280	Politics is aesthetics.
304280	306280	Politics is aesthetics?
306280	308280	That's literally what fascism is.
308280	310280	Have you even read Benjamin?
310280	314280	Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.
314280	316280	The military parades, the pageantry,
316280	319280	and communism responds by politicizing art.
319280	321280	This is what I can't stand about communists.
321280	323280	You want to turn art into propaganda.
323280	325280	Well art is already ideology.
325280	327280	Ah, look, instead of ruining art,
327280	329280	why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism
329280	331280	with pageantry of our own?
331280	334280	And you know who's going to make that happen?
334280	335280	Who?
335280	337280	Well funded trans women.
337280	338280	Patreon's in the description.
338280	339280	Ew.
339280	340280	Stop that.
340280	341280	What?
341280	343280	I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community
343280	345280	by strategically leveraging my content creator
345280	347280	promotional media brand analytics.
347280	348280	Is that so wrong?
348280	350280	You're so bougie.
350280	352280	I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.
352280	354280	Revolutionary philosophers.
354280	355280	Whatever you need to tell yourself.
355280	357280	Look, the point I'm trying to make
357280	360280	is that the world we live in is not a philosophical world.
360280	362280	Think about Instagram.
362280	365280	It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.
365280	367280	If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?
367280	369280	No one sees that.
369280	370280	They only see the show you're putting on.
370280	372280	Okay, but life is not a show.
372280	374280	Hmm, politics is a show.
374280	375280	Look around you, Tabby.
375280	377280	Try to understand what's happening to the world.
377280	381280	The president of the United States is a reality TV star.
381280	384280	The 21st century is an aesthetic century.
384280	387280	In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle.
387280	389280	And it's important to know what you're in.
389280	393280	Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.
393280	394280	It's Rome.
394280	396280	And your problem is you think you're in the Forum
396280	398280	when you're really in the circus.
398280	401280	I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.
401280	402280	Now you're against reason, too?
402280	404280	I'm not against reason.
404280	406280	Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.
406280	407280	If you're a man.
407280	409280	And what if you're a woman?
409280	410280	Oh, don't be a woman.
410280	411280	That's not a good idea.
411280	412280	Ow.
412280	414280	Do you remember that debate between Blair White
414280	416280	and that YouTuber with the pink wig?
416280	417280	What was her name?
417280	418280	I don't know.
418280	420280	She was relevant back in 2017.
420280	422280	Anyway, this was before she transitioned.
422280	425280	And in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes.
425280	428280	And the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig
428280	430280	not looking at the camera.
430280	431280	I vaguely remember.
431280	433280	I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.
433280	435280	Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad.
435280	437280	It was embarrassing to watch.
437280	438280	Not really.
438280	439280	I mean, she was right.
439280	441280	And her arguments were better.
441280	444280	Ah, Tabby.
444280	447280	Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.
447280	449280	Arguments don't matter.
449280	451280	How pretty you are matters.
451280	453280	Is this really where you're going with this?
453280	455280	Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,
455280	458280	sooner or later you're going to need to take the trans girl black pill.
458280	459280	Oh, boy.
459280	461280	If you're a trans woman in the public eye,
461280	464280	what matters is one thing and one thing only.
464280	466280	And it's always been the thing that matters.
466280	467280	What?
467280	469280	The realness.
469280	471280	Verisimilitude.
471280	473280	You have to look like a fucking woman.
473280	474280	There it is.
474280	475280	There it is is right.
475280	476280	We don't say it in public,
476280	478280	but we all know it and we all feel it.
478280	480280	What does it even mean to look like a woman?
480280	481280	Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.
481280	483280	I'm trying to have a real conversation here.
483280	485280	We all know what it means.
485280	486280	I don't know what it means.
486280	488280	Women have a lot of different looks.
488280	490280	There are bald women, bearded women,
490280	492280	muscular women, wide-shouldered women.
492280	494280	And what is society's opinion
494280	496280	about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?
496280	499280	Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?
499280	501280	The dress is the last of my concerns.
501280	503280	I mean, where do I even start with this?
503280	505280	You're wearing combat boots.
505280	507280	You cannot be wearing combat boots.
507280	508280	Why not?
508280	509280	A lot of cis women wear them.
509280	510280	Cis women?
510280	511280	Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?
511280	512280	Fully clockable.
512280	514280	So you want me to look like a woman
514280	515280	without imitating cis women?
515280	516280	Yes.
516280	517280	Do not, under any circumstances,
517280	519280	imitate cis women.
519280	520280	They have no idea what they're doing.
521280	523280	Well, where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?
528280	530280	And where does that come from?
530280	531280	Poets.
532280	534280	Teenage gay boys on Instagram?
534280	535280	The only people with any coherent vision
535280	537280	of contemporary womanhood.
537280	538280	That's insanity.
538280	539280	Is it?
539280	541280	Tabby, look at my face.
541280	543280	Look at this highlight.
543280	546280	Does that look like the product of insanity to you?
546280	548280	I mean, yeah, kind of.
548280	551280	Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?
551280	552280	Good banter.
552280	553280	Well done.
553280	554280	But trans women have to overdo it.
554280	556280	You need to be so good at makeup
556280	559280	that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.
559280	562280	You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.
562280	564280	You need to smile even at people who hate you.
564280	566280	Eliminate every aggressive impulse.
566280	571280	You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.
571280	573280	Your hands are not tools.
573280	577280	They are ornaments at the ends of your arms.
577280	580280	So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.
580280	582280	Literally a man's idea of a woman.
582280	585280	Well, men have the power, men make the rules,
585280	588280	and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood.
588280	591280	So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.
591280	594280	I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform
594280	596280	to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.
596280	597280	Not stereotypes.
597280	598280	Performances.
598280	601280	You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?
601280	603280	Gender is performance.
603280	606280	We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.
606280	609280	Womenhood is not what you are, it's what you do.
609280	612280	And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.
612280	616280	So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.
616280	618280	Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.
618280	621280	I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.
621280	624280	I mean performance in the sense of everything you do,
624280	628280	the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.
628280	631280	And authentic performance is just a habitual performance,
631280	633280	and nothing more than that.
633280	637280	So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?
637280	641280	I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?
641280	643280	You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.
643280	645280	You fake it till you make it.
645280	648280	So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.
648280	649280	That's what any woman is.
649280	652280	What about gender non-conforming cis women?
652280	654280	They're not doing womanhood in that way.
654280	656280	Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.
656280	660280	They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.
660280	662280	You don't want to end up like that, do you?
662280	665280	And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,
665280	667280	talks like a woman, takes female hormones,
667280	669280	is gendered female by other people,
669280	672280	and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,
672280	675280	that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?
675280	677280	Yep, that's absurd.
677280	680280	But it's absurd because the example is absurd.
680280	681280	No cis man would do that.
681280	685280	It's like asking is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men.
685280	687280	Like, yeah, pretty much.
687280	690280	See, this is a philosophy at its worst, pointless speculative fiction.
690280	693280	And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,
693280	696280	which is you getting rid of those combat boots.
696280	698280	I thought we were talking about philosophy.
698280	700280	No, we're talking about shoes.
700280	702280	Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?
702280	706280	You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.
706280	710280	The left will abide a regal queer.
710280	714280	Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.
714280	717280	If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,
717280	720280	then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?
720280	722280	What matters is that we identify as women.
722280	725280	We can express that identity in different ways,
725280	728280	but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.
728280	731280	But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.
731280	734280	Without action and without social recognition,
734280	736280	the identity is meaningless.
736280	738280	If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,
738280	742280	then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.
742280	744280	Because unless you're living womanhood,
744280	746280	the identity is literally that meaningless.
746280	749280	That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.
749280	751280	Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl.
751280	753280	I'm trying to talk about what's really true.
753280	754280	I didn't say it was insensitive.
754280	756280	I said it was unfair.
756280	760280	Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality
760280	763280	that implies a potential to live your inner truth.
763280	766280	No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter.
766280	767280	It's just a troll example.
767280	768280	True.
768280	770280	But even if they were sincere,
770280	774280	there would still be no reality to it because helicopter is not an actual social role.
774280	778280	Whereas, you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,
778280	780280	but you have to work to get there,
780280	782280	and ultimately, society has to let you.
782280	783280	What do you mean?
783280	787280	I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,
787280	789280	but if no one recognizes me as a doctor,
789280	792280	then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?
792280	795280	But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.
795280	797280	All it takes is being misgendered.
797280	800280	It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?
800280	803280	Why did you get so angry when that turf called you sir?
803280	807280	Isn't it because in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?
807280	808280	That's ridiculous.
808280	809280	I am a woman.
809280	810280	That's my reality.
810280	812280	It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.
812280	813280	I know you're a woman.
813280	815280	I'm just saying that in that one moment,
815280	818280	you effectively had your gender canceled.
818280	822280	Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.
822280	824280	Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.
824280	826280	There's no reasoning your way into it.
826280	827280	But don't worry about that.
827280	829280	I don't argue I'm a woman.
829280	830280	I smash.
830280	832280	I know you do, and it's a bad look.
832280	834280	Is this about the shoes again?
834280	835280	Yep.
835280	836280	Here, put these on.
836280	837280	Absolutely not.
837280	838280	I'm not wearing those.
838280	840280	Yes, you are, bitch.
840280	841280	No?
841280	846280	If you put these on, I'll scratch you behind the ears later.
846280	848280	Okay, fine.
848280	850280	Now walk.
850280	851280	Walk.
871280	873280	That was the worst thing I've ever seen.
873280	875280	Well, you're the one who made me do it.
875280	877280	Look, don't stop around like that.
877280	879280	Keep your shoulders back and steady.
879280	880280	All the movement comes from your hips.
880280	883280	And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.
883280	885280	Here, I'll show you.
910280	911280	Your turn.
911280	913280	Do it right.
913280	915280	The category is...
915280	917280	Cat Girls.
933280	934280	Yes, bitch!
934280	935280	That was flawless.
935280	936280	It was iconic.
936280	937280	I'm loving for this.
937280	938280	I'm loving this for you.
938280	940280	You're doing so good for yourself.
940280	942280	I'm never doing that again.
942280	943280	Why not?
943280	945280	Because it's not who I am.
945280	947280	All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.
947280	949280	Well, that's not what aesthetics is.
949280	952280	Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.
952280	954280	And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,
954280	956280	but I can be a first-rate tabby.
956280	958280	Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson
958280	960280	about the importance of being yourself.
960280	961280	Shut up.
961280	963280	Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?
963280	965280	I know I'm not pretty.
965280	966280	And I know you think you're too good for me
966280	968280	because you mostly pass.
968280	971280	And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.
971280	973280	People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry
973280	974280	and that's weird,
974280	977280	but I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you,
977280	979280	because I'm not like anyone but myself,
979280	981280	and because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us,
981280	984280	and I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow
984280	985280	and deep voices,
985280	987280	the girls even other trans women make fun of,
987280	989280	and when, in the history of the world,
989280	992280	has anyone but me ever stood up for them.
992280	994280	That's why everyone knows who tabby is.
994280	997280	When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?
997280	1000280	Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.
1000280	1001280	But so what?
1001280	1003280	So mail to anime Twitter stans you.
1003280	1004280	Big deal.
1004280	1005280	You're mad, aren't you?
1005280	1007280	I'll get over it in a few weeks.
1007280	1009280	Look, you're right.
1009280	1010280	You have to be yourself.
1010280	1012280	Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.
1012280	1016280	So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,
1016280	1018280	then wear them well and make it work.
1018280	1020280	But sometimes being yourself is not enough.
1020280	1023280	Sometimes you have to become yourself.
1023280	1024280	And for you,
1024280	1027280	I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.
1027280	1029280	I mean, with the Nazis, it's one thing,
1029280	1031280	but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.
1031280	1034280	I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else
1034280	1035280	were willing to stick up for us.
1035280	1037280	Your delicate notion of femininity
1037280	1039280	is a product of the privilege you share
1039280	1041280	with a lot of thin white cis feminists.
1041280	1042280	Wow.
1042280	1044280	It must be so hard for you out on the streets
1044280	1046280	as a fat woman of color.
1046280	1047280	Shut up.
1047280	1048280	I'm just saying,
1048280	1050280	don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.
1050280	1051280	You could have what I have.
1051280	1052280	You just have to work for it
1052280	1054280	instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.
1054280	1056280	You are raised a white boy.
1056280	1059280	You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.
1059280	1061280	And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,
1061280	1063280	but you still stand on a lot of privilege.
1063280	1065280	I look at all the photos of trans women
1065280	1066280	who are murdered in this country,
1066280	1068280	and they don't look like you or me.
1068280	1071280	Why don't you use your privilege and use your education
1071280	1072280	to actually do some good in the world
1072280	1075280	instead of this elective, revolutionary larping?
1075280	1077280	You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.
1077280	1079280	I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough
1079280	1082280	to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.
1082280	1086280	I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.
1086280	1088280	You don't win friends and allies with a bat.
1088280	1089280	They're just using you.
1089280	1090280	Well, who do you think benefits,
1090280	1092280	and who do you think gets hurt
1092280	1093280	when you go out into the world
1093280	1096280	and represent trans women as masculine and violent?
1096280	1097280	Who do you think benefits
1097280	1100280	when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?
1100280	1102280	I guess we can't win, can we?
1102280	1104280	You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?
1104280	1106280	Yeah, okay.
1107280	1109280	Forget about the disrespect.
1109280	1110280	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1110280	1112280	It turns out that every chromosome,
1112280	1114280	every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body
1114280	1117280	is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.
1117280	1119280	You don't know what you're talking about.
1119280	1120280	You're not educated on genetics.
1120280	1121280	Would you like to discuss the genetics or not?
1121280	1122280	Well, no, no.
1122280	1123280	What are your genetics?
1123280	1127280	You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1127280	1130280	Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.
1130280	1135280	You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1135280	1138280	So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,
1138280	1141280	I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community,
1141280	1142280	which is so frustrating.
1142280	1143280	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1143280	1145280	Damage controlling, so frustrating.
1145280	1146280	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1146280	1147280	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1147280	1148280	So frustrating.
1148280	1149280	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1149280	1152280	It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.
1152280	1155280	If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex
1155280	1158280	and then talk about you're a very feminine biological man
1158280	1161280	and you've had the surgeries to prove it,
1161280	1163280	then I think that we can talk about
1163280	1164280	what is the appropriate pronoun to use.
1164280	1165280	Because my problem is the...
1165280	1166280	The...
1166280	1167280	They're...
1167280	1171280	Tambi, I don't want to fight with you.
1171280	1173280	We're surviving in this shit world together
1173280	1175280	and you'll always be my sister.
1175280	1177280	Well, I'm glad.
1177280	1178280	I love you.
1178280	1179280	What?
1179280	1180280	Love.
1180280	1181280	I was in love once.
1181280	1184280	I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati,
1184280	1186280	bent over a pool table.
1186280	1188280	The year was 1985.
1188280	1191280	And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey
1191280	1194280	hits my nostrils at just the right moment,
1194280	1197280	I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth
1197280	1199280	against my cheek.
1199280	1202280	Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.
1221280	1224280	Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.
1251280	1254280	Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.
1281280	1283280	Thank you.
