00:00.000 --> 00:19.020
Alright children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.280
How do I put this delicately?

00:21.280 --> 00:24.120
Your humble hostess is a total les.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.620
Shame.

00:26.620 --> 00:35.020
You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse than just that.

00:35.020 --> 00:45.020
You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness, and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.920
And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be gay.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.420
Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.

00:54.420 --> 01:04.820
So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key, les-bicious behavior.

01:04.820 --> 01:07.720
And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.520
So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.820
Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.

01:12.820 --> 01:18.620
Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is piping hot.

01:18.620 --> 01:24.720
For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi, I'm a super fucking bi.

01:24.720 --> 01:31.220
But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into the straight lifestyle.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.020
This really started in 2018.

01:33.020 --> 01:39.820
By that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman.

01:39.820 --> 01:45.220
And we're going to circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle of things.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.420
I'm like an epic poet.

01:48.420 --> 01:49.820
Hey, how are you, gorge?

01:49.820 --> 01:56.220
So, at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I didn't even say best friends, with a woman whom I'll call...

01:59.220 --> 02:01.320
Joanne, light of my life.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.520
Can we get some melodramatic music, please?

02:03.520 --> 02:04.520
Yeah, here we go.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.720
You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.320
I want you to fully enjoy my pain.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.620
So, my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.

02:12.620 --> 02:17.420
It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes,

02:17.420 --> 02:20.620
and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.720
We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.820
And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds,

02:27.820 --> 02:33.820
which is very unusual for me because I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.420
One reason we got so emotionally close is we're both trans.

02:37.420 --> 02:42.420
And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with another trans woman

02:42.420 --> 02:44.720
that I can't really have with anyone else.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.320
Oh, and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful,

02:50.320 --> 02:53.620
which I did notice every time I looked at her.

02:53.620 --> 02:59.320
And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.720
We'd get drunk and make out.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.220
We'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle.

03:03.220 --> 03:04.620
Straight girls do that, right?

03:04.620 --> 03:06.620
Gal, pals.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.920
I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,

03:10.920 --> 03:15.720
and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand,

03:15.720 --> 03:18.120
and we walked down the street together holding hands.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.320
This is garbage and I want to die.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.320
I hope you all know that I'm in agony.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.120
Later, we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink,

03:27.120 --> 03:30.420
we'd run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.720
Ah, this is still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.620
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.720
A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.320
They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.020
Gal, pals.

03:48.020 --> 03:48.820
Just kill me.

03:48.820 --> 03:54.520
Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home,

03:54.520 --> 03:55.620
and they won't notice.

03:55.620 --> 04:03.920
So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.520
So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time,

04:08.520 --> 04:12.820
I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.820
So how could I possibly think that?

04:14.820 --> 04:17.720
Well, the short answer is shame.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.220
Why is no one talking about the shame?

04:20.220 --> 04:23.420
I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.420
There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.

04:26.420 --> 04:32.220
Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.

04:32.220 --> 04:37.320
There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription,

04:37.320 --> 04:40.520
Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.020
I'm a bronze star lesbian.

04:42.020 --> 04:46.420
Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.420
Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.620
I tried prayer.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.220
I tried electric shocks.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.220
All the classics, all the hits.

04:54.220 --> 04:57.220
You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women,

04:57.220 --> 04:59.020
you start to associate the two in your head.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.720
So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.220
This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.

05:07.220 --> 05:12.220
So at some point the shame was just too much for me and it literally broke my brain.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.220
I no longer wanted to be straight.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.220
I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.

05:17.220 --> 05:20.220
Maybe a little by a little bit.

05:20.220 --> 05:25.220
By that time I started dating men and I got into a serious long-term relationship with a man.

05:25.220 --> 05:31.220
And at first I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself female friendships are just really intense.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.220
That's probably why I feel so strongly.

05:34.220 --> 05:38.220
And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that.

05:38.220 --> 05:43.220
And, you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.

05:44.220 --> 05:47.220
So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.

05:47.220 --> 05:49.220
And then two things happened.

05:49.220 --> 05:52.220
First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.220
Fuck my drag, right?

06:00.220 --> 06:06.220
I think before that I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia

06:06.220 --> 06:11.220
allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as I just have a thing for my straight best friend.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.220
Like, who doesn't?

06:13.220 --> 06:19.220
But that's a very self-serving narrative because it quarantines your feelings inside the safety of unattainable fantasy

06:19.220 --> 06:22.220
and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

06:22.220 --> 06:26.220
Because that way it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just she's just not that into women.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.220
But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.220
And the jealousy hit me so hard I couldn't ignore it.

06:34.220 --> 06:38.220
Second, around that same time Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.220
It was a long-distance friendship.

06:40.220 --> 06:43.220
And about halfway through that visit I cracked.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.220
One morning I woke up next to her.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.220
And I looked at her pretty fucking face and I had the thought,

06:51.220 --> 06:54.220
I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

06:54.220 --> 07:01.220
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual biogirl to have about her gal pal.

07:01.220 --> 07:05.220
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.220
Like, what the fuck is this? What am I feeling?

07:08.220 --> 07:15.220
I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th century Italian opera.

07:15.220 --> 07:21.220
So I confessed my feelings to Joanne and, love confession gone wrong, devastating.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.220
But she did not reciprocate my feelings.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.220
Nurse, my pain is at a 10, I need more pills.

07:28.220 --> 07:32.220
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah.

07:32.220 --> 07:34.220
I'm sure we all know how that goes.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.220
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,

07:38.220 --> 07:40.220
I might have recovered.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.220
But we couldn't keep away from each other.

07:42.220 --> 07:46.220
She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me because

07:46.220 --> 07:49.220
the truth is, we were never just gal pals.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.220
And I was beyond reason.

07:51.220 --> 07:56.220
Like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.220
That's how tragic this got. Those are great by the way.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.220
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

08:00.220 --> 08:04.220
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other,

08:04.220 --> 08:07.220
and I just repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.

08:07.220 --> 08:12.220
Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year

08:12.220 --> 08:16.220
because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.

08:16.220 --> 08:21.220
But rejection and a heartbreak are shameful in themselves and only made the situation worse.

08:21.220 --> 08:26.220
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial until finally last October.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.220
I got super fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.220
Link in the description. Subscribe.

08:32.220 --> 08:37.220
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a friendship break.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.220
Otherwise, I was never going to get over her.

08:39.220 --> 08:43.220
So there was this combination of things, being politically cancelled by Twitter,

08:43.220 --> 08:48.220
being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend,

08:48.220 --> 08:52.220
which sent me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.

08:52.220 --> 08:57.220
And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.

08:57.220 --> 09:00.220
Because depression brings your life to a standstill,

09:00.220 --> 09:04.220
and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes feel outside yourself.

09:04.220 --> 09:07.220
And with that comes a new perspective.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.220
So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day

09:10.220 --> 09:13.220
and binge watching Orange is the Bluest L word,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.220
I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.220
And that gave me a new kind of clarity.

09:18.220 --> 09:23.220
I looked back on the last couple years and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.

09:23.220 --> 09:32.220
So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a gay, not clickbait.

09:40.220 --> 10:03.220
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

10:03.220 --> 10:04.220
Shame.

10:04.220 --> 10:10.220
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.220
Well that's my Eden.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.220
Candy flipping.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.220
I love it.

10:13.220 --> 10:19.220
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.

10:19.220 --> 10:22.220
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

10:22.220 --> 10:26.220
First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.220
Female friendships are just really intense.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.220
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

10:30.220 --> 10:36.220
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic attraction to men.

10:36.220 --> 10:40.220
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

10:40.220 --> 10:48.220
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again and I'll slide back into denial.

10:48.220 --> 10:52.220
So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.

10:52.220 --> 10:58.220
Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.220
She's a Libra.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.220
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

11:02.220 --> 11:05.220
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that.

11:05.220 --> 11:09.220
Like it makes you grow breasts, at least in theory.

11:09.220 --> 11:11.220
I just added progesterone.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.220
We'll see if that does anything.

11:12.220 --> 11:16.220
But the lesser-known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.

11:16.220 --> 11:24.220
The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual because the libido I had known before was just gone.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.220
But I'm very much not asexual.

11:26.220 --> 11:32.220
It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.

11:32.220 --> 11:37.220
One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now, whomst I'm attracted to.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.220
Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way.

11:41.220 --> 11:45.220
It sparks my interest, but it doesn't light my fire.

11:45.220 --> 11:49.220
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.220
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.220
Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about.

11:56.220 --> 12:00.220
But I think the concept it describes applies to me.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.220
Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

12:04.220 --> 12:09.220
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them as a friend.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.220
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

12:12.220 --> 12:17.220
Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?

12:17.220 --> 12:19.220
I know that's not how it works.

12:19.220 --> 12:20.220
I have to play the field.

12:20.220 --> 12:24.220
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.220
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

12:27.220 --> 12:28.220
It's boring.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.220
The build-up of desire.

12:30.220 --> 12:34.220
That's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and shame.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.220
I shouldn't, but I want to.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.220
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

12:39.220 --> 12:44.220
I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality is more common in women than men.

12:44.220 --> 12:49.220
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.

12:49.220 --> 12:55.220
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.

12:55.220 --> 13:01.220
Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.

13:01.220 --> 13:05.220
And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

13:05.220 --> 13:09.220
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality.

13:09.220 --> 13:13.220
Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards the beautiful people of any gender,

13:13.220 --> 13:15.220
and that can be pretty intense in its own right.

13:16.220 --> 13:24.220
I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating to me than looking at a beautiful man.

13:24.220 --> 13:31.220
Which can be moving in its own way, but it's more like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.

13:31.220 --> 13:36.220
You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.

13:36.220 --> 13:39.220
That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.

13:39.220 --> 13:40.220
I'd fuck it so hard.

13:40.220 --> 13:44.220
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,

13:44.220 --> 13:51.220
and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

13:51.220 --> 13:58.220
There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.

13:58.220 --> 14:09.220
Like, I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms unfolding my smooth, fragile body.

14:10.220 --> 14:17.220
Or maybe it's Mark Freudian, the masculine man as Daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic power of the phallus,

14:17.220 --> 14:20.220
penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

14:20.220 --> 14:25.220
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man

14:25.220 --> 14:31.220
and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.

14:31.220 --> 14:36.220
And I can find things I like about male bodies, like, they're very warm.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.220
I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.220
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head and she says,

14:42.220 --> 14:47.220
but are you attracted to men, or do you just like being warm?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.220
My attraction to women is very different.

14:49.220 --> 14:55.220
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

14:55.220 --> 14:58.220
This is going to destroy me.

14:58.220 --> 15:01.220
You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.

15:01.220 --> 15:03.220
I've never once been in pain over male beauty.

15:03.220 --> 15:07.220
But around Joanne, once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,

15:07.220 --> 15:10.220
there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be like,

15:10.220 --> 15:12.220
don't even enter my line of sight right now.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.220
You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

15:14.220 --> 15:18.220
There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.220
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

15:20.220 --> 15:25.220
And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

15:25.220 --> 15:28.220
I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.220
It's that they're interested in me.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.220
And that's pretty interesting.

15:33.220 --> 15:38.220
I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

15:38.220 --> 15:44.220
You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.

15:44.220 --> 15:45.220
Fuck me up, King.

15:45.220 --> 15:46.220
God, that's odd.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.220
It gets me every time.

15:48.220 --> 15:53.220
But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,

15:53.220 --> 15:57.220
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

15:57.220 --> 16:02.220
You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.

16:02.220 --> 16:05.220
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

16:05.220 --> 16:10.220
And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women

16:10.220 --> 16:16.220
is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.220
It's all very passive.

16:18.220 --> 16:21.220
And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

16:21.220 --> 16:24.220
I've taken a very submissive role.

16:24.220 --> 16:29.220
Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let them do things to me.

16:29.220 --> 16:34.220
And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.220
I like that feeling myself.

16:36.220 --> 16:40.220
And I do genuinely enjoy taking on a more submissive role sometimes.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.220
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

16:42.220 --> 16:48.220
Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid confronting

16:48.220 --> 16:50.220
what your desires actually are.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.220
It's freedom from freedom.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.220
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation

16:54.220 --> 16:56.220
and ashamed of your transsexual body

16:56.220 --> 16:59.220
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

16:59.220 --> 17:02.220
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

17:02.220 --> 17:06.220
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

17:06.220 --> 17:08.220
by letting someone else take control

17:08.220 --> 17:11.220
can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.

17:11.220 --> 17:14.220
And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.220
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

17:17.220 --> 17:21.220
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

17:21.220 --> 17:23.220
isn't really that much more liberated.

17:23.220 --> 17:26.220
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago

17:26.220 --> 17:28.220
and totally identified with the fantasy.

17:28.220 --> 17:33.220
And later, I thought that was evidence I had normative female desires.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.220
Never mind that I was identifying with the midlife crisis fantasies

17:37.220 --> 17:39.220
of a repressed English housewife

17:39.220 --> 17:41.220
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

17:41.220 --> 17:46.220
I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy.

17:46.220 --> 17:50.220
I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.220
But what makes me different is that for me,

17:52.220 --> 17:57.220
submission to a man was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.220
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

17:59.220 --> 18:03.220
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.220
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

18:06.220 --> 18:10.220
straight women are ultimately attracted to men

18:10.220 --> 18:12.220
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.220
Or are they? Gay men certainly are.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.220
And gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

18:17.220 --> 18:22.220
But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh about male bodies and men in general.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.220
Which, what is that about?

18:25.220 --> 18:29.220
I just, I just do not understand straight women.

18:29.220 --> 18:32.220
I don't think I ever will. And that's okay.

18:32.220 --> 18:36.220
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment and move on with my lesbian life.

18:36.220 --> 18:41.220
Now, what I've been giving you so far is a retrospective analysis,

18:41.220 --> 18:45.220
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

18:45.220 --> 18:48.220
But you have to understand that when I was living through this,

18:48.220 --> 18:51.220
I experienced it very differently, because I didn't have these insights.

18:51.220 --> 18:54.220
So I wasn't thinking, oh I'm not really attracted to men,

18:54.220 --> 18:57.220
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

18:57.220 --> 19:01.220
so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.

19:01.220 --> 19:05.220
Now, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,

19:05.220 --> 19:07.220
at least until Joanne ruined my life.

19:07.220 --> 19:10.220
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

19:10.220 --> 19:13.220
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.220
I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half,

19:16.220 --> 19:19.220
who I had very genuine feelings for.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.220
Plot twist, story time.

19:21.220 --> 19:27.220
So, my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.

19:27.220 --> 19:31.220
Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga Chad fantasy.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.220
You know, he was very masculine, taller than me,

19:34.220 --> 19:37.220
objectively attractive, very charming.

19:37.220 --> 19:40.220
Straight women used to tell me all the time they were jealous of me for being with him.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.220
And obviously I loved that.

19:42.220 --> 19:47.220
To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,

19:47.220 --> 19:51.220
a sort of archetypal romantic lead who swept me off my feet

19:51.220 --> 19:55.220
and fulfilled my sick fantasies of being a heterosexual woman.

19:55.220 --> 19:59.220
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

19:59.220 --> 20:03.220
but that once it came to actually dating, I realized I didn't like it.

20:03.220 --> 20:06.220
But honestly, it's more complicated than that.

20:06.220 --> 20:09.220
Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him.

20:09.220 --> 20:13.220
And I still think of him as the one genuine boy crush of my life.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.220
When we started dating, it was really exciting.

20:16.220 --> 20:20.220
I'd never had a boyfriend before, and he'd never been with a trans woman before.

20:20.220 --> 20:24.220
And we had this, like, adorably heterosexual energy together,

20:24.220 --> 20:26.220
like holding hands in the park.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.220
It was cute!

20:27.220 --> 20:30.220
This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a cad.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.220
But he wasn't. He was great.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.220
He took very good care of me.

20:33.220 --> 20:36.220
He was never ashamed to be seen with me,

20:36.220 --> 20:39.220
or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,

20:39.220 --> 20:43.220
which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.

20:43.220 --> 20:46.220
He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself.

20:46.220 --> 20:50.220
And when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.220
And that meant a lot.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.220
So I really wanted this to work.

20:55.220 --> 20:59.220
Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.

20:59.220 --> 21:02.220
And for a year or so, I thought it was working.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.220
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

21:04.220 --> 21:06.220
I missed him when he was gone.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.220
I told him I loved him, and I meant it.

21:08.220 --> 21:11.220
But what happened is, by the end of the first year,

21:11.220 --> 21:14.220
the initial excitement ad died down.

21:14.220 --> 21:18.220
And while Chad was ready to keep escalating the relationship,

21:18.220 --> 21:24.220
I was realizing that something was very seriously, emotionally wrong on my end.

21:24.220 --> 21:26.220
There was something missing.

21:26.220 --> 21:29.220
And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,

21:29.220 --> 21:32.220
I was like, there's that missing feeling.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.220
And I started to understand what my problem was.

21:35.220 --> 21:39.220
Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram

21:39.220 --> 21:41.220
an aloof picture of me with the caption,

21:41.220 --> 21:45.220
do I actually like men or do I just like attention?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.220
And I didn't mean anything serious by that.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.220
I was just joking around.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.220
You know, you can post something like that

21:50.220 --> 21:52.220
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

21:52.220 --> 21:54.220
yeah, fuck men.

21:54.220 --> 21:56.220
What is their damage?

21:56.220 --> 21:58.220
Well, they're stuck dating men. That's their damage.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.220
But a few people left comments saying,

22:00.220 --> 22:02.220
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

22:02.220 --> 22:04.220
You should make a video about comphet.

22:04.220 --> 22:07.220
And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?

22:07.220 --> 22:12.220
So I Googled it and I learned that comphet is short for compulsory heterosexuality.

22:12.220 --> 22:17.220
Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality is socially required of women.

22:17.220 --> 22:22.220
And it's so bound up with the conventional idea of what it even means to be a woman

22:22.220 --> 22:27.220
that gay women often mistakenly believe for years that they're attracted to men.

22:27.220 --> 22:32.220
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

22:32.220 --> 22:38.220
And I'm reading through this post like, oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

22:38.220 --> 22:44.220
Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head that says I must really be het

22:44.220 --> 22:46.220
even when I'm in love with a woman.

22:46.220 --> 22:50.220
Quote, you have every reason to be happy in your relationship with a man,

22:50.220 --> 22:52.220
but you just aren't.

22:52.220 --> 22:56.220
Everything is going really well, but something is missing and you can't figure out what.

22:56.220 --> 22:59.220
So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

22:59.220 --> 23:04.220
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.

23:04.220 --> 23:09.220
And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual taking this quiz like, it's true.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.220
Samantha was right.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.220
I am a total lass.

23:12.220 --> 23:15.220
All the cis gay people watching this video probably want to kill me right now

23:15.220 --> 23:20.220
because y'all figured this shit out in high school and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

23:20.220 --> 23:22.220
it's just, I just, I just can't.

23:22.220 --> 23:26.220
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?

23:26.220 --> 23:28.220
Is it all right with you, the gays?

23:28.220 --> 23:33.220
So to be honest, I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.

23:33.220 --> 23:38.220
Like for a long time, I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.

23:38.220 --> 23:43.220
But after a lot of introspection, I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

23:43.220 --> 23:46.220
of private happiness and fulfillment.

23:46.220 --> 23:50.220
It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.

23:50.220 --> 23:57.220
Like, can you imagine if I got married to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding

23:57.220 --> 24:00.220
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

24:00.220 --> 24:03.220
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

24:03.220 --> 24:05.220
I'd be super heck and valid, uwu.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.220
But I don't actually want to be married.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.220
I want to get married.

24:08.220 --> 24:10.220
I want to have a wedding.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.220
Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.

24:12.220 --> 24:14.220
I want attention, okay?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.220
Please pay attention to me.

24:16.220 --> 24:22.220
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy, but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

24:22.220 --> 24:26.220
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality.

24:26.220 --> 24:32.220
Because there's a level of gender instability and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.

24:32.220 --> 24:37.220
And until recently, I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.220
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

24:40.220 --> 24:44.220
and I think I needed to go through the more one-on-one straight girl experience

24:44.220 --> 24:47.220
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

24:47.220 --> 24:53.220
I still have a hard time imagining a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.

24:53.220 --> 24:58.220
And I think that's partly because good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.

24:58.220 --> 25:02.220
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama from 15 years ago,

25:02.220 --> 25:05.220
which I do like, and I like the new one too.

25:05.220 --> 25:11.220
But after that, the runner-up is, I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

25:11.220 --> 25:14.220
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whom we ship.

25:14.220 --> 25:19.220
Well, I don't ship them because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush on Kacha's Amalochkava.

25:19.220 --> 25:23.220
Don't laugh at me. She's smart. She's funny. She's beautiful.

25:23.220 --> 25:25.220
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

25:25.220 --> 25:31.220
Sure, some haters and losers will probably try to convince me that Kacha is in fact a homosexual man posing as a woman.

25:31.220 --> 25:36.220
But you know what? This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life, and I don't need this right now.

25:37.220 --> 25:42.220
I need to be touched by a real woman. I'm losing my goddamn mind.

25:42.220 --> 25:48.220
It's so deeply embedded in our culture that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.

25:48.220 --> 25:56.220
And it's not just Disney movies, like it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology, German fairy tales, Victorian novels.

25:56.220 --> 26:02.220
The whole weight of cultural history is telling you that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.

26:02.220 --> 26:08.220
And if you're already super dysphoric and insecure about your gender, then to reject that possibility?

26:08.220 --> 26:11.220
Ah, it hurts. It hurts so bad.

26:11.220 --> 26:18.220
But whenever I think about having a long-term partner, you know, not the wedding day, but the one thousandth morning waking up together,

26:18.220 --> 26:29.220
I can only imagine her being a woman. My brain wants a good man to take care of me, but my heart wants a high maintenance diva to ruin my life.

26:29.220 --> 26:35.220
And once I knew that for sure, I thought I would be wrong to stay with Chad.

26:35.220 --> 26:39.220
And this man was like my hinge. He was holding me together.

26:39.220 --> 26:51.220
But last December, I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian, which at least is a good reason.

26:54.220 --> 26:58.220
I'm having a hard time, you guys. Leave your pity in the comments.

26:58.220 --> 27:01.220
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too. I feel like shit.

27:01.220 --> 27:06.220
I think it's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me. I could really use a couple Advil on a vodka tonic.

27:06.220 --> 27:10.220
I think I might throw some clothes on, too. Where's that snake?

27:19.220 --> 27:22.220
I already missed my heterosexual nails.

27:22.220 --> 27:26.220
I know these are too long to be gay, but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.

27:26.220 --> 27:30.220
Getting my acrylics removed? Traumatizing. I feel like I'm detransitioning.

27:30.220 --> 27:33.220
One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure with acrylics on eight fingers.

27:33.220 --> 27:36.220
I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon and say,

27:36.220 --> 27:42.220
Hi, I'm a homosexual, please. I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.

27:43.220 --> 27:50.220
Shame. Let's talk about the shame. Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women, though.

27:51.220 --> 27:56.220
Two of those women later turned out to be trans, so I guess we had some way of finding each other.

27:56.220 --> 28:00.220
An attraction to women was never really a problem for me before the transgendering,

28:00.220 --> 28:05.220
because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle where men are supposed to be attracted to women.

28:05.220 --> 28:10.220
Crazy, I know. Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty.

28:10.220 --> 28:14.220
I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.

28:14.220 --> 28:19.220
And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around my being, at the time, a gender non-conforming man,

28:19.220 --> 28:27.220
which, in my early YouTube videos, I dealt with by caricaturing myself and basically leaning into the public humiliation.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.220
One of my classic techniques.

28:29.220 --> 28:34.220
But now, my shame is centered around my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.

28:34.220 --> 28:44.220
And the most glaring aspects of that failure are my male past, my sexual orientation, and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.

28:44.220 --> 28:50.220
Yeah, killing all those people was not my most feminine moment, but I was having a bad skin day.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.220
What was I supposed to do?

28:51.220 --> 28:54.220
So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

28:56.220 --> 28:59.220
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

28:59.220 --> 29:06.220
And whatever one times two is, I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.

29:06.220 --> 29:07.220
Ugh.

29:07.220 --> 29:16.220
And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.220
Why is no one talking about the shame?

29:18.220 --> 29:20.220
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.220
But we shouldn't be.

29:21.220 --> 29:24.220
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

29:24.220 --> 29:33.220
I grew up in a media era when trans women were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities who deserve the violence they bring upon themselves by existing.

29:33.220 --> 29:47.220
And I started my transition in the first year of the Trump administration when there's been constant vilification of trans people in the press, invading women's bathrooms, forcing our insanity on children, destroying western civilization with our authoritarian pronouns.

29:47.220 --> 29:52.220
It's hard to express just the daily humiliation of being a trans woman under these conditions.

29:52.220 --> 29:57.220
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you like my laser technician recently told me,

29:57.220 --> 30:02.220
you must be very courageous to transition because that is not socially acceptable.

30:02.220 --> 30:05.220
And then she went back to blasting laser beams into my asshole.

30:05.220 --> 30:10.220
And then there's the internet where, you know, I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.

30:10.220 --> 30:16.220
And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet are a wretched, wretched horde of bigoted attack helicopters.

30:16.220 --> 30:19.220
The whole point of this channel is I try to talk sense to these people.

30:19.220 --> 30:25.220
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives and I try to empathize with their point of view and provide a rational response.

30:25.220 --> 30:31.220
But a side effect of all that research is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self loathing.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.220
It seeped into my brain and become a part of me.

30:34.220 --> 30:39.220
And this lifelong build up of shame has become a wound at the heart of my existence.

30:39.220 --> 30:44.220
And all I can really do about it is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

30:44.220 --> 30:48.220
I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.220
I am resplendent trash.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.220
I am couture trash.

30:52.220 --> 30:58.220
And I just bought a mid-century gold trimmed Venetian blown glass decanter.

30:58.220 --> 31:03.220
Which helps me forget the shame and self loathing that plagues my every moment.

31:03.220 --> 31:08.220
Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

31:08.220 --> 31:12.220
when I've already come out as trans, which seems like a bigger deal.

31:12.220 --> 31:17.220
To paraphrase what some people have told me, you're already a transgendered and a freak's a freak.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.220
So who cares what kind of freak?

31:19.220 --> 31:23.220
Well first of all, I would like to propose a sociological theory.

31:23.220 --> 31:30.220
Tiffany's Law. All freaks have a deep psychological need to feel superior to a different type of freak.

31:30.220 --> 31:34.220
And trans lesbians are pretty close to the bottom of that packing order.

31:34.220 --> 31:37.220
Who's even left for me to feel superior to, the goddamn Belgians?

31:37.220 --> 31:39.220
Fuck this waffle.

31:39.220 --> 31:45.220
Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me because I did it incrementally over like eight years.

31:45.220 --> 31:49.220
At first I was like, well, I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.220
Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup.

31:52.220 --> 31:55.220
I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.

31:55.220 --> 31:58.220
And then I realized I'm not a man at all and I identified as non-binary.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.220
Then I started taking hormones.

32:00.220 --> 32:05.220
In two months on HRT I woke up one day and said, it's fine. I am literally a woman.

32:05.220 --> 32:10.220
So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman, that was actually a step up

32:10.220 --> 32:13.220
in terms of social acceptability from where I was before.

32:13.220 --> 32:16.220
When I was a genderqueer gender fuck, I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.

32:16.220 --> 32:22.220
Whereas when I started transitioning to female, even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,

32:22.220 --> 32:29.220
there was at least a goal in mind, some possible future where I could lead a normal-ish life as a woman.

32:29.220 --> 32:34.220
So the moment I started identifying as a woman was the moment the comphette voice entered my head.

32:34.220 --> 32:38.220
Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before, but maybe I'm attracted to them now.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.220
I'm a woman, right?

32:39.220 --> 32:43.220
I've always been a little bi-curious and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.220
Maybe I can make this work.

32:45.220 --> 32:48.220
Let's choose some boys to be attracted to and get started on this.

32:48.220 --> 32:51.220
Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.

32:51.220 --> 32:56.220
My way of explaining it to myself was, I guess hormones just magically changed my sexual orientation

32:56.220 --> 32:59.220
to the socially acceptable one. That's zebra-freaking-crazy.

32:59.220 --> 33:02.220
Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.

33:02.220 --> 33:06.220
God, there's so much pressure on trans women to be extremely gender-conforming.

33:06.220 --> 33:09.220
And even more so if you're a representative of the community.

33:09.220 --> 33:14.220
You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife or else cis people are going to throw us all in camps.

33:14.220 --> 33:18.220
And early in my transition, I kind of worshipped straight trans women.

33:18.220 --> 33:21.220
Like, I looked up to them and I wanted to be just like them.

33:21.220 --> 33:27.220
Now back then there were a handful of trans lesbians on YouTube trying to make the case to the masses

33:27.220 --> 33:30.220
that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.

33:30.220 --> 33:33.220
But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.220
I watched those women get eaten alive.

33:35.220 --> 33:40.220
And as a result of my witnessing that at a super-freaking-vulnerable moment for me,

33:40.220 --> 33:46.220
I internalized the message that a trans lesbian is just not an okay thing to be

33:46.220 --> 33:50.220
if you want to be tolerated or respected by anybody other than a handful of communists.

33:50.220 --> 33:56.220
So I began my transition with essentially no role model of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.

33:56.220 --> 34:01.220
And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia are harsher on gay trans women

34:01.220 --> 34:03.220
than they are on straight trans women.

34:03.220 --> 34:08.220
They could take this trope that trans women are men who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.

34:08.220 --> 34:11.220
In response to that, it feels really good to be able to say,

34:11.220 --> 34:15.220
I'm not even attracted to women, I'm just a petite heterosexual biogirl,

34:15.220 --> 34:19.220
I'm surely not some kind of six-foot monster who likes women.

34:19.220 --> 34:22.220
Shame. Shame.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.220
It does make me feel like a monster sometimes.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.220
Like a mutant that has no place in society.

34:26.220 --> 34:31.220
And this shame has actually made it more difficult for me to accept that I'm a gay woman

34:31.220 --> 34:34.220
than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.

34:34.220 --> 34:39.220
It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain where I traded my sexual orientation for my gender identity.

34:39.220 --> 34:44.220
So I finally transitioned only to spend the next couple years living with a different kind of denial.

34:44.220 --> 34:48.220
And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.

34:48.220 --> 34:54.220
This is painful and incriminating to admit, but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.

34:54.220 --> 34:59.220
Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust toward things I saw trans lesbians doing.

34:59.220 --> 35:03.220
Like this anime catgirl shit which clearly gets under my skin.

35:03.220 --> 35:06.220
And not just because these people have been harassing me for three years.

35:06.220 --> 35:09.220
Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,

35:09.220 --> 35:13.220
this queasy combination of the hypersexual and the infantile.

35:13.220 --> 35:16.220
I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian cum slut.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.220
Meow meow girl dick, meow meow.

35:18.220 --> 35:22.220
Here's the 97th picture of my own legs and thigh-hide stripey socks oo-woo.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.220
What is that about?

35:24.220 --> 35:26.220
Is this how women act?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.220
Sis people are gonna see this.

35:28.220 --> 35:31.220
They're not gonna let us into women's spaces if we act like that.

35:31.220 --> 35:35.220
Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings.

35:35.220 --> 35:39.220
But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,

35:39.220 --> 35:43.220
guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

35:43.220 --> 35:47.220
And if I was a different type of YouTuber, I could have turned this into content.

35:47.220 --> 35:50.220
At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,

35:50.220 --> 35:53.220
why are trans lesbians so cringey?

35:53.220 --> 35:56.220
They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.220
And that's the real darkness, isn't it?

35:58.220 --> 36:03.220
Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself like an honest American.

36:03.220 --> 36:07.220
No, just sitting there in absurd denial of who you are as a person,

36:07.220 --> 36:11.220
disparaging your own repressed identity to anyone who will listen.

36:11.220 --> 36:12.220
And I'm ashamed of that too.

36:12.220 --> 36:14.220
I'm ashamed I sunk that low.

36:14.220 --> 36:17.220
But all you can do is try to get better.

36:17.220 --> 36:18.220
And I'm trying to get better.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.220
I've broken free of the denial.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.220
And now I have to break free of the shame.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.220
Because shame is literally ruining my life.

36:25.220 --> 36:28.220
I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame.

36:28.220 --> 36:33.220
And she said, I might want to mention that one of the reasons she didn't want to be with me

36:33.220 --> 36:37.220
is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.

36:37.220 --> 36:40.220
She said she feels like relationships between trans women

36:40.220 --> 36:45.220
are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society with no attempt to integrate.

36:45.220 --> 36:49.220
These are very painful words to hear from the woman you're in love with.

36:49.220 --> 36:52.220
But I understand why she feels that way.

36:52.220 --> 36:55.220
Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.

36:55.220 --> 37:00.220
But I can't be the hinge that connects her to mainstream society.

37:00.220 --> 37:02.220
And it's maddening to me that she feels that way

37:02.220 --> 37:06.220
because I would have chosen her over every cis woman in the world.

37:06.220 --> 37:10.220
But I'm just another worthless freak without the authority of society behind me.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.220
So my love doesn't count.

37:12.220 --> 37:13.220
Shame.

37:13.220 --> 37:14.220
It poisons the soul.

37:14.220 --> 37:17.220
You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,

37:17.220 --> 37:20.220
is such a basic part of your humanity.

37:20.220 --> 37:23.220
And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.220
It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.

37:25.220 --> 37:28.220
It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.

37:28.220 --> 37:31.220
It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.

37:31.220 --> 37:35.220
And living in that state of mind is garbage.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.220
It's basically hell.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.220
Even after I realized my sexuality,

37:39.220 --> 37:43.220
I considered just shoving that shit back down, never coming out.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.220
I have all these fears about it.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.220
I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.

37:47.220 --> 37:51.220
I'm worried cis women or straight women I'm friends with will get weird about it.

37:51.220 --> 37:53.220
I'm worried I'll die a lonely useless lesbian,

37:53.220 --> 37:55.220
in which case I should have just married a man,

37:55.220 --> 37:59.220
because at least then there'd be someone to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.

37:59.220 --> 38:02.220
I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.

38:02.220 --> 38:04.220
Although, I mean, love you boys,

38:04.220 --> 38:08.220
and please keep the attention coming because I need all the validation I can get right now,

38:08.220 --> 38:10.220
but I will be fine without you.

38:10.220 --> 38:15.220
And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?

38:15.220 --> 38:18.220
I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,

38:18.220 --> 38:22.220
just sacrificing my sexual orientation to regain that safe,

38:22.220 --> 38:27.220
comfortable, shameless feeling I used to have when walking down the street holding Chad's hand,

38:27.220 --> 38:30.220
feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.

38:30.220 --> 38:33.220
But if I don't deal with this now and work towards accepting myself,

38:33.220 --> 38:36.220
then I'm just going to be in the same situation in 10 years,

38:36.220 --> 38:40.220
when I'm 41 years old and married to a man and having these same feelings.

38:40.220 --> 38:41.220
So it's time for this to stop,

38:41.220 --> 38:44.220
because literally the only good thing about being gay

38:44.220 --> 38:45.220
is doing gay shit.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.220
And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,

38:47.220 --> 38:49.220
no one's going to want to do gay shit with me.

38:49.220 --> 38:52.220
As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,

38:52.220 --> 38:55.220
how in the hell are you going to prop up your narcissistic delusions?

38:55.220 --> 38:57.220
Look, I'm trying to stay positive.

38:57.220 --> 39:00.220
Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now, but just you wait.

39:00.220 --> 39:02.220
We all know how trends work.

39:02.220 --> 39:08.220
In 10 years, being a trans lesbian will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,

39:08.220 --> 39:11.220
and all the people who talk shit now will forget they ever said a word.

39:11.220 --> 39:12.220
That's right.

39:12.220 --> 39:16.220
Even the straight trans girls will be making out with each other just for the clout.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.220
Like, we can be lesbians too.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.220
We are aji.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.220
Oh, it's going to be Madonna and Britney at the 2003 VMAs all over again.

39:23.220 --> 39:25.220
Mark my words.

39:25.220 --> 39:31.220
And among cis lesbians, oh, it will actually be a sign of prestige to have a trap waifu.

39:32.220 --> 39:33.220
I can dream, right?

39:33.220 --> 39:36.220
Once you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?

39:41.220 --> 39:42.220
I can't believe it.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.220
I can't believe it.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.220
I can't believe it.

39:44.220 --> 39:45.220
I can't believe it.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.220
I can't believe it.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.220
I can't believe it.

39:47.220 --> 39:48.220
I can't believe it.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.220
I can't believe it.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.220
I can't believe it.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.220
I can't believe it.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.220
I can't believe it.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.220
I can't believe it.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.220
I can't believe it.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.220
I can't believe it.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.220
I can't believe it.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.220
I can't believe it.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.220
I can't believe it.

39:58.220 --> 39:59.220
I can't believe it.

39:59.220 --> 40:00.220
I can't believe it.

40:00.220 --> 40:01.220
I can't believe it.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.220
I can't believe it.

40:02.220 --> 40:03.220
I can't believe it.

40:03.220 --> 40:04.220
I can't believe it.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.220
I can't believe it.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.220
I can't believe it.

40:06.220 --> 40:07.220
I can't believe it.

40:07.220 --> 40:08.220
I can't believe it.

40:08.220 --> 40:09.220
I can't believe it.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.220
I can't believe it.

40:10.220 --> 40:11.220
I can't believe it.

40:11.220 --> 40:12.220
I can't believe it.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.220
I can't believe it.

40:13.220 --> 40:14.220
I can't believe it.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.220
I can't believe it.

40:36.220 --> 41:01.220
I can't believe it.

41:07.220 --> 41:35.220
Thank you.

41:35.220 --> 42:01.220
Thank you.
