1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Dass. Dass, dass, dass, dass. It's the only thing everyone fears.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the only thing that gets me off.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello, my devilish darlings. I am Lenora Lavey, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The story is rather simple, really. The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and zem.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable health care, and video games for lesbians.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ahahahahaha!

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But there's one man who stands in the way. The villain of tonight's thriller. A meddling little cipher of a man.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order to chaos.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ugh! Can you imagine?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings. Ugh!

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can our heroine put a stop to this? Well, I'm just the executioner. You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ugh!

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hi, girls. It's me, Ms. Points.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mademoiselle, poi.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Words, words, words. What do they even fucking mean?

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I don't know, and I don't care. But we have to talk about it anyway, because of a boy named Ben Shapiro. So who is Ben Shapiro?

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of The Daily Wire, and the auteur behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner, is she?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And let's be civil, right? That's the tone of the day.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm a fan.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on his edgier mantra,

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Facts don't care about your feelings?

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben. It's true. Facts don't care about my feelings.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition, this makes me feel invalidated.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad are true.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling apps, but too fucking bad for me,

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk at forever.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mmm, I was a yum-yum, though. Build me a time machine, doc.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We call this autoandrophilia, nurse. What can I say? I like younger men. I'm a cougar in tiger's clothing.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So look, I want to be treated like an adult. I don't want to be indulged. If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to tell myself to make it through the night.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's probably just dry down there. They're just ingrown hairs. I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other, of course, false and heathen religions.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I am an evangelical transsexual. I don't want toleration, dammit. I want converts.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment to talk about my womanhood? Sure. Go ahead. Touch it.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So look, Shapiro. Benny. Baby.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales to melt away every crystal of my snow flakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding tea.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right, big boy. Let's have it. I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she because you can't change your sex.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can change your name. Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man. And if he were born with a high dose of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right. You're determined by your chromosomes.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype that is XX sex chromosomes.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she. And to call you she would be tantamount to a lie.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender like woman be called she or something because it is a lie.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie and you think that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans woman she, we're saying that she has a normal female karyotype.

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But hold on. I am a transgender woman and I have never claimed to have a normal female karyotype. And yet my friends, lovers and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend, ladies.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good girl. Good girl. Just like that. Don't stop. Don't stop. Are all of us deluded about my biology? No.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro. It is you who misunderstands language.

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not. We all agree on the biology.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man and woman.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word? Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists and study the way a word, for instance, she, is used by a linguistic community.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And whatever the social convention is, is what's correct.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority, such as the dictionary, or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, if we take the descriptive approach, you lose Ben Shapiro because most people call me she, and that's all there is to it.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Once more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical. You don't put an article before a pronoun. That's not how pronouns work, you silly dumb-dumb.

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and she originate in the protodramatic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe beginning around 500 BCE.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions, so let's try out a prescriptive approach.

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word should be used?

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated by political goals.

65
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.

67
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Opponents argue the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed because it's the definition.

68
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

69
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And on the other hand, gay people argue that the definition should be changed because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of words.

71
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible, and for that matter you can change the Bible.

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean, have you read the contemporary English version? The prose is atrocious, appalling.

73
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I won't stand for this.

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more than just a political and legal dispute.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It seems to me that whatever church, state, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are and will continue to be women.

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival Blaire White.

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whom stays bad.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

79
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Blaire responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely impractical.

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt,

81
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and you had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blaire, and they said okay, and you had to describe me to take me to the table,

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you wouldn't say the man in the orange shirt, you would say Blaire, you would say her over there.

83
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ben then responds, saying,

84
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that there is a utility to the use of pronouns,

85
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but that's not quite the same as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.

86
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And Blaire responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.

87
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them that kid's parents,

88
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link at all biologically,

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's expand on that analogy.

91
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.

92
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings forth offspring.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Facts don't care about your feelings.

95
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological parent,

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

100
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?

102
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents, but we do say adoptive parents.

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right. Adoptive parents, an entirely valid type of parent. To call them parents is not a lie.

104
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly is the context that you were suggesting matters.

105
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In what context are we talking about the parents? Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

106
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has two aspects, right?

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and adoptive parents.

109
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

110
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological role of woman, which you are not,

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and then there is the, you look like a woman, which is, I'm going to describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But when Ben seems in the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

114
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind of ugly, you know what I mean?

115
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There was the, I think, I think the person's name was Zoey Turr. There was the threat of physical violence.

116
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are your genetics?

117
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

118
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that I'm saying to you right now

119
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
is exactly what I said to Zoey Turr on the air.

120
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?

121
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Zoey threatened you after you called her Sir, and you didn't call Blair Sir, did you?

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why did you call Zoey Sir?

123
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

124
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I suppose Sir is a strictly biological term.

126
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other, or tweeting out F.U., that's not a great way to change my mind.

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

128
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So what is a great way to change your mind? Ben Shapiro?

129
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

130
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It doesn't seem like she did.

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm the editor of a pre-major site, and my basic rule is that when we're discussing people who are trans,

133
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
we immediately say in the first paragraph, trans woman, and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,

134
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
because biology is the nature of the pronoun.

135
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

136
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?

137
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

138
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and biological parents.

139
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between transgender and cisgender,

140
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
or as you say, biological women.

141
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive health care you think should be illegal.

142
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But does this apply to pronouns?

143
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes,

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
or are they part of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?

145
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The answer is obvious.

146
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

147
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between ahi and ashi.

148
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

149
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.

150
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So, as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy,

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Fascinating, though it is.

154
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child,

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.

156
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is, in effect, false.

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still not.

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What's the harm, right?

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If I teach my almost four-year-old girl that she can become a boy,

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
then I think that is not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh yes, the classic argument.

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How do I explain to my child?

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Kill your shitty child for all I care.

164
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's simply not my problem.

165
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.

166
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.

167
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You and I are through.

168
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

169
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

170
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.

171
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Or maybe an orgy.

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.

173
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell-bent on destroying Western civilization.

174
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hi boys, it's points again.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In my previous video, Nasty T. Babe likes it rough.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I made an argument about why it's correct to call trans women she.

179
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.

180
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

181
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering them.

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've never watched that show.

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh.

186
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But the reality is that in a lot of cases, it's a little more complicated.

190
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.

191
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Society basically gets that I'm a woman.

192
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

193
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on TgirlLove.com?

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I got called Sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M.

197
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.

198
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And what happened next stays between me and the Lord.

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in...

201
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

202
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It wasn't cute.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking,

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I try to pass off as my voice, and my tragic inability to conduct myself

205
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding.

206
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Your girl remains, despite my desperate painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You look great, hun.

208
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And that debate between Ben and Blair,

209
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.

210
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.

212
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So appearance definitely matters,

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking like a cis woman,

214
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is really the most important thing.

215
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give me,

216
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So my goal isn't necessarily to serve on clockable fish,

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
so much as to embody a certain kind of diaphanous archetypal femininity.

220
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Also, I am going to have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And a lot of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that performing your gender is the only thing that matters

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and that how you identify counts for nothing.

225
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But that's not what I think.

226
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,

227
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because I think that's a much more compelling argument

228
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify as a woman,

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.

230
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

231
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns.

232
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And I'll explain why.

233
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive

234
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
about anyone telling them what pronouns to use.

235
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So I'm going to try to be respectful of your feelings

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
After all, we live in a repressive political era,

238
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
despite the best efforts of hero professor Jordan B. Peterson.

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But alas, he was too late.

240
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people to jail for...

241
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed.

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, I guess that was a false alarm.

244
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
God damn it.

245
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Look, I'm not going to tell you what pronouns you have to use.

246
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm just going to tell you how I use pronouns in my reasoning behind it.

247
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And you are welcome to use your free speech

248
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you want to be, okay?

249
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So, back to identity.

250
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets

251
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and a customer were to walk in looking like this,

252
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,

253
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but that would be wrong.

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,

255
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
he is THE man.

256
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
YouTube's most regal makeup artist, his lordship John McClain,

257
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and he uses he-him pronouns.

258
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Likewise, if I were approached by this person,

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns,

260
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and this time I'd be correct.

261
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but because she's genderfluid drag queen Courtney Out,

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
who is the fucking audacity to be a more beautiful woman than I am,

264
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and who, so far as I know, uses male pronouns in boy mode

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

266
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression

267
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
get played out in the world of drag.

268
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men

269
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
who live as men and perform as women.

270
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Shay Kool-Aid, and Violet Chachki, identify as non-binary.

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Others still are biokweens, cis women who perform as drag queens,

273
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
like Lucy Garland or Crème Fatale.

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And then there are trans women who are also drag queens,

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.

276
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I mean, look at me!

277
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-11 at 2 a.m.?

278
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Because I do.

279
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Look what I have become!

280
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

281
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.

282
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I just, through pure coincidence,

283
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
happen to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived.

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I am so sorry, I can't help it.

285
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So let's recap.

286
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.

287
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.

288
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns

289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
depending on their current presentation.

290
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender

291
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
other than the one they present and live as and prefer other pronouns.

292
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks

293
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because there's a lot of situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

294
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,

295
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but it's also not the only thing that matters.

296
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered,

297
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
then there would be no need for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition,

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
including requesting different pronouns,

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
because pronouns belong to the social world of language.

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Not to individual psychology.

301
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

302
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You can identify however you like,

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

304
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man,

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
then you are fully trans, your identity is fully valid,

306
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
but until you begin living as a woman,

307
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.

308
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.

309
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,

310
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and not enough on social relationships.

311
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.

312
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

313
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

314
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

315
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
they are fully trans.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience

318
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
To put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,

320
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.

321
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Many trans women just seem like women to me

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
in literally the same way that cis women seem like women,

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to do from birth.

324
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,

326
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
but at least to seem like our genders to the people around us.

327
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
As Laura Jane Grace put it,

328
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You want them to see you like they see every other girl.

329
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity.

330
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
As a trans woman.

331
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But just because I seem like a woman to them,

332
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because the reality is,

333
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,

334
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety

335
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

336
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,

337
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and I cope with that fear by looking like a second-rate drag queen.

338
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a zero percent woman,

339
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
if she tells me she's a trans woman,

340
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

341
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Not just to be polite,

342
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological experience,

343
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and especially because I want to help her resocialize

344
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.

345
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,

346
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.

347
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.

348
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

349
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
An increasing number of people identify not as male or female,

350
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
but as non-binary,

351
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels

352
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, greygender, and so on.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In English, usually they.

355
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,

356
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all

357
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
is a particular feature of the English language

358
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that's by no means shared by all other languages,

359
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.

360
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
that humans make up to suit our purposes.

362
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If you're new to using singular they,

363
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
it is a little confusing at first, but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.

364
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They poured milk on me.

365
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I poured milk on them.

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
They did anoint themselves in their milk and it was good, thus saith the Lord.

367
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So the polite thing to do here is easy.

368
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If someone asks you to call them they,

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
you call them they.

370
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You call them they.

371
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing

372
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You want to understand why you're doing it.

374
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people.

375
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I want to be a convert.

376
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I want to believe about them while they believe about themselves,

377
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
so long as those beliefs are reasonable.

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So what do all these words mean?

379
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What are these people talking about?

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
John McClain is feminine in expression, but a man in identity.

382
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Whereas I am a woman in identity and in expression, I am a mess.

383
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity,

384
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
art, science, spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.

385
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10

386
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
or high femme to stone butch the gender expression of a given domain,

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
such as Mulan looks or Steven universe characters.

388
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender,

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
greygender, and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity

391
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the Futch scale gives to expression.

392
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But my input on this isn't really worth that much because I'm not non-binary.

393
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here

394
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
because all this talk about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

396
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.

397
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And that's how I experience gender.

398
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I live, I exist as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve

399
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

400
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I identify as trash.

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman.

402
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration,

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
waiting in a long ass line for the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist,

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons in case someone asks,

405
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
a dude explaining Philosophy 101 to me and me going,

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
oh really? Wow.

407
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But you know these experiences mean different things to different people.

408
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So all I can really tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures

409
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
that taking female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures

410
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
makes me feel more at home in my body and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
socially, spiritually, sexually.

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So that's the jargon free explanation of my gender as I see it.

413
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?

414
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have.

416
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And that, I think, is legitimate enough.

417
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So I know what living as a woman means to me,

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?

419
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
that's something that's going to vary between individuals and cultures.

421
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,

422
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
such as the Hydra of South Asia, a legally recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh,

423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
or the various two spirit traditions of indigenous North American tribes.

424
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition,

425
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but we do have individual non-binary people,

426
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,

427
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

428
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.

429
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Even as a binary trans person,

430
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.

431
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.

432
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But many of the people who call themselves non-binary

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
seem to be fighting for something more radical than what I'm fighting for,

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
at least in my personal life.

435
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.

436
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Heh.

437
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.

438
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The traditional female garb of my culture.

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer-neer.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No!

441
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely,

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
they're effectively trying to create the society that includes them.

443
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people,

444
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
who, for example, promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

445
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,

446
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
provided they assume it correctly.

447
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Otherwise, I will throw you an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

448
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary,

449
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and gender non-conforming people find it easier to navigate the world

450
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.

451
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.

452
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,

453
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to do or say anything,

454
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I do hope you use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech

455
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to choose to do the same.

456
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Freely.

457
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

458
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm talking about the female lead.

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Now the fun really begins.

460
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The show's over.

461
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor,

462
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
so goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

463
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Until next week...

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Go to hell!

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
In hell!

466
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We'll go hell!

467
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
In hell!

468
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
