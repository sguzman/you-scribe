1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
yourself questions.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,360
Why is the world bad?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,520
What did all these people die for?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,680
Well, for freedom, I guess.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,080
And like, American values?

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,280
But what are those values?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want, but

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,120
they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels anyway.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Ahhh.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,400
Fucking neoliberalism.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,800
What even goes on in these big buildings?

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,400
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,680
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather?

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Drinking human blood?

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,800
Licking whipped cream off the interns?

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
What the hell even is this country?

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,320
Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place, Longhorn Steakhouse,

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,800
Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, Petsmart, Chipotle, Fridays, Dave and Busters.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,160
I guess it's not so bad.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,600
As long as you kick things up a notch.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,640
Of course, I want the fucking lava cakes.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,760
Oh, goddamn it, it was so good, but I ate so much, I think I'm gonna die.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
It's a good capitalism, maybe you do.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,560
A vast part of territory all across the Middle East.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,160
of people have that feeling.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,880
But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,240
The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,440
There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,760
sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,560
they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,680
The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,680
adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,320
jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist world

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,120
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
homeland.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,760
But till now, I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,920
do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,240
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,720
And so the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
cocks.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,000
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid IKEA consumers, capitalism did.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,800
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,280
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking, goddamn,

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
reptiles.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Chapter 1.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Capitalism and Spirit.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh god, I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,160
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,420
A leftist could easily have said that.

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,600
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
to it too.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,040
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,280
soul under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,560
who appropriates the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment

66
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,040
of inanimate objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,240
No, I don't want a landline.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,160
No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,000
Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,280
notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meeting in ancient customs,

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
And that shit's not really my scene.

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,800
as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
And here's why.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Chapter 2.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Alienated labor.

80
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,120
Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Let's come up with something new.

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,040
Chapter 2.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Shitty jobs.

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,080
Why is your job so shitty?

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center and

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,800
you spend your day dealing with whiny and titled white bitches who don't understand

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
that you're just a lackey without any actual power.

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,840
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
at each other.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
a gear.

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,280
The CEO makes $36 million a year while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of

94
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,240
the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,040
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,920
your fellow employees for a promotion or even to not be laid off.

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,800
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,840
shitty job as a concrete lifter or a mud mule or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook person.

100
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,560
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

101
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,320
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

102
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,560
And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate

103
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,280
in team building exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not

104
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,080
only do you have a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
of openly hating your life.

106
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,560
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

107
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,960
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,760
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

109
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,640
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,040
They'll call you an independent contractor.

111
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,640
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

112
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,000
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,480
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

114
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,920
paid leave, or pension.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,160
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,080
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
Chapter 3, advertising.

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,120
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

119
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,000
What if each section is named after an episode in The Odyssey?

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,760
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

121
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,280
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

123
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

124
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,080
a basic feature of the human condition.

125
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,480
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
life under capitalism.

127
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,920
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,840
up with advertisements for…

129
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh.

130
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
So many fans.

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Contrapoints is a tanky confirmed, a neoliberal tanky.

132
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,400
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,080
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

134
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,240
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,200
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

136
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,640
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

137
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,600
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational, for instance,

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,560
randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities the product

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,880
promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating the product

140
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,840
with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,560
the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,

142
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,000
gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,040
original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.

144
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Is this rational?

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,760
Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?

146
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Of course not!

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,880
The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,080
to endlessly create new needs.

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,720
And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a lot of stamina, which is why it's a good

150
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,760
Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,960
for a sustainable blast in power.

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,360
With all natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,720
and indifference to pain that I need to get it in.

155
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,640
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammos, then I take

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,400
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Vitalimax, for bottoms!

158
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires, which they implant in your

159
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
brain through advertising.

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,920
Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,400
of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.

162
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,000
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,680
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to

164
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
want and then sell it to you.

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,000
And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,280
egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.

167
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,520
On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,

168
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,040
spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more

169
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,080
than half a million homeless people and 13 million children who have to go to school

170
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
hungry.

171
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,960
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet

172
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,000
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes and there are apparently Americans who are

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,240
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.

174
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
I mean, it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really

175
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?

176
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

177
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,060
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe.

178
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,280
But shouldn't the economy serve humanity rather than the other way around?

179
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,360
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,480
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?

181
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,480
No cost to the planet, great! Save our lover, too!

182
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,440
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,560
Canto IV, message to the rich.

184
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Alright, you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up!

185
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,920
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.

186
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,440
I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little

187
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,920
significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,480
are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

189
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here, recent polling data shows that a majority

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,040
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of

192
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,920
the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

193
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,200
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.

194
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,720
You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this when

195
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,400
there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.

196
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,760
They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

197
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,200
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix some

198
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,920
shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.

199
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,520
I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

200
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,000
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,640
thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

202
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,840
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

203
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,960
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going, something is gonna have to change,

204
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,840
and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,240
The choice is up to you.

206
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Well, are you going to answer the phone?

207
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
There is no phone.

208
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,920
There is only the side of the oppressed creature.

209
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,920
The heart of a heartless world.

210
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,920
The soul of a soulless condition.

211
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
It's best to just try and ignore it.

212
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Episode 5, Message to the Youth

213
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Alright kids, so you're angry.

214
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Well, good.

215
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
The world sucks.

216
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
There's a lot to be angry about.

217
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.

218
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

219
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
So, what do we do?

220
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Smash?

221
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Tabby, get in here.

222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Sit down.

223
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.

224
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Harsh words have been exchanged.

225
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
But I need young radicals like you in my life.

226
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,920
The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.

227
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
So I apologize.

228
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I never meant to hurt you.

229
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Baby, I'm sorry.

230
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I mean, look, I get it.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Smashing is fun.

232
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
But we also need to have a real plan.

233
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
That's all I'm saying.

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
So what's the plan?

235
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Revolution.

236
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Okay.

237
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Yeah, revolution.

238
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I mean, you're right.

239
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Donald Trump is president.

240
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Fuck it.

241
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Revolution.

242
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
We've gotta get better people in office.

243
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

244
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
No, revolution.

245
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Yes, I know revolution.

246
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
But what kind of revolution?

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Like, project mayhem, gather your muskets ye militia men and water the tree of liberty what?

248
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
No, I mean direct action.

249
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Okay, so like a general strike?

250
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
No, end capitalism.

251
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here because I really don't.

252
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
But I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive

253
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
than just saying the word revolution.

254
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Like, I'm in support of radical movements.

255
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings.

256
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,

257
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
they shift the Overton window to the left,

258
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
and they can have a big cultural impact.

259
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
But none of them so far has ended capitalism.

260
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,920
And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power.

261
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
And we can change the state through electoral politics.

262
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
So why not direct some serious energy toward that?

263
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China,

264
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
but no elected politician has ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US.

265
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
So why do you think that will work?

266
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,

267
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,920
finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?

268
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Well, you're not entirely wrong.

269
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,920
But on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were not exactly super great.

270
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,920
And in any case, I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army

271
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

272
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion

273
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,920
and getting affordable healthcare and education

274
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?

275
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
What if the 2020 election is postponed?

276
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically.

277
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Why not just be honest about your political stance?

278
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Are you a democratic socialist or would you actually support a revolution?

279
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

280
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Now, for you, counterpoints.

281
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
I mean, you're still a heretic in an enemy of the Imperium

282
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,920
and you are a demonetto slaanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

283
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Well, what exactly are your positions?

284
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Um, well...

285
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Kill everyone now!

286
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Condone first-degree murder!

287
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Advocate cannibalism!

288
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Eat shit!

289
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Filth are my politics?

290
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Eat reptiles?

291
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

292
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring

293
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,920
and it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles.

294
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist.

295
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?

296
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books.

297
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Have you been the same beset of Horkheimer?

298
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Have you read Horkheimer?

299
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Yes.

300
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Have you read Kropotkin?

301
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes.

302
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Have you read Bakunin?

303
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
No.

304
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

305
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Have you read Plekhanov?

306
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Have you read Goldman?

307
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Have you read Zetkin?

308
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Have you read Gramsci?

309
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Have you read Grindelwald?

310
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?

311
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

312
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Have you read Slutskinarevsky?

313
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Tabby!

314
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I have half a PhD in reading tedious Blowhards

315
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.

316
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish

317
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
is a prerequisite for talking to you,

318
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

319
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I think I'm just gonna go.

320
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
This isn't really working out.

321
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Wait, Tabby.

322
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

323
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,920
If you ever change your mind

324
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,920
about leaving, leaving me behind

325
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

326
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Bring your sweet loving.

327
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Bring it on on to me.

328
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I know I laugh when you left

330
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,920
but now I only, I only hurt myself.

331
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

332
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Bring your sweet love.

333
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Bring it on on to me.

334
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I'll bring you jewelry and money too

336
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,920
but that ain't only all I do for you.

337
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Oh, baby, bring it to me.

338
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Bring your sweet love.

339
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Bring it on on to me.

340
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I know I'll always be your slave

342
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,920
until I'm buried, buried in my grave.

343
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Tabby, bring it to me.

344
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Bring your sweet love.

345
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Bring it on on to me.

346
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Bring it on home, catgirl.

349
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Unsubscribed.

350
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
It's fucking 2018, man.
