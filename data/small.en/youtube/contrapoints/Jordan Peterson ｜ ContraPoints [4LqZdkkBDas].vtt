WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
My lords, ladies, and theirs that lieth betweeks, Tis evident nor sensation nor the passions

00:09.280 --> 00:15.160
possess dominion over the mind of man, which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of

00:15.160 --> 00:21.560
all faculties.

00:21.560 --> 00:27.320
It must needs be remarked that the power of the commonwealth deriveth not from the despotical

00:27.320 --> 00:33.840
acquisitions of conquerors, but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth

00:33.840 --> 00:34.840
the lobster.

00:34.840 --> 00:39.240
Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?

00:39.240 --> 00:43.960
Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.280
Monsieur Ting, I'm not going to kiss your hand, you freak, I'm more of a woman than

00:48.280 --> 00:49.280
you are.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.640
It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.400
Clock me, Amadeus.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
Don't break the fourth wall.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.920
I'm trying to make a video about post-modernism.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.120
Get out of my drawing room, 18th century sexual deviance.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.920
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.

01:02.920 --> 01:14.920
Reason, power, truth, these are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.920
Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.480
So who's Jordan Peterson?

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
Wow.

01:22.480 --> 01:29.240
He's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, who got famous for sounding the

01:29.240 --> 01:34.040
alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely

01:34.040 --> 01:35.560
lead to Stalinism.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.600
Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.760
David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the western world, and

01:42.760 --> 01:46.800
his self-help book, 12 Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.880
I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.640
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here because I want to

01:54.640 --> 01:55.640
talk.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.440
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson haven't really engaged with his ideas very

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
much.

02:00.440 --> 02:05.080
He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past, as in the infamous BBC interview where

02:05.080 --> 02:09.720
Kathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.760
So you were saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they

02:13.760 --> 02:14.760
deserve.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.960
No, I'm saying that that's one component.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.440
You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
That's murderous.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
You're just saying things though to provoke, aren't you?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I mean, you are a provocateur.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I never say anything.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.200
You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.040
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.040
I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are, like, afraid of his

02:35.040 --> 02:36.040
actual ideas.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.880
But I'm not afraid of his ideas.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.120
I'm not afraid of anything.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.440
I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
Daddy.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.520
I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts

02:52.520 --> 02:57.280
and reading his books, and honestly, I think I get why people like him.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.520
Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.880
His book, 12 Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly

03:06.880 --> 03:10.240
Effective People or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.000
The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like, take responsibility

03:15.000 --> 03:19.920
for yourself, don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings

03:19.920 --> 03:24.720
of psychology, philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.800
He's telling us a pretty classic story.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.720
Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering, so you need

03:30.720 --> 03:32.520
a higher purpose in your life.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.520
But I knew that already.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.600
I learned it at the AA meetings I refuse to go to.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.160
These are, like, basic insights of world philosophy and religion, but they're insights that today's

03:41.160 --> 03:46.520
youths apparently haven't heard before, I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.240
Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with, so to a

03:50.240 --> 03:53.440
lot of people, Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.320
And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.360
Most of Peterson's fans are young men, and, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards

04:00.360 --> 04:04.280
into shape, and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.720
I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy, and sometimes girls do too.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.200
But, there's a big problem here, and the problem is that all of this life coaching

04:14.200 --> 04:18.520
is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.

04:18.520 --> 04:22.880
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help not merely as a guide to private life, but

04:22.880 --> 04:27.920
as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.

04:27.920 --> 04:33.080
There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?

04:33.080 --> 04:34.200
Why not?

04:34.200 --> 04:38.400
The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.160
Now Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics because that doesn't sound scary

04:42.160 --> 04:43.160
enough.

04:43.160 --> 04:48.720
His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.

04:48.720 --> 04:54.640
Now we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism with cultural Marxism, the Nazi

04:54.640 --> 04:58.600
conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.440
Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?

05:01.440 --> 05:02.440
Right?

05:02.440 --> 05:06.760
So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist, and you may quote me

05:06.760 --> 05:12.000
on that, but I am wondering if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals

05:12.000 --> 05:16.080
plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?

05:16.080 --> 05:19.440
Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.880
So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson, Professor, Daddy, let's talk.

05:24.880 --> 05:29.320
And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect

05:29.320 --> 05:30.560
I think it deserves.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.760
Mmm, that's good, that's good temperature.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.760
Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.760
Thanks, Daddy.

05:47.760 --> 05:52.760
It's really an honor to bathe with a public intellectual of your stature.

05:52.760 --> 05:58.640
You know, I never like to argue in the bath, so I want to start by telling you the things

05:58.640 --> 05:59.640
I like about you.

05:59.640 --> 06:04.200
The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the left, the stifling of even

06:04.200 --> 06:09.560
slightly different opinions, the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments, the

06:09.560 --> 06:15.320
politics of resentment, are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.880
I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person, oh god

06:19.880 --> 06:22.240
the dysphoria, please don't watch it.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.200
But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very

06:26.200 --> 06:31.120
localized problem, and I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could

06:31.120 --> 06:33.080
be hurt by that backlash.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.680
Like fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists, but

06:37.680 --> 06:43.880
if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights, that would

06:43.880 --> 06:45.480
be bad, right?

06:47.480 --> 06:50.240
I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.

06:50.240 --> 06:56.200
I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom, but clearly, the sheep need

06:56.200 --> 06:58.840
a shepherd, and you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.680
You know, on the left, we don't really tell people what to do.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.960
We tell them what not to do.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.480
Don't exploit the workers.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.960
Do not do blackface.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.800
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people, but that's a pretty small

07:09.800 --> 07:14.800
rule compared to some of your rules, like how to raise your children, or when it's

07:14.800 --> 07:16.560
okay to criticize things.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.680
The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.

07:20.680 --> 07:25.480
I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons were talking about Plato and

07:25.480 --> 07:31.160
Aristotle and the meaning of life, and I thought, huh, on the left, we don't really talk about

07:31.160 --> 07:32.440
that kind of thing.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.160
What we talk about is how society oppresses people, and that might not be enough, because

07:37.160 --> 07:39.200
people need to have a positive purpose in life.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.680
I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.400
I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons of Strangers with Candy

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
until I die.

07:46.400 --> 07:52.640
But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus, other white guys who talk about lobsters,

07:52.640 --> 07:57.800
they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering and, like, not just complain

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
about patriarchy.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.440
I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy when patriarchy isn't the thing

08:02.440 --> 08:06.560
that's making you suffer, but I do think that an education that only teaches people about

08:06.560 --> 08:08.160
oppression is inadequate.

08:08.160 --> 08:13.200
We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad, and then we say, well,

08:13.200 --> 08:17.440
you're educated now, good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!

08:17.440 --> 08:19.480
And that really kind of sucks.

08:19.480 --> 08:24.400
But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made without comparing transgender

08:24.400 --> 08:26.000
activism to Stalin.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.040
I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.240
See, this is when you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.880
If you don't establish dominance, I'm just going to mouth off.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.160
They use all this compassion language, and I'm on the side of the oppressed, all of

08:42.160 --> 08:43.840
that posturing.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.320
It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.

08:47.320 --> 08:51.400
And I've just been starting to review their curriculum for children from kindergarten

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
to grade 8.

08:52.400 --> 08:58.920
This pure social justice, postmodernism, the people who hold this doctrine, this radical

08:58.920 --> 09:04.480
postmodern communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender

09:04.480 --> 09:12.440
identity or some kind of group identity paramount, they've got control over the most low to mid-level

09:12.440 --> 09:17.680
bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well, but even in the United States where

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
you know, there's a lot of...

09:22.400 --> 09:50.840
So you've got to give it to JP.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.680
When he says stand up straight with your shoulders back, he means it.

09:54.680 --> 09:59.280
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences with fairly popular

09:59.280 --> 10:00.520
opinions.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.920
Political correctness often feels stifling.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.240
Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.760
Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use, and I don't like it.

10:09.760 --> 10:14.820
But once he draws you in with these inviting preludes, he leads you to a pretty weird place.

10:14.820 --> 10:19.880
His central political message is that leftist professors, student activists, campus diversity

10:19.880 --> 10:24.560
initiatives, and corporate HR departments are collectively following the philosophy

10:24.560 --> 10:30.840
of postmodern neo-Marxism to destroy Western civilization and sink us all into a totalitarian

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
nightmare.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.080
Now there's just no avoiding that this idea is actually pretty similar to the cultural

10:36.080 --> 10:41.400
Marxism or cultural Bolshevism theory, but I'm just gonna ignore that because if I dwell

10:41.400 --> 10:45.920
on it, I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist and then everyone will think

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
I'm crazy.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.360
Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists, I don't like to hide.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.160
So let's just try not to think about that and instead, straightforwardly ask, is it

10:56.160 --> 10:59.800
true that postmodern neo-Marxism is out to destroy us all?

10:59.800 --> 11:03.360
Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?

11:03.360 --> 11:07.600
We all know what Marxism is, the idea that society should be understood as a class struggle

11:07.600 --> 11:11.520
between workers and capitalists and that the workers will eventually revolt.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.940
Some college professors definitely do believe that, but zero percent of corporate HR departments

11:16.020 --> 11:19.420
do, so that, okay.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.980
So what is postmodernism?

11:20.980 --> 11:24.140
Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.

11:24.140 --> 11:27.860
Some people try to explain it by listing all the things that are called postmodern and

11:27.860 --> 11:30.340
then trying to guess what they have in common.

11:30.340 --> 11:33.940
That's basically what the YouTuber ArmouredSkeptic did in his video about it.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.460
So many daddies in this video.

11:35.460 --> 11:39.940
We should invite them all to a barbecue, complain about postmodernism, listen to some Zeppelin.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.660
I've had worse evenings.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.540
I don't think there really is a common thread linking all the things called postmodern.

11:45.540 --> 11:49.700
Basically postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945 that seemed to me at the time.

11:49.700 --> 11:54.980
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism, he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.260
He's talking about postmodern philosophy.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.260
So what's that?

11:58.260 --> 12:01.540
Well, basically it's a kind of skepticism.

12:01.540 --> 12:06.780
Not YouTube skepticism, but actual skepticism, you know, like having doubts about whether

12:06.780 --> 12:09.020
humans can really know things about the world.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.780
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea, that goes way back to ancient times.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.660
But more specifically, postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

12:18.660 --> 12:19.860
So what's modernism?

12:19.860 --> 12:20.660
What's what?

12:20.660 --> 12:21.460
What are words?

12:21.460 --> 12:22.340
What's anything?

12:22.340 --> 12:25.700
I'm going to divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.220
First, there's early modernism.

12:27.220 --> 12:31.780
Early modernism is the philosophy developed by a bunch of boring 18th century queens

12:31.780 --> 12:34.660
which says that we can form universal theories about the world

12:34.660 --> 12:38.100
through observation and reasoning aka the scientific method.

12:38.100 --> 12:42.260
Now that turns out to work pretty well for whatever questions you have about plants

12:42.260 --> 12:46.100
and crystals and how to medically reconfigure human genitals.

12:46.100 --> 12:49.540
But it has some limits, which was pointed out by David Hume,

12:49.540 --> 12:53.460
one of the least boring 18th century queens and one of the only philosophers

12:53.460 --> 12:58.900
I can actually put up with in small doses even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.020
This is a call out.

13:00.020 --> 13:03.060
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,

13:03.060 --> 13:08.100
you can't really know much about important things like morality, causation, and the self

13:08.100 --> 13:10.820
because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.460
Anyway, then the late modernists came along and they said,

13:13.460 --> 13:16.420
fuck Hume, we're going to do science about those things anyway.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.940
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards

13:19.940 --> 13:24.580
who one way or another tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.

13:24.580 --> 13:27.140
So for example, you have psychoanalysis,

13:27.140 --> 13:31.060
which said human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives,

13:31.060 --> 13:32.820
which is of course ridiculous.

13:32.820 --> 13:34.820
I'm conscious of all my drives.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.500
And you got Marxism with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.820
You got early sociology and anthropology,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.460
which started out with racist social evolutionism

13:43.460 --> 13:46.900
and progressed to a kind of we're all the same universalism.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.540
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.540
His first book, Maps of Meaning,

13:51.540 --> 13:56.260
is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world and create order out of chaos

13:56.260 --> 13:58.500
through universal myths and archetypes,

13:58.500 --> 14:01.940
which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.860
Boy, this is a lot of explaining.

14:03.860 --> 14:06.820
It's so much explaining, it's triggering gender dysphoria.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.260
I better put on some longer nails.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.180
Nails?

14:10.180 --> 14:11.940
Is that all womanhood means to you?

14:15.300 --> 14:18.260
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

14:18.260 --> 14:22.340
So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories about reality,

14:22.340 --> 14:23.860
history, and humanity,

14:23.860 --> 14:27.780
postmodernists say, actually, no, that's not possible.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.700
For example, the French postmodernist,

14:29.700 --> 14:30.980
Michel Foucault.

14:30.980 --> 14:31.700
Sargon?

14:32.660 --> 14:34.100
You little gooths?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.140
Michel Foucault.

14:35.140 --> 14:39.860
wrote intellectual histories of subjects like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,

14:39.860 --> 14:44.020
in which he argued that we should not understand these histories as straightforward progressions

14:44.020 --> 14:46.100
toward liberty and scientific truth,

14:46.100 --> 14:51.700
but rather as mere shifts in the way that power orders our institutions and populations.

14:51.700 --> 14:54.820
The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.020
Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.260
If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.620
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,

15:01.620 --> 15:06.580
irony being the skeptical caution with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness

15:06.580 --> 15:12.500
that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world is not the final or best vocabulary.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.940
All right, that's enough explaining.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.060
And my nails are done.

15:15.060 --> 15:15.940
Check it out.

15:15.940 --> 15:18.420
Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails?

15:18.420 --> 15:23.220
But do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them with barely concealed visceral rage?

15:23.220 --> 15:24.980
Well, I have a solution for you.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.660
The bisexual manicure.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.740
One hand for the V, one hand for the D.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.980
Both for degeneracy.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.740
It's absolutely filthy.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.900
So we've got all the pieces on the table.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.900
Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.900
On the one hand, we have Marxism,

15:38.900 --> 15:44.020
a fundamentally modernist worldview that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.260
On the other hand, we have postmodernism,

15:46.260 --> 15:51.380
a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity to know any universal truth is about anything.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.900
On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.700
And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,

15:57.700 --> 16:00.820
with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre calling Foucault

16:00.820 --> 16:04.180
the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.

16:04.180 --> 16:08.740
And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died, capitalism did end forever.

16:13.060 --> 16:16.580
So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?

16:16.580 --> 16:20.660
Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists were in some way influenced by Marxism,

16:20.660 --> 16:23.220
so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.900
But that's not what Peterson means.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.500
It's clear from the way he uses the term

16:26.580 --> 16:30.420
that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical than it initially appears.

16:30.420 --> 16:35.540
Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to include not only postmodern intellectuals

16:35.540 --> 16:38.740
and Marxist intellectuals, but also liberal politicians,

16:38.740 --> 16:43.300
academic administrators, and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,

16:43.300 --> 16:49.140
and so-called identity politics activists, including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.620
Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.

16:51.620 --> 16:55.860
Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally at odds,

16:55.860 --> 17:00.500
since Marxism is a big story about a struggle between two clear and distinct groups,

17:00.500 --> 17:04.500
and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,

17:04.500 --> 17:08.020
and about the stability of binaries like bourgeoisie and proletariat.

17:08.020 --> 17:13.220
But that's not the only tension in Peterson's clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.

17:13.220 --> 17:16.100
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows

17:16.100 --> 17:20.580
that Marxists and identity politics activists are constantly at each other's throats,

17:20.580 --> 17:23.780
because the Marxists accuse the activists of being bourgeois dogs

17:23.780 --> 17:28.660
who want more female CEOs of color and more disabled transgender drone pilots,

17:28.660 --> 17:32.660
while the activists accuse the Marxists of being a boys' club of brochelists,

17:32.660 --> 17:36.580
no more woke on gender and race issues than the average Jordan Peterson fan.

17:36.580 --> 17:42.020
Most often, these accusations are correct, because everyone is problematic and I disown them all.

17:42.020 --> 17:46.740
And then there's also the conflict between the identity politics activists and the postmodernists.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.940
Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?

17:50.020 --> 17:51.860
There's nothing postmodern about it.

17:51.860 --> 17:56.660
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice for particular groups,

17:56.660 --> 18:00.180
such as women, people of color, and gay and trans people.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.340
This kind of activism presupposes that these group categories exist

18:04.340 --> 18:07.060
and are a useful basis for political organizing.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.460
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.

18:09.460 --> 18:13.620
They want to show that these categories, race, gender, sexual orientation,

18:13.620 --> 18:18.100
are contingent social constructs and are themselves potentially oppressive.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.580
This is why conventional feminist activists often hate postmodern feminism.

18:22.580 --> 18:26.260
Because the postmodern feminists want to show that the whole concept of womanhood,

18:26.260 --> 18:29.460
for instance, is contingent and potentially oppressive,

18:29.460 --> 18:32.500
and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.820
And then the conventional feminist activists say,

18:34.820 --> 18:39.540
the fuck, we need the concept of womanhood to organize around women's political interests.

18:39.540 --> 18:43.780
How are we supposed to do that if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?

18:43.780 --> 18:46.260
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,

18:46.260 --> 18:51.140
well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler, the most famous postmodern feminist ever.

18:51.140 --> 18:56.020
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics when identity becomes its own policy,

18:56.020 --> 18:59.220
bringing with it those who would police it from various sides?

18:59.220 --> 19:02.500
And this is not a call to return to silence or invisibility,

19:02.500 --> 19:06.500
but rather to make use of a category that can be called into question,

19:06.500 --> 19:08.980
made to account for what it excludes.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.460
If you take the first part of that quote out of context,

19:11.460 --> 19:14.100
it almost sounds like something Jordan Peterson could have said.

19:14.100 --> 19:19.220
The difference is that JP actually does think we should return to silence and invisibility.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.180
Or does he?

19:20.180 --> 19:22.020
It's hard to tell what he thinks.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.220
More on that in a moment.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.540
I bring all of this up to show that one,

19:25.540 --> 19:31.860
the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical,

19:31.860 --> 19:36.980
and two, identity politics is not this dogma that must go unquestioned.

19:36.980 --> 19:41.060
There are sophisticated debates about this going on within leftist academia,

19:41.140 --> 19:44.500
but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that or doesn't care.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.700
He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism to characterize the left as a unified philosophical

19:49.700 --> 19:55.060
force bent on destroying Western civilization when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

19:55.060 --> 19:58.580
who can't stop squabbling with each other over every goddamn little issue.

19:58.580 --> 20:03.460
The only reason I can think of that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force

20:03.460 --> 20:08.260
is if you're so far to the right that literally everyone who supports the economic and social

20:08.260 --> 20:12.260
advancement of disadvantaged groups looks like one homogenous enemy.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.260
But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?

20:14.260 --> 20:18.740
That he opposes all social progress for women, racial, and sexual minorities?

20:18.740 --> 20:23.380
Well it's difficult to say, because while he spends much of his time comparing activists

20:23.380 --> 20:28.340
for these movements to 20th century mass murderers, he resists being pinned down to

20:28.340 --> 20:30.020
any more specific position.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.580
I was maybe too harsh on Kathy Newman earlier.

20:32.580 --> 20:35.940
She came out of the interview looking bad, but she had a tough job to do.

20:35.940 --> 20:39.700
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves saying something that's more or less

20:39.700 --> 20:44.500
uncontroversially true, while at the same time implying something controversial.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.740
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like there are biological differences

20:48.740 --> 20:51.300
between men and women, which is obviously true.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.140
But he'll say it in the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation

20:55.140 --> 20:59.300
of women in government, which implies… what exactly?

20:59.300 --> 21:00.820
So how do you respond to this?

21:00.820 --> 21:05.140
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement,

21:05.140 --> 21:09.620
or you have to guess at what he's implying in response to which he can accuse you of

21:09.620 --> 21:13.940
misrepresenting him, which is exactly what happened with the Kathy Newman interview.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.420
The most famous moment where Peterson does this is the notorious lobster argument.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.620
So he starts by saying,

21:19.620 --> 21:25.620
There's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct

21:25.620 --> 21:27.220
of the Western patriarchy.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.340
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,

21:30.340 --> 21:34.020
and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,

21:34.020 --> 21:36.900
so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.

21:36.900 --> 21:41.940
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters?

21:41.940 --> 21:45.700
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals

21:45.700 --> 21:48.340
and human beings organize their structures.

21:48.340 --> 21:51.700
The problem with that is that no one has ever said

21:51.700 --> 21:55.700
that every hierarchy is the product of Western patriarchy.

21:55.700 --> 22:00.020
This is such a massive straw man that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation

22:00.020 --> 22:03.140
of Peterson suggested by Kathy Newman in this interview.

22:03.140 --> 22:07.220
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.900
Even the anarchists whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies

22:10.900 --> 22:14.500
limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.060
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.

22:17.060 --> 22:22.820
The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics within our own society,

22:22.820 --> 22:25.700
to which the lobster case is a complete non-sequitur.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.540
I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument the same way he uses it

22:29.540 --> 22:32.660
to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,

22:32.660 --> 22:34.180
no matter how unjust.

22:34.180 --> 22:38.100
You could be an 18th century Republican arguing against the monarchy,

22:38.100 --> 22:40.260
and the monarch could turn around and say,

22:40.260 --> 22:42.500
well, hierarchies are inevitable.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.940
God save the lobster queen.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.060
Oh dear God.

22:47.780 --> 22:51.940
My lords, ladies, and those of life betweeks,

22:51.940 --> 22:55.780
present rumors of Republican rumblings amongst the rabble

22:55.780 --> 22:58.900
have compelled us to summon you together.

22:58.900 --> 23:03.540
Let us remind you that nature has so made the lobster

23:03.540 --> 23:07.060
that some individuals be stronger than the others.

23:07.060 --> 23:15.060
Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty be anywise impugned.

23:15.060 --> 23:21.460
And as for parliamentarians, well, let them vote for cake.

23:24.180 --> 23:24.980
Very good.

23:24.980 --> 23:25.540
Thank you.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.740
I need new roommates.

23:30.740 --> 23:34.180
So I've argued that Peterson is invoking the incoherent concept

23:34.180 --> 23:37.220
of postmodern neo-Marxism as the supervillain

23:37.220 --> 23:40.020
in a childishly simple worldview he's promoting

23:40.020 --> 23:43.140
where these evil leftists are out to destroy the West.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.860
Now it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.

23:45.860 --> 23:48.340
What, exactly, is the West?

23:48.340 --> 23:51.140
Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West

23:51.140 --> 23:52.980
that describes the intellectual tradition

23:52.980 --> 23:56.740
that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.

23:56.740 --> 24:01.060
Now a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West

24:01.060 --> 24:05.300
and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary and supremacist

24:05.300 --> 24:08.420
and justifies imperialism and all that kind of thing.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.180
But we don't have time for that right now.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.420
So I'm just going to grant that the West is a thing

24:12.420 --> 24:14.660
and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.

24:14.660 --> 24:17.860
For Peterson, the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism,

24:17.860 --> 24:21.940
individualism, the idea that each human has a spark of divinity

24:22.020 --> 24:25.220
and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,

24:25.220 --> 24:29.700
a term more popular with conservative pundits than intellectual historians.

24:29.700 --> 24:34.100
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values with postmodern neo-Marxism,

24:34.100 --> 24:39.140
which he describes as anti-Western, collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.

24:39.140 --> 24:43.220
This framing of a conflict of ideas in terms of geographical chauvinism

24:43.220 --> 24:46.580
and external threat is inaccurate and scaremongering.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.820
Marxism is Western philosophy.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.140
Postmodernism is Western philosophy.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.340
If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries

24:54.340 --> 24:58.660
of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.

24:58.660 --> 25:04.020
Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western.

25:04.020 --> 25:08.900
The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs

25:08.900 --> 25:12.820
is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty

25:12.820 --> 25:15.300
over collective dogma should be on board with.

25:15.300 --> 25:19.220
You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy

25:19.300 --> 25:22.660
with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.

25:22.660 --> 25:27.060
I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson talk about the Western tradition,

25:27.060 --> 25:30.100
but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.780
If you did read it, you'd find a surprising diversity of thought

25:33.780 --> 25:36.900
that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.

25:36.900 --> 25:42.020
Much of Plato's political dialogues are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,

25:42.020 --> 25:45.780
suggesting that, far from being an invention of postmodernity,

25:45.780 --> 25:50.180
it was actually a pretty popular worldview among ancient Athenian pederasts.

25:50.180 --> 25:55.300
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher, David Hume, famously said that reason is,

25:55.300 --> 26:00.660
and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, literally feels over reals.

26:00.660 --> 26:06.420
And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade, was advocating the abolition of morality,

26:06.420 --> 26:11.620
filling the churches with scat porn, and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion

26:11.620 --> 26:15.940
so decadent and depraved, I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.

26:15.940 --> 26:19.140
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,

26:19.140 --> 26:24.660
and it's just as much a part of the West as Peterson's soggy Bible-patting conservatism.

26:24.660 --> 26:30.100
But again, and I really can't stress this enough, I don't care either way.

26:30.100 --> 26:34.420
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.260
So what do you people want from me?

26:36.260 --> 26:37.780
The lobster queen is dead.

26:37.780 --> 26:38.740
Long live the queen.

26:41.620 --> 27:10.100
I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the lobster queen, I'll save the queen.

27:10.100 --> 27:38.580
I'll save the lobster queen.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.180
And I think you would agree that there's just a foundational erosion that,

27:42.820 --> 27:46.340
I think people of all sides, and I think there's totally intellectually smart people

27:46.340 --> 27:47.540
on the far left that can help.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.100
Where are those people?

27:50.100 --> 27:56.020
There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in, that I watch,

27:56.020 --> 27:59.140
and I don't mean to misgender her because I think she identifies with her,

27:59.860 --> 28:02.020
ContraPoints, I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber,

28:02.020 --> 28:03.060
who's on the far left.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.260
I've seen the name come up every now and again.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.300
Totally disagree with everything this person says.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.500
When I look at it, I'm like, this seems very reasonable, educated, academic.

28:11.220 --> 28:15.220
And I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone's in love.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.900
Hello, Dave.
