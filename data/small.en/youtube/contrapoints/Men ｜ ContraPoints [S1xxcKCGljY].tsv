0	7920	Hi boys, it's me again.
7920	8920	Just your average girl.
8920	14120	Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able
14120	16880	to converse as men.
16880	21280	I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between
21280	23120	now and the decline of Rome.
23120	24460	Do you like history, boys?
24460	25920	How did Rome fall again?
25920	27760	Was it the gays?
27760	29180	Tell me all about it.
29260	34220	Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's
34220	36060	rights activists on the other.
36060	42460	Whatever happened to that, these days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.
42460	44220	I did want to do the fedora though.
44220	48540	Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I
48540	50460	wanted to put my own little twist on it.
50460	56620	My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA Femme Fatale and fedora would make it fashion.
56620	57620	School shooter realness.
57700	63540	I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-peeled Carmen Sandiego.
63540	68620	In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?
68620	76180	Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.
76180	80460	Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting
80460	82700	in a state of psychological balance?
82700	86100	Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?
86100	87780	I guess, yeah, kind of.
87780	90940	You don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual medicine cabinets.
90940	93100	I'm losing my target audience here.
93100	96700	Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.
96700	98740	And I'm not saying I'm any better.
98740	100780	To be clear, I'm not okay either.
100780	104180	There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.
104180	105700	Yeah, that's right.
105700	107140	Women pee too, okay?
107140	108140	Get over it.
108140	112620	I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will
112620	115460	not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.
116100	121980	You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?
121980	124380	Ugh, I suppose I was too.
124380	129100	I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological
129100	130980	female and as a Pisces moon.
130980	136540	But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, contrapine, for men, I started brushing
136540	142940	up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.
142940	147580	So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus
147580	151900	Logico-Philosophicus, and of course, the philosophical classic, The Rational Male by
151900	152900	Ruyo Caliente.
152900	159020	So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating
159020	161020	intellectual interchange.
161020	164620	Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?
164620	167460	So there will be no emotions in this video.
167460	174060	I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,
174060	175660	and deductive proof.
175660	187420	Actually, you know what?
187420	188420	Fuck that.
188420	190740	Let's listen to house music and do sax drugs.
197460	208860	I'm pandering to the male gaze.
208860	212100	Oh, and the male straits.
212100	213860	God, I love attention.
213860	214860	Hey, gorge.
214860	215860	Hey, gorge.
215860	216860	Hey, gorge.
216860	219140	Okay, I'm ready.
219140	221820	Let's crack open a cold one, boys.
221820	225140	My hands are too pretty to open the can.
225140	227900	I need a man to do it for me.
227900	228900	Help.
228900	229900	Fuck it.
229900	230900	Okay, that's super funny.
230900	231900	Hey, gorge.
231900	232900	Hey, gorge.
232900	237860	Are there any women still watching this video?
237860	242500	I'm really sorry about all this unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case, how
242500	243500	very dare.
243500	244500	I'm a good Presbyterian.
244500	247100	And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.
247100	248100	Hey, how are you?
248100	251540	Look, the video is about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.
251540	253460	Am I doing this right?
253460	254460	Is this what men like?
254460	255460	Traps.
255460	256460	Traps.
256460	258220	It is a risky look for a girl like me.
258220	261660	When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere on the Frankenfurter
261660	263660	Violet Chachke-Diedevonti's spectrum.
263660	268700	Oh, but you don't know where exactly, and that is a dangerous game, ladies.
268700	275900	I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now, but that
275900	277900	could be because of the drugs.
277900	282740	Look, gentlemen, let's be rational, and we're fooling around, okay?
282740	283740	Part one.
283980	286500	Oh, wait, rational.
286500	290260	Axiom one, America's next top victim.
290260	295580	I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture, and I'm
295580	299420	not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.
299420	301700	No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.
301700	304940	We have white people complaining about reverse racism.
304940	312820	We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rage prejudice.
312820	315140	That must be super fucking hard for you.
315140	319260	We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.
319260	322940	You know, flaunting their sexuality on the faces of children who are trying to raise
322940	326420	a family and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***.
326420	330700	And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights, too.
330700	334220	I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life, and I've always been
334220	335660	very skeptical.
335660	340860	Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.
340860	346020	Men try to do a good thing to solve a real problem, and then a man shows up to say, well,
346020	347020	what about men?
347020	350820	Men also get harassed, why aren't you talking about men?
350820	355380	And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?
355380	357580	Of course he's fucking not.
357580	360300	He doesn't give a shit, he's a troll.
360300	365380	His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?
365380	366540	What about them, honey?
366540	370260	For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once, and the first thing I did
370260	374020	was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement, which is The Myth
374020	375820	of Male Power by Warren Farrell.
375820	380220	Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.
380220	384500	But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it
384500	385500	to.
385500	389620	Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender
389620	391980	role that confined women to domestic servitude.
391980	396900	But, he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually
396900	401540	an illusion because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.
401540	407420	He introduces the idea of male disposability, basically the idea that society values female
407420	412020	lives more than male lives, which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting
412020	413860	and providing for women and children.
413860	418740	And he points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,
418740	422060	workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.
422060	426380	So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power
426380	427380	than women.
427380	432920	In fact, the Queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided
432920	438660	for by the expendable male worker bees and I guess that kind of makes sense.
438660	441020	I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.
441020	445400	What I'm saying is, I took the red pill and I rubbed it on my claaa-
445400	450420	But some initial objections come to mind.
450420	455420	Like haven't men been almost all of the king's presidents and CEOs for millennia?
455420	457900	Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?
457900	461480	I don't know boys, still seems kind of patriarchal to me.
461480	465220	But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society
465220	467120	that men have more power than women.
467120	470540	Maybe the average man is also oppressed
470540	473240	by the system that feminists call patriarchy.
473240	475260	If that's what you're saying,
475260	477800	I think I basically agree with that.
477800	479400	See, what you have to understand about me
479400	482360	is I am such a fucking Libra.
482360	484960	Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,
484960	486580	well, maybe everybody's right
486580	488840	and maybe there's good points on both sides
488840	490500	and we should all just listen to each other
490500	493840	and rub each other's clothes.
493840	497360	But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.
497360	500700	Oh, there will be a champion, there will be blood.
500700	504680	So, judges, how do we decide which gender
504680	506500	is America's next top victim?
506500	509600	I mean, it's not like you can just change genders
509600	512880	and see how the other half lives, or can you?
513800	517000	Proposition two, diary of an X-Man.
517920	521400	Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal
521400	524200	that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.
525200	528320	Mom, get out of my room.
528320	529560	You're ruining my life.
529560	533100	Look, I have never ever talked about this
533100	534960	on my channel before, so this is like
534960	537120	a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.
537120	539040	But I was born a boy.
539040	542000	Well, was I ever really a boy?
542000	543120	It's hard to say.
543120	545760	Dear diary, growing up I always knew
545760	547560	that I was different from other kids,
547560	551240	especially other boys, and it took me so long
551240	555560	to pinpoint what it was, but there was this moment.
555560	558320	I must have been what, seven, eight years old?
558320	561360	And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself
561360	565800	and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.
565800	569120	And I don't know what it was, it was like this magnetism
569120	572640	that drew me to them and I put my little feet in them
572640	574360	and walked in front of the mirror
574360	577040	and I didn't really have the words yet
577040	581400	to describe how I felt, but basically in that moment
581400	583840	I sensed that God had made a mistake
583840	588840	and I was destined to be a cross-dresser.
591200	593520	That is super fucking coconuts.
593520	596160	Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart
596160	597000	and I became a woman.
597000	597880	Hey, how are you?
597880	599840	I became one of the dolls.
599840	601560	My plastic surgeon is an artist.
601560	604520	Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is
604520	606040	I used to live your lifestyle.
606040	607520	I know what people like you get up to
607520	609360	and I think it's disgusting.
609360	611800	I gotta say though, since I transitioned
611800	614800	my life has been super fucking great, like way better.
614800	616760	Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it
616760	620400	better than men, but because hey, gorge,
620400	623120	I am literally transgendered.
623120	625800	So before I transitioned I was dying inside, you know?
625800	630240	I was in the wrong body and now it's like I finally
630240	632680	have the body I was meant to die inside of,
632680	634020	but it's not just that.
634020	637040	I do think that in some ways, since I started presenting
637040	639800	as a woman, people actually do treat me better.
639800	642400	I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,
642400	645240	but that's probably for the best.
645240	647040	Now before using my personal experience
647040	649240	as any kind of evidence, I guess I should say
649240	650400	a couple caveats.
650400	653880	Caveat one is that most pre-transitioned trans women
653880	655520	are not like other boys.
656160	657680	And most of us, we're not living the business class
657680	659920	male experience by any means.
659920	662160	You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,
662160	665640	tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,
665640	669420	poets, you know, that sort of thing.
669420	672800	Caveat two is that my trans experience
672800	674880	is not the trans experience.
674880	676720	And I do have a lot of other privileges
676720	679120	that made things go super fucking well for me.
679120	680060	Hey, how are you?
680060	682860	Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege
682860	685580	in a way that's actually just bragging?
685580	688100	You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge
688100	691140	that I've been so successful and I've come so far,
691140	694900	in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young
694900	699260	and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated
699260	702500	and I'm popular and my plastic surgeon is an artist
702500	704460	and my boyfriend is really rich and hot
704460	706620	and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.
706620	708300	And part of what makes me so enlightened
708300	711700	and so compassionate is that I'm able to recognize
711900	715300	these privileges that I have that just might not be available
715300	718380	to people who are less fortunate.
718380	719740	From the bottom of my mother fucking
719740	720860	and my father fucking heart,
720860	722400	they must be super fucking hard for you.
722400	724540	I can't even imagine.
724540	726260	What I was saying is there are ways
726260	727540	that people treat me better now
727540	729020	that I'm presenting as a woman.
729020	730860	You know, people smile at me more.
730860	732700	I feel more taken care of.
732700	734700	Men do things for me.
734700	737580	Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,
737580	740180	you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,
740180	743620	because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.
743620	744780	But not me.
744780	746020	I love it.
746020	747700	Both because I love attention
747700	750060	and because I'm a recumbent queen
750060	752300	who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.
752300	753540	I do this thing on airplanes
753540	755780	where when it's time for me to put my carry-on luggage
755780	757100	in the overhead bin,
757100	760300	I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift
760300	763380	and then some man will usually get up and do it for me.
763380	766580	Even though I'm taller than most men, it makes me happy.
766580	768220	Another good thing about becoming a woman
768460	770940	is I integrate it into female social groups
770940	773980	and I found that they provide a kind of communal support
773980	775620	and overt affection
775620	778660	that male social groups generally just don't.
778660	780700	I find that female social style suits me better
780700	781940	than the male one,
781940	784860	which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,
784860	786820	where affection is always concealed
786820	790020	behind this semi-jokey front of competition.
790020	792300	Like, think about the way boys talk to each other
792300	793700	when they play video games.
793700	795380	A third improvement for me has to do with the way
795380	797980	men and women are treated in public space.
797980	799820	When you present female in public,
799820	802340	you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle
802340	803940	to be commented upon.
803940	807780	People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions
807780	811260	about you, sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,
811260	813380	sometimes just fucking weird.
813380	815860	Whereas when you present male in public,
815860	818140	you're more likely to be treated either as invisible
818140	819620	or as dangerous.
819620	822380	Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences
822380	825940	as men asserting dominance over women in public space
825940	827380	and they've criticized catcalling
827380	830380	as being objectifying, degrading, and misogynistic.
830380	832740	And it certainly can be all of those things.
832740	834300	There's different kinds of catcalling
834300	836220	and I have different feelings about them.
836220	839140	If I'm walking with another woman and a man says,
839140	841860	"'Ladies, you look beautiful tonight.'"
841860	843380	I don't know, I like that.
843380	844740	I think that's nice.
844740	847220	It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired,
847220	848740	it boosts my confidence.
848740	851380	Whereas if I'm walking alone
851380	854060	and a drunk starts following me down the street,
854100	857300	singing, "'Have you seen a polythene, Pam?
857300	859980	"'She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man.'"
860820	864180	That I am less enthusiastic about.
864180	866180	I mean, not that that's ever happened.
866180	867860	I'm completely fucking unclockable.
867860	868940	Hey, how are you?
868940	873940	No one knows what it's like to be a sad trans.
875180	876900	I definitely get where feminists are coming from
876900	878700	because street harassment sucks.
878700	880580	I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night
880580	881620	than I used to be.
881620	883380	And there's a lot more places
883380	885140	I just won't go by myself.
885140	886660	But on the other hand,
886660	889580	I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night
889580	892180	without other people acting afraid of me.
892180	894660	I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine
894660	898060	the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous
898060	900420	can also kind of suck.
900420	901780	In my video on incels,
901780	904780	I talked about male invisibility on dating apps
904780	907100	and how getting no attention at all
907100	909100	can actually be emotionally worse
909100	910940	than getting a lot of shitty attention.
910940	913980	And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,
913980	915660	when I was living as a man,
915660	918060	sometimes if I was walking at night,
918060	919980	a woman on the same block as me
919980	921940	would change sides of the street.
921940	925180	And I totally get why men do scary shit sometimes
925180	926620	and it's better to be safe.
926620	928780	But it's still stung a little bit
928780	931820	to be treated as dangerous by default.
931820	933540	I think it can actually be harmful,
933540	936500	which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.
936500	938820	There's ways that white women's fear
938820	942260	can actually be dangerous in particular to black men.
942260	943820	I had an experience with this recently
943820	945740	when I was filming my video, The Apocalypse,
945740	948140	and I had rented a room in a hotel casino.
948140	950300	Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment
950300	952500	up to my room and I got into the elevator
952500	954620	with a group of people from the casino floor.
954620	957180	A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator
957180	960140	except for me and a single black man.
960140	962260	Well, I mean, he was alone.
962260	963300	I don't know if he was single.
963300	964140	That's not part of the story.
964140	965580	And as soon as the door closed,
965580	969020	he started literally whistling row, row, row your boat,
969020	971660	the official melody of performative innocence.
971660	976260	And I realized, oh shit, he is afraid that I'm afraid.
976260	977980	And I found that just excruciating.
977980	980380	I was like, oh God,
980380	983220	how do other white women behave in elevators?
983220	985500	Do they like clutch their purses?
987420	989900	That's so fucking embarrassing.
989900	991660	Nothing like that had ever happened to me
991660	993140	when I was living as a man.
993140	995580	It's not a thing between black men and white men.
995580	998300	It's a thing between black men and white women.
998300	999780	And so that dynamic was there,
999780	1002180	not just because I'm white and he's black,
1002180	1004940	but because I'm a woman and he's a man.
1004940	1006700	And I thought of that incident again
1006700	1008900	when I was listening to the myth of male power
1008900	1009900	and Farrell says,
1009900	1013220	men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength
1013220	1016700	and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.
1016700	1018740	I think there is some truth to the idea
1018740	1020620	that women's perceived vulnerability
1020620	1022060	can make them powerful.
1022060	1024980	And men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.
1024980	1026940	Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt
1026940	1029660	because these are just some little observations I've made
1029660	1031460	based on a handful of anecdotes.
1031460	1033500	And as rational males,
1033500	1036020	it's important that we consider the facts,
1036020	1038020	the stats and the figures.
1038020	1041380	Did you know that 46% of men
1041380	1046340	are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?
1046340	1047540	Look it up.
1047540	1048380	I haven't.
1048380	1050860	Because my super fucking Libra opinion
1050860	1052740	is that there's upsides and downsides
1052740	1054340	to male and female experience.
1054340	1056660	I don't actually think there's a single definite answer
1056660	1058500	to the vague and useless question,
1058500	1060260	which gender has it worse?
1060260	1061700	I consider myself a feminist
1061700	1063700	because I support reproductive rights
1063700	1065540	and I oppose workplace misogyny.
1065540	1068100	And I generally agree with a lot of the activism
1068100	1070180	that happens under the heading of feminism.
1070180	1071700	But I also think a lot of men
1071700	1074460	are just having a super fucking difficult time right now.
1074460	1077340	And that must be super fucking hard for the main hour, yo.
1077340	1079380	And I don't think feminists have an obligation
1079380	1080700	to care about male acts,
1081420	1083580	but I care about you boys.
1083580	1085020	God, I'm such a cool girl.
1085020	1086660	I think the entire Mid-Atlantic region
1086660	1087900	is about to freeze over.
1087900	1090500	No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon.
1090500	1093540	And I really try to understand other people's pain
1093540	1098540	because I just find it really, really funny.
1098780	1101660	I'm also really, really sobering up here.
1101660	1103140	The drugs have worn off
1103140	1107500	and I am suddenly feeling very naked.
1107500	1109140	Like it's just now occurring to me
1109140	1112180	that this is a highly inappropriate outfit
1112180	1113380	for this occasion.
1113380	1115900	So I'm going to go put on a robe
1115900	1119220	and I'll meet you back for the next section.
1119220	1121940	Postulate three, the man question.
1127780	1130300	Hi, boys, et cetera, et cetera.
1130300	1131460	Hey, how are you?
1131460	1133300	For the last three years on this channel,
1133300	1135420	I have been your vergil,
1135420	1137500	leading you through gender hell,
1137500	1139860	pickup artists, gender dysphoria,
1139860	1142180	incels, radical feminists,
1142180	1144940	non-binary genders, men's rights activists.
1144940	1148140	It seems like everybody's having gender trouble.
1148140	1149540	So what do we make of that?
1149540	1153580	Well, Gorge, a very, very rational male philosopher
1153580	1157340	named Hegel once said that the unfolding of history
1157340	1159980	is a basically rational process, Gorge.
1159980	1162380	That means that at any time in history,
1162380	1164980	society is based on certain principles
1164980	1168140	like all men are created equal
1168140	1170180	as long as there's super fucking rich and white.
1170180	1173100	And there's always contradictions within those principles,
1173100	1176340	which creates tension and eventually leads to a rupture,
1176340	1179500	like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized
1179500	1180980	according to new principles.
1180980	1183140	At least I think he was saying something like that.
1183140	1184620	It's pretty hard to make anything out
1184620	1186260	through the fog of his unreadable,
1186260	1188100	hyper-abstract, man jabbering.
1188100	1190020	God, I can't stand that shit.
1190020	1192220	Or any of the other music-hating vole cells
1192220	1193940	of the male philosophical tradition.
1193940	1196460	My point is, I think our society has reached a place
1196460	1199620	where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.
1199620	1201700	Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working
1201700	1205100	or how to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken.
1205100	1206980	We have mainstream feminists saying we need
1206980	1208820	to continue advancing the rights of women.
1208820	1210340	We have conservatives saying we need
1210340	1212580	to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.
1212580	1214100	We have an increasing number of people
1214100	1216100	not identifying as men or women.
1216100	1218380	We have TERFs who think that the transgenders
1218380	1220300	are the single greatest threat to civilization.
1220300	1221140	Hey, how are you?
1221140	1222980	And we have men's rights activists saying
1222980	1224980	we need a male equivalent to feminism
1224980	1227820	to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.
1227820	1229860	Now, I wanna focus on that last one
1229860	1232660	because in principle, I agree.
1232660	1234300	I've spent a lot of the last three years
1234300	1235620	covering the manosphere.
1235620	1238020	I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.
1238020	1239980	And from all the time I've tortured myself
1239980	1242140	waiting through these communities of incels,
1242140	1244780	pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,
1244780	1248340	intellectual dark web, fanboys, and alt-right racists,
1248340	1251300	I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,
1251300	1254700	which is that they all recruit from the same massive pool
1254700	1256540	of sad young men.
1256540	1257940	We all know the archetype.
1257940	1259660	He has trouble relating to women.
1259660	1261180	He has no strong friendship group.
1261180	1263420	He's not excited about any long-term goals.
1263420	1266140	And he fills the void with video games and porn.
1266140	1267380	And just to clarify,
1267380	1270020	I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn.
1270020	1271860	I'm not telling you what to do with your penis.
1271860	1274020	You can rub one out to this video for all I care.
1274020	1276340	Just don't pull a gamer key on me, okay?
1277780	1279020	I live in fear.
1279020	1281500	Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars
1281500	1283060	inject their poison,
1283060	1285300	most of these boys are not bad people.
1285300	1286620	I think all of this originates
1286620	1289060	in a genuine crisis of male identity.
1289060	1290940	And I think it's happened in something
1290940	1293300	like the way men's rights activists describe.
1293300	1295820	The sacrificial role of men as warriors
1295820	1298300	is no longer widely glorified or necessary.
1298300	1300660	The traditional protector provider role of men
1300660	1302820	is being replaced by a more equal
1302820	1304700	and undefined gender dynamic.
1304700	1307300	And college professors and activists are telling men
1307300	1310220	that most of our culture's aspirational representations
1310220	1312300	of manhood are toxic and bad.
1312300	1314380	But without an attractive replacement vision
1314380	1316500	of aspirational manhood,
1316500	1320940	average young men can only envision their future as what?
1320940	1324820	The beta, the cock, the new male.
1324820	1326340	And in a post-left tube internet,
1326340	1328860	we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.
1328860	1331540	And to be fair, it is very funny.
1331540	1333820	But we forgot, especially us grills,
1333820	1334860	that for a lot of men,
1334860	1338820	these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.
1338820	1340300	And a lot of leftists go,
1340300	1343620	well, how can men be so angsty, especially white men?
1343620	1344900	They're so privileged.
1344900	1348740	But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.
1348740	1351740	If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle.
1351740	1355220	You have something to fight for and therefore a purpose.
1355220	1356580	But for a lot of men,
1356580	1360020	their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.
1360020	1362340	And that, along with the loneliness
1362340	1364420	and the lack of a positive identity,
1364420	1366660	is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment
1366660	1369060	by the Manosphere groups and by the alt-right.
1369060	1371980	And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor
1371980	1374540	for the small but growing number of young men
1374540	1376180	who decide to pick up a gun
1376180	1378340	and open fire in a shopping center.
1378340	1380260	There were two mass shootings during the weekend
1380260	1383540	I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.
1383540	1385260	Both shooters were young white men,
1385260	1387420	and one of them posted about the shooting
1387420	1388820	on an alt-right image board.
1388820	1390220	Now, I don't pretend to fully understand
1390220	1391780	the motives of mass shooters,
1391780	1393600	but I don't think it's a coincidence
1393760	1395520	that basically all of them are men.
1395520	1398600	One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic
1398600	1401200	is that these killers are trying to resurrect
1401200	1404400	some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory
1404400	1408360	and therefore to be seen and recognized as men
1408360	1411840	by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.
1411840	1413560	And of course, there's also the racism
1413560	1414920	of the alt-right killers
1414920	1417920	and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.
1417920	1421520	But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,
1421520	1424000	and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis
1424000	1425880	are more receptive to learning it.
1425880	1428320	So you can try to take down their forums
1428320	1431400	and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,
1431400	1435280	but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,
1435280	1437960	I don't see any end to these problems.
1437960	1440320	Theorem four, what do?
1440320	1443120	There is this media narrative that has emerged
1443120	1445120	around me and around this channel.
1445120	1447200	And by the way, the fact that there's any kind
1447200	1449080	of media narrative about this channel
1449080	1451400	is super fucking coconuts,
1451400	1453120	because let's be real, Gorge,
1453120	1454920	I just wanted to form milk on my face
1454920	1456240	and talk about the mouthfeel.
1456240	1457600	But there's this media narrative
1457600	1459240	that my role in the discourse
1459240	1464240	is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.
1464600	1466160	And it's true that if you read
1466160	1468480	the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,
1468480	1470880	I used to be alt-right posts are so common
1470880	1472280	they're considered cliche.
1472280	1474680	And some of them cite me as an influence
1474680	1475960	in changing their politics,
1475960	1479720	which I love for them and I'm super fucking happy about it,
1479720	1483600	but it's also a lot of responsibility.
1483600	1488120	They're my boys and I worry about my boys
1488120	1490040	because in reality, it's not like they go
1490040	1492840	from far-right extremists to complacent centrists.
1492840	1495080	No, most of them go far left.
1495080	1497760	A lot of them become communists or anarchists.
1497760	1499720	So I watched them go from far to my right
1499720	1501800	to significantly to my left.
1501800	1504920	It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.
1504920	1506880	And I think it's definitely an improvement,
1506880	1509560	but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.
1509560	1512800	I worry about my boys because I don't think
1512800	1516520	that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.
1516520	1519120	Oh no, that was worded poorly.
1519120	1520440	You know, there's kind of two options
1520440	1522340	the left has for disillusioned men.
1522340	1525800	The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.
1525800	1528600	We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,
1528600	1531600	but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.
1531600	1532880	So just join the revolution.
1532880	1534840	It's gonna be super fucking crazy.
1534840	1537360	We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow,
1537360	1541600	smash no voting, and then things will be better for you.
1541600	1544200	Now, I think that has a couple of limitations.
1544200	1546920	One is that I look at the far left
1546920	1549600	and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time
1549600	1552240	accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges
1552240	1553720	in closed Facebook groups.
1553720	1557720	And I'm concerned that might not succeed
1557720	1560080	at ending capitalism, meow, meow.
1560080	1561960	Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders
1561960	1563480	or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,
1563480	1566080	but if you're investing all of your hopes
1566080	1568560	on a capital R revolution,
1568560	1571120	I worry that can become like waiting for Godot
1571120	1572520	or waiting for the rapture.
1572520	1574140	So we do need political change,
1574140	1578080	but I feel like I'm failing my boys
1578080	1579720	if I'm somehow giving them the idea
1579720	1581920	that revolution is their only hope.
1581920	1583200	Because here's the other thing.
1583200	1585920	Even if we did succeed ending capitalism,
1585920	1587140	there would still be gender.
1587140	1590280	And my boys would still need some model
1590280	1593500	of what it is to lead a good life as a man.
1593500	1596140	Now, the other option the left has for disillusioned men
1596140	1598340	is the feminist tranquilizer.
1598340	1600420	We say, look, toxic masculinity
1600420	1603040	is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings.
1603040	1605380	And it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.
1605380	1607740	So while feminism tells women you hate your body
1607740	1609260	and you're constantly doubting yourself
1609260	1612940	because society did this to you and needs to change,
1612940	1614740	we kind of just tell men,
1614740	1616860	you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.
1616860	1617780	Stop it.
1617780	1619020	We tell them they're broken
1619020	1621700	without really telling them how to fix themselves.
1621700	1626180	I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood,
1626180	1627300	which I don't think is something
1627300	1630420	that women can create for men, even if they wanted to.
1630420	1632380	And honestly, the best way for that to happen
1632380	1634620	may actually be some kind of men's movement.
1634620	1637300	But on the left, the whole idea of a men's movement
1637300	1640900	is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know
1640900	1643140	is basically just a backlash to feminism.
1643140	1646320	And at worst, it's just straight up misogyny.
1646320	1648860	And look, boys, I understand that being lectured
1648860	1651220	about man spreading for most of 2015
1651220	1652900	was super fucking hard for you
1652900	1654340	and you're still mad about it,
1654340	1656820	but posting endless outrage porn
1656820	1660100	about false rape accusations and paternity fraud
1660100	1662580	isn't actually gonna make life any better for you.
1662580	1665820	Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen,
1665820	1669060	but they're not systemic issues that affect most men.
1669060	1672460	I think what would actually improve life for most men
1672460	1676340	is a positive ideal of 21st century manhood.
1676340	1678700	But that's not something I can give to you
1678700	1681000	because in case you hadn't noticed,
1681020	1683080	I'm literally a fucking woman.
1683080	1685720	I can't mom you through this one, boys, you're on your own.
1685720	1687200	You have to help each other.
1687200	1689600	So find each other in the comments section,
1689600	1692600	meet up on Reddit, make friends, clean your room,
1692600	1694840	leave the house, fuck each other.
1694840	1697040	I don't know, it's worth a try.
1697040	1698120	And feeling that,
1700300	1703440	you could always throw in the towel and become a woman.
1703440	1704380	Worked for me.
1705260	1706080	There it is!
1706080	1706900	So yes.
1707900	1709320	It was hyper sculptures.
1712020	1725600	We had
1755600	1762600	I'm just trying to give like malady energy.
1762600	1766760	Yeah, it is, it's really, it is English, it's very John McLean, very Quentin Crisp, very
1766760	1767760	aristocrat.
1767760	1771440	I'm super fucking naked right now, that's crazy.
1771440	1773680	That's super fucking crazy.
1773680	1777960	According to traditional gender roles, men are useful for their labor and women are useful
1777960	1778960	for their wombs.
1778960	1784080	Well, I'm a woman without a womb, so I guess I'm useless, but I'm beautifully useless.
1784080	1786400	Ugh, I'm a work of art.
1786400	1789480	The problem with our society is we've turned men into women.
1789480	1790480	It's disgusting.
1790480	1797520	As an ally to men, it's not my place to speak for them or speak over them, but I just want
1797520	1806040	to use my platform to uplift some male voices who might not have as many subscribers as
1806040	1807040	me.
1807040	1808040	Okay.
1809040	1814720	And I'm not hypergamous, I don't need a rich husband.
1814720	1818720	If I may quote Cher, I don't need a rich man.
1818720	1819720	I am a rich man.
1819720	1823680	It's not even really much of an insult being called a delusional man.
1823680	1826680	Many great books have been written by delusional men.
1826680	1828680	So bad.
1828680	1830680	I'm bad.
1830680	1833440	I'm really bad.
1833440	1834800	Okay.
