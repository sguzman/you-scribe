00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube, sensation. Welcome to my world! Every

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,120
week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me!

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,200
So I'm going to go with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a Flaunt

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,240
325 dash. Smoke it out. Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed. It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yeah. Yes. Okay.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,360
I'm not living for it. Oh my god. I think I glued my eyeshot. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life,

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,520
which is why I support our president, Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:31,120
Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of The Freedom Report, whereâ€”I'm sorry, why does my studio

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,040
look like a Japanese drag queen redecorated in Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it.

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political

13
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,160
spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational,

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,880
free-thinking debate about a timeless question.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Are traps gay? My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Intersectional AF. Clarence? Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,240
transphobia is racist? Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles.

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program,

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,440
isn't that right? That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,240
Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders and how I was tired of

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,520
trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I know,

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,320
everyone's calling me a turf and a traitor, so I said, you know what? I'm out. I'm not going to

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,840
put up with this culture of silencing and shame. I think that's just so brave of you. Yeah, wow,

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are. Shut up, Adria. I had just

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,760
come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that, the trans

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,880
community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing. I was absolutely alone.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,040
Do you have any idea what that felt like? Your leftist allies are not your friends,

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,240
Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them. Those are not friends. Well, you have real friends

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,880
now, Tiffany. I think you're going to fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,960
who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,520
politically correct dogma. Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

33
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,320
So I'm going to go in with the highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow until I'm

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,120
literally blinding. I am glowing. She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it. You know what

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,560
else I'm not living for? The Muslims. Tiffany, you are so funny. I'm sorry. Are we just going

36
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
to ignore the blatant racism? How is that racist? Muslims are religion, not a race. Yeah, Adria.

37
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,400
Muslims are religion, not a race. Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
together. You can't just...well, you both know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's try to

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,480
get back on track here. So Adria, traps. Are they gay? Look, there's so many things wrong with the

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
question that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it. First of all, what are traps?

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Are they trans women? Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men. A lie that reinforces the mentality

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
that causes men to murder us. Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman. What about

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
anime? Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans. The Japanese word

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,960
is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser. There's no implication of tricking men, but the

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women. So when you tell us that's

47
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,840
not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.

48
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women. We're not all offended all the time.

49
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,200
I actually happen to identify as a trap. Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap. Well,

50
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,520
she's in the sunken place. And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless. Doesn't it bother you at all

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
that if some guy murders you, his defense is going to be, well, she was a trap. I was tricked.

52
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,600
And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking. What do you care, Adria? No one's

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,520
gonna be trapped by you anyway. Oh, spicy. The fuck did you just say? I said no shade,

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
but you don't really look like a woman. Jackie, are you going to allow your

55
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,440
guests to talk to me like this? Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer. Look,

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,960
dragging bitches is what I do. Facts over feels, hunty. Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,920
of a point? Like if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in. I mean,

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,960
what is this, a men's shirt? How are you going to attract men with that? I'm not trying to attract

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,280
men. I'm a lesbian. I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman

60
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,320
and a lesbian? Well, I'm a woman and I like women. I don't know about that. Sounds debatable. I'm

61
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the transphobia

62
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,960
special. Transphobia? Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair. I mean, I've invited two trans women

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,560
to be on my program and I'll have you know that one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.

64
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,760
And what could be transphobic about that? See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans

65
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,760
people. You're obnoxious and offended by everything and everyone feels like they have to tread on

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,320
eggshells around you. Thank you, Tiffany. See, you're one of the good ones. You're a good tran.

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,640
Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany? Be the lap dog of people like this?

68
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,840
No. I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient and agreeable

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
and by looking the part and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet your

70
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,640
impossible standard of wokeness. And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh? Just keep

71
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,280
reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away. Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone but yourself and the only reason you're accepted is

73
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
that you don't challenge the status quo? I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because

74
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,360
I feel like we're just getting hung up on terminology. Look, Adria, if you don't like the

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,480
word trap, we just won't use the word trap. The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to

76
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,240
trans women? It is if you're a woman. No, I mean for men. Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men

77
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,120
or gay men? Well, all the men I've dated only date women but if they're attracted to me, I mean,

78
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
it's not the straightest thing, is it? Why not? You look like a woman and I know that you know

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that gay men are not attracted to these tits. Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria? I mean, sure, she looks like a woman but

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,600
she does have XY chromosomes. When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,640
That's not how sexuality works. We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,040
biology. Okay, sure, but I mean, a lot of trans women still have their penis and you gotta admit,

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,840
that seems kind of gay. Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you? We live in a

85
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,320
world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women but there's an intense stigma

86
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,520
on dating trans women and it's actually dangerous because what happens is if a man's friends find

87
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,480
out that the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by

88
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,040
lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating and this happens again and again. And

89
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,440
every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma and you're

90
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,200
making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women. Alright, I'm not trying

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,240
to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women

92
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,760
could be attracted to a person with a penis. Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you, I am a lesbian,

93
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women, and when I'm attracted to a trans woman,

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,200
I perceive her as a woman. And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,

95
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,360
but as a part of her female body. So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick. I'm

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,640
sorry, what? What is girl dick? The feminine penis. Oh no. Oh, come on. This is nonsense. How

97
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,000
could a penis possibly be feminine? Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman, but also because

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,880
hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis. Shut up, Adria, just shut up.

99
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Wait, really? How is it different? Well, I'm glad you asked. More needs to be said about the feminine

100
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
penis. Why is no one talking about the feminine penis? Kill me now. So to start with, it doesn't

101
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
get as hard. It doesn't really ejaculate and it has a different mouth feel. Can we please talk

102
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,760
about the mouth feel? Why is no one talking about the mouth feel? I don't think that's necessary.

103
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.

104
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,040
That's correct. I don't like mantic. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.

105
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,200
Not like girl dick. Girl dick is everything soft and smooth. What is that? Star Wars? Do

106
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,240
you also build computers for a living? I mean, guilty. I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

107
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl. My sweet love. Wait,

108
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
you're dating that crazy Antifa cat? Well, we're in the same poly heel. I don't know what that means

109
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,160
and I'm not like prejudiced or anything, but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

110
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,760
Like if you're born male and you're attracted to women, how is it not just heterosexuality?

111
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,040
Well, my girlfriend is also trans. So if you follow your logic to its conclusion,

112
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,240
okay. So you're a woman who was born a man and you like women, but you're dating a woman.

113
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,280
Someone who has a penis. It's a female penis that used to be a male penis.

114
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,160
So you're attracted to women, but you were born a man and you're attracted to women.

115
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,320
But that used to be a man your dating a female has a penis. So that means you are gay,

116
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
but you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born. I can go over it with

117
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,520
you again after the show if you need some extra time to figure it out. Why am I constantly

118
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,120
surrounded by homosexuals? Adria, just stop talking. Look, I don't care what you do in private,

119
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,760
but I'm sorry to break it to you. The world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

120
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,320
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile and people like me

121
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
to be our representatives because I act like a normal woman and I date normal men and I don't

122
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,600
have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick. Also, I look fucking gorgeous. I'm sorry,

123
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,400
but that matters. Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart. You're not

124
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,440
blair white. Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done, so there's not a fair comparison.

125
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
What work are you having done? I'm going to lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,

126
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,360
reshape my brow, get some lip injections, maybe Botox my forehead. Oh, and I'm going to fix my

127
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,200
nose, obviously. What's wrong with your nose? It's kind of big and manish. Well, my nose looks

128
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,840
kind of like that. Are you saying I look manish? Are you saying I look ugly? What are you trying

129
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,200
to say, Tiffany? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to women?

130
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,960
I'm not doing anything to women. What? Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,000
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman. She has to work really hard to be seen as female

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
and you just don't. Shut the hell up, Adria. Don't get offended for me. Don't condescend to me.

133
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm not a victim. Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be, but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.

134
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,360
Oh my god. I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.

135
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:35,360
All right, let's forget about it. I'm fine. Tiffany, are you fine? I am fine. To be clear,

136
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
aren't not fine with any of this. Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out? Let's

137
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,120
shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post. Well, we may never know whether traps are

138
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,640
gay, but the important thing is that we talked about it. I'm Jackie Jackson for the Freedom Report

139
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,800
where the debate never stops. Your mascara is running. Get out of my studio, both of you.

140
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Get out. We're done.

141
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:17,360
Hi, Nick. Yeah, I'm finished. Well, it was a shit show. No, Adria was fine. She was cringe as fuck

142
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,360
the whole time. Let's have her back. Tiffany was a problem. She kept veering off message and she got

143
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:34,640
emotional. Yeah, don't invite her back. Get Blair next time. And the week after, can we get Kanye West?

144
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:43,440
We can't get Kanye. Get Candace Owens. Oh, what have you done to my studio? Hey, Adria, look,

145
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay? It's just that I've been working so hard to win

146
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,240
acceptance for trans people to show everyone that were normal, that were just like them. And

147
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,640
when you show up looking like that and acting like that, it's just hard for me to watch all

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,400
my hard work be undone, you know? Like, you can't be talking about this feminine penis in front of

149
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,520
cis people. Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.

150
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:21,680
Oh my god, you crazy freak!

151
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I hate Adria. She looks like a man beast. Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

152
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.

153
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,680
They should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,920
Angel, relax.

155
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,840
Well, it's off.

156
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,400
I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up. All right, what are they saying?

157
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Fuck it.

158
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:10,080
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know them. I may have a mental illness,

159
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,800
but I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional. I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.

160
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,880
You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.

161
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,920
It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...

162
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm not a victim. I am in control of my life.

163
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,360
I wish I were a woman or anything but this.

164
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,240
I'm destroying my body.

165
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
How could I ever love this?

166
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm just mutilating myself. It's so disgusting.

167
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,480
God, I'm so disgusting.

168
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm so disgusting.

169
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm just eating a can of another drink.

170
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm not a victim. I am in complete control.

171
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm not a victim. I'm not a victim.

172
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,720
I'm just not a victim. I'm just a victim.

173
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.

174
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.

175
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.

176
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm just a victim.

177
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm just a victim.

178
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm just a victim.

179
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm just a victim.

180
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm just a victim.

181
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm just a victim.

182
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm just a victim.

183
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm just a victim.

184
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm just a victim.

185
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
I'm just a victim.

186
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm just a victim.

187
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm just a victim.

188
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,520
Welcome to my world.

189
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm just a victim. I'm just a victim.

190
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I'm just a victim.

191
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
I'm just a victim.

192
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm just a victim.

193
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm just a victim.

194
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm just a victim.

195
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I'm just a victim.

I'm just a victim.

197
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720

Don't let them define us.
