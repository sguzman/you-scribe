how you guys finding Twitter fun nope at all Twitter just waiting to get banned
for something stupid right I feel like that's the same for me it's just a
matter of time before I get bad if I say something wrong don't misgender somebody
or tell someone to learn to code but it's not a band because they said learn
to code oh yeah someone might someone of my server got a 12-hour suspension for
telling polygon polygon they should learn to code I was that cuz when you get
fired it's like you're rubbing it in oh is that how they would justify that
because I was curious what I would come under it's like that's not exactly
your attempt is yeah that's the justification for it yeah well people
have been people have been spamming it en masse it's kind of become just a spam
oh like you're adding fuel to the fire sort of thing yeah a lot of other
people say it and you say it well it doesn't seem fair but I guess you know
Twitter being fair isn't really a thing yeah I'm unfortunately logged into this
chat is my actual name but whatever oh you can see it though can we you can swap
out on the top right right and YouTube oh really account I think oh well in on
the chat like I'm assuming you have a it's fine okay if anybody wants to find
my address slash my tires go right ahead it's a Toyota I don't care
efap 25 great up live
this episode is called the efappening everyone hmm get ready yeah we haven't
used that yet that's that's surprising I'm really sure I don't believe that
if happening wait was I want all the was that when all the celebrity dudes got
why do you got to bring porn into it all the time yeah ef slow down our my uncle
represented one of the kids who stole nudes from one of the celebrities iCloud
really really he got him a great deal he was like he's just a kid he just wanted
to see naked whoever it was how old is the kids old he was probably like 19 or
something I was gonna say like what what was his sense after I don't remember
what it was he just got probation cuz my uncle is a king trying to remember what
my uncle's get out of here lost someone had to be in jail for that I could have
sworn someone did go to jail well the thing is that like you know it there was
different like groups he was like one kid who like got pulled into it you know
some dude Wow ring leader there was multiple people doing it yeah North
Koreans yes the North Koreans were definitely part of it I don't know if I
I don't know if I buy that they hacked Sony it's it's a little it's a little
out there yeah later they know about see right anyway so since that's a decent
chunk of time for people to be jumping in I will quick you got the kid got eight
months in prison it's pretty good I'm gonna say eight months yeah I don't know
cuz I don't know what the precedent is for something like that you know it's
not is that now the pretty good job there cuz like that must have been I
mean about the fact that you can't remove the photos I mean no matter what
they do there's some other country server is gonna be hosting them forever
it's not that I've seen them not that I've looked into this I'd say that's a
pretty light sentence man out if somebody took a picture of me I didn't
want being out there me being naked Oh there he goes Wow so middle of his pun
yeah only way to fix that is to start working out and get yourself looking
really good and then release those nudes yeah and then you could still
probably get some money out of suing them as well and let's just win-win but
uh unfortunately it took us a while to get the stream started because Vito's
been trying to fix his ability to stay and speak and it looks like it has not
been fixed I don't know what's causing it but he may be popping in and out
throughout the stream even though he's supposed to be a consistent guest so in
the meantime I guess we'll just oh hello a lot of people want you to ask
me about my you get to look at women comment I'd love to I would love to will
work on that I will give I'll give everybody an intro we'll totally talk
about that but uh Vito are you there that's one too yes hello hopefully it
stays longer this time you didn't leave on purpose yeah no it's just gonna keep
dropping me in and out and I don't know why discords crap for some reason all
right Vito you're batting zero get it together I run a I run a live stream I
do discord for two hours straight I have no problem I don't know what's it's
cuz you're in the front or whatever it's probably the server is localized next to
you and now yeah it is a Western Europe server right yeah it says region Western
Europe so that's probably what's screwing me over well you can't connect
to Europe I don't want to connect Europe I probably have a racist router that
can I change it to like America US Central happy better hello yeah okay I
guess maybe that'll improve it I don't know hopefully we can see we weeding out
the weak links here is this what's happening um is Vito a weak link in this
analogy no but come on get it together I know right this is like come on but yeah
okay oh now it's US East I have no idea what discords doing what it wants to do
but uh okay so anyway this is the fab number 25 the last one we did was like
considered a season finale because of the insanity that took 25 years of the fab
25 years it's it's insane I don't even know how we managed to oh I just invited
you to a server for no reason ignore that well this is a really funny upon
majorly more like minor P you know that's actually pretty accurate server I
take a lot of minor it's true I do um we get where I got me picked we it's
been said now the season one villain of a fab was Quentin reviews season twos
villain was Jack and Eric put together so we're excited to see what happens in
season three considering this first episode as as many people may have
noticed there's no dishonored wolf it's because he was essentially busy for the
whole week we're gonna try and obviously have him back next week next time but
because of him being unable to be here we've got two guests two wonderful
beautiful guests first hello hi fuck off rags Jesus Christ you're not a guest oh
wait no that's the meme right yeah rags how you doing a special guest we're
doing great I'm glad to be on again consistent special yes if it'll keep me
on for more in two seconds oh right yeah so while Vito is here you you what
don't you want to talk about your channel and why you decided to degrade
yourself by coming here today oh my name is Vito I don't really know what my
channel is I just kind of make stuff but I made a video about Star Wars that a
lot of people liked what was it a Jedi a cinematic failure but you did that yeah
motherfucker dude man that movie was five million views my man the king of
Star Wars criticism is here mauler I'm sorry oh I'll settle for the the jack of
criticism of the yeah I don't want to go for Queen personally I'll have the
jester of criticism you can be my gesture I got no problem with it you know
I I'm so embarrassed I was ripping into I didn't even know you did that hilarious
video you watch did you watch that one oh thank you sir be honest I I just
looked at the thumbnail and that was enough to just crack me up I mean good
work yeah people got real mad about that thumbnail I still get people being like
how could you treat general hold oh that way make her look I'm like I don't know
man I just played around with the liquefied tool in Photoshop I wasn't
really thinking that hard about it I just mean the whole cinematic failure
part that just is hilarious to me yeah I don't know why that that phrase has
a cinema a cinematic failure would be if the movie didn't get finished like
it wasn't a film it would be maybe there's an argument to be made you
should it's all right it's a good time but yeah I definitely I don't know if
that phrase makes sense but yeah what are you getting I see other people
making YouTube videos using it now and I'm like oh yeah you gotta have a hot
title you know you gotta have a hot title and a hot thumbnail with a hot
face it's very clickable it's like shit man well could you call something a
literary failure is what I say I mean a failure to be good oh a good failure you
could just gone with like an embarrassment to cinema something like
that yeah I mean that's a potential clickable one too and so yeah the so not
a good good to have you here soon it'd be fun to talk about anything but stowels
right that's probably not a topic that we'll cover I seriously doubt it you
know why would anyone man over that stupid you know if you guys want to talk
about Star Trek discovery instead I'm sort of down but I've not seen it but do you
like it or hate it it definitely has a lot of hateable elements like I can
totally see why a lot of people are calling it you know SJW propaganda I
mean it is very diverse you got to look with like a magnifying glass to find like
a straight white male on the show that isn't like a bad guy but you know that
doesn't bother me but I it is very heavy with that but all that aside I think
it's a really solid Star Trek show I mean there's so much stuff that relates
to the the past I mean you know references to all these little things and
characters you know Captain Archer they bring up I mean I don't know I think if
you've watched all of Trek it's it's got a lot to enjoy but you know it's not
perfect it's definitely got your TV drama issues but yeah I was a little
confused so so discovery is not part of the official Star Trek timeline now I
know that people thought that yeah because there's like the Kelvin universe
everything it is I mean it totally is you know they spots in it pike is in it
they talk about the you know the Klingon war is referenced a lot and in old Star
Trek so it definitely relates I think it's kind of like the first JJ you know
reboot film where it started out as being this prequel but by the end of it
it's like yeah there's these two timelines happening at once people in
this chat people in the shed are saying it's not officially the original I
don't know I think they're probably right I don't know original timelines
now like apparently you have to interpret the prime timeline yeah I
don't there's two universes but but it's I know to a guy like me who hasn't seen
every single episode of every series it definitely feels like it's all just in
the same realm but you know that could be just because it's consistent I don't
I'm not a nerd I was actually gonna say to make sure because I'm totally cool
this talking but I was gonna say we also have major Lee if you'd like to tell
everybody a bit about your channel then I'll I'll get you up to speed on on a
potential of your your rep here on efap not to say that yeah what do you want to
know dude I mean I'm I am at your mercy just your channel you what would you
say your channels all about you know it's a pretty idiotic place to be but I
think it's it's it's all about having fun I like making people laugh and you
got your video game shit you got some Star Wars stuff but I started out really
not intending to cover either of those things I wanted to do you know videos
about random stuff but really those were getting no views and I like talking
about video games so I started doing that and I like talking about Star Wars
so I started doing that and then it kind of turned into this character sort
of that I started to kind of keep up because to me it's just it's just fun I
mean it's like it's like an outlet for me to just be crazy and say wacky shit
you um you take certain positions that want people could call controversial
like you were you're very in favor of these Star Wars Battlefront 2 game the
2017 one was it how have you found the response to that position well I I
totally get that the shop system was terrible I mean especially when the game
first came out you know the the prices of characters were insane but even then
I mean there's so much good stuff to enjoy in that game the campaign mode is
awesome it actually has a storyline that bridges return to Jedi to Force Awakens
and yeah it's not amazing it's not perfect it's not like cinematic quality
but I thought it was pretty damn good and there's a lot of funny lines that
they give to Han and Lando Billy Dee is in it so it really that the campaign is
terrible now it's great man there's one I mean there's so many great moments
like you're Han Solo and you're fighting enemies in Maz Kanata's Cantina and you
got like a beard and it's just like total fan service you know you're
playing as Leia on Naboo they actually you know bridged all these different
elements it's like you're playing as Leia but you're in this prequel setting
you know you play as Iden Versio the Imperial turned rebel who kind of helps
you defeat the Empire in this story and I don't know I just thought they did a
really good job you know you got Luke he finds the compass with Del Mico there's
a little reference last year tonight this is the game where there's a mission
where Luke like has to kill the spider things yeah yeah oh yeah we were
watching a video and someone was playing out in the background and we were laughing at it because it looked so awful
yeah I have no play to the graphics yeah it looks terrible well it looks amazing I
mean maybe it sounds terrible but you gotta I mean it's a beautiful world that
you're in the animations looked really funky the it looks like it was a mini
game where Luke can squeeze the green milk out of some alien titty because I
would play that I really wish that was in the game make that like a clicker
mobile game oh man I really recommend just like first of all the game is like
probably ten bucks an hour like seventeen dollars so I mean it's so
worth it if you're really just a frickin obsessed fan and you just like looking
at the shit and being Luke and slashing through stormtroopers it's fucking
great you know you got arcade mode tons of multiplayer modes that are really I
mean you're packed in with like 40 players I mean probably not an accurate
number but there's a shit ton of people playing that game at this point if it's
what it's like ten bucks probably so it's truly worth it for ten but I would
play it that they added Dooku you got you got grievous now you got obi-wan
love you it's packed in well I mean it would be interested to visit but the
thing is like there is an ethical quandary of like do you even remotely
support him with their good games I won't buy a battlefront to it's what is
a good what is a good EA game what are honestly I if you really played all the
content in this game you wouldn't be able to deny that there's quality there
it's like yeah the microtransactions all that shit it's it's yeah but I'm using
it to be honest I'm using it to probably fund like the child sex slave ring or
something I don't know what he is I'm gonna buy a multiplayer game with pay to
win microtransactions that's a leap every time I see the thing it doesn't
really affect the game that much I mean if all you care about is winning then
yeah it doesn't affect but it does affect whether or not you win
campaign there's nothing to do with the micro turns action you're talking about
multi-player modes then yeah I mean campaign well then don't buy the game
yeah if you're just playing it for the online experience then yeah you're gonna
be you're gonna be like all right people are better than me I suck and
it's gonna take me a while to get these star cards but I'm telling you there's
plenty to enjoy without that element I dude I suck at that game and I'm there
are times when I win and I'm like how the fuck did that just happen because
it's not always you're getting your ass whooped by people who are super
overpowered you get some shitheads or suck like wait but when you play online
like what is a star card like you get a better lightsaber if you pay more money
there's a lot of cool ways you unlock stuff in the game I mean the things
that if I go online why would I be worse than anybody else get the strong star
cards whereas you would have what is the star card why is it wrong it's an
upgrade for your okay it's like it's like okay it's like it's for specific
attacks like let's say Ray has like a lunge attack one of the star cards would
be like lunge plus two or you know whatever it's like you upgrade your
moves they make your character objectively better sometimes in serious
ways you know the thing about the game is that I think you have to be just a
massive Star Wars fan to like it it's like you have to be just into the fan
service if you're looking for like a competitor to like you know call of
duty or rainbow six then you just play those but a game should be a good game
on its own right yeah because it sounds like what you're describing is like hey
it's go fancy it's like yeah it's yeah but look I mean people want fan service
in episode 9 they're saying they just want to go back they just we just want
Palpatine and Padme and just bring make Luke alive we just want the characters
to be together I mean like they probably thought that Star Wars fans would just
eat it up because there's so much to like clarify you you don't want that
yes at nine right fuck no but you got to understand the people that I thought
you're advocating about front to when you may like the people that decided
there's gonna be a shitty shop system are not the same people that designed
the gameplay I wrote the story sure but you can't it's all in the game so many
right but it's not their fault they worked hard on those aspects and those
aspects are fucking great I mean like I've had so much fun playing that game
we usually blame EA so many hours they're the ones that would have pushed
yeah but I'm not gonna support a game if I have to pay for a game if it
especially if it's not a free-to-play game like this released as a $60 game
with pay-to-win microtransactions in it like that's that's awful yeah it's no
it's not totally normal you say micro interactions are normal the question
becomes like why help normalize just just put it out there God of War one of
the most successful games of the previous year didn't have any
microtransactions it's normal and massive multiplayer online game yeah of
course have you played an MMO before it's like these are fantasy star I mean
fuck man so much are you really you don't like I'm not saying it doesn't
happen I'm saying normal is a relative to him I don't think it's it depends on
the game too I mean if we're talking about a multiplayer game I mean apex
legends just came out I don't have to spend money on it you know it's
cosmetic overwatch cosmetic yeah like the difference no it's not the same with
every other battlefront we're talking about a different thing the campaign
regardless and it's and have what if I if I just want to play the multiplayer
that I'm gonna have a better sick no you're gonna have a great without I'm
gonna be worse than everybody else you're gonna love it you're gonna come
the most clear what if what I enjoy is not being worse than everybody else on
the server what if that is my enjoyer game do I still enjoy it there's a mode
where you only play as the the you know the heroes like the Ray and the Vaders
of the world and it's fucking awesome I mean it's just four on four yeah it's
for I for it doesn't fix anything does it dude it doesn't matter you don't
need it's like dude I'm like love it makes you objectively better if you're
telling us it literally says ability of your character plus you know yeah but
that doesn't mean you lose you know it doesn't define whether you would win but
it certainly increases your chances definitively what how else how else would
you want to have it I mean it's like Vito just calls me on Lee but yeah but
then there's no fun and upgrading the character now you're shooting me you get
to upgrade their movie can't be this that's the whole point money you play you
got you when you upgrade a character you want to upgrade their moves not just
their outfit yeah but why do I gotta spend money on it I didn't I don't buy
Final Fantasy every time I level up my character I gotta put a dollar in the
slot I try to play games that I'm gonna pay money for right I understand the fun
of upgrading a character absolutely but just give me I'll play the game and get
experience points and spend them don't be like oh $100 and you get a magic card
that usually you're spending $100 you you need to get there are you do it is
you have lots of classes lots of weapons loss and there's all kinds of balancing
that allows each other to counter each other depending on what you're picking
up that creates the matter you don't just go this thing I really feel like
it's it's pretty balanced like I'm not getting my ass whooped all the time dude
I suck at the game my characters are low-level just it's not that bad like
in terms of just you know being feeling like you're outnumbered or people are
way stronger than you it doesn't fucking matter just it's fun regardless
I'm telling you have you played the game at all or if you just watched a video I
watched many videos and I'm not buying to pick up no requires spending money
giving it to clarify you never even play why are we wasting time on this
let's move on it's pay-to-win game that I'm defending you can't talk about it I
was about to say you should play it specifically about anything that's wrong
never utter a word it the length that you've done I would never do that for a
game but if I said that's right what am I said that's right nothing you just said
too much never said anything wrong you can judge things you haven't played if
somebody tells me where a guy get if a guy if there's a movie about a guy
getting a nail jammed in his deck for two hours I can objectively say yeah
that probably is not a thing I want to say you know so if you tell me there's a
Star Wars game where I got a paid 20 bucks to be as good as everybody else I
know that's not my kind of experience to clarify what you're suggesting is
that the the pay-to-win elements and like not that important you saying like
they don't make it right not a big deal doesn't matter game is still good I'm
sorry I just don't care I get it but the fact that they exist is a very poor
yeah it's not perfect look you got at least give the game like a four or a
five or so I'm not saying it's a ten out of ten game but to give it a zero it's
like dude you're ignoring a good elements I'm not saying you did but
people did I'm that's what I made my video about cuz there were a lot of
zeros so I'm just saying you gotta just be realistic a lot of time the best game
but it's like a judgment from a lot of people where if you you cross that line
it doesn't matter what your game is because you've all right well that sort
of thing I'm not gonna argue with that if you want to be have strong principles
that's that's fine but you know just don't don't overreact it's not the end of
it it's just a freaking game I mean yeah it's you're not gonna get every
trophy though it literally doesn't care it doesn't matter it really doesn't
matter it's still it clearly goes to people mom Vito baton zero play the game
press right all right I'm excited I can't wait it's like nine never hand me
the nail they're going nine he says it's good so I'm gonna jam the nail up my
hole cuz he's what are you Glenn Danzig what's with this dick nailing just I'm
just saying I mean it's on the same level it's a beautiful analogy fair
enough a lot of giving my giving my money to EA feels like jamming it yeah a nail
through my dick I won't argue with this that's my yeah he has to earn my money
I'm not just gonna throw them money so that I could spend more money yeah it's
a bit of a weird that's the thing cuz you like to earn this game by the way
this game is what like three four years old two years only was it 2015 for the
first one I'm gonna send you a copy you know I'm gonna send you my copy I will
play it I'm sure it'll be stupid for like ten bucks but then at a certain
point I'm gonna be like all right I'm just getting my ass kicked online I'm
gonna know anything I haven't I don't know if they've changed anything in the
game since all the like of a what kind of changes they makes I know that they
tried to reduce the amount of grinding you needed to unlock certain things well
not to mention the insane amount of free content they've given you like the last
Jedi content the solo characters the new stuff from the prequels you know like I
said you got Dooku and Grievous and Obi-Wan in there but I mean yeah they
did reduce drastically the prices of unlocking shit which I don't even think
was that good of an idea because now you really made yourself look stupid but
now I think a lot of the main characters are all free I don't think
you're on EA's payroll or something you talk I just insulted them what are you
even talking about I'm being I'm like I'm trying to be as fair as I can I like
the game lowered the prices of the microtransactions in the $60 game that
they released it made well it's just me because it made the people who did spend
all that money feel really fucking angry I'm sure you know what was they can feel
angry yeah I'm fine with the people who spent money on objective advantages and
what should be a fair multiplayer game yeah I don't care if they feel shafted
people in the chat are saying that it is now only cosmetic yeah apparently you
cannot buy star card upgrades with a bent over even more they bent over
backwards even more I don't know if it's for their players yeah I hope that they
would I remember the biggest thing the game didn't they have the flaws are like
minuscule didn't didn't they prove that to be able to play as Darth Vader you
needed to grind for about 900 hours when the game came out well something
ridiculous I'm sure he was expensive yeah it probably costs like stupid amount
of credit that was what caused the initial controversy you know I like to
look at the bright side of things I don't know of course but you know you
got to just appreciate the fat the aspects of the game that are good and
there's a fuck ton of them I'd like to move on we're talking in circles about
this game I think we reached a nice little conclusion there but we we we are
in a new watch together they were we're not gonna look at we usually look at
meme videos at first but we don't do that cuz Wolf's not here and he needs to
appreciate that he's in a lot of them so we will I mean we got a chunky chunky
intro there anyway so the first video and possibly the only video
no not the kittens all right well I mean I can just fucking introduce the video
anyway it's a video called Star Wars the fandom menace and I believe it is a
video that is critical of the negative response to TLJ not got a huge amount of
views and it's not like you know the guy who made it I don't know he's got 34 K
so this is relatively a strong channel maybe but um yeah the idea will be I
haven't actually seen this video I've only seen like the opening and I'll just
be curious to have a look at it and then maybe we can talk about the movie
and possibly the the culture surrounding it I really hope he I really hope he
sticks it to those incel man babies but uh yeah not every TLJ haters and
incel man baby we we know I am you know I can't hear you from your basement V2
test one too oh no no me you can't hear me oh yeah so by the way I just should
say that we did cover your video in like efap I want to say 16 17 one of the
earlier ones I video or majorly oh I'm aware I got a tsunami of comments after
that we we enjoyed the hell out of it we may have disagreed with it hugely but
we really the I think by the way were you responding to you responded to a bit
of videos video in that video did you or did you not I honestly haven't seen
his complete cinematic failure I just I just loved the the title so much it just
you know you know the I'll never forget the you get to look at women comment
wasn't that in response to the the part with veto says something like there's
there's like five women on the screen at the same time right now no no I don't
think I was aware of anything he had said I that was just in response to you
know amazing Lucas just being okay okay well yeah we thought that was a
hilarious counter argument oh yeah I mean I you gotta understand I am fully
aware that a lot of things I say are very easy to make fun of it's I I want
you to make fun of it that's the thing it's like I'd rather you make fun of me
for stuff that I know is stupid then not like that's a libtard thing to say I
know that's the point I want to piss off the amazing Lucas's of the world I
want to say the exact opposite of what they're thinking because I know it's
gonna get a you know no wait is your opinion your opinion or is your opinion
baiting it's my it's my I do I do like the casting in the film I think Laura
Dern is hot I think Billy Warren is hot yeah I mean you get I mean I look at
that she's wearing around her neck and I'm like yeah you know the thing about
Haldow is like the reason why I love the character is because yeah it's not what
you'd expect she looks like this purple haired lady that that doesn't fight
isn't a general or an admiral but she steps in and then when she you know cuts
Poe down in that next scene you see that she is really who this person is
she's really an admiral she has she probably has what it takes to be layers
successor and she does because she teaches Poe the exact same lesson that
Leia was trying to teach him you know there's only dead heroes are dead uh what
was the line like something dead soldiers no here dead heroes no leaders
that's what Leia said to him and it's just like doesn't Haldow become a dead
hero but she's still a leader though she led she still taught Poe the lesson
yeah that's the thing like yeah they all died but the lesson that Luke gave at
the end of the movie for example was that you can use non-violence to succeed
in a war which should be the lesson that the Jedi are teaching us at the end of
this movie and she didn't find what she hates to defeat the first order no
that's well that's that was the whole point Poe went ape shit got the whole
bombing fleet killed in her eyes yeah it was and maybe it wasn't the best no it
actually wasn't Poe well it wasn't even that bad of an idea that's the thing
it's like no no you said it was Poe it wasn't Poe who did that oh who got the
bop who wanted the bombing squad to attack bombing squad did it on their own
on orders from Leia well Leia wanted them to go back and not destroy the
dreadnought and Poe went against her men no I'm confused but she ordered them in
but then Poe took it to the next level he's like we have a chance to take out
the dreadnought and Leia was like no turn back around and then he shut her off
yeah he knew it here but she can still talk to the bombing units yeah she
ordered the bombers up that was her she didn't want them all to get killed she
slapped him she scolded him she did and I considered a bit of a reckless move
considering she had all of the power to be able to draw them back yeah she made
the mistake too of putting Poe in charge of that mission maybe wait how
does how does the chain of command work there she goes all the bombers go in and
then they're like all right Leia gave us that instruction but now we listen to Poe
on whether or not to turn back I don't know it's not very well translated in
the film because it shows Poe muting here but it doesn't mean that everyone
else can't hear Leia
the invisible bombers appearing from nowhere once Poe brings them in maybe
it was like mauler and he just like kicked Leia out of the chat and they all
just didn't hear I I guess that I don't know yeah you're right that wasn't
explained but you know I don't know it didn't really bother me I mean it just
felt like he was going against her and that's great drama by the way the fact
that you see these heroes butting heads it really fleshed out in that scene I
think that it's Leia and Poe are not heroes no I thought you meant the one
with a holdo and Poe no no no I mean the very opening scene is great I mean it's
so true I appreciate that dynamic like the idea of two good guys clashing on
what should be done I just like for instance by the way if they decided to
turn back unless those bombers have hyperdrive they never would have made it
back to the raddest before they'd get shot down just slow they were yeah I
mean and if they have hyperdrive holy shit they should just hyperdrive one
bomb and they do by the way the ships do have hyperdrive we actually checked
well I mean look how much where is that you know it's like doesn't matter this
whole thing was that they you know I don't know that just didn't really come
up in my mind for the fucking god knows how many times I've seen the film it's
just you know yeah I'm sure if you really pick apart the timing of the fuel
consumption and events and that yeah you'll probably find some holes you're
right it's not about that no your thing so that scene I like all the explosions
and spaceships to go back to the women battle to go back to the women people
love that yeah I just really do like looking at the women in this film I
think it's well shot you think Rose attractive woman I think Kelly Marie
Tran is very attractive definitely I know I wouldn't say that the character
of Rose is supposed to be attractive I mean you know Rose is the person that
they needed she she needed to be this pure fighter who lost her other half her
sister and that's why she will not stand for Finn being a deserter and she
will not stand for him trying to order he tried to leave an escape but when did
he join the resistance yeah no he was just he offered help he was never
part of resistance yeah well whatever I mean she knew that he helped with the
Starkiller base mission she thought he was a hero she knew that people looked
up to him he was important they needed him and Rose just needed to be who she
was to get people in line she's probably gonna have that same role in
episode nine I hate to say it in line Finn I think an episode nine she's gonna be
a little black baby I was Rose how was Rose getting Finn in line you serious
there's like four scenes where she yeah tell it tell me tell me well the very
first one is when she tases him the next one is right how was that getting him in
line because dude really I just said that because they need Finn Finn is gonna
be a big big part of episode nine I hope he fucking picks out how was Finn
out of line dude he's filled with flaws that character in the scene that you
mentioned where was he out of line and how he tries to escape in the pod with
his backup pack up well why is that to go get Ray why is that bad he's trying to
save someone's life yeah I was unnecessary raising cowardly it was a
dumb thing to do no matter what whether it's cowardly or whatever is great
it was not the right decision they needed Finn first of all Finn had the
whole plan that didn't work but at least he tried and what was Finn going to do
wait sorry which plan the him and Rose came up with that plan to sneak on to
the the supremacy right guys but that's how are they gonna devise that if Finn
escaped well that plan didn't go anyway sure it didn't but still that that's the
movie though there would be no movie if he was gonna fight what he hates but
what he needed to do with save what he loves is true like she saved I don't
understand what the difference is but okay say that one more time I didn't
quite catch that he was fighting what he hates but what do you need to do with
save what he loves the line right I'm curious yeah I actually genuinely want
to get your answer on this so would you say that holdo was a defending what she
loves rather than attacking what she hates in her maneuver not the suicide
maneuver no but definitely in the whole escape plan yeah for sure I mean that
was what pissed Poe off that's why it's the audience off so you think that she
was doing the attack what you hate when she did the hyperdrive thing she did
both when she was loading the escape pods yes the Rose says that you
shouldn't do one and you should do the other she says sometimes it's better to
say obviously you have to fight that's how we're going to win this thing yeah
well that particular moment yeah yeah that particular moment you can't kill
yourself and like don't die because laser beam scenario but later on you
get to fight what you hate also yeah yeah one person already killed them two
people killed themselves sacrifice himself we had page we had holdo we
don't need Finn that's too much but if they hadn't a blasted open the wall they
could have stayed there for indefinite amount of time wait if they hadn't
blasted open you mean the wall at the end yeah like the we would we were told
that if they destroy the cannon then the cannon can't blast the wall and thus
they would be safe and destroy it wouldn't wouldn't matter is protecting
what he loves or no there was a better plan anyway or was he hating what he saves hold on this is
getting kind of Luke had his own trajectory okay yeah Luke did the same
thing yeah he chose not to fight Kylo see if Luke physically went there he
loved yeah like everyone loved if everyone like Kevin Smith got their way
and Luke got in the x-wing or whatever physically went there only two things
could have happened either he kills Kylo or Kylo kills him how how it didn't how
do you figure that those are the only two and what else is gonna happen what
else is gonna happen he delays Kylo and then escapes are you that's a Kylo is
strong wounds Kylo that refuses to kill him but the whole point is Kylo and I'm
sorry to say this I know people gonna be like oh my god but Kylo could whoop his
ass I'm sorry look at how fucking buff he was they should call him Darth wall I
mean I mean Ray be kind of a fight is who's more sure sure Ray be Kylo but
she's the good guy what we don't want the good guy to lose
there you go so there's more buffs so he wins except if the other person's a good
guy in which case I do I do want to sort of highlight rags his point there I found
it interesting that you said like what can even happen if Luke goes there
personally it's like do you know he would have died he would die what I was
gonna say something has to happen as a writer you have like a thousand options
and you limited it to Kylo dies or Luke dies it's like so many other things
could happen imagine an episode 5 right Cloud City Luke and Vader go there the
only two options is that Luke dies or Vader dies there's no other options
except now we know yeah cuz he escaped but look I mean oh one of them escaped
that's maybe that wasn't possible unless you were not physically there
what do you mean maybe it wasn't why I wouldn't order I mean you're standing in
front of like fucking they escaped they escaped in the movie picture this that's
an option of what happened they battle they battle and then Luke wounds Kylo by
he smashes the lightsaber with an extremely good move with the lightsaber
and cows on the floor like yes he does not kill Kylo there's literally a
precedent yes it did there's there's a precedent set for this being able to
happen so yeah that's a possibility but I don't think that would have been that
good I'm sorry oh it is a possibility so there's more than two it's not a good
one it's like it's like when people say that Ray should have been a whatever
it's like yeah that could have happened but it would have been for me dude I'm
just saying why wouldn't why wouldn't be affected because it's just not a big
happening just someone getting it's not a big happening that's what this is
leading to empire strikes back the biggest happening okay but look we got
to take it to the next level by the way the whole fact that Kylo and Luke had
that conversation or Luke apologized and tried to get some kind of redemption I
mean don't you think that that was we could really dramatically impactful okay
so they talk but then they also fight I mean that's what literally happens yeah
but like again Luke is not as strong as these new character Luke and Snoke have
to rely on mind tricks exactly maybe he does maybe he tricks Kylo he he has like
a force sort of clone that Kylo attacks and let me back up for it let me ask you
guys a question what actually are your problems with the ending this sounds like
a non sequitur the same fucking topic tell me you mean the death of Luke
Skywalker is that yes tell me Vito because you seem like you feel stronger
about this but what what are your problems with the whole Luke ending
thing he doesn't die as Luke Skywalker he never resumes he doesn't die as Luke
as an old bitter man I was the old and bitter he apologizes to Kylo he shows
compassion what is the apology when he literally says I'm sorry the wrong
everything is just just disappears there's no there's no like hey man I
think you're going down the wrong path I think there's still good in you there's
no there's no Obi-Wan to Darth Vader being like you know strike me down I'll
become more powerful than you possibly imagine he kind of said that he said
I'll see you around and he did say if you strike me down I'll always haunt you
like your father just tells them hey you're a failure see you know dude he
popped that's one way to look at it definitely and and that's why it's so
cool because you could look at it as he's taunting him and making fun of him
or you could look at it as he's apologizing and trying to I've said this
my videos I'm like I'm actually gonna back you up here a lot of people are
saying he doesn't apologize Luke does say I'm sorry I failed you yeah he
literally says I'm sorry I failed you and that's why the scene has had to
happen because if Luke fought Kylo yes it would have been cool but it wouldn't
have made sense in the story Luke's whole reason for being on that island
was because he held the saber over Kylo something he feels awful about he
created this tyrant this Hitler of the universe and I'm pretty sure Luke
sites Snoke is the one who created him he says Snoke's gone to his heart well
he blames Luke and and the only thing Luke could have done was apologize if
Luke fought Kylo it just wouldn't have made sense why I'm gonna go it would
have a better rectify what I did by kicking this kid like we suggested he
wouldn't kill him he would stop him yeah but we've already seen that with Rey
it's like it's literally a precedent for it why you just suggested that Luke
wouldn't kill him so what we just said had to be in character right he wouldn't
I'm saying he would either he would kill him or Kylo would kill him and neither
one of those would be good where would it go from there what would be the third
clarify you think that Luke would execute Kylo if they fought wouldn't you
want to see that what if people this is part of why people think that Luke has
been damaged that's something we would never expect yeah yeah that would be
that would hurt the shit out of my expectations look I think the only thing
that made sense I think the only thing that makes it right I mean people said
that about Luke though people were like oh that's how you're gonna kill Luke
it's like that's the best way to kill him off and and not that I'm saying he
should be killed off but that's where the story was going when when the Force
Awakens came out and Luke was not present during Han Solo's death how you
gonna explain that there could have been a million reasons why he was yeah
but this this one made the most sense I'm sorry like if Luke if Luke was over
in like a library researching badass fighting techniques that's not good
enough to like let Han die that doesn't make sense the only thing that you can
do is make him this this depressed hermit who's rejecting everything it's
like all not at all all right so what would what would you have rather had
them studying the force he was out there studying the force building a secret jet
high temple on the island letting Han die he wasn't there it wasn't up in a
way that was happening yeah that's not relevant or maybe Kylo you know cut him
down he's meditating gaining his strength back in the absolutely he
could have been injured by Kyle he was I mean how do you think he was able to do
this this force projection that that's why he didn't show up to save Han cuz
he was these wounded or whatever emotionally wounded who knows I mean the
the move that Luke did do fighting move for a way to defeat Snoke Luke was
trying to he's the ultimate like original Sith or something and Luke
didn't but see that but again that wasn't necessary cuz Kylo kills your
question was what else can you do it's a post hoc rational okay but why he didn't
do sorry okay sure yeah so you said there were no other options we came up
with like four or five right there but they don't make that much sense though
it makes a lot of sense Luke okay did not need to get killed by Luke yes I was
going to the theater expecting them to duel I was right with you guys I thought
this film I didn't think I didn't care if Luke whatever I okay fine whatever
people did a lot of people did I've read some of them did yeah people I think
people more concerned with having some of them having an explanation that's all I
think no having an explanation yeah just have a no explanation so you guys
don't like that Snoke had no backstory what is to like about that yeah a fact
that he didn't need one at all except for the gap between episode six and seven
sure dude that should have been filled in already it's not when you have this
character who by the way in The Force Awakens I thought was pretty fucking weak
because he had no backstory and and by this point no it's not I if you look at
my video for Force Awakens I say that Snoke is a weak character because who
the fuck is this guy we don't know anything and now at this point it really
doesn't matter because in The Last Jedi it's not about that the first scene we
see with him there's drama between him and Kylo he's treating Kylo like
no the problem still exists it's like they've moved on we need to know we need
to know something about Snoke we know nothing yeah to clarify who's there it's
the Emperor we knew like okay he took over the galaxy so you just want another
Emperor you just want like a character that basically is the same role as the
Emperor again the fact that they cut him that's what they sliced him as the new
Emperor I was about to say we've been corny if we're assuming even if it's
corny at least he had at least he serves a purpose in the story if in this
conversation we assume the Force Awakens is in stone and we can't change it then
yes we are currently dealing with an Emperor clone so what can we do that's
what they wrote him as so what can we if you're saying from the ground up no I
wouldn't have had an Emperor clone but if we're dealing with the Force Awakens of
our lore we have to then I go okay so the first thing I've got to do because
JJ fucked up is explain how six became seven and the one of the biggest things
to do is figure out Snoke where was Snoke when Palpatine was in power where
was Snoke and how how did Snoke tear apart a Skywalker and solo families how
did Snoke gather so much power and men Snoke is the key to all of this yeah but
he doesn't have to be though he is where he was the key and you know everyone was
like because the movies tell us he is Kylo's the key now it really
is all because that's after the fact this is after the fact after it's all
before I mean maybe Snoke only rose to power because he found Kylo and was
using him you know maybe draw that inference I don't I'm just saying it's
possible you're just making it up we have nothing to go by because of these
characters that's not making it up just like everyone is making up tell that to
the frickin stupid fan theories that better I don't know anything about fan
theories this is just us you don't know anything about fan theories well then
I don't pay attention I don't pay attention don't know the researching fan
theories is like what research is that relevant to it's totally necessary you
have to know what people are saying about the film if you want to like but
it's not we don't know if it's real or not I don't get we all we have to go
that's set in stone is the movies I don't care what the fan theories if you
agree with what I just said did you hear what we were saying before like are you
forgetting the sentence like I'll say something and you ask me why I'm saying
it but it's like dude are you are you following the conversation honestly I was
wondering why you can't follow because you're giving me mixed signals here as I
was saying cuz dude we're talking about Snoke and people wanted to know
something about him there was all these theories about him like oh he's dark
exactly who fucking cares who snow you said that I have to know what the
theories are and I need to research the theories I would say that you would at
least have one so what I think is happening no backstory is that rags I'm
gonna try and explain both of your positions of why they're clashing rags
is saying Snoke needs to be explained so that we have continuity and you're
saying you've got all these fan theories that try to do it what we're trying to
do now it's like we're we're talking about it to get to a point where the
films actually just follow we don't care like the ideas like Snoke is Mace
Windu it's like I don't care Snoke is Palpatine's brother I don't care what I
need is specific information of how he made this mechanically happen why this
happened so how he rose to power then is what you want to know just how he that
would be in this position I don't know the well because like he might have been
in power this whole time as long as you didn't know something yeah honestly you
know you're not wrong but again this was a thing I brought up when the Force
Awakens came out it was like this was something that has always been a flaw and
and at this point especially now that he's fucking dead and that he made Kylo
even more of who he is because he did that for Rey and then she kind of turned
him down it was all just leading up to this great moment where now Kylo is this
powerful leader of the rest of the First Order and that's what Snoke's purpose
was you know that he might not be dead right what it leads to that'd be fine but if Snoke is alive that
that could be fun I mean what that shot where he had his tongue hanging out when
I first saw that I thought that was an interesting thing to do well it was
almost like maybe he's still alive because his eyes were open and you know
his body slumped over on its own that's gravity there's a few things that they
could undo like if they wanted to make the only thing I know about Snoke is
that what doesn't Leia say like oh he turned Kylo was it Leia who said that
yes no it was Leia and Han we're talking to each other yeah it was also Luke who
said it as well in TLJ what does that mean what does it mean exactly how did
he tell you how was Kylo doing before the original trilogy what is his has
been missing you're right I mean why do I gotta wait till the third movie to
figure out my villains motivation in a way it's it's cool because you know me
into this all I think I hear I have no idea what I have no idea and I don't
care the upside to it is that we're learning this really interesting
backstory through flashbacks which hasn't been done before and I think it's
being done pretty damn well when in fact two of my favorite characters of all
time are dead and I have no idea why or for what purpose do come on Luke Luke
sent a great message in the because he had to teach that you need to you put
love over everything he did exactly what he did for his father he chose not to
fight him or movie you can't put that's yes but it's a Star Wars movie it's a
space fantasy and it's about it's about family and relationships I got it it's
about love outside of the theme why did Kylo Ren need Luke Skywalker today why
was Kylo so pissed off at Luke because dude Luke's question he asked that's not
the question he asked okay what did he ask I'm sorry asked why Kylo needed Luke
to do he just wanted to kill Luke out of a sense of revenge I think there's more
to it than that right there's a lot of reasons I think he
give us three I'm telling you okay number one he he wants to be the most
powerful Jedi he's got a snuff Luke out so you can be the one oh yeah we'll take
these one at a time what element of the script supports what you just said why
wouldn't he want that can you reference just a scene or a line to support what
you just added first of all Snoke told him to he said Skywalker lives you need
to snuff him out blah blah blah maybe he's just ingrained that this is Kylo's
mission that end the fact that he blames Luke for making him how fucked up he is
he clearly blames him I mean you could tell from that showdown that they had
the way he was looking at Luke he was like a like a snarling dog I mean the guy
just had so much honest animosity towards Luke I don't think he was just on Snoke's
orders he really blames Luke for fucking him up well maybe the story's over so
Kylo got what he wants Luke Skywalker's dead and we don't need a third movie
right oh no see now Rey and Kylo have to go at it because now Kylo is gonna be
really pissed at Rey for turning him down why though he told Luke I will
destroy her and everyone yeah we're asking for the reason for that statement
not this thing well it's the same thing it's it's just like Luke you know Rey
saw the good in Kylo and it wasn't enough Luke saw the bad in Kylo and it
wasn't good enough for Kylo he's so fucking tortured it's like when Luke did
what he did he was seeing the dark side future of Kylo and Rey is trying to do
the opposite of that but it's too late for him and that's why it's so tragic
because in The Force Awakens everybody was aware that Kylo was like a pussy and
wasn't you know fully dark and you know again I think that's why he wore the
mask tragedy the tragedy is that Kylo could have been good he's the son of
Leia and Han but he maybe he almost was but if Luke didn't do what he did he
would have been okay or was Luke seeing a distorted vision was Luke getting a
dark side like trip and that wasn't even the correct future
fuck at the at the end of Empire I know what's going on okay the the Empire
wants to kill the rebels Darth Vader wants to convert Luke Skywalker to evil
right right I know everything that's going on and I'm ready for a third movie
the first order is now under Kylo I don't know why that matters or what he
wants with them Luke Skywalker's dead I don't know what that accomplishes Kylo
wants Rey Kylo is gonna burn it all down for a girl that's how crazy he
just wants everything gone why did he take the first order then why didn't he
tell them all to pull out their guns and shoot themselves in there what about the
whole thing they turned him down there was this was the next best thing he
wanted to rule with Rey when he found out he couldn't do that he was like fuck
it I'm gonna take control of this and now he's gonna know he said he wanted to
leave it all behind you didn't want to whatever whatever you know what you're
saying is contradicted by something in the film I was gonna say you can't I
understand the need to say whatever but it's like but this is your point isn't
it yeah this is this is literally you got what I'm trying to say though he
wanted Rey and him to join forces that's that's what I'm trying to say he wanted
him can you see how me as a yeah can you see how me as a person who wanted to be
invested in the Star Wars thing I'm going to the third movie like oh why do I
care like I have no idea what anybody wants okay well then oh there's bad guys
and there's good guys because some of them have red lightsabers and some of
them have blue lightsabers like that's pretty much all the information I have I
hear what you're saying there was kind of like a reset button hit in a way but
look it's the exact opposite of what we were left off with The Force Awakens
this this fucking grueling cliffhanger where it's like we know the next movie
is gonna be like a minute after this this is the exact opposite of that we're
taking a year off we're gonna let these characters grow and evolve probably
don't grow them off-screen please what do you think Return of the Jedi did when
we when we saw them again they worked so much more good at what they do we
couldn't have had a character okay well not Han but like Luke definitely
evolved between those movies and an empire that a little bit of training for
empire gain confidence is would be the price so you're saying you don't want
dude I'm excited to see Finn and Rey and Poe after a year I can't wait to see
what they're gonna be like I mean I definitely I want a time skip
absolutely okay I think they're gonna need one yeah I don't think they can do
the film without a time skip at this point yeah they're gonna have to
basically require one it's gonna be free it's I hear what you're saying though it
is kind of the reset button and it's all different now like the stakes are
different the motivations are different like you said when we left off an empire
there was this clear-cut conflict now it's it's about Rey and Kylo and it
should be I mean why return of the because that's how the original was to
end the prequels it's all it's all about this have to be like the original so
okay so do you not honestly I'm not trying to like piss you off by saying
this but like are you aware that like the main plot line of the prequels and
the original trilogy is the the family drama or the relationship why does that
even matter because that's dramatic why does that why does that have why do we
have to redo old things why does that have to not redoing it it's very
different if anything it's the polar opposite and the original trilogy the
whole more the whole theme was that you have to love your family unconditionally
and and redeem them and this one I think it's gonna be the opposite I think it's
if someone's not your family hate your family and no you just let them go okay
to stab your family well they sleep moral of the movie now I'm talking about
Ray Ray has to let Kylo go he's the abusive boyfriend he just leave she did
she closed the door on him at the end of the movie she she leaves him then
what's what's the conflict she's just leaving Kylo's gonna hunt her down he's
lucky cuz he said I'm gonna destroy her what why cuz he doesn't like her he's a
whiny baby well this is the moral of the story is kind of a weak really bad
things I use a phenomenal I want to be clear the intriguing conflict at the
center of the movie is Kylo Ren is a bitch is what you're telling me that is
the hook no come on why should I be invested in this character and you're
like he's a bitch you should be invested in him come on dude I'm saying he's he's
a very complicated character as he should be we we don't want a villain
that's just yeah we don't want in a villain that's just pure evil it's we've
really really evil though now he is yeah but he but I'm glad that he started out
kind of conflicted did you say we we haven't seen like a non pure evil
character I'm just saying it's been done so much in all types of movies that's
thank you fucking God I just mean like yeah by premise a good guy that slowly
turns evil good right that's why he was fucking good you have to have someone
that's confused and Kylo is such a confused menace he's always gonna be a
menace he always has to burn shit down and fuck everything up and kill he's a
bitch he does whatever the current writer wants him to do yeah I love I love going
to the toy store and I see these Kylo Ren figures I'm like what kid is buying
this being like all right let's play Star Wars you have to be Kylo Ren I don't
want to be Kylo Ren he's a bitch I can see what you mean I would just be I'd be
confused as to how to cosplay Kylo Ren exactly it's like depends on what scene
you're gunning for is how he feels you know what I feel really bad about all the
people bought like the $500 like replica Kylo Ren helmet when force
awakens comes out and then last Jedi comes out we go yeah bitch version of
Darth Vader aren't there uh JJ is planning on bringing the mask back what
do you mean that's the only thing I like what are you seven that's the only thing
I know to you got a cool mask yeah it's child it's like you're like going with
the iconic imagery you don't know it's because the character doesn't have
anything oh my god Star Wars is childish it's not we don't care about the
characters that there's no there's no meaning or substance it's all wishy-washy
all right I'm not gonna argue if see here's my position if you have a problem
with force awakens and last Jedi that's a whole different argument but if you're
trying to tell me that you okay fine but if you're trying to sit there and be like
force awakens is amazing last Jedi sucks okay I didn't think you would I'm
just saying that's where I'm coming when the movie was a lot of people that say
that and it's fucking ridiculous it's like backwards force awakens has good
costume design let's put it that's true I don't know man
Leo was looking like Hillary Clinton and that fell by the way can we at least
acknowledge that yes Leia was Mary Poppins in the last Jedi but at least
she fucking did something she did nothing in the force awakened she that's
alright I know but hey man if you say it dude I'm just saying it's better than
fucking her treatment and as Hillary Clinton pantsuit I'm sorry it really
wasn't though I fell for Leia reacting to Hans death and I didn't anything in
the TLJ that was a good moment let me let me ask you guys remember when they
got that on the last Jedi for Luke that was a smart one what you mean when he
was crying you didn't like that no no cut it in the film because yeah no but
you did were you serious that that was smart or not sarcasm that they cut that
from the film that was ridiculous right what do you think do you think it should
have been in there's a delete wait there's a blue crying hundred percent
how have you not seen this there are scenes that were deleted that I think
are legitimately bad like I think that Tom Hardy scene is fucking garbage oh
yeah no I agree with you but this scene I must put it in our walls I'll PM it to
I'll put in both yeah the crying was so quick and you know another really quick
moment that they should have left in it was so brief I mean literally 10 seconds
where you see Luke speaking the caretakers language to them I thought
that was fucking great well yeah yeah but we did get 11 minutes of canto
bites so um veto if you just check that out it's such a wacky casino yeah no I
did look at it it's pretty useless little scene there I just like there's a
lot of people who will defend the last Jedi to the death and they'll say like
the argument I've seen is we don't need this we know he's sad about Han oh no I
think they definitely should have left that in the film I also really liked the
deleted scene where Finn sees the hologram of Rey and him I you can make
fun of me I know it's corny but I love that I thought it was really really good
well like I'm just curious well do you think it's insane that they cut this
Luke scene cuz I do I think it's not really if you if you think about it there
are people out there that probably thought it would have been corny and
unnecessary we see a lot of I think Ryan Johnson actually said this I hate
to like take the words out of his mouth but there are a lot of shots of Luke's
like face with his mouth open in the film I mean it kind of fine one of the
other ones take place like right after he finds out about Han Solo I'm not sure
how it was actually it was right before I don't know where you I don't know where
you drop this in exactly I think if you actually watch it it shows what's
after it and yeah it's weird I think it cuts to like Leia in that room in front
of you know when she's sitting there at the table like as Ray's not in the room
with him at this point sense what's going on by himself like I think it cut
to Leia sitting at the table with like her hand covering her mouth she was like
thinking about how this was going you know like legit when I saw the movie the
first thing that slapped me right out of it was when she says she explains what
happened to Han well he says where's Han and it cuts away that to me was the
most bizarre choice for filmmaking in history to have Luke find out that Han
is dead off-screen I hear you but at the same time it's like people would have
probably you're right I kind of thought that too I kind of wanted to see Ray say
that but it's also really good when they cut back and you're just seeing Luke
sitting there on the steps looking demented like he obviously just heard
the news and that is pretty effective so yeah you know some people don't even string
together that that's what's happening a lot of people just like because remember
what he talks about was acting like before anyway and he says she makes her
argument about the first order then he's just like what do you expect me to do it
so we assume that he's just fucking all despondent about the fact that someone's
come to him to help get into a war as opposed to the Han Solo stuff this the
reason it works about is there's nothing else this is just him there's no one's
there that's the important thing no one's looking at him so he gets to be
raw true yeah no I agree yeah with the with the Han thing I don't know I I
think it's fine but um you know it's it's all just part of that thing where
we all really wanted to see these characters together or at least talking
about each other you know at least but the fact that they never got to be in
the same room is also really hate to use his word again but it's just fucking
effective like it really makes you appreciate the old movies because now
those are really special because we get to see those characters together they're
they're different it's like these movies are not even trying to be better than
those they're trying to be different and do their own thing so expecting
those movies are bad because they make the old movies more I'm just saying it's
dark the fact that you realize what you're missing out well I mean but but
that's that makes you really appreciate the old films it's like yeah the events
that happen why would you want to appreciate the old films I can watch
those whenever I want like make me appreciate this film I just think it's
the the scenario that's going on in these in the sequel trilogy it's really
fucking dark as it should be it should be a lot harder for these characters to
stick because it's episode 8 things it's supposed to be like level 8 in a video
game everything needs to get harder wait so episode 10 is gonna be darker than
episode 9 I'm not saying it's gonna be darker it should be harder for the heroes
to win therefore you gotta kill off some people dark hard same thing but why
so yeah why does that mean that's clearly is the end of return of the king
right is that darker than the middle of the two towers you mean the part where
Frodo is getting his finger bitten off no the end of the return of the king oh
it's the resolution it's happy I mean no no but but it's further down the road it
should be darker that's what dude come on it's a strange like I'm applying your
logic yeah he's just trying to know yes I am listen let's just roll it back why
does episode 8 need to be dark slash hard the for the characters cuz why else
would we be watching what how else is it gonna be like what's the point if if the
stakes aren't heightened and you can only do that by making these are there
are there stakes serious are there stakes in the new hope yeah there's
stakes in a new hotel there's things in the force awakens you know I actually
thought the stakes were kind of low in that film well what I'm suggesting that
am I is the the stakes would still exist even if you're not going dark and hot I'm
actually I would advocate in a trilogy that you bring the heroes down in the
second of the three films however I thought that you maybe would been a
proponent of being like well we did that before so why don't we try something
else well they're new characters now I mean not only do we have actual new
characters but the old ones have grown up so much they're practically different
people cuz they've learned so much I mean you know Leia has this power now to
fly or whatever pull herself
of all the characters are learning now I'm just saying it's like why now I'm
just saying they didn't look changed obviously we've except we've he can
probably know that right now I'm just saying lie yeah I'm just I'm just fucking
with you man yeah but I'll make you this fundamental character shift I'm
goofing on you with no justification wait say that again I'm sorry oh this
fun like for Luke especially this fundamental complete total character
shift into a new person is done all off screen with extremely little just I
don't think it was a complete fundamental shift into a new person at
all he just had a downer moment he was in a rut he made a mistake and isn't it
great that we didn't get to see why that happened well you mean why Luke held the
saber over Kylo I'm talking about the time between then and the end of episode
six we don't get to see any of that yeah well you know again they waited
really fucking long to do these movies the characters are but they give us a
flashback in which Kylo was playing Luke's student so why not have just made
a trilogy in that time I don't know that's a good question they probably
thought it would have been more effective to just cut right to the future
and I disagree I think they decided to try and remake a new hope and decided
the best time to do it would be 30 years later when you can just repeat
if you want to if you want to shift gears into dumping on force awakens we
I'm down well that's a whole other topic is the thing the one thing I give the
last Jedi is that if I was told to write and direct the sequel to force awakens
the first thing I'd want to say is like by the way JJ fuck you for putting me in
this position but that does not mean you can't make a well-written explanatory
film the first thing I'd be thinking about is like guys we've gotta fix this
we've got to explain all the things that JJ skipped over to have his
beautiful payoffs like we think they tried that with the flashback I mean you
know we saw that moment where Luke did this in my head I was thinking like
right 30-minute flashback loads of expos and he was just like the three second
flashback that we saw three times that'll do it okay so you wanted to see a
longer flashback then I am more substantive in a start I mean a lot of
people probably wouldn't have been down with that you know it's not all you need
to do is set up framing devices so for one we have Kylo being taught by Snoke
the final lessons of being a Sith and while they're doing it they can recant
some history some then we go with Ray and Luke talking about how all this came
to happen that's the perfect set up like Luke what the fuck happened and Luke's
like okay oh so blah blah blah you're not wrong I think there is still room to
do that and it would and it would be pretty cool if they did that in the
third movie because this movie was about the history between Kylo and Luke well
okay yeah I don't think this look this movie was pretty packed with shit I mean
the the fact that it managed to not really be that convoluted is pretty
fucking incredible we had a lot of scenes but we agreed the canto bite was
almost pointless though we agreed it went nowhere I don't know what you
define that meaning here's why I love canto bite all right by the way when I
first saw the movie I was in heaven during that scene here's why I love
canto it's it's a pure adventure I mean it's it's the pure adventure part of the
film where you're just dropped into this Star Wars casino which is totally new
for the films it's just fun man like first of all it's it has a purpose the
whole question is it better because it's new is I never said it was better
than anything I'm just saying one of the qualities that you assigned to this
scene was that it was new it is all right so because so right so it's it's
this new setting we've got new creatures so and we have this plot where
these people are you're just skipping right over why does that make it better
I'm explaining to you have this plot these people are like weapons dealers
it's showing you this other side of the war that's going on that I can't believe
some people had a problem with I thought that was really interesting and then you
have this this accident where they bump into this kid who just happens to have
the force he at the end of the movie and it's like yes it seemed like they
were just fucking up and running around but look they had good intentions and it
led to good things and Finn needed to learn that lesson fin needed to learn
lead to dude the kid the kid he had the force no matter what right but he has
the ring now he knows what did Finn learn exactly that that war is bad
worse bad animal bite when he was a bunch of civilians like wasn't that his I
realize war is bad moment so that war is bad the lesson was that this glitz and
glam it has a dark underbelly and also that you have to like show people that
you have good intentions not just take the mantle of the hero like she thought
he was in the beginning of the movie she frees that fucking the father or the cat
horse and children yeah the children you know children they left the children
they freed the children nobody knows it's a mess of a scene we don't know
what the fuck they're trying to do here you know the kid was like six I mean how
old was the horse maybe he grew up in that stable and maybe he grew up in that
stable leave him here to his slavery he looked like he was having fun as they
should have just left Anakin on Tatooine because he was born there can I
present he was to a an argument to to to Lee I want to see how he reacts to this
so the the way I think we're supposed to interpret it is that the kid is ecstatic
to see that the rebels not only certainly exist because that ring but
it's well okay so I get that right and the kid is like happy it's like hey the
the people are here and he wants to support them because obviously he's in a
in a rough spot um yeah the and you can you can talk about any source of the
issue for this be it force wagons or TLJ but my assumption here was okay so the
fighting between the First Order and the resistance has only really been
going on for a day because the Republic was destroyed a day prior to that who
we're in power and we're blissfully like vaguely unaware of the First Order's at
least power so yeah canto bite is flourishing hardcore under the Republic so
why would this kid want the good guys quote-unquote to even be in power when
his entire life he's been that way thanks to them if anything when she
showed that ring I would expect him to be like you hate them well I mean you
know it's possible that since he is very young he probably didn't think that deep
but no you're not wrong I just think you know this kid he's a Jedi I mean he he
should be part of the fight and no he's not a Jedi he can use the force no no no
you're talking about the character of Luke that's one of the very important
distinctions that Luke makes this is your character you love so much that's
actually a part of the film yeah what do you the force does not belong to the
Jedi the forces right that's true okay yeah so you're right yeah he doesn't have
to be a Jedi just kidding that's a force but he's meant to be in this fight I mean
he wore that ring and he looked up at that ship he wants to fight on the
resistance side he's probably wanted to for a while he has this Luke Skywalker
action figure that he just made and it but it makes obviously into it's to well
it doesn't make any sense that he would want to support the government that's
responsible for his condition or you'd be happy to see them I don't understand
what he thinks that they do one could say that the resistance is only fighting
because the first order is in power I mean don't they already in power
yesterday this could even know about this maybe he's working off of the
legends from the original trilogy maybe he heard about return of the Jedi and
he's playing with those toys and now this new thing just inspired him I don't
know it I'm gonna actually all side with leave for for one time I'd say that kid
has heard a bunch of storybook advantage can't be good guy Walker that's all he
knows no I'm actually on your side I'm gonna say I'm gonna say neither of you
make any sense that doesn't make that's cuz you like honoring the alive for like
ten years at most there is no world that he grew up with that didn't have
the Republican power you tell me the canto bite the most affluent fucking or
affluent expensive place of the planet doesn't have up-to-date news on who's in
power but I don't think I get what you're saying but man it's just I know it
does make a lot of sense doesn't matter though it's like making sense does
matter in film I feel like what you're saying is totally valid but I think you
could do this way any for us you could wave in colonial times you're not
doesn't matter take any film that like you love I guarantee really doesn't
say things like this about forest people in America saying is that their flaws
in other films too that doesn't alleviate the flaws in this one no I'm
just saying they're not even for it's like it's not a big deal it's just this
thing that like no I guess you could yeah it just no it just doesn't matter
just because you can do it in another film that doesn't mean anything that's
not relevant I'm saying they could do it in films that you like and you probably
don't we would accept is different than a film that's good that's completely
the reason this matters is because that kid saves them in that movie so you're
saying it's a flaw in the film that the kid is a fan of the good guys and not
just not it doesn't follow the kid would not recognize them and he would
certainly not like them and yet he's the reason they escape in two ways he
supplies them vehicles and he opens the gates for them you know he it's possible
that maybe his slave mother told him stories of the man yeah he probably just
thinks that the rebels are good and you know he's gonna side so I mean we got a
right for them at that point yeah we're going by what's in the film and you're
extrapolating based on I'm just saying there's plenty of characters in canto
bite that are painted as not good I mean there should be someone that is just
gonna stick to the light and just how does he know it's either that's the
point we're trying to make just because there's what I'm suggesting is that if I
grew up in his position I might look at the first order as the saviors yeah the
difference is that we're just going by what's in the film we're not trying to
make stuff up I don't even think that kid is gonna be in episode 9 by the way I
don't think so he's probably gonna be in Ryan Johnson solo trilogy or not even
but that would be interesting but yeah I think he really was just a symbol of the
fact that Luke and slept me here in slavery what what Luke did actually did
reach people's ears I mean it actually yeah I'd like to I'd like to approach
that I don't argue with that either I mean yeah how would you describe to
somebody what happened on crates like in definitive terms not like flowery
language literally just mechanically I truly truly was just over the moon at
that's at that whole crate sequence what do you want to know what I'm
suggesting is if if if the if the rebels or the resistance are the ones who
spread the story of Luke all they saw was him getting pelted by 8080s and he
didn't die they didn't see anything else remember they were heading to the ship
when he was fighting Kylo or doing something with Kylo so they didn't see
any of that but but they don't need to know that he did this crazy thing they
just know that he said he let the rebels escape he came distracted the first
order and the rebels were allowed to survive I mean that that could be all
that they know and that's enough to be inspiring yes so the if that's the story
that alone right I'm not gonna say that I can't inspire anybody the guy do that
he stood up to an army of 80 you stood up however T. Annaman Square thing but
how the hell did the story even get out when they're all on the money was it a
time skip because the kid is exact images when we saw him that is a good
question and look I know this is not in the film I'm just saying it's possible
people were talking about it nearby the kid over her maybe some guards what
about what about right tuxedo wearing fish people were like oh fuck you hear
about them let's say the story gets out all right and it makes sense that it gets
out what about the first order being like by the way he wasn't actually there
it was just like a weird projection thing that story could ruin the legend but
maybe Kylo is keeping that under wraps because that made Kylo look so bad can
you imagine the only wouldn't keep it under wraps at that point would he he
would expose Luke he'd be like Luke just sent a drone to try and make it look
like he's a hero but he was a coward say that you could say that but it also
makes Kylo look really fucking stupid I mean here he is swinging around his
saber at a guy who's not even there embarrassing himself in front of his
whole army yeah you could sell it however he wants it might my suggestion
is that it's it's a very strange story to have kicked off compared and this is
the important bit just 30 years ago when it's one man killed the two people at
the top of the chain in the Empire and was instrumental in its destruction and
the freedom of the galaxy how is that story not everywhere
already that is the story and my on out of the fight for 30 years this kid
thought that all right maybe he died and then the news that he reappeared was
enough I mean you know go ahead dude I interrupted you know I was gonna say I
mean I honestly thought that it would be a thing where the story gets changed
kind of like oral tradition so what those kids are talking about he's like
yeah he faced down the entire first order with a lightsaber so they don't
have the details so it sounds inspiring without actually knowing exactly what
went down right because they don't need to know he died maybe yeah maybe all the
details don't get out but you know people just extrapolated themselves just
passing this story around like there's no any and then he cut the head off all
the ATA you know the whole oral tradition thing it gets changed from
person to person you guys think Kylo knows checking out their message boards
you know they're there I don't know where they're getting the story from
yeah doesn't Kylo stab Luke and then he disappears and then Luke is actually
dead back yeah so you could actually argue Kylo killed him yeah right right
he let Kylo kill him in a way I suppose it seems so hard to clarify exactly how
the story spread of what the story would be I guess is the point here this is the
story of the age I mean this is Luke Skywalker saving what's left of the
rebels that story is gonna travel some nobody cares about you know cuz they
didn't come well in the health of rebels the kid knew that Rose was out there and
she was there or he met Rose you just went over why that kid shouldn't even be
about that they left yeah I mean I've really I have no rebuttal to that
honestly yeah it's terrible to roll back like this was just talking about
canto bite and it's it's such a mess but then like the main point people usually
make is that it it's self the opposite of self fulfills like it's self-canceled
was supposed to be a mess it was supposed to be this big mess that's why
it was good we're using the word mess differently I think there should be a
scene in this movie that goes nowhere and it's just an aimless adventure and
it's the argument go for it dude it's an adventure everything in Star Wars it has
been built up to be this oh man this has to happen and that character has to do
this there should be there should be a moment where it's just a break from all
the deep plot twists and it's just this Star Wars escapism you're literally
riding this fucking cat horse through this amazing town by the way that's
another deleted scene I thought shouldn't have shouldn't have been cut the
fucking and then you kept building on it but where you started was wrong what no
characters aren't destined to do these things by by Star Wars writing no I'm
just saying it's fun to have this scene where it's just people riding through a
fucking casino wrecking shit but there's no point in it
play Star Wars Battlefront 2 and you have that for hours upon hours I was
about to say what you just said whenever you want like I can't even get behind it
on a superficial level of just watching it because we're freeing this cat horse
we're helping this kid they were just being good wait so it is there's like
six arguments for this that we're gonna have to go through that I really listen
to see what your take is so destroying canto bite with those those creatures
getting rose they you you would agree they considered that a moral good and a
general fun yes that's what they had thought that they were doing do you do
agree with their take on that I 50% agree with it because as you know DJ
after that says you know some of those guys were good I'm sure they kind of
felt kind of a little stupid that's after it wasn't this is at the time while
they're doing it as they're getting ready to do it and as they're executing
let's ignore DJ telling us that people are morally good they will just ignore
that because they're supposed to be using that yeah they're they're wrecking
these rich assholes you know nice town so the concept of insurance right the
idea that the good guys who are super well the guys who are super rich this
isn't gonna bother them okay so take their aggression out and they're doing
them a favor it's a win-win so to think let's just assume there is an
insurance for whatever reason who do you think is cleaning that mess up that kid
the kids is broom the broom it's it is so embarrassing to think that they did
all the amount of damage they've dealt to that small child after all he did was
help them who knows he's whipping he's gonna get for double whipping they help
too though I mean they they gave him that ring man it was right yeah they
really just left him with like this big risk yeah I love why is the richest
casino place haven't six how useful is a six-year-old slave kid when you could
get a robot that probably cleans the casino yeah that's another to be an
eight-year-old slave kid well yeah that creepy child slavery no you didn't have
to have that at all why not it's not a reason why they had to do it it's cool
these are completely different things they didn't have to do it they decided
to write that in of their own volition destiny did not lead them to writing
those words I thought that little butt alien was pretty cute terrifying that
little ass work Davis ass dude he was hilarious it seems like you pretty much
on board with this what we're suggesting here is that not only was the the action
scene it seemed a little bit excessive for just enjoyment on a superficial
level but if you think about it for a second it becomes very like awkward and
you know you pull your collar like oh god what are they fucking doing and then
they're like this is why it's worth it and they let the the animals go so if we
ignore all the stuff that I just said releasing captured racetrack animals do
you know yeah why that's not a thing people should do well he went and they
went back to its family didn't I think they showed like a pack of other
father's I was pretty dark scene but I could have sworn it like I think there's
like a scene off out of the forest or no yeah yeah yeah something like that
right it's a giant rich people planted a big net will be a point point is they
will be recaptured because that's how they get these things in the first place
to if we depending on how long this thing was in captivity you can't even
survive outside of captivity anymore because it wouldn't have any I do just
know what to do three the the flying things they're like right there as soon
as they let it go I don't know what Rose is thinking that it's like yeah there's
no way they get captured again it's a planet they can't fly away maybe I could
have sworn and I know I should be sure about stuff like that but I could have
sworn like when they freed it it was running over the hill to join like other
ones but yeah they're either way that's true then maybe they're gonna all be
safe maybe there's 99.8 percent what I what I think people who love the movie
would say is you see Finn was like all happy about smashing the people we hate
while Ray Rose was like no it's worth it now because we've saved what we love
these innocent animals but you look at all the mechanics and it's like the
message is nice but good god you have fumbled its delivery and that would be
the the problem I have I get the message just like I appreciate the message that
failure is the best teacher I think that's a great message too but if I made
a movie where I said that was my message and there was just a black screen like
would that be what you'd consider a good movie it's like we always like degrees
in which you deliver this message right do you have like a method would have
been better delivered so I would have cut counter bite and re redone the B
plot I would have made it so it was relevant first but if you were like no
we need it to say that you should protect what we love instead of attack
we have okay we'll definitely do that but first we have to figure out what
I'll be plus gonna be but if you gave me that kind of creative freedom I would
want to nuke the a-plot as well I hate the slow chase I think it's stupid it
makes no sense you do we want to talk about that how does it make no sense
all right this will be easy this is like one of the things that we got Billy the
fridge with there's a lot of dialogue that they spend explaining it well they
try in fact I'll give it to you that they tried to explain it but they made
it worse so we've got the idea that the smaller the ship you are the faster you
are right right so why can't the star destroy the rat is yeah I mean again
these are things I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm gonna present I'm gonna say
the same thing I said for the other thing it's just not that important like
I get what you're saying it's very easily you could easily pick out things
that they should be doing if they're really going that slow this is central
to the plot of the film like everything relies on everything happens and it
revolves around this scene this chase okay what what's the what's the main
beef with that you know none of it makes any sense it doesn't make sense that it
even happens so first of all the stars joy should be able to catch up to the
raddest let's knock that one out secondly they can hyperdrive you know
that the film said the ship is smaller therefore faster it's dumbass logic but
that's the film star destroyers smaller than the raddest whether or not they wait
hang on I'm pretty sure they might actually be because the raddest is
supposed to be the largest capital ship that the river distance if it's not if
it is star destroyer like the main one is like massive the supremacy or no I'm
not talking about that one just the star destroyers it doesn't even matter
because this film operates it tells us that all of these ships can only move
at the exact same speed as one another well I was gonna say that if we don't
even possibly speed up which doesn't make any sense fundamental you remember
the opening for a new hope right where the big ship is chasing and catches the
little ship right well that's curious how that works um what I would assume
considering I'm not an astronaut or a NASA person it doesn't matter how heavy
or big your ship is it's gonna be all about the thrusters because you're in
space yeah I mean you you're right the new hope tante for whatever is called
rebel blockade yeah I mean they got they got boarded but again it's like it's
possible that now maybe their technology evolved because they started using the
Akbar's stuff and now they can go as fast as the first order I mean well
either way right so if we throw that out let's just pretend that's not a problem
and it all makes sense why can't the Star Destroyers send one ahead with
hyperdrive turn around and head towards them to cut them off that's a big thing
to do for a Star Destroyer I don't know maybe they turn really slow I mean it's
they have all the time in the world that's time time isn't an issue they
have all the time in the world to just turn around so maybe that would use all
their fuel up no no no they're huge that they can literally go ahead no no no no
the fuel thing it doesn't hold up this is an organization that can build
planet-sized planet destroyers resources are not an issue and not to
mention that the idea would be if you know they all port in like on the radis
for some reason I don't know why Kylo and Hux would have ordered every single
one to port the exact same place behind the radis instead of surrounding it but
let's just say that was an accident they go oops I hit the controller all you
need to do now is go okay Star Destroyer 7b go back by like one hyperdrive
unit and then go forward by 1.001 and you'll be just ahead of them you can
cut them off but but that's assuming they can do that they absolutely can if
they can they can land in the orbits of place they they hyperdrive a lot if you
remember an empire yeah yes so it's established that they can do this so why
don't they do it I don't know maybe they just all right all right they don't
feel like it we'll ignore that one then we'll put a pin in that one I mean
next I'll admit that that that thing offers a lot of questions but I don't
think it's a flaw necessarily it's just something that wasn't explained a shit
ton even though I thought it was but apparently not enough it just bother me
like it didn't bother me why I'm okay with it not bothering you but to say
it's not a flaw I find that interesting what do you mean by it's not a flaw I
just I mean it's not a flaw because it didn't bother everybody I also don't
think it's the a-story if anything it's like the sea no no we're going out of
tangent we're going to clarify I'm just explaining why I don't think it's
important that's not relevant whether you said that I'm important or not you
said that it's not a flaw because not everybody is bothered by it is that how
you define a flaw no I'm just saying it's not glaringly bad it's not like a
massive plot hole where no sense this couldn't have happened they had to have
been caught it's like no I don't I don't I don't see it at all what can you just
give me a what you consider a massive pole like in another film even if you
want to just right now jeez I don't know that's a good question I mean let's see
what was last bad movie I just watched well can we admit that plot holes exist
in films exactly would you consider what we've been talking about a plot
hole in a minor degree at least minor maybe nano degree I will say this it's
probably not the strongest plot threat of the film but I don't think that's
because it's flawed I just don't think it has the stakes as like the Luke and
Rey storyline or the Kylo and Rey storyline and that's okay I mean I like
this far more stakes than both of them all right well I saw it as this kind of
break from that and it's what remains of the good guys outside of yeah that's
the entire resistance right there yeah I mean you know it's just I don't remember
what I was saying okay we'll put a pin in that one as well so when they go
back to it when they connect to the radis with all the star destroyers they
release four TIE fighters now before I make my point about that between the
four of them they destroy the bridge on the radis and the radis is hangar now
that's a lot of damage for for the TIE fighters why did they send only four
instead of a swarm I'm starting to see a pattern with your guys's criticisms but
I question why did they only send four TIE fighters because Kylo was a part of
that squad he was probably like no I got this when Kylo comes back why did they
not send more when cuz they fucking wiped them out dude later they were
still clearly alive in front of them but they didn't didn't they didn't Hux have
a line there where he was like like right before they showed Leia waking up
and flying away they had Hux and he fuck what did he say he was like well we'll
keep at a safe distance but keep firing I can't remember the exact island I know
I feel like they did offer some kind of maybe it wasn't that strong doesn't
Hux get mad he's like why can't we catch up to them yeah even though the TIE
fighters can we can establish that TIE fighters can so why don't they just send
TIE fighters to blow up the radis they have any left I don't know maybe they
were down to their last fleet supremacy has like hundreds of thousands of
personnel on it yeah but it got destroyed not yet they have hundreds of
thousands of personnel it really is possible that Kylo was just like nah
okay look I have is that they're like why waste the resources you know you
could say that the full TIE fighters to begin with why waste the resources on
destroying our only enemy it really is possible that these two sides actually
have a similar amount of resources at some point in this film because they're
getting their shit from the same people we did learn that well they have them but
they already have they established that all they have left is the radis the four
support ships and the 400 people I believe well the first order and I'm
totally kidding when I say this but maybe Finn destroyed the city and now
they can't buy any more ships well they already have all right I think the line
that the the you I think you're drawing is the whole like I don't care if it all
lays out logically it's about no no no no no I I'm totally comprehending what
you're saying it's not perfect you don't consider that important right I don't
even like remotely okay so it's I do agree that the the lines were Hux and
that fuck I can't do what was that actor's name the his like first in
command I can't remember yeah the British guy that scene yeah maybe the
explanation could have been a little more pleasing would you would you agree
that like Ryan Johnson cared to put lines in to try and explain it therefore we
should probably consider how well it's explained as in that's I'm not saying
that means it's good I'm just saying at least they know I'm suggesting that he
considers it important to his film he's like this needs to be explained and put
in lines in that explain it absolutely he's obviously aware that someone is
going to like you guys you know be really scrutinizing the realism and you
know if everything adds up scientifically and mathematically I don't
think we've gone much further than literal just easy logic right we've just
been like this X is Y but else X is also X but again it's like you could you
could make up shit that's not in the movie and I think we're all we're all
kind of guilty of that right now like no we're all just going by what's in the
film explanation well we're using just what's in the film and we're pointing
that out that it doesn't make any sense with the film's own logical rules that
his set the film does not follow its own rules yeah it's not about relating
it to our world it's about what they tell us about their world yeah it's it's
it's debatable but I see where you guys we know how that's been going I get how
movies like this probably are filled with shit like this because these are
scenarios that don't really happen I mean if they do it doesn't matter the
technology isn't real it's like it doesn't matter there's gonna be a lot of
shit that hold on a second I feel like there's gonna be a lot of shit in movies
like this that's just never going to make full sense cuz this isn't real
science it doesn't it needs to be consistent with it so here's the big
thing for me is like if it was some random sci-fi movie set in its own
universe where it doesn't matter I'd be like okay it's movies internal logic is
inconsistent so I'll turn off my brain and just come up with explanations you
know that maybe make it make sense that's just lazy writing not even saying
that but even if that was the case that would still be acceptable for some
movies I'm not saying that's what he's doing like yeah the writing kind of
sucks but like Star Wars it's like dude you have so much lore like so many
people are invested in this universe I feel like it should be like an airtight
ship where like there's not even a moment that I have to be like this
doesn't make sense well all you have to do is just follow the rules that you set
yeah what about previous movies I mean doesn't matter when when Han was
running the Star Destroyer I mean why didn't they just yeah what's the
inconsistency why was he able to outrun them in this millennium Falcon sure but
it's this big Star Destroyer don't they have the ability to teleport in front of
him I mean well no no no no because this is this is fair right what you should
we should be applying the lens to every star was film so what happens when Han
Solo is evading them he's literally flying around them then he draws them
into an asteroid field and then he hides yeah so but all of that follows to
me so like what or you could even say how did the Star Destroyer really not
detect that it was like on the fucking ship that to me always felt kind of
attaching himself to the ship I could totally see that coming up on a tracker
it's being like well that's us about when it was on the way what about when
is traveling to the ship couldn't have seen it then well the idea is he stuck
so close to them that for temporarily they wouldn't be able to see him but
then by the time they're waiting for him to turn back up they're like where's
he gone so what you could say is it's pretty convenient that they didn't think
to check the back of the Star Destroyer but I mean that seems like a pretty that
to me is what holders maneuver is done right it's a thing where we go oh that's
kind of clever and even the people on the Millennium Falcon say like this this
this fucking this worked like wow and he is a smuggler so it's precedent to think
that he would know how to do this yeah yeah I mean I'm not saying perfect I'm
suggesting that we've got so much to work with from the actual universe for
why that would make sense yeah well I miss we have none it is different you
gotta admit that like we never had a chase scene like this in store I don't
think anyone has ever said if we're at the point now where we've sort of shared
those issues but you're you're at the point being like they don't affect me
whatsoever that's fair what I would like to sort of talk about then is so
you've seen the disappearing knife right in the throne room yeah so does like
does that bother you absolutely not okay that's okay if every knife
disappears I want to explain it mechanically why it would bother
somebody so the idea of like Luke versus Vader it's like what is your brain
running on with all this like well Vader is really powerful Vader is evil
Vader's motivation is to try and convert Luke to the dark side but he
will threaten their lives blah blah blah he's gonna he's a pretty good fighter so
that's him we got Luke it's like well he's gone through a bunch in this
trilogy he's better now than he's ever been he's super confident and he wants
to defend not only the people that Vader's threatening but also fight the
chance of becoming the dark side and he's pretty skilled at this point too
who's gonna win this is gonna be interesting if Luke's lightsaber
disappeared the moment he went to strike Vader and it just disappeared we'd be
like whoa that's the lightsaber the floors taken away from us in terms of we
had all of our stakes we had all of the understanding of each team and now the
film has just said no to that specific thing Luke no longer has a lightsaber we
need to do something that's getting in the way of so it's betraying intelligence
Luke's lightsaber and some henchman's like little
what happens when a dagger stabs you I have let me relate it so like I've made
this that's the argument right in in that fiction so let's bring it over to
the Last Jedi Ray is we've got enough issues for how Ray is skilled and
powerful like without what I would call proper explanation she's nailing it in
this throne room fight now she gets to the point where this guy tangles here
where he can stab her in the back and she's finished but he doesn't because
the knife disappears it's a mistake she has the kind what I'm suggesting is
what does it do to the stakes of the story she is so powerful that she makes
it happen what I'm suggesting is why it affects the the storyline not I'm not I
think it's an error too I think it's a matter of them airbrushing it out when
they fucking failed to realize that she would be dead if they didn't do it right
that doesn't change the fact that it's massively critical to the stakes she
makes weapons disappear if they touch her yeah I mean well you're treating it
like it happened in the film do you understand that that's what you're
having like in the script it didn't say weapon disappears now it doesn't matter
it happened yeah but it was a mistake it wasn't yeah we know that it's like the
guy wearing blue jeans and gladiator you gotta be like yeah that was yeah yeah
it's a mistake I didn't even notice it but you get one what I'm the whole
reason I brought this up is it bothering you and it being a mistake of two
different things yes especially when it's that small that is it saves her
life I was gonna say she literally survives because of it she survives
cuz Kylo saved her at the last minute because disappears that didn't that
wasn't okay if you write Luke is wearing like literal converse in one scene you
see him in the corner of the screen you can see he's wearing that you go what
the fuck I mean it's gone for the next scene that is what I would call minor
because it has absolutely no effect on anything but it's a mistake now a weapon
disappearing before it can kill Ray is incredibly serious to the night I hear
that it's a weapon yeah I get that it's it's it would have made her break her
life yeah you're right but again it just wasn't intended to be in the story I
think that's very true I don't think they would ever wanted that to be in the
story it's on it's on the same level as you know people you got to be like all
right people are also making sure that they never hit Ray and like aim over
her head it hits three people if you want to talk about Ray that's that's a
topic but what I was gonna get into was you know if you want to ask my opinion
on shit that's like hated the Leia flying in space thing I thought could
have been better I don't hate it I don't think it was terrible but what do you
so I actually think it should have been longer I know that probably sounds the
opposite of what I think the moment turned people off because it was really
quick and jarring I mean here we are seeing Leia displayed this crazy power
you know she's surviving in space it's it's a big moment I think it should have
just been dragged out a little bit maybe we see like one more shot of her flying
towards the camera it sounds pretty silly but really I think it just should
have sunk in a little more here's another thing you could have done let
me know what you think of this what if instead of flying or pulling herself she
you might hate this too but a like a blue shield or something forms around
her and she protects herself from like the space radiation that's even worse
okay well I'm sure maybe some people would agree with you but then some
people probably like oh I like that better it's like you could improve that
scene a hundred million ways but I love the fact that we got to see Leia first
of all almost die actually have her like actually have some stakes for her and
then we get to see her do this great thing and it's not like she just was
perfect after that the book tells us that she got really sick from that the
book doesn't matter all right fair enough but I'm just saying it really I'm glad
that they did something like that but yeah I think it could have been maybe
paced out a little better so how did she learn how to do that
oh I don't know what did the what did Jessica Chastain learn at the end of
interstellar I literally don't care well I'm just saying it's like I a lot of
times are you assuming I like interstellar I don't care about no I hope
but I'm just saying there's a lot of times you could be like how did they
learn that well there's been I don't care I don't care about this what about
ism of other movies I'm asking about this movie it's been 30 years maybe she
just frickin learned it yeah no no okay she had because they didn't because they
didn't say I learned this also confirmed that you to compare it again for you
like the knife thing if we're unaware of powers or abilities the person
has it'll change the stakes arbitrarily in the biggest payoff moments what you
need to do it's standard storytelling you go what will let the audience know
that this is possible for layers like oh we need to have an earlier scene where
she does something that implies that she's actually got a decent
understanding of the force as opposed to Luke telling her you have the force we
need more than that otherwise when we're told she is dead we're like oh god it's
like oh no she's alive because of the force remember and you're like there was
a very quick let me ask how you feel about this I'm guarantee I guarantee
you're gonna be like wasn't enough but in the last in the beginning of the film
there was a quick moment where you see Leia sensing that page is about to die
or something big is about to happen the camera kind of zooms in or it's her kind
of having like that that was sensing death is something that a lot of the
Jedi do she did it in false awakens with fun and then right before right
before she got blown out obviously she had this moment with Kylo where they
were going back and forth with like the three frame fades just like in the old
one so I mean they did a little bit yeah they didn't say oh I learned how to fly
but I don't know maybe she didn't learn maybe she just learned it right there
and then kind of like how rave figured out how to mind control the Daniel Craig
storm price that was a mess well hey but it's but it's keeping it in line where
maybe you just learn force powers oh it keeps it it keeps in line with the idea
that force users can just spontaneously learn extremely difficult
techniques but that doesn't that flies in the face of the OT she's a Skywalker I
mean I wasn't bothered by her flying honestly I was like you know what if
she's a Skywalker maybe she just has that much latent force ability yeah I
mean she has you figured out you know for 30 years you're hanging out you got
some force power you might spend time trying to let well do you know that I'm
that JJ has said outright that she's had zero trainings in the time between six
and seven J shut your mouth
see if it was me and we it was like what is the quickest fix I would just have a
sight a quiet scene between her and fuck we're running I needed to be Rey but we
can't do that she's not there but maybe before Rey had left see this goes back
to force awakens it can't be in TLJ unfortunately maybe they're on a comm
device or some shit but she if Rey is like I can't get through to Luke like
something's wrong Leia could be like talk about the time that we spent
together talk about how he taught me blah blah blah blah and how he could teach
you or in the last movie at the end she says you know Luke will teach you like
he's taught me or something like that yeah yeah you sort of have a nod to it
like like Rey is like did he touch you and she could like smile totally fair
would have been cool just something so we can go oh so I wonder what Leia can
do I wonder how that'll pay off and then we see I think the moment was stupid
just on the face of like unnecessary it didn't accomplish anything other than
being like look she can fly okay so you could have just had her get knocked out
I always assumed that the purpose of it was to get Holdo in into the the admiral chair
because it would have been Leia but you could have had that you could have had
her just get knocked out by the blast absolutely maybe he should have died there
Holdo never would have destroyed that star destroyer if
I'm not gonna make the argument that we need it to happen because we need another thing to happen
by the way that's the other thing about Holdo not telling Poe the plan I've said this too
many fucking times I'm getting tired of it but like seriously as soon as Poe learned that he
called Finn told him what was going on it cuts right to DJ sipping on his coffee and just listening
who's obviously dude it's it's fucking Poe and Finn no it's Finn's fault Poe is it's got
nothing to do with Poe Poe has no idea what's going on the other end but the point is he's
telling people and it's getting out it's supposed to be the secret thing that they're escaping
well it's not supposed to be blurred remember what happens when he's told the actual plan
he says this will work well he says this might actually work meaning that he would have been on
board so isn't that just a bad call from Holdo she made a mistake yeah yeah no I think she was
making a mistake in that scene where Billy Lord is like what are we doing and she's like just
steady on you're supposed to say oh she's fucking up right now but she redeems herself by sacrificing
herself I mean there's really not much more you can do to try to redeem yourself I mean she's dead
you're not going to hear arguments against for us to fad to Holdo so you you got somewhere
you see what I'm saying it's like she really kind of knew that he was dangerous impulsive
like she said to him which he is he saved the day what twice already I was going to say he's not
what what what gives you the impression that he's a hot head dangerous pilot just the fact that he
just the fact that he turned that calm off with Leia and disobeyed her and just went ahead let
me ask you this what from TFA supports it because my argument would be it's invented for TLJ nothing
which is why I love what TLJ did to Poe's character because they gave him flaws in The
Force Awakens he was so pitch perfect he's barely in the movie was that he consistently makes the
right call when necessary all you need to do to give him no he was like too perfect his okay so
his like core character trait is that he's an amazing pilot right so like all you need to do
is have him put in a situation where there is no piloting and he can fuck that up what they
did was try to make it so that his leadership in terms of piloting or organizing a fleet was
flawed which I think is essentially a contradiction because he's been amazing right but but then again
it's it's the kind of contradiction that I honestly was really glad they did because that
character just needed some dimension and Force Awakens put it this way I would be more on board
with it if they'd actually done it in a way that made sense as in make it his fault make him fuck
up in the film I don't know that he makes any decisions that I disagree with he didn't think
when he turned Leia off you weren't like oh I mean that's that's that's a petty choice but it
doesn't change anything that he did in a grand scheme he just ignored it yeah yeah well I mean
they did blame him for getting the bombing yeah which is he saved the entire fleet
he saved the fleet by doing what he did and he gets no appreciation for that yeah yeah that
the character needed to be told about his flaws which there were and I'm saying I agree but the
way in which they executed it similarly to what we were saying about the themes like they it's
clunky they have all these ideas I think I think one of the commonly said things by Redler Media
was that like it's all about how they executed it it wasn't it wasn't that they have bad ideas it
wasn't that all these things couldn't happen feasibly the idea that Luke has forsaken the jedi
and become uh like sort of anti-jedi like I'm like yeah I'll watch that story but you've got
to really execute it well you can't just make it arbitrary which is what I feel like they did with
a lot of the elements to get there stuff happened that one time I mean like what else do you think
is is poorly handled but uh sounds good on paper Ray basically falling for Kylo I think that
him killing Han should have had a hell of a lot more of an effect considering a reaction in TFA
well she's so forgiving she's willing to see the light in Kylo it's like she's she's even better
than Luke Luke was ready to turn on Kyle it's the one thing that I actually really liked about
Ray's character was how much she she catered when he she brings up it's the one part that I say like
Daisy Ridley's doing a good job is when she like struggles to say why did you kill your father
because of how much Han meant to her which by the way I think there's a problem there but if we accept
it that Han Solo was a father figure to her for whatever reason uh she gets over that really
quickly in favor of um that's but that's Ray's lesson that was Ray's mistake of the film is
falling for Kylo trying to even just talking to Kylo do you see the connection here all of these
mistakes are just no it's just happening that's the whole point of the film these characters
needed to learn and you can only do that by fucking up the whole point of the movie is you
you're not going to learn how to win against Kylo and Snoke and all these guys the only way to
learn is not to fuck up that's not the only way to learn in this film it was the message and it was
pretty damn consistent across all the plot points I thought the whole conversation we've been having
was how it's all inconsistent I think it's the opposite of the message itself I understand but
the way they've delivered it has so many problems in each of the mechanical elements
like how does how does Poe grow by fucking up because by the end of the film when you okay so
when he sees Luke out on that battlefield and he says that line where he's you know quoting Haldo
we are the spark he's distracting us we have to save ourselves this isn't about Luke fighting
and this is about us getting the fuck out of here that's the moment where he really becomes a leader
how does that contradict what he's done in the past it doesn't it strengthens his character
it makes him really likable but where does he fucked up before that he fucked up the whole
movie how where yeah but we just talked about how all the choices he made that wasn't totally
would you not have committed to a mutiny with what was happening on that ship I certainly wouldn't
do anything absolutely the the fact that the mutiny was ineffective is another topic because
that's I agree with you it was so dumb the way they do the mutiny however the act of mutiny is
not a mistake in this scenario I absolutely would have been on his team even though Leia wasn't on
board with we didn't know that really doesn't matter we didn't know that well yeah but Leia
was in the coma before holder was introduced when you watch the movie a second time and you're aware
of where it goes and what Haldo's intentions were and what Leia's position so that's looking into
the future of the things that characters don't know no I'm just saying the first time you see
the film you're along for the ride you are in the shoes of Poe you're pissed at Haldo you're in the
shoes of Rey you're pissed at Luke actions that she takes and the reasons why she attempts to
justify them they don't make any sense all right well that's your opinion they don't change in the
first or second viewing and like what could Poe have done exactly I think they were strong enough
to be pissed at you what could Poe have done boring morale what post what should Poe have done
should he have just sat there I mean I guess we're gonna die you mean in that first scene
when he talks to her and he's like what's her plan everything from the moment he meets
Haldo onwards what should he have done I don't know I'd have to I'd have to think about each
scene but my point is that the best thing you could have done from what we know is to just do
nothing and we would have been fine but the fact is that all the information he has which is the
information she's controlling she only allows the trickle of very small pieces of information
all points to destruction everything points to everyone dying so he has to do something
because he doesn't want to die and he doesn't want everyone else to die and that's his fault
yeah but it's like again it was really good that he didn't do anything and at the end his
whole lesson was let's not do anything yeah but that's Finn wanted to go fight Finn was like let's
go wait say it again I'm sorry that what you're doing is you're taking the results of something
that they couldn't have possibly known beforehand and using that to rationalize the decision based
off of what the outcome happened to be how so give me give me the example we what you just said
about the mutiny he couldn't have possibly have known that things would have turned out a certain
way based on the information that he had the rationalization can't be well if he would have
just acted irrationally things happen to work out so that's justification and it's not
I'm not even following so the premise of the argument was a
poet made mistakes we're arguing that he didn't make a single mistake in the movie
well I don't know all right let's put it this way if the characters thought he did so
I definitely yeah if she thinks he made a mistake then yes
her being Leia doesn't give her freedom from not making bad decisions you know what they did really
cleverly putting her in a coma because if she had been on board with Holdo's plan and not telling
Poe Poe would have been like Leia what are you doing and she'd be like just just trust that just
she didn't even say that Holdo didn't even say we have a plan and we're not telling you what it is
but it's going to save everybody if she had done that I'd be true but I hate to sound like uh
whatever the fuck that term people like to use white knight I hate to sound like uh whatever but
Poe was being kind of aggressive to her and he was kind of like this is a life or death situation
I think he warrants being aggressive he didn't respect her he was like this is a life or death
situation for the entire resistance and because he's being a little snappy you're just gonna
not tell your your ex-fleet commander the plan no he got demoted it's not his right to what what
is a captain captain don't get to know captains don't get to know the survival plan dude I don't
dude you don't know dude I have no idea I know the story of this conversation is I don't know
fucking clue who's allowed to know what and this is fucking star wars this isn't like what does that
have to do with anything factual like oh this captain knows that who knows first of all there's
no one left there's obviously like emergency situation there's a whole shot of role holdo
is now the general in a way she kind of got like demoted am i wrong like this is there's no time for
fucking bullshit she got to know the plan i don't think it was bullshit because she became the
general the whole the whole crew is like oh my god we're all gonna die you know you know how much
harder it is to do your job when there's a gun pointed at your head so it's kind of nice when
somebody goes hey don't worry there's a plan everything's gonna be fine she didn't even say
your whole crew just have help just keep smiling said your whole crew's there at their terminals
being like well i guess we're all gonna fucking die why even do my job right i don't even know
this isn't the greatest you're gonna fucking hate this answer but maybe she had a feeling
that he would get on his cell phone and blab to someone not i mean i know that's not good enough
but it happened he did that you have to he did you have to bring that up you have to
just have her go i think there's a spy i gotta be quiet yeah i think i think that we could
apply a large patch to this this wound if she had just said there's theories that there is a mole
aboard but then the question is does that go again mentioned in the film in our world that
they're trying to put in a lot of people made that argument it's not even in the movie yeah not even
a little bit at in the slightest of ways like like people said she obviously thought poe was a mole
and the counter is one no lines but a mole in the movie and two she actually likes it's possible
that she just thought he was really reckless and he was gonna you know let it slip or you know
but i don't know what he did that was reckless but he got to do that was post post post the
decision not to tell him anything yes that was reckless the thing that got him slapped by leah
what was that well that he did that got him slapped well if you remember holdo even taking
out the dreadnought that was he saved the he saved the entire fleet yes leaves lee's right
in the she slapped him and do they confirm in the movie that they needed to take out the dreadnought
or they were going to dreadnoughts cannons yes no uh the cannons can fire and aim and fire at the
radis at a very significant range meaning needed but they needed the bombers to take out the cannons
is that what they thought the cannons were already taken out that's why i i thought that's why the way
i was like okay we're done no no no no no no so there's these mega cannon things that blow up
the base and they're right at the bottom right at the bottom yeah those so the film is telling us
those things can destroy the radis meaning at very large range meaning that if the dreadnought
had come with them when they did the uh the the ambush then the radis destroyed yeah why would
leah call them back is she's just an idiot this is this is the thing so you said that leah slapped
him and by virtue of leah slapping him you believe that he's done something reckless as opposed to
leah being wrong yes and leah was wrong oh no it's possible she was wrong no that's a great point
yeah it's it's confirmed that leah it's totally possible that everyone in this movie at some
point was wrong that's totally possible i see we go we're saying that specifically in this
point leah was wrong poe didn't do anything wrong i don't think so no but in a way maybe it's like
okay saying poe didn't do anything wrong in the movie i mean that's
arguable but you gotta like you i don't know you're just not seeing it from the the female
character's points of view they think he's wrong they think he's a decent reason to think so i
mean he did disobey his boss he saved everybody in the resistance let me say this publicly i would
hope you disobey your commanding officer if they're planning on murdering you there was that shot
where leah looked at her screen and saw all the x-wings were gone and she lamented okay so the
alternative is everybody dies or some bombers die so if you're a general maybe the bombers are more
important no bombers what i'm joking i'm joking the moments of war pulled that every i just don't
know what leah's plan would have been if they didn't take out the dreadnought was it just to
go fast enough to not get hit by the well they couldn't have gone fast that's the thing i don't
know i know i know they were trying to stop it from destroying the base that was on ducar
because that's what it was really letting it happen like hey how come at the beginning of
the film they didn't shoot the raddest before god yeah so lee i'm just warning you like we've
only been through like 30 of how much this movie we're not even we haven't even reached like act
two by the way i really want to know do you guys like i'm just trying to get like a better
perspective on how much you hate the film like you don't really need it we're just talking about
film stuff do you think that the film has some good elements but like plot holes ruin it most
you just think none of most of what i love about the film is superficial so like i love the visuals
in a lot of it yeah i'm just a lot of places um there's a couple scenes that i like i like the
ideas really don't like the the last 30 minutes just everything that i do i'm gonna i'm just
here i just really don't like women or minorities so yeah um like we haven't gone to all white people
but create is like perfect yeah what we did to canto bite we're going to be doing to crate too
because crate is a pile of shit for writing a pile a pile of red shit yeah but visually it looks
pretty cool you know the red on white i like you let's talk about the snoke getting murdered i
want to know why you said that and the black guy almost died which would have made did you say
wait what did you say bro are you i don't know if you're i hope you're joking dude
i'm obviously joking come on he's he's baiting don't fall for it late don't fall for it
i'm not i almost did but not quite he was a good time you're funny okay so
snoke dying how do you guys feel about it so what's your i'm okay with snoke being killed it's
that i needed the information on him that's my take on snoke gotcha the way he died um i guess
you'd have to so there's there's one question of of how the hell he didn't see it coming because
he's supposed to be like the most powerful being in the universe um i think i could answer that i
believe it or not well my answer my counter argument to myself would be oh well he was sensing
kylo's desperation to kill not specifically who right and he was so blinded by his cockiness i
mean he really thought he had kylo by the balls and that kylo would do whatever he wanted because he
probably did train kylo and thought that kylo needed him and he didn't realize that kylo is
fucking way stronger than snow don't you think that he was a puppet master in the first one and
the second one they make him this affluent over the top like i'm the best i have all the best
things i'm super smart and powerful person snoke yeah i i think in the in force awakens
he had zero personality and i think he's right beyond the fact that he clearly wants to stay
far away from the actual shit that's happening he's the puppet that's why i'm even a puppet master
but he's like in the thick of it here i don't understand why he even needs to come you know
like why is he there the way you could almost say luke is like the reverse of that i mean he's kind
of like the puppet master who hides on this island in what way is he the puppet master i'm
not he's not pulling anyone's strings but he's using my tricks to stay out of the fight well
no he i'm i'm just saying he's a puppet master oh how well i mean not like a puppet dude he
manipulated kylo he he fucking was pulling kylo string at the end so fooling somebody else doesn't
mean you're being a puppet master i'm confused what does he fool kylo with yeah oh he makes him
i guess the apparition oh makes him think he's physically there at the very end but that's not
controlling anybody else that's just i'm just making no but he's using his mind tricks to
manipulate i mean that's something else that you could argue is an issue how does kylo not recognize
he's using the lightsaber that he just destroyed same same reason why why snoke didn't know kylo
was going to kill him he's so blinded by his rage for luke that he's not saying it is really
convenient no it's just this is what happens when you have it's realist dude my client pleads
insanity it's dude it's it's honest like when you have a character that is that rage filled
he's not going to see straight it's the ultimate defense of anything that anybody does well it's
like um and this is no slight against you early but the top defense i have for any action kylo
takes is it's supposed to be that way none of it makes any sense because he's just angry
i'm okay with kylo being so mad that he's not good are you saying that's lightsaber color you
know yeah dude i didn't notice that i didn't notice the lights um i would i would argue that
i don't think everybody would however and also kylo is the one of the characters that absolutely
should he wants that lightsaber if you remember in the force awakens he's like that lightsaber
belongs to me yeah but is he looking how does he know that you know maybe luke scott walker built
a new blue lightsaber well it's the same one dude the same one i would what does that music
the second he starts fighting him does he look at his hand like oh yeah that's definitely the same
one do you think it's a stretch to believe that he would look at the lightsaber yeah when you're
about to fight somebody don't you think that knowing what weapon they have is important
tower could be fighting him making the same lightsaber again
all right well it looks just like it uh kylo's a dummy he he was stupid in that moment how many
parts are there for like every one of them's gotta look stupid maybe he goes oh luke made a
very interesting the same looking lightsaber from the one he used to go no we can jump into
crate if you want because i just i just like the idea real quick we will but real quick here's
why i love the snoke scene that whole scene like the buildup to snoke getting cut in half was just
so well done i mean you see kylo sitting there the saber flings back towards him it spins around
he looks at it that probably gave him the idea to turn the saber and kill snoke it's just so well
done and kylo's poker face that whole scene you have no fucking idea what this guy's going to do
he is really playing snoke really well it's so fun to watch why did he kill snoke dude
snoke fucking abused him i mean the beginning went yeah he fucking zapped him with lightning and
fucking made him feel like shit for killing his dad and not being a man about it i mean
you know he made kylo feel like uh like he did that for nothing i think
because it wasn't good enough for snoke and he should have anger towards snoke
plus he probably blamed snoke kind of like he blames luke you created me you fucking fucked
me up and see so and also wouldn't it be great not to mention to sif always kill their masters
they're not sith unfortunately and this is something i've come across i referred to them
as sith and i got a lot of like they're not sith there's no i don't know how to classify it for you
i i have no idea what they are but apparently they're not sith um well so following the rule
of two doesn't necessarily follow but um the his animosity towards both luke and snoke on his
anger towards him like that's something i want to see beyond him going you were beaten by a girl
and then zaps him it's like yeah yeah no i i i hear you i haven't even seen why kylo's always
good like why did kylo even connect to snoke maybe he just didn't he just thought snoke is
more powerful because the dark side is more so you see how you start that sense maybe because
we haven't got anything fuck fair enough yeah like i have ideas of what's going on but it's
given me nothing so i have to like make up in my mind what's going on with snow but what is luke
that's the only way you can be at that point two movies in i should have some idea why does luke
like yoda why does luke pursue yoda it's like we can answer that question all day
got so many references back training baby my my point is that the film has given us so much to
work with gotcha gotcha so you're saying you wanted kylo to like flesh out his relationship
with snow a little bit more what we saw were really great payoffs in the grand scheme of
cinema but uh i'm missing all of the the legwork that makes them powerful for me all i see enough
i want to know was kylo was he actually working for snoke was he always planning to betray snoke
did snoke tune him during training with luke because that's the implication change his mind
that's a great question that i think you're supposed to be asking because luke when luke
had that you're asking questions i'm asking because maybe nobody question well no it's a
gray area was luke seeing kylo's actual future was he actually already turned or did luke just
doing that saber holding over the bed did that create the future he was seeing was he creating
that future in that moment and i think the fact that you don't know is really strong
i don't even know what the future we're talking about do you think it follows kylo becoming a
tyrant do you think it follows that luke may have created kylo in that moment by threatening him
with a lightsaber and thus kylo murders the other students that's why it's such a mind fuck and did
luke uh yeah in a good way though like did you agree no but like you know what i mean it's one
of those things you keep thinking about did luke start this or was he reacting it's very much like
what anakin did to padme inadvertently killing the person you love by trying to save you got
you got no hope of it making any sense if he was a good guy up until that point because again
murdering a bunch of students and maybe that's a good reason why we didn't see anything before
wouldn't it be wouldn't it been great if he had animosity towards those students we saw him
training with them and they all insulted him for being weak for being slow for being unable to
understand the force and then over time getting bullied as his dad nothing as good as his mom the
only voice that's supportive because his mom and dad are distant and luke is is harsh with him
because yoda was harsh with him like that that's going on uh the only voice that's comforting is
snoke just keeps talking to him through the force every night and kylo just slowly
turns that's the story that would make the sequel trilogy so much more powerful if i actually knew
who kylo was gotcha i mean i can't really argue with that but you know when i first saw the force
awakens and they revealed that kylo was han's son i was like what the fuck this is unnecessary
we don't need this guy to be his kid this is too much but then when i realized where it was going
the fact that yeah he couldn't be this evil if he wasn't their kid it's like it really paid off
really nicely and kylo is now responsible for all their deaths i mean i don't i was gonna ask you
guys do you think he knows that leah is dead or not because he there's nothing really to say that
he knows she was in that base at the end see and that suggests to me that you see it as a really
interesting sort of yeah because in his mind he's killing everyone my take was it was a waste
the idea that uh we don't get to see his reaction because layer and kylo that's something i can see
but now that's the whole thing that they can they can do that in the third one we know she's in it
it is possible they're gonna have a moment it's possible i'm not you know i don't i'm not saying
let's wait till the ninth one it's gonna all make sense i'm just saying it's that that is something
that you don't need i don't think to have crammed into tlj it was about kylo and luke that's where
the the flashbacks went that's where the film ended how long were the flashbacks they were short
and you know what don't you think there's three flashbacks all the same scene instead of giving us
no that's that's a very common thing in film i don't remember what it's called but it's like
yeah you matter if it doesn't work whether it's common in films doesn't matter if it doesn't work
i agree with you guys in that i think the flashbacks should have been actual flashbacks
with like dialogue and you know a scene like yeah that would have been awesome i'm i'm
totally on board with that great we're at the luke versus kylo lightsaber fight honestly that's
what i was sure sure i mean we got like a second of it but yeah i was gonna say i need their
conflict i don't it doesn't have to be lightsaber fight i just need their conflict there you go i
mean for me when he killed snoke and i saw that body cut in half i literally screamed out in the
theater i was like i think i said slice and dice or some fucking did you like oh dude i'm
sure the whole theater was like get through my popcorn at a guy and i mean i was like over the
moon because i i i really think that the last jedi was made for the star wars fan that really
did not want a repeat of anything and was just so down to fucking cut this snow guy in half what
about all the repeats yeah he's a corny he's like an emperor palpatine clone just get him out of
here it was great i mean really thank god they fucking killed him off seriously i mean in that
way in that scene it was just so well and because you you want kylo to do that you're like dude
slight this fucking guy in half already he's treating you like shit he wants to kill ray he's
got to go i mean that's why do i want one bad guy to kill another bad guy what i don't know why
kylo was attached to him in the first place if that's the only way he's treated him this whole
time it's like yeah he thought he was more power snoke was kylo's path to being this powerful
maybe if he didn't have i liked when snoke wore a bathrobe and sat on a chair that was that was
sexy but you know and then right after that when they when they're fighting together ray and kylo
the first time i saw the movie i was just like where the fuck is this going in a good way i felt
like my mind was just shattered it was like i did not expect to root for kylo at any point
in any of these movies and here i am i'm rooting for this guy he killed him so you're rooting for
exactly exactly that's the power of this film's writing they actually made you like him they made
you like the person who's supposed to be i don't like him yeah i don't like him why do you like him
you didn't like kylo when he threw people into a shredder those red henchmen you didn't think he
was the man oh this poor henchman why do i want kylo to survive to clarify i think kylo is now
the villain in the implications that we're not supposed to fucking root for him no but in that
one moment in the middle of the film all bets are off and you think you're going to start rooting
for him and thankfully no you don't he he goes back to being the villain i was actually a little
worried i was like oh fuck is he just good now but nope sure enough he went right back to being
that was great wait it's a fucking crap sheet with kylo i love it though it's so unpredictable
how that character just is bad and then he's good and then he's bad and then he's good
that's kylo force awake he's like vito it changes the best item out it changes it's
flushing out what the fort force awakens did the same thing yeah literally changed with the weather
when the sun went down he became bad it's like he's dead what remember that tfa
remember that fucking scene in force awakens when the the the light and the planet gets eclipsed
and then he stabs han you didn't notice that so he's like a vampire okay i guess i like it
i don't know now kylo gets mad
fuck but no um but to jump to the i think we've covered snoke uh you know but uh with crate i
mean that that going into that scene i thought luke was gonna fight kylo i was like oh we're
gonna get a duel this is great and then when he put that saber away and started apologizing it was
like 10 times better and then when they revealed him to not be there i fucking started clapping i
was like oh my god dude i don't know you don't clap in a movie i don't clap in a movie i don't
clap but yeah i'm not seven get into it and dice yeah brother fucking yeah there are other people
in the theater who want to enjoy the film i'm not seven years old i don't clap if you're a star wars
theater with me you you gotta you gotta just get ready i get go hard as long as it's not like
opening weekend if there's like five guys in there fine go no no this is midnight yeah yeah
all right so i guess if we're talking about crate you mentioned how much you didn't want
these films to copy the old films and how you want to get them their own thing yeah i just
saw them post like i just i clapped i clapped when i i clapped when i saw star wars i clapped
dude i'm a clapping fool st's st's i'm a straight up clapping fool no i mean i wasn't like you know
if when i saw force awakens and the the blanket came off of r2d2 like like one person in the theater
clapped i'm not on that level i mean you are you are yeah that dude that's not like it you said well
maybe not r2d2 but when you cut open an old man who's just sitting there in a chair that gets him
hyped um so uh so the the i clapped for titty milk this yes great crate had some fan service there
was this great moment where i also jizzed in my pants where the uh millennium falcon goes into
the mine you hear the tie fighter music rays out there at the gunner position it's just pure fan
service in the best way ever it's like a medley shot yeah they use the music they use the visuals
they just they use all the stuff we've had already that's great but it was unexpected it almost came
out of nowhere it was like yeah almost like it shouldn't have been there yeah no it was
fucking great you didn't like when the tie fighter music played you really weren't excited
can i reflect that question back to you you didn't like it when the star wars did the star wars
no honestly like that was such a needed moment because i love it when star wars to star wars
i like the millennium falcon when i saw the millennium falcon i clapped i recognized that
it wasn't just that it's the millennium falcon this was a medley dude kylo sees the falcon instead
of recognizing the ship you're recognizing the song no no no there's a lot of elements you
mentioned the tie fighter music specifically you're picking out one thing i'm talking about like 10
things the whole scene you're picking up was filled it was a star wars medley you got kylo
wanting to blow the falcon out of the sky that's fucking great let me ask you he's reacting to old
shit why do we like it when the uh the ending in episode six happens when they they approach
the death star once they shield it down is it because of the music and the visuals i'm not
saying that's why the scene's good i'm suggesting that that is the presentation but the reason we're
so invested is because this is the heart of the the empire these people have just been in a half
hour long spaceship battle where they're in a kill box and they've survived it long enough to now
enter the whole itself we've got they're being chased by the tie fighter so the stakes are still
through the roof people are dying as they're going through this the track the area to the
center of this death star it is phenomenal i absolutely adore that bit to then copy it
paste it cut out the narrative for why it even happens and just have the visuals and the music
is actually insulting to me okay i mean i yeah did you just say like if you take out the plot
and it's just visuals then it's bad is that what you just said i said if you copy and paste what
is an iconic moment in the other trilogies without with forgetting why it became iconic
then yeah it insults the original scene itself i do not give a shit if you play the music from
the ot it does not make your movie good that's not why i like the scene it's what's going on
in the story kylo wants to blow that piece of junk out of the sky fucking love that line because
father's ship it reminds him of his dad that he hates i mean it's like all the stuff is coming
together in that moment you know we're getting chewy coming to the rescue dude who knows kylo
hate his dad because he's han solo you think like dad of the year yeah i'd love to have one
it'd be great if we sold that relationship wouldn't it be cool to see that relationship
why better it's an uncle you're right but but because we didn't and we were just given that
one scene where he fucking mercs han that had a lot of fucking impact because it's like did it
that's the only moment i didn't think it had any impact at all because we don't know anything about
their relationship is it is it impactful because that's han solo getting killed or is it impactful
because of the relationship between those two that's the only scene where you even see the
relationship so that's why it's impactful it's like you're getting this thing that i agree with
you i i do want to know about and that's really all you need to know han was gonna abandon kylo
leia fucking told him to get go in there and give him another chance he knew that his son was done
so it's like you and han knew that that was a bad idea but he had to do it because just like luke
he had to try to plant a seed in kylo's heart that might make it exciting when his kid wants
to blow up his spaceship dude it's just a great moment so he sent all of his he sent all of his
tie fighters and everything to chase that one ship and remember there's like seven and for some
reason there's only seven tie fighters even though yeah for whatever reason they managed to save
all their 8080s so so wait does this contradict something you said earlier where you said maybe
they only have four so we can prove they at least have seven in that scene yes they they had more
it's a different scene they had them the whole time they had they had 80 80s were those were
those in the previous parts of the movie yes you can see them in the background because they're in
the supremacy yeah yeah but they weren't being used it doesn't matter why would they use them in
space combat so you're saying the 8080s should have been used or yeah i don't get the point
you're trying to make why why are there more fighters later or before they're established to
exist dude did you not see the supremacy get ripped in half maybe they lost a lot of their
fucking shit hello you understand do you understand how big the ship is it has hundreds of thousands
of personnel that's not if we see anything escape the tide fighters we saw where ships to the ship
destroyed there after that rags his suggestion is we saw seven after it was destroyed therefore
before it was destroyed and we only see four would you have liked to see more if there was 20
tie fighters getting shy if ray had more kills no no that's not at all what we're saying that's
what we're saying i thought ray ray was killing them too fast no yeah she gets a triple kill on
her first shot with a gun turret that has she ever used it before do you guys like action movies
honest question i like good action movies like like you're gonna get mad that the hero is hitting
enemies like are you kidding it depends on the movie okay it's a stupid schlocky action movie
yeah they can kill 100 she just got her fucking ass handed to her i want it based where some
semblance of reality where does she get her ass handed to her dude kylo told her
she killed all the guys she was the badass in that scene and she also beat him in the
full fight he got knocked out the throne room she saved kylo they saved each other ray was doing
horrible at one point and kylo saved her then when does kylo save ray uh did you see the moment
where she like couldn't even get a hit on one dude and kylo was taken like so the moment where
she counted three of them at the same time is that the same one yeah she kicks one and it hits three
people but what's the moment where kylo saves ray so what did she manage just by taking three guys
at once durr how is that saving her three guys at once what movie were you watching uh i counted
dude go back and watch the scene no he's not saying he's not saying this i think it's pretty
obvious i've seen this movie a lot more than you guys i like it obviously you haven't answered the
question yet what how did she say how did he save her by fighting the guys by fucking fighting
if he wasn't there she would have gotten all those fake disappearing knives okay i understand the
confusion so when we say uh she saved him what we're referring to is she throws him the weapon
that saves his life did you really just ask me when did kylo say he killed fucking snoke dude
so what we're talking about the fight we're not talking about the snoke bit he's saving her a lot
in that whole sequence i mean i thought you just argued that he didn't even i thought you argued
that he did that because he wanted to kill snoke not to save ray anyway yeah well that well that's
what you think he's doing for her if snoke was about to murder him then you might have a point
but it was kylo's choice to murder here anyway yeah that was all on kylo suggesting that kylo
saved her from him self dude he saved ray because he honestly because he wanted to use her and
because he has a fucking heart on for her but yeah you're supposed to think in that moment
kylo's helping ray oh my god he's good then when he's like take my hand we're gonna kill everything
you learn oh he didn't kill snoke for ray he just did it for himself he just wanted to take
snoke's place it's like it all makes sense it's just he killed what he his motivations are
evolving because it just works kylo should be a mystery you shouldn't know exactly where this
character is going you should be inconsistent with every scene it's not inconsistent he's what
he should we know will he be a mystery is that bad i don't know kylo is fucked up i don't know
why kylo of all things needs to be a mystery because if you knew his next move it wouldn't
be an effective villain it'd be like coordinator but i couldn't know what his move is i don't know
exactly how he's gonna get there but i know what he would i would like to know what he wants why
he would make a move i don't even know what the exact move is not a good villain what does he
want you're not right we don't know villains don't have to be one track that's boring
did anyone say that any tracks he is he's zero
he has no he's off the rail either he has zero he has 17 tracks motivation really his no all he
says is that he wants the past to die and that means nothing and he doesn't he wants to leave
it all behind and he wants the past to die and then in the next scene he's leading the first order
like what is he what does he want dude he's contradicting the things that he does he needs to
be a mystery i don't think it was a mystery not a mystery he could be anything there's no
contradiction there yes there is he he wanted to have this thing he wanted to whatever arrangement
you want to call it once he found out that she wasn't down he said fuck it i'm gonna i'm gonna
i'm gonna do this instead i'm just gonna be a straight up exactly he contradicts no this is
the character it's the same thing that luke did to him that he feels like he's being turned down
and every time someone turns him down he just becomes more and more bad just straight bad
it's like it reminds him what what his fucking track was oh i'm bad let me go back to that
he's bad he's bad as his motivation i'm trying to explain it in a way that you'll get it
yeah it's gonna be bad well no matter what you're saying he's evil he's mysterious and
that's about all i'm getting and i agree don't think the mystery is the fact that you think his
motivation is one thing and then you learn it's another you think that what do we think his
motivation is what was his first you think he just wants to do is for ray when he's when him and ray
are fighting those guards a part of you is thinking oh my god he is saving ray right now
he's doing he's killing snoke to save ray he is i never thought that all right well i thought he
was just like i thought he was i thought he was trying to take over yeah that's what i thought
well that's good because that's what he was trying to do so where's the confusion he was trying to do
the other thing that's how some some people could think that but it doesn't matter because five
minutes later you know that that's not the case and not not to mention the other contradiction
being that that's not what he wanted he wanted to leave it all behind and then raised dismissal
made him go to the thing that i thought was the thing the whole time yeah no he right but he
dude his like you guys i don't know what you guys are even talking about we're just we're just
paying attention to the movie mate we're just going by what he says and what he does we're just
you're not british you don't have to use that word uh what mate what word mate how do you know
i'm not australian sound like you are mine is i want to i want to be on the australian you don't
sound like it fringy for kylo to have a motivation which you seem are you really australian is he
actually australian no he's not australian so fuck yeah why are you saying that how do you know
yeah we we've already proved the point yeah i just i know that you you think kylo has a
motivation i really wish you were right let's put it dude even if he doesn't that's good that's his
character i like it when characters don't do anything for any reason
oh he doesn't do anything really i said for any reason oh he doesn't have a reason we don't know
what the fuck is we don't know we don't what you're describing his motivation if you think
that he has a reason that that's motivation the reason is look at him he's fucking evil
he's fucked up he's tortured he's been if that's his only motivation that's in his mind possible
motivate he's in his mind he has had this life probably where he's you know his lay his son and
the nephew of luke there's probably all these expectations and then he gets corrupted by snoke
and luke why the fuck wouldn't he be motivated this is like all you just assuming stuff he doesn't
state any of this the movie doesn't state any of this that he had a grudge against luke because he
thought luke corrupted him that doesn't know the second part certainly was never said he doesn't
consider himself corrupted i don't think he sees because luke might have tried to cut his head off
but uh yeah i mean like like a misunderstanding if any whether whether he knows if he's corrupted
or not i i don't know wait how could it be his motivation if he's not aware he's i think it's
very possible he's aware did you see how he was acting in that last scene did that look like a
guy that like is down with luke he looked like he wanted to slice his fucking head off that's not
we're not disagreeing with that there if he wanted to leave it all behind why is he even there
yeah why doesn't he just want to leave it all behind because he only wanted to leave it all
behind because he thought he ray was going to be with him why why does he give a shit if ray
why does he want to be with ray why he loves her
that's not i don't think he's in love with me why would you even if you really don't think
that he has a hot spray of course not i don't think he's joking with you so he's ray and he's
kylo ray he's probably never had a date in his life he's probably suppressed say this like it's
a fanfic you're right dude what was the prequel trilogy what was the prequel trilogy are you
going to use a different relationship as evidence that there is a relationship yeah yeah i'm going
to say this goes right in line with star wars it's about relationship like how darth vader was
trying to have sex with luke skywalker it's the same no right because tubaca and bb8 have a
relationship because that's star wars yes everyone has a relationship that's what star wars yeah
that's where i saw even there's no any any allusion to it no scenes that would imply it
there is no dialogue that implies it it's star wars so it's probably true wait there's no dialogue
that implies what but they're in love kylo isn't in love are you guys watching the film did you not
tell me the line give us a reference give us a reference go that's the closest you're gonna get
what just give us a reference the i've touched plenty of women i haven't fucked or the finger
touching across space it was an intimate moment dude come on don't don't ignore what's right in
front of you you don't think them touching was intimate no the filmmakers even said this is the
closest thing to force sex scene in star wars you're gonna get i think ryan johnson even said
that it's supposed they have chemistry how do you not get that chemistry they do oh my fucking god
really i i would be shocked if ray does ray have emotion at all they have they have a lot in
common they connected they were doing this force skyping thing because they're both lost and you
know why doesn't know she should look up to luke kylo doesn't know if he should look up to snoke
they have something in common and and in that scene where she's covered in water and like in
love with each other that's not what i got out of it well it's not fully there yet i mean they
didn't kiss but oh wait wait to be fair to check in your prediction for ray low you know you don't
think that there's a ray there's not a ray low movement going on you know i don't think that's
what we said follow up on i don't care they are definitely seeing this people are certainly
interpreting it as a romance or a fucked up they also interpreted finn and pose romance
that was ridiculous oh that was ridiculous okay oh but no but that's what i do think that's
yes that was dude do you remember the ot where there was a relationship uh yeah it's called
vader and luke the fucking driving force of the second two romantic relations guys guys guys
guys you're literally not even listening to i'm sorry i said it's about the relationship and the
family dude dude you're literally ignoring parts of what i'm saying because it helps your argument
that's okay but what i said was dude it's okay the prequel trilogy and this one are more about
the relationship the man loving the woman and it's abusive and whatever the ot was about the
family drama the father who was abusive and who abandoned his son and was a piece of shit
but he had unconditional love for him because the last jedi was all about family
it has a lot of family in there too that's the thing these are driving themes and all the
movements it's about family to to show you it's a fucking space opera which is another word for
soap opera in space said kylo was in love with ray and your evidence was they touched fingers
and that the story of stars is about relationships he's into her man he likes her what i'm suggesting
no i'm not on her team i'm going meta what i'm saying is we have absolutely listened to you're
giving us barely anything to work with i'm i'm giving you barely anything what more do you want
you told us their fingers touched dude we need more than that because people wait she was also
you want to see them fucking we want to see them say i love you uh no love is love is a little more
than sex that would be something i was about to say harn and leah don't have sex in the ot but
they absolutely love each other yeah but i can give you references for that beyond and touching
fingers this is a romance between two jedi one good one bad we've never seen anything like this
in the main in the movies and it's fucking original it's really different from the the
original trilogy but it has a similar theme you think the original one luke and vader are the
most interesting thing about that storyline they just are but when you hear i'm your father that
now has become the most interesting thread we all know that and at the end of return of the jedi
when luke and vader reconcile it's fucking great because that is the main thing that is driving
those movies is the relationship between them episode nine the main story is going to be ray
and kylo that's just where these movies are going and if there's not a romance then maybe it's like
a a rivalry it's something but he feels rejected but they're in love it has to be a romance right
dude it's okay they're in love fine they're not like you know jack and and uh rose from titanic
but so at the end of at the end of the last jedi when kylo is you know kneeling down picking up
the dice and he looks up at ray and she shuts that door in his face that means i am rejecting you
you're done i'm closing the door on you and the look in his face it's just pathetic i mean you
almost feel kind of bad for him because he really was like a bitch for her in that moment and you
know if to think that that doesn't set up for any conflict in the next one i mean come on look i
think he wanted to be like you know like partners with her but yeah as far as i would yeah there's
nothing in the text that's totally fair that's totally fair they're in love it could have been
either one okay fine it could have been either one you could interpret it as there's a romance
and you could also interpret it as no it's not he just wanted to work with her they're both valid
i'm not arguing with that at all i i there needs to be something to support the idea that he's in
love with her and there's just nothing there you know what people had the same conversation
in the force awakens they said oh why would kylo take off his mask and talk to her maybe as a thing
for her it this was been a subtle thing i mean didn't she challenge him she said your creature
in a mask and so he took it off yeah yeah but you know then when she sees him the look on her face
is like surprise it's almost like oh that's just that's just her resting face i was my suggestion
would be that it's it is surprising he's a little boy he's not an intimidating 50 plus year old man
there is a tiny tiny little amount of sexual tension in that scene they're just this the way
he's touching her he's right up to her face he's being all creepy with that to poe yeah yeah but
it's different with ray you can tell he likes her as soon as he it starts out as he fucking
hangers what he hears there's a girl he yanks that guy over and chokes him it's like what girl
it's like he like he feels inadequate and now in the second movie there's this little added twist
that no he just wants her on his team that's fucking great that's actually exactly what the
character should be doing why does he why does he want shit out of his fingers because she's
incredibly powerful she beat him in the force awakens so and in that scene he was like i can
train you i mean you know whether he wants the boner or not i mean it's it's not even relevant
but there are people that interpret it as a romance you can't argue with it when arguing with
people interpreting it that's literally what's happening right now see that that's that's the
best thing about this kind of shit is there isn't one answer it could be either one i hope they do
harp on that a little bit more in the next one but right now it is kind of left open and that's a
gopin episode nine he just holds you down starts touching all her fingers right it could stop you
never know if they wanted they could have him say you know what i never had any feelings for you
whatsoever this is just i'm just using like yeah of course why would that would be fine damn it from
anything that's happened yeah and she'd be like why would you even break that up wait what would
you say about that though would not be distro distracting for you because no not at all because
no because she saw the good in him and luke was trying to tell her you're seeing the wrong
future like he is bad so it is bad well no but maybe no no no we're talking about kylo loving
ray if they don't follow through with that in episode nine aren't you going to be a little bit
distraught because you would just like 20 minutes ago saying it's like obvious that he loves you
well if they don't take that plot any further it would be a definite miss opportunity because
like you said they they didn't even cement that there's a romance well enough if you're really
not seeing that so yeah i mean then it should be in there yeah i think it'll be a missed
opportunity if they just this leads to a good question what is your ideal episode nine i don't
have you don't have anything in your head i don't want no dude i don't go into movies with like this
is what i want to happen i think that is the last thing you should do when you watch any movie and
star wars i'm sorry it's the epitome of the thing that people know exactly what they want to see
already i'm not saying you guys did that you guys don't seem like you know some themes you
want to just define there's something you want to see in it we just did no no i said i want to see
played out there's relations you want to see the story further you asked me if they don't continue
it will i be disappointed fine what do you want to see continued what do you want to see continued
the ray and kylo romance definitely okay that's really it i mean that's that's the driving force
right now other than that i don't care what they fucking do it doesn't matter it's all good i'm
on board with these new characters i'm invested in them at this point i like poe i didn't like him
at the end of force awakens i thought we shouldn't go on movies you opened our conversation today
we're saying that people want people want episode nine to play it safe and you said that's absolutely
not what you want right and that's not what i mean no i don't have any expectation about specific
things like oh luke better come back and fight cut that that stuff is specific you know but if
you say that's something you do not want then there are things you want no no no i don't know
what i don't want uh it's not i don't i don't that's not how i go into surprise okay yeah i want
i know i'm not saying you guys are like these you know packing fan theories when you walk into film
it doesn't sound like you're that type of uh person i'm just saying there's no finger this
is what star wars fans do it's star wars we haven't had a star wars film in a while before
the prequels it was a really long time people had a lot of time to build this thing up in their head
of what they want to see happen and i really believe that that's coming in the way of people
enjoying these films i mean wasn't the reception to the force awakens really positive though no a lot
of people thought it was echoing a new hope yeah dude yeah but they still really liked it then
yeah that film got overwhelming praise oh yeah it got way more praise than overwhelming praise
from audiences yeah absolutely yeah you just said a second ago they didn't
no dude people didn't like the movie also there's plenty of people that are like jj ruin
star wars blah blah blah yes i don't think i don't think rags are saying everyone likes it
i'm not yeah what do you what do you obviously there are exceptions what do you believe the
overall reaction on average was to the force awakens i think sure if i think at first everyone
loved it and then like as months went on people started hating on it which is maybe youtubers
ruined it right i mean lee actually criticized thomas awakens himself i think the force awaken
is riddled with flaws i i i will harp on that till no end but oh wait you don't like women or
minorities i'm curious what are the flaws of the force awakens that do not the there were
characters that were just weak i thought hux was weak uh snoke was weak po was weak uh the
scene with the raftar you do you think kento bite had no purpose what about that fucking raftar scene
that was so no stakes what's the raftar we knew the characters were gonna make out of it
make it out of the big testicle monster things right the floating testicle and then you had this
tie fighter chase which some people think is like the best scene in the movie i thought that scene
had zero stakes on jack who man she sure can fly really well wait we need you there why doesn't
have stakes you're just it's just i don't know it just i knew they were gonna make it out so
early in the film it just felt like this yeah i don't know i don't know but i do really like
the film force awakens is a great movie despite all the problems it still manages to be awesome
and that's a feat it i thought your position would have been that it wasn't great absolutely
not it's really great it just there are things in there that i don't love like the whole scene
where han and leah are talking to each other and it's like you know we should have never sent our
son away that's when i lost you that's when i lost you both it just it's like a soap opera are you
allergic but wait you said it was a soap opera you said but a bad one it's not supposed to really
feel like a soap i mean it's supposed to be one in disguise i mean if you have to reject the
characters that felt like a straight up like it was plucked out of a guiding light or something
it just was like base opera is not a reference to soap opera by the way yeah there's a different
opera opera yeah yeah but what do you think a soap opera is a reference to it's a bad opera
all right so what is the relationship to why do we call them nurse sharks
what i can't believe you're missing a point if i move on move along it's a nurse shark
we can uh we can jump onto craze yeah it's a nurse shark it's it's not actually a nurse
it's a shark his point it doesn't matter uh we so the first thing i think that we should
go with crayons is do you have any issue whatsoever with rose saying uh fight uh fight for who you
love rather than what you hate that the execution of her the execution of that little little sequence
i don't have any big problems with it no not at all no it's cool so the idea that finn was
trying to destroy the weapon that was going to obliterate his entire faction actually completes
his mission she loves him she's in love with finn yeah maybe you know she was being selfish but
but the line itself right the movie is trying its best to deliver that line
and it deliberately shows the laser completing its task in the background don't you think that
that's a 100% contradicting i i don't entirely disagree with that i when i first saw the movie
and i saw finn going into that fucking cannon i was like oh my god this is incredible if finn dies
right now this will be great because it's so unexpected uh but the fact that he didn't it's
like okay obviously he has a big role in episode nine and he needs to live and that's even more
you know it's just giving you something to look forward to this character had to grow to live he
didn't need to live well don't you think is anytime a character lives it gives me something i hear you
probably happy about it i kind of hear you i thought it would be cool if he died but i also
love finn and i'm down to get more of him he's he's hilarious so it's like it's a double-edged thing
um but he's a goof oh yeah he's hilarious he's a goofy he's fucking right he's very
the finn he's the finn come on yeah are you watching these movies
my buddy i honestly least about finn is like wasn't he a battle-trained stormtrooper
since like birth how did he become so forced economic relief that's what it's like when did
he yeah but hasn't even trained like why is he such a goofball i was actually would they beat
that out of you it's a fair question yeah that's on the force awakens that's not on the last jedi
in fairness but i agree yeah that's a little silly yeah it's a little unlikely hey maybe
i'm using because we're definitely attacking the logical elements well i mean what i just said was
kind of the hermetic element um the way in which rose manages to get ahead of finn to 90 degree
turn and knock him what's that about i don't know man it's it's a little he had the faster glider
dude she had the like do you get how someone would be broken don't you think someone would be
insulted by that because they're like that's not possible yeah it's it's she must have been really
stepping on it but then again he was in a laser and probably being pushed back do you like that
the 8080 stopped shooting from the moment that the last person died from them and the the scene was
kind enough to let them do their emotional moment about the pressure didn't even notice it didn't
even notice it and how the 8080s just stare at them while they're talking about the aftermath
in that crash it's just yeah okay and how they managed to drag drag a floppy corpse all the way
back okay they don't just blow him up when he's right there in front of him they just feel about
how do you feel about rose basically not asking finn for consent just pushing yourself on him
ah come on now okay i don't know man but lee what if the roles were reversed negotiate consent
in that situation wait what what if the genders were reversed she doesn't even ask do you like me
can i be your girlfriend just puts her mouth all over him yeah you know it's a little presumptuous
yeah a little bit sexual assault people have gone down well i mean there was the actual assault of
her ramming him but there was also though um she was a little aggressive in that moment didn't she
i mean it's a good thing luke just happened to show up or else rose would have doomed the resistance
do you like haley lee do you like do you like the sure is a good thing luke showed up to save the
day sort of do you like the real showed up and he revealed to leah that he's he's a ghost subtly
which is quite cool and c3po apparently recognized it too however soon after post says look luke got
in here somewhere let's find an exit and leah's like yeah follow him it's like leah you know that
he came in here via ghost oh dude i'll be honest i didn't even catch that that luke told her that
i didn't even get that it's the look cool she gives him a look and i actually liked it she
knew she was like ah he's because she knows that's why she leaves the dice behind because
they're just ghost dice you're saying very cool yeah i mean you know but i just find it funny
that she's like yeah kids go and look for an exit from the ghosts that came here via ghost power
yeah isn't that really weird give her ghost dice though like what it is yeah especially
ghost dice that represent the relationship between the heart of his ex-girlfriend hey leah
yeah those dice are you know well it's a nice little gift at least you get to hold it for a
minute is it what it's it's about hans relationship with his ex but they were friends they were cool
they hugged what enforce awakens what they were fine what do you know i don't understand
you what you have a problem with the dice like yes oh god it's it's really disrespectful to leah to
had to a token of hans previous relationship dude didn't have another one neither oh my god
it's true oh my god wait who gave han the dice originally was it that he had the dice he gave
them to kira when they lost contact and then 10 years later when they come back she gave him back
to him that is the only context we've seen those dice in solo character it's just so you think it's
disrespectful okay i mean what would you call it leah what would you call it i'm gonna go with how
leah felt about it she seemed to be okay with it which would be contradictive she has no reason to
like those dice that's not true it would be pretty great if luke has a totem of han she
totally could be just you know what are these because you know it's like hans dice you know
i never they should just give him all the dice that would have been funny that would have been
funny if she was just like wait what are these i never know these two dice represent your bottom
and top half connected mechanically that would be beautiful it's the drive chef from the millennium
falcon han solo loved it oh okay i gotta be honest this is the first time i've heard that
that point be made that leah should be offended at the dice that's interesting i don't know that
she should be offended she should be fucking confused she should be like why the hell are
you handing me these why are you giving me this this if anything it should hurt it should be like
thanks man that's the thing i needed when thinking about han being dead all the things he could have
made a parade the dice what was better than the dice i mean i don't know fucking hell dude nothing
like actual nothing if he wouldn't have given her anything that would have been better than the
i don't agree with that i'm sorry i think it was nice do you think holding a hand wouldn't have
worked it showed that he cared about hans death he was sorry that he wasn't there to prevent it
it was just like a little like you know i'm sorry about hans previous relationship i miss my friend
too dude i don't know why you have do you think han had like a bunch of chicks after leah no we're
going from that movie that came out solo yeah we're going from movie that exists yeah before leah
that was like way before he met leah that was a whole point yes that's the point okay i got you
so so kira should have been the one to get the dice yes if anybody should get the dice kira
absolutely should get the dice that would actually make for a nice moment i'm not even kidding han
have uh not even had the dice on the millennium falcon not arguing that reminder of the that's
true kira kira should have been the dice receiver yeah i'm gonna assume leah i'm gonna assume leah
does not know anything about kira let's hope let's fucking hope or at least does not know about the
dice christ if she doesn't know what he's just hey here's these dice and like oh yeah she does
know it's god damn it i can't imagine her face if she knew she looks up at luke what the fuck
she knows luke thinks he's like doing like a good thing he's like what i hope you die all right looks
like these are the dice you guys always used right they represent your dice right held in her hand
the whole time i always saw han looking at him so lovingly i think he really liked these dice he
always used to talk about the special woman connected to these dice and i knew that was you
and she's like all right i get it luke shut up god that's funny there's a whole movie there
like the love triangle like here comes back into the story i think the flaw with the dice is that
it might have been a little too obscure i mean a lot of people that are big star wars fans were
just like what the fuck what were those well that's because they created the dice and then
afterwards they tried to give them meaning i was gonna say i think that's what they were hoping
for but people assumed they were a nebulous element of the falcon but now we know what
they actually mean if they were a nebulous element of the falcon it would have been fine
yeah it's like a lucky piece they're like actual six-sided dice right they didn't have
yeah they're just they're just hanging in the in the cockpit i believe that's all they were
let me ask you guys this on them to be weird alien dice here's a flaw here's a flaw that a
friend of mine brought up recently that i i can't really argue with do you think all that grime on
the walls of the falcon would have appeared after the time span between solo and a new hope
what grime oh you know just deterioration i don't know yeah like it's all white and then in
the new hope it's like brown yellow stain yeah i don't know maybe i was like you know
maybe chewy was just covered in mud all the time and he was leaning against the wall i don't know
it's it's an outdoor vehicle right i mean they were dragging on and lando's character
lando is very flashy and we ought to try to keep his spaceship in perfect condition yeah i'm mostly
okay we hope they don't ruin lando see capes what do you mean right so what do you guys think about
uh luke like you know force projecting and the twist that he wasn't there and that he didn't
fight kylo what do you what is your pointless pointless oh come on i think it would have been
more powerful if he was there yeah but on the silver screen so you don't like the sort of
message they leave you with that you know the jedi message it's the jedi powers should be used
for defense not attacking except when you use it to attack it's the execution luke didn't use
it to attack he was purely i didn't say luke did uh but we've seen several examples of jedi using
the force to attack of course we have and and that has been good but that's not the only thing to do
i mean don't you think it's cool that they actually because dude wait do you think it's a new idea to
use the force defensively no i don't know that's the thing they cemented it that's been a theme
and now luke is the one to hammer that home but we knew that didn't yoda save the two two is two is
two jedi and in attack of the clones by force holding the uh the thing the counter could drop
instead of pursuing duku he used it defensively don't you think if luke fought kylo it just wouldn't
have made sense like he felt bad for holding a saber over him you think he's gonna fight him now
it's not a point that he got reinvigorated by yoda and ray no the point was to go forgive yourself
for these mistakes then you're killing yourself over this you know they need you to do something
there yeah i thought that that's what it was going to lead up to i thought luke was marching
on that battlefield to fight kylo and the build up made you think that was going to happen
and that's why it's so great it was so meta it's like they did indeed settle for a lesser alternative
yes it just made more sense with the plot that the force awakens laid out i mean if luke is
really going to be absent for the events in that movie then this was really like just it was just
the most honest thing to do with luke you know just put him on this island he could have gone
make him throw the saber off the cliff you think he's gonna let han get killed and then take the
saber and be like okay now i'm down it's it just that whole thing was kind of in character yeah
it would have made the force awakens it would have cheapened it would have made the force awakens
shitty a lot shit because it's like why the fuck wasn't luke just yeah why wasn't luke here then
he could not be there like again kylo cut off his fucking other arm and he was you could have yeah
you could have given him a good reason to be out there we gave like four or five earlier but i'm
sorry those are not you can still have him get a reason during the film's progression for him to go
back like hey leya is in danger your sister that you love she's in danger and he's like oh crap i
need to go save her because i'm a good person i'm established to be luke skywalker a character
who would do this you know mostly that that's the messianic um so he thinks the way to keep
everybody safe is to be by himself because then kind of anybody else well yeah right i mean he
feels like he is responsible for all of this and if he would get involved he would just make it
worse and if no luke would say if i did something i need to fix it that's what he does he does fix
it by the end and it's so impactful because he had this arc all the times he said no i want at
the end he sort of helps yeah if the whole movie was just him being like already badass and cool
doing the right thing from the beginning there would have been nowhere for it to go he would
have had to been like stabbed how do you know that it would have there was nowhere for it to go
because because why there you could take it somewhere but it's not going to be that strong
of an arc as if he starts out down in the dumps the way that they you've walked that back pretty
quick so no it wouldn't go very far it would go like an inch it would have gone as long as anywhere
it could have gone the possibilities are endless with so we just keep luke badass and cool throughout
the whole thing and he never changes he doesn't have no you don't have to because i remember luke
has already had his arc right yes he had a better arc in this one than he did in the original trilogy
yes absolutely what was his what was it was better because it was condensed into one film
and it's it's yeah dude we took one film to see this guy go from total fucking loser blames
himself he's a hermit sucking the milk out of space tits and by the end of it he's the man and
it's so much more impactful because he had that redemption i just wow dude because are you because
he learned he had a lesson the character had a flaw thank fucking god are you actually pulling
a lone man bad are you unironically pulling a lone man bad time that i'm like come on dude
luke in this movie yes it's better than the original trilogy yes we got nine seconds of
a flashback that's way better than the original trilogy i strongly believe that what they did with
luke was so fucking good that it's what the character deserved luke deserved some development
he deserved to have to mention make a mistake learn from his mistakes these are things that
characters and films do if he was just perfect like you think luke skywalker is it would have been
boring there'd be no drama there'd be no real interesting thing for his character to be perfect
he's never perfect he was reckless in empire that's our point yes that's now point i want to
inject it straight into my veins because you are living in a blissful magic world i what are you
saying what an absolute fantasy world what do you what do you mean here you live some magic crazy
place where you saw this star wars movie and you clapped dude you guys know that like are you a
you guys are aware that like i want to be there with this is hold on hold on character you're
playing right are you guys aware that a lot of people liked this film i don't care i i do read
the positive reviews so why are you even talking to me then we invited you here so that you could
attempt to well for starters to try to the point dude i wanted to know i'm giving you the benefit
of the doubt yeah but then you told me that luke skywalkers are in the last is good yes is better
yeah i believe that all right i'm gonna fuck if you guys think that's silly no that's that's fine
dude it's a it's a strong arc he really changes in this movie no strong argument though he goes
from a guy that's almost the antagonist science fiction story of all time and you're like see it's
about an old man and he lives on now you're you're now it sounds like you you're you're having this
messianic view of a character dude the throwing the same thing consistently with what's been
established it is you guys just didn't like it do you know that luke doesn't have to be pathetic
yeah but thank god that he fuck it was it's interesting it's actually dramatic it's boring
if he's just perfect we didn't we're not suggesting that this is why so what do you want so what so
i'm suggesting he be luke skywalker yeah there's no why are we come on what was on luke about him
tell me what was on luke about him the fact that he ran away from his problems for 30 years cut
himself created kylo ren because he fucked up that does not answer created kylo ren dude he
blames himself created kylo ren he ran away from all of his problems and he let all the people and
things that he care about to whatever fate that they would and he wouldn't come to help them out
when it was established that they needed his help that's what we thought that's the polar opposite
of about what luke has been established to be oh dude he made mistakes in the other movies too
and you know it's no no that's not the that's not what we're saying me spilling water and me
threatening to murder my family member while they sleep is two different kinds of mistakes
i want to go back to me living in the fantasy world do you guys really not know that there's
a shit ton of people that think this is the best star wars film what have we said that would
contradict that statement the fact that you think i'm like the only one living in this fantasy world
like do you really think i'm the only one that likes it not the only one people love the film
if people love something as much as the people who love this film do love it then it's obviously
not the worst film in the world yeah there are flaws nothing is perfect it's not a 10 out of 10
but god damn the amount they did right i'm impressed it could have been so much fucking
are there any movies that you hate and think are poorly made that have beloved
i just saw glass and thought it was pretty awful but i don't know that's i'm just thinking
recently well point being that i'm hoping to get you to say something along the lines of
yeah some films are bad and they're still liked i saw bohemian rhapsody recently and i and i
thought it was a bad movie that i like you know uh matrix reloaded bad movie that i like like
there's a lot of shit that i know is dumb but it's good last jedi's not a bad movie that i like
i think it's a really great show when somebody points out a flaw in a film you'll never say oh
yeah but i liked it as a response right because you know you know now that that doesn't make any
sense as a response no i always say that dude you're allowed to like a film but think it has flaws
and you're allowed to hate a film but no that's literally what he's just trying to establish how
do you not understand so how so what so how am i living in a fantasy world though oh my goodness
well when you when when you make references to things that never happened in the film or
or claims what didn't happen like you're always saying kylo being in love with ray that never
happened tell that to the fucking legions of people that doesn't matter it doesn't matter
yes it's not in stone they don't say i love you but it's a theory reference to it dude enforce
awakens you just said it's a theory that supports my whole point oh my god dude who gives a fuck
you asked me dude you asked me for the one who asked dude okay listen to my answer then
in the force awakens people thought ray was luke's daughter or whatever it it it may still be it may
not be but that was something that you could argue was in the film you could also argue that there was
no you couldn't to allude to her okay well whatever people did so no whatever that's no
then that's wrong you can't build as a foundation your argument something that's blatantly wrong
all that to the people that have these theories okay those other people i hear what you're saying
the theory existed that mace window was raised dad and it's like that i don't know i i don't care
what your theory is there's nothing that supports that we don't care what the crazy theories are
it's subtlety something can be in a film and you can debate it okay you know what it's a good
example the ending of taxi driver you ever see that movie no the ending of the film is that
travis bickle survive i did a video about this on my channel travis survives according to the
filmmakers but you can very easily interpret that ending as travis dying yeah well and the whole
whether or not is a is a replicant as well these things exist but your referencing doesn't exist
dude it's possible that it will we have to see where the third movie there are hopefully
inception there is evidence supporting and decrying the idea that he's still in a dream
these are things you can prove with references what the things you've been referencing and not
prove debatable no you can't use evidence the fact that there might be evidence in the future for
yeah i can what do you know you can't dude these are things that are not fully answered just like
my evidence for the fact that unicorns exist is that in the future we might find evidence for
unicorns existing okay fine but don't you think yeah i know fine i know because i'm right because
that's not how arguments work you have to follow these things don't you think it's don't you think
there are some times where maybe you can't like fully make a judgment like oh that's definitely
not in there maybe it is it could be i dude you justify my believing in it i won't believe it
well okay you know my stance on ray being a nobody i fucking love it i was hoping for
that i think it's really relatable they could very easily undo that and it wouldn't be bad
it would all right fine you you did another twist there you go okay and see what the relevance is
yeah right you disagree with that okay the relevance is you could still argue that it's
in the film kylo tells her you're a nobody yeah okay no no there's a difference between evidence
for a proposition and no evidence against that proposition being true do you think there's no
evidence that kylo and ray have a thing i don't see there's any evidence for it all right fine
you said kylo was in love with ray that was the place there's no evidence for that in the film
and maybe i was you know uh what's the word hyperbolic yeah maybe i was blowing it out he
definitely has something for her i mean come on well something can be anything all right that
doesn't help you know what fine we can see there may be something there may be something there
might be love you could interpret it as i wouldn't go that is that okay is that better you could
interpret i'll happily concede to something but love is way too strong okay but you got i mean
like dude how often do you guys spend time like listening to reviews of people that like the film
have you do you i went through like 50 plus of them for my video okay i know you do but what
about you you do we covered plenty of the on efap right so so why is anything i'm saying such a
shock to people like this shit well some of the arguments you've made today haven't i haven't
heard yet yeah i've heard the argument that none of these things matter i've never heard the argument
that luke's arc is better in the new film than in the ot it is sorry it just is sorry i know that's
a fucking strong i'm not saying the movie is better wait it's just the character had a really
like it's just true dude the character has a i liked it better all right there you go i'm just
if you look up in a textbook you're not going to find yes this had a better arc i like it better
yes it's my opinion do you just like it you're not saying it's like true
so we're talking about opinions here nothing is true your opinions your opinion my opinions
you can't say this is better than that no one can argue that last jedi is a better film than empire
strikes back that's okay that's what i was aiming to to find out i think we i think dude i don't
think this is a better film than the original trilogy if that's what you thought i meant by
that no you can never top those didn't say that i i just really like what they did with luke it
was unexpected it was exactly what i like when i was watching the film and i saw him throw that
saber another moment i wanted to clap for it just made perfect sense it just it was just perfect
exactly went in line with i agree right exactly all right i think that was a good conversation
i can't believe it took three hours time flies when you're having fun absolutely uh i need
to read all of the super chats and i don't think we're going to be covering any videos because
there may be an efap early next week because i can't do and post that for a while like a week
when is wolf gonna be back around wolf is free on monday and tuesday so i'm pretty sure that's
how we're gonna set up but um that was the first full-on debate i think we've had on efap the last
of that long so it's beautiful beautiful are you serious not for real we've had i don't know if you
call it a debate what happened with tro would you regs it was more of a um i would i would say um
i don't know if i'd call it a debate i think it was no i wouldn't call it a debate yeah we've had
we we have disagreements in house but we haven't had uh something something of that caliber and i
wonder how people are going to find it it'll be interesting to see what people think because it
could we could guys ever do you ever do debates where there's more than one person who disagrees
with you or is it always well we disagree with each other a lot so a gang gang not that i have a
problem with it uh well this is the first time this has happened we've never brought someone on
to uh because the thing is dude it's really hard with the the first time me and wolf ever tried to
debate someone who liked lj they we nearly like made them cry we were very like close to being
like we felt like really yeah we didn't it's not like we were loud or angry but they they got very
upset very quickly so we were just like okay we'll just we're just gonna stop um we did talk
just right at one point was i was i that bad or was that better i think you'll never be able to
be worse than the worst of the people we covered on efap so yeah i mean i'm never gonna convince
you guys you know that's the thing like i you know and i know i'm not no don't give yourself
more credit than that it's not i know i convinced i i made fun of mauler and like a tweet once but
aside from that i have absolutely no problem with oh yeah you did i forgot about that you said
i just thought it was a little gloaty and i i'm sorry about that you know it was rude
well dude if you pass any milestones i would encourage you to celebrate because it's a really
awesome achievement regardless of well i wouldn't say regardless of what content you make if you
like fucking recorded people's murders or something i'd be like maybe that's not something to celebrate
but um yeah it was 100k 100k is really special that's a pretty big deal yeah it's a big deal yeah
i know i was out of line you know i i read it and was just like look at this fucking guy just
just saying oh man my hate for this movie really i do more than just i know i know dude i i if i
could take it back i would but i'm not it's out there and it's all good but no i really have no
problem with you guys and uh i know i'm never gonna convince you guys and it's it's all good
with me i just you know just know that there are really a lot of people out there that think that
this is the best star or something i don't think it's the best but oh my god um you know
just got like abducted you don't know you're my god okay um go ahead but i will say this uh you
have a lot more balls than a lot of people who won't even talk to us about it like jam saint and
eric taxon like they won't even wow you guys are cool we are pretty cool you know you insulted me
a little bit called me a child but it's all right i still like you i mean surely that that's just uh
it goes both ways right we're allowed to throw insults here and there yeah dude i i really
strongly recommend you buy battlefront it's fucking cheap you won't regret it at this point
you won't regret it i guarantee you that i won't be able to forgive myself if i spend
money on it it's gonna be like i hate that i'm enjoying this any fun that i have after that
it's like if i fucked my mom it would probably feel good physically but there's a lot of baggage
oh my god you know um jesus that one almost killed me yeah go ahead and uh if you want to
sort of well it's gonna be tough but i i think that you like challenges uh why should people
subscribe to your channel sell yourself to my audience you shouldn't i'm sorry i'm still
choking hold on a second oh man oh my god thanks for my microphone man that does sound very good
that joke about fucking your mom like maybe choke it's just it's a very it's an appropriate analogy
why should someone subscribe to my channel if you want to see something truly idiotic i i got you i
got you bro i got you well uh no i just like to have fun man i like to make jokes i like to
make fun of people that i think are being silly in this case i thought the you know the the people
in my last jedi video just seemed like a really good comedic opportunity it just seemed like easy
material it was like all right these people are clearly clowns and i don't know uh i just like
making fun of shit and uh yeah let's just leave it at that yeah um we uh i was gonna say it's
it's really up to you now because uh what we're gonna do for what will possibly last like an hour
is i'm gonna read every super chat that came in um during this check i mean shouldn't i be there
for that i think that'd be hilarious i was saying it's up to you guys if you want to stay if you want
to if you want to use the loo really bad so i'll be right back go for want to see
what these guys these guys are probably like dumping on me yeah let's definitely look at
this we'll do it so i'll let i'll let vito uh give himself a little bit of a plug too
there's no way you're there's no way your listeners like think that i came off good in
this i'm sure they were just like everything i said they just probably bounced off and you know
that's okay i don't i don't i would say they should go see your full take i think that would
be fair to you you have a full video that explains all of your points right i actually think this
conversation was better but oh there you go that's just i'm trying to plug your fucking video fan go
i'm sorry i appreciate that it's just that i think we covered more ground than i did in the video
i mean by far i don't it was like yeah yeah if it was a fully supportive lee audience i think
they would say maul rags and vito care way too much for the things that don't matter like all
the logical consistency in a film that is literally about space wizards it's insane
and then the reverse would be uh lee clearly likes the film despite all of its flaws that
that would be the kindest take i think on both sides of the argument yeah i mean look you you
could say i'm a forgiving passive you know you could say i'm like uh whatever like i settle for
less good things i'm not going to argue with that i do think the film is definitely above average
it's not perfect uh but you know when the prequels came out i feel like there was a pretty solid
amount of universal hate for them and you could really say the same thing about this it's like
there's a pocket of people that love it so it really can't be that terrible it's you could you
got to apply this to those movies too it's the same series but you know i mean i don't know you
you guys have heard plenty of both arguments i'm sure aren't you guys sick of talking about this
movie i'm actually not at all they won't let us they won't let us not an infant infant i can't
remember the last defab we actually talked about star wars now it's been a while oh that's cool
okay so i i'm sorry to bring you back into this shit that's all good i i like talking about
movies and writing uh we have plenty of references to other films there we got to talk about some
things i hadn't heard of in terms of argumentation so it's all it's all like a running machine for
the brain it's a nice little jog get yourself right on dude and you know i i also apologize
because i haven't seen the video where you guys destroyed me so so to speak i mean you're gonna
have to go in with a very open mind because dude come on wasn't this like the same thing
i mean i was sure i will say i think that we let's just say that your video uh it doesn't rank
anywhere near the the worst videos we covered because we thought your argumentation was really
lame but uh you weren't as malicious as some of the people we've covered as in like interesting
why a lot of people who are their goal isn't to discuss it's to sort of defame yeah like a lot
of people said not you know nothing Macintosh okay see i don't even know that you can take that
as a plus yeah i know i definitely appreciate that uh but you know it took me like three months
to notice that you that you did that because all these people started contacting me being like oh
mauler just fucking fucked you with a knife damn dude holy mald well we never we'd ever encourage
that so people were like he fucked you you got you got mauled and i said okay i'll bet i'd bet
i did because i like being corny and i like being over the top and and my my humor is so easy to
make fun of i get that it's i do that on purpose i mean i know that the things i say are idiotic
it's it's it's supposed to be that way i mean dude like i once went on a weird rant in final
fantasy 15 i don't even remember why i did this but like it just gets weird i gotta keep that
character consistent though you know what i mean like that major lee he he he's uh he's he's a bit
weird but you gotta keep it up it's like you guys said you want luke to feel like luke you don't
want this ake jake skywalker or whatever people call it um and yeah just so it's so i've made
sure i don't uh you obviously will stay we've still got a potential hour left but vito why
should people subscribe to your channel well first of all i'm the king of star wars criticism
uh recently surpassed mauler and subscribers because i'm that good no but uh if you like
talking about star wars obviously i have fleet cinematic failure which uh people really like
people found it very funny almost about to hit five million views so
nice it's not as long of a long-form critique it's like 20 minutes long i think it's a good
afternoon watch i feel like a good chuckle and then i also do lots of dumb comedy stuff one of
my bigger videos was my pepsi video mauler are you aware of that one pepsi video i don't think
i've seen that one oh you haven't seen that one okay well did you already know how to talk about
pepsi do you remember when kendall jenner made an ad where she was handing out pepsi yeah i remember
that's the kind of people so people think i'm saying black people wait wait people are saying
you're a troll hold on let me read these comments people say i'm a troll how am i a troll i really
like the film trolling would be if i didn't really like the film and i was pretending
that would be a troll wouldn't am i wrong poor ryan yeah fucking poor ryan people are calling
this poor guy round head you don't think i can't feel bad man come on have a conscience
i'm gonna finish a sentence i was gonna say no but you remember that ad she was trying to save
the world by giving out pepsi cans yes and she was successful the will pieces i went to a i went
to a berkeley antifa trump protest with a giant a giant i was handing them out well just like many
cans of pepsi and i was giving them to antifa and trump supporters and they started whipping
them at each other and people were bleeding and dying in the street it was beautiful i hate to say
it but that's probably the best use of a pepsi can yeah uh so there's a lot of great footage of
people getting hit in the face of pepsi cans and being like i think i'm gonna go to jail at the end
of this video oh well dude i gotta i gotta watch more of your content this sounds like it's slash
veto the ito very i did check out a lot of your uh your movie reviews that takes on like the dcu
which by the way i don't think you have any legitimate arguments due to some marble fanboy
by the way just letting you know did you did you like the dc video i forgot to ask you guys
well the funny thing is do you guys like i want to know what you guys like
a really great movie yesterday oh yeah we watched um anthra poise yesterday love that movie
ever heard of it right not many have yeah it's not check it out it's usually well known um
i liked infinity war a lot but i think it's flawed that was a good movie if you're telling
me the flaws about tlj come on infinity war has gotta have some shit like that absolutely yeah
well the characters are pretty uh in line and that's the most important part for the storytelling
sort of system for me and obviously we disagree on luke but luke is the core of star wars for me
he got fucking ruined a lot of people liked it man i mean i i hear what you guys are saying i
i get it man i just get it but people loved it so it's not that bad um but but yeah i was gonna
say veto i don't have that problem because i shat on black panther and then i praised infinity war
so people were like you can't call me a marble fanboy because it's like i literally just shat
oh man i did not realize how intense the dc fanboys are man they were really mad at me
people wanted to cover those films i was like i don't know the
i don't even know why they're still talking about it yeah i just figured like how can you defend
batman versus superman with a straight face like really well i know a lot of people who love that
movie is the well justice league their defenses warner brothers didn't let zach snyder yeah they
want to snyder create a vision do you see aquaman this is how was aquaman it looked it looked pretty
visually stimulating it was double as fuck it looked like a colorful like i should get really
high and just turn my fucking you know dishonor wolf's kind of working on a video for that i would
just say everybody check that out because he's passionately ripped into uh is it funny well he
hasn't done it yet i'm just saying keep an eye um he's playing i'm doing some strong editing
choices for it so i'm kind of excited especially because would you guys think of bad times at the
el royale have you seen that no oh no i think it recommended though i really liked it i mean maybe
i'm crazy maybe i'm the only one i i i was like over the moon about it yeah that was one of the
best movies i've seen recently i also really liked uh that black mirror movie on netflix it's kind of
kind of different deal oh man did you did you dig that at all or not not really i played it with a
fred we thought it was crap we didn't understand the fuck it's such a mind fuck i mean it's a little
silly the way they kind of make it easy for you like if you fuck up you could always go back
but man there's just the acting like that main kid and the blonde kid the dude who was in like
we're the millers oh my god they were just incredible but i liked incredible too that
was a good time uh dude i love that brad's all right i've hit a lot of bad things about
problems in that movie wasn't perfect but uh it was it was funny that's fine that's cool all
the stuff with the baby made me laugh a lot what should we address in these comments or people
oh well no i was gonna say i've got super chest to read now so um yeah go check out both these
guys's channels that was the point of that to make sure it's mostly mine mostly what is super chat
so that's when if you can see the the things that are highlighted when they're posted they're
like donations plus a message so i've got them all listed here so we're gonna go right back to when
they started oh very cool so you got daddy i don't i don't know how anything works beautiful i'm an
idiot you should stream some q&a's or something on youtube you should nobody would care they'd be
one guy he'd be out there he'd be one dude be you looking for what to what i'll just be in the
fucking you don't even know uh super excited for you guys to be back looking forward to it all
this week my gf says i should be less excited but who listens to wamen am i right wow
that's fucking disgusting you explained to me the wamen thing i'm like i know it's something
sexist i just don't really know it isn't actually it isn't no it's just coming from anything or is
it just a fun i think i don't get where did it come from i think pewdiepie started he did the
respect wamen yeah interesting it's just like making fun of uh cartoonizing someone saying
respect women to the point where there's respect wamen dude i mean i you know i genuinely think
we should respect women i'm not trying to be like do you think yeah you are that i i genuinely
think women deserve a little more respect i think uh you know whatever well i i actually
you're gonna be telling me you think they should vote that's just that's that's my do you think
they should be allowed to drive that is the big question no definitely not absolutely not
only if they're driving me around uh no i don't know literally the fall of what oh snap you guys
gonna get to look at women well you get to look at wamen baby we didn't um come on you don't like
looking at some wamen come on guys well only attractive ones but this is wamen goggles on
this is something you won't get this is literally just for rag so don't don't question it if you
don't understand it a major lee i just finished your fallout 76 video but i was bored my third
time watching it so i had to leave a dislike yeah that is hilarious that is my man that's
like a collection of memes across 24 episodes of efap what what for you it was really good
this it's like it needs to be decoded to explain that message to you it's uh i just think it's
funny it sounds like he watched the video three times and now he's bored that's that's funny
that's good that's a good joke all right wolf have you played metro explain to me the other meaning
uh for every three words in his sentence it references something from a past efap episode
and he's constructed it into a statement that sounds vaguely solid that's the joke wait a minute did i
do that is that what this is no no it doesn't have anything to do with you you're just being used
you're like the indirect object in this sentence yeah yeah that was a little misleading uh yes
someone said wolf have you played metro exodus uh did he how do you he hasn't played that right
ranks i have not bought it yes i probably won't buy it till it gets on steam oh do you know if wolf
has i do not know i'm assuming he hasn't but uh hopefully you can well hopefully he has by the
time the next efap comes on uh can't wait for to return can't wait for return of the mystery box
yeah that'll be a potential for episode nine gotta do the meme conduit you damn right dude
make make away any of you heard of vic mignonia controversy vic monogner yes i have
have you not heard about this no he's the voice actor of many anime characters he was in the new
dragon ball z movie uh and it came out that he at conventions has a habit of getting a little touchy
with fans who come to take pictures with him and stuff as to is what he did bad enough to be
blacklisted out of the industry oh has he been yeah he lost all these jobs basically every every
when he was working with gut and people are someone it's a feminist some convention invited
him to speak and everybody's pissed about it i forget which one and it doesn't help that he's
like a hardcore christian either so people are thinking i don't know there's a lot of
who is a conspiracy or whatever it's a complicated subject um hey lead you get to look at women
you know i don't enough which is why i loved it so much in the film i don't see any women
i i live in a cell like that kid in the stable i can't wait to look at women while drinking my
rhino milk i'm sure that makes sense dude that guy sounds like my kind of dude let's hang out
stop criticizing this masterpiece about disney fanatical wizards intending intended for space
rhinos bilbo williams also look at women see it's just beautiful it's just memes yeah like
again that was a joke that i just knew was stupid like you gotta if you watch my other videos
there's so many stupid jokes like that it's just that's just i'm corny you know that's that's just
my humor we could probably expect a few more of them oh dude it's gonna go it's gonna get worse
i mean the corn the corn is gonna just magnify that star wars gale has expressed interest in
going on to efap and he plans on having the first wamen on that would be the second wamen we had
identified as one the other day but we weren't on efap so he missed an opportunity there
but um yeah we're always looking into other guests the problem is i still have
a backlog of guests i mean it took a while for me to get from the first time i heard that you were
interested you posted like a comment like two weeks it said two weeks ago on the thing that
i saw i was like shit so it took ages did you get did you get my actual personal like email
that i sent you i wasn't sure if you know but the problem is i get a lot of like i need to sort
a new email out because i get a lot of stuff i didn't know you guys do i didn't know you guys
were so game centric we are i don't know people you cover a lot of video games molly or at least
you did do you mean efap or my channel or our channels i'm confused because like efap we've
only done movies mainly we've done a few game things and then we did the gaming one
why is somebody dissing avangelian and also dissing me did i
that's interesting i know something rose tika was a security guard how and why at the end of
tlj was she flying a fighter i thought she was a mechanic because she's a wayman dude
wait i thought finn didn't know how to fly why was he flying a fighter oh that that's an actual
thing i was just gonna say to believe that rose can fly something yeah i can we can believe that
dude can we at least feel bad for the actress can we at least for being in the
literally anybody who gets you know attacks like yeah sure i'll feel bad for i'll feel bad for
anybody i'll feel bad for all the youtubers who get constant attacks well not even the
attacks just the fact that she was this character that so many people hate i mean can you imagine
that's just a really badly written having a million dollars is the worst thing in the world
i think she wasn't the best character but i i appreciated what she brought to the to the
equation i thought she was needed uh thoughts on the abomination known as the will smith genie um
the will smith genie that shit looks hilarious is this supposed to make me like
battle is right no i feel so bad for will smith this guy like he's too dislike magnet why because
dude fucking after earth he got bright like critics are just dumping on this guy's films
because they're no who cares he's got more money than god i don't feel bad yeah i can still have
after earth was terrible mm-hmm oh i'm just saying you put poor will smith it's not his fault he
shouldn't have took the role as the genie it was a bad move anybody yeah it's like a bright making
the movies i haven't seen it yet i saw the first i went in knowing i got bored and stopped watching
it yeah it wasn't bad like i really appreciated the story it was like this kind of interesting
like middle earth meets crappy gang los angeles i mean you know it wasn't amazing but going into
the film knowing it had like a zero on uh whatever metacritic like you can't know the famous line from
that uh movie mauler well uh fairy lives don't matter oh jesus what don't matter what was the
line ultimate says fairy lives don't matter as he slaps a fairy out of the sky i believe within
oh that's favorite yeah yeah the film had some topical commentary that is yeah that's some over
well there we are i guess uh hey guys hail the blessed pipeman of course valentine day is gay
it can be uh veto my friend has a ray ayanami shrine and claims she's his waifu upon interrogating
upon interrogating him i learned that in the years she's been his waifu he never jerked to ray
ryan tie is this fake ray fan or liar i'm i don't uh yeah i saw that comment uh yeah if you haven't
jerked off to ray how can she be your waifu so okay waifu i mean unless you're like asexual
and you you marry another girl who's asexual but uh the primer energy go ahead have you guys uh
you guys see that new dragon ball z movie it wasn't bad i haven't no i don't know i mean i
haven't seen that you know like literally have a watch the voice of somebody so no it had a
surprisingly good story i mean they they really made broly like this this character that you felt
bad for and uh just seeing goku and vegeta banter is just always classic they're like fucking abbot
and castello i never saw the original broly movie or any of that stuff but i do want to watch it at
some point but in theaters that shit was not terrible um the primary antagonist of efap season
three will be ryan johnson kathleen kennedy i think they're going to be the overarching
villains of the entire thing you know can you guys at least agree that dave falloni
should not take over lucas film who's the guy that like he rolled the clone wars and rebels
yeah he's like clone wars dude that's like a big thing at this point i'll take i would
absolutely take him as the writer instead of ryan johnson yeah i'd do that in a heartbeat
maybe as a writer but like dude he i mean the guy doesn't have like films on his resume even
i mean it's well i mean you could have told me that ryan johnson didn't die there and i'd believe you
yeah poor roundhead ryan johnson only has a film on his resume because his parents gave him
what happened to make a movie so don't you guys just want to give ryan johnson a hug don't you
just want to he's been an asshole squeeze him and tickle him a little bit i'll go watch whatever
movie he puts out there he's been a huge ass i'm interested in seeing whatever he makes but i don't
want to make a star wars trilogy and i have no idea how about that knives out you pumped about
that one no idea what is i have no idea you talking about the trilogy now or something else
yeah he's got a movie coming out oh pretty good knives out no idea what it's about sighted
but we'll see sight is a wish but i hope i hope my expectations are properly subverted i don't
think you'll be as disappointed as you were with uh last jedi but yeah sin sins is amazing and
you're insane it's very true lee loves valve front two campaign because you play as women
yeah stop white knighting for kathleen kennedy dude kathleen kennedy is a great resume i'm not
white knight like dude she worked on so many great films i'm a fan of her like this is not
some fake i'm not standing up for her because she's a woman i genuinely believe she's qualified
she's basically the next you know the next best thing to uh spielberg yeah
um oh no lee i don't want i don't want to picture you molesting ryan dude go ahead and picture it man
uh you need a ryan johnson emoji so we can say ryan milk true ryan milk huge fan and this is
totally off topic but rags is wrong about water not being wet oh god when you dry something
you are removing excess water making water the source of the object's wetness that doesn't
actually prove his point if anything that proves mine um he should have he should have
out that through a bit better i appreciate the donation i am not gonna it will be here forever
if i fucking covered on any of that uh someone called i think the color is not real thing is way
more interesting anyway someone call the auto hereticus on this man quickly what's what's the
auto hereticus war hammer dude you guys know way more of these terms than i do wisecrack just
posted a bullshit video whoa damn it uh bullshit video on starship troopers equals fashion
bullshit go forth and watch and downvote if you agree um honestly sargon is the only person i've
seen have a take on starship troopers that i thought was more accurate than any other what i've
seen dude his video on starship troopers was amazing i really like i said man i always i really
want him in uh these guys think kathleen was a water girl it's like yo calm down um yeah i'd be
interested to see a debate about starship troopers between someone who thinks that it's
well just the two posing ideas i guess um who thinks it glorifies fascism or psychopaths right
uh it would be basically impossible to make the case that it does they're like oh there's like
you know naziism is good i'm like what are you what are you talking about yeah i wonder what movie
they saw yeah yeah i don't know watched it wrong people really hate kathleen it's it's it's yeah
they do they will the hair she approved the script right so people blame ryan in here i love
her for that i just want to give her a high five i just want to hug her i'm sorry i'm sorry guys
trashing such a good it's 2019 tell us about all the creative decisions kathleen made yeah
i'm sorry go ahead uh you're watching efab you got yourself a cup of rhino milk life is good
give them a good work guys ragas stay sassy beautiful uh you need to pay money for the game
to be fun lee baggins yeah this is how far back we are we're all the way back to battlefront two
right now they kind of got rid of most of that but okay fun yeah it sucks i know ea stalls
battlefront two it's not that bad gonna be gonna be an interesting watch have some monies
thank you very much hey man it's called looking at the bright side not wrong with that i have to
correct a common comment here in battlefront two you cannot buy star card upgrades the game was
going to be pay to win but they removed it before it came out paying is only cosmetic you only
upgrade your abilities by playing yeah and um i believe it was the fact that it takes
bloody ages to get the things you want and they tried to i believe they tried to ease that out
they tried to make the grinding um less impactful i think battlefront two i was really the it was
sort of like the watershed moment for a lot of it was what started the loot box controversy it's
what began it if not for battlefront two this is an ironic greatness of the game uh microtransactions
probably still would be stuck in a position where the culture was not as aware of them
they'd be an anthem i know anthem changed specifically because a lot of the backlash
yeah developers fucking hate battlefront two for biting too much like they bit yeah they went too
hard they're like oh it's gonna be like 500 bucks for darth vader it's the idea of like
say you have a bunch of siblings who regularly steal a couple of pennies out of your parents
wallet like one of them stole the entire wallet they're like no you fucking idiot now they'll know
it is pretty good uh hey major league can you definitive definitively say making love to your
grandma would be a bad experience i.e zero out of ten if you've never done it i guess that's a
reference we're talking about my my dead grandma or like someone else's grandma well i think that
point would still stand i think either is definitely it's because you said about you know you
shouldn't really be talking about the game if you've never played it this argument is
can you never say a thing is bad without having experienced it well a game is not meant to be like
fucking your grandma it's supposed to be fun so it's a little different i mean if you were to say
hey man you're supposed to be fun don't don't knock banging a nail into your dick until you've done
it it's not yeah it's a cute quick if somebody tells if somebody tells me that orlando bloom
was in lord of the rings and then i say well you haven't seen the movie so you shouldn't talk about
i mean i don't know what dude i i only said that because i really it sounded like you'd
played the game i was surprised that you didn't well you said i hadn't said anything wrong the
premise of the argument was that we're not playing it because of these things having existed
i get that like an ethical thing totally fair microtransactions are a problem when people have
spending problems and gambling addiction because that's who they're made to cater to so that's why
there's terms like wales it takes advantage of those people um yeah you know i'm okay with like
certain microtransactions because i was going to say that you could make that argument for
literally every micro transaction ever right yeah uh so for me it's always about the execution
i've as long as the game is not designed in a way that it is you have to buy this to have a good time
to uh play the game correctly or beyond the same level as everyone else if you release your game
and then you add content packs of just different skins for things and this is like yeah you have
to pay money to get them i just be like yeah that's fine like make your character you have
to try pretty hard to justify to me why you have a full 60 game and you're also putting
microtransactions into the game because those things used to be unlockable through actually
yeah listen i was well a lot of that comes down to the uh used game market because you know
the shadow of war have well it's like in that middle earth game it's like the definition of
what an expansion truly is what's the line like expansion packs used to be these massive huge
additions to games and in games too you would have i mean halo's a good example you do this
thing that's difficult you get this item that you could show off that you did something
and now it's everything is so randomized loot boxes are so commonplace in a lot of other
games that when people have something cool or interesting you don't work towards anything
there's no reward that you can show off it's just i got lucky or i paid money so i got this thing
it doesn't actually say anything about how good i am or anything and you also have to look at the
cost of development these days though i mean like that's a decision they made you can make yeah but
you used to be able to make a video game with five guys in a basement you can still do that
you can still do that you can do it with five guys in a basement okay well hang on you know
what's the sass is creed made with five guys in a basement originally oh but i'm saying that the
reason it has more you know dlc and that sort of thing is they're like look it was a great
thing yeah what are we talking about expansions well yeah expansion packs and microtransactions
or look at terraria oh dude you play that i'm not saying there aren't games that are like that it's
just like you know some people look if you want to say hey let's stop making triple-a games and
just make indie 2d things okay that's a different argument what about hellblades no not at all
hellblade was a that's a two that's an indie game the witcher three's an indie game soma but would
god of war have been better if less people worked on it i don't know that's a strange position to
take yeah maybe i'm saying that you just make those games you have to have a company and they
have to be profitable so the witcher three's an indie game witcher three has a very large staff
that's an indie game that's impressive well it depends on looking forward to that you're saying
it's an independent studio that's not an indie game no or like stardew valley by the common
definition of indie game witcher three definitely does not qualify yeah it's a little being an
independent game studio is different from being an indie developer you know what i'm saying
how uh indie okay if i tell you i have an indie band does it sound like i put on saying the guy
defending who is defending microtransactions in this conversation i haven't heard anyone
i'm no i'm not i know they suck i'm defending i'm defending microtransactions i said they're
bad but it's just there's so much good shit in the game that it's you can't give it a zero because
that you could give it a five or six that's fair but the microtransactions are optional which they
are well there's just so many modes that don't even involve that that there's just i don't know
yeah it's well you've relegated stuff that is in those microtransactions to content that otherwise
would have been unlockable through skill or here's the question as a reward or would have been
$60 do you get $60 worth of content and that's what matters oh $60 there's the option to obtain
more content if you play the game a lot absolutely you're getting your money's worth i mean you know
so does the game have $60 worth of content fine and then if they want $60 worth of content is the
standard then that justifies pay to win microtransactions i mean i'm not saying they had this great
they didn't have this great concept down but now at this point with all the the you know bending
over they've done and getting rid of a lot of the microtransactions they've added a lot of free
content you got all this last jedi stuff the prequel stuff i mean it's definitely worth $60
at this point i don't see why microtransactions look if i pay $60 for a game and i get a game
that's fantastic there's no part of me that says i have to buy more stuff in fact i very rarely buy
any dlc because i'm like yeah i got enough out of that game dude the the store in fallout 76 makes
the game and they want to you know keep making content for it i gotta fund it you know there's
no reason for them to keep adding stuff to the game if it's not going to bring in more money
a fallout with like a $10 sign for you i'm saying all my yeah well that's the thing obviously
there's ones that are like manipulative and fucking exploitative but if you're gonna be
like oh it's a whole new area yeah because fallout 76 took assets that were in previous
games that you got through gameplay and they turned them into microtransactions right like
clothing yeah i mean each one has to be you know exactly but i think people who are like
oh you should never have microtransactions i'm like well then you're just gonna get games with
less content like right they're not gonna they're not gonna make money off of it i mean or they will
less content you can sell 60 games they're very common games free games are fine i'm fine with
them in free games as long as they're not pay to win yeah no i hear you i agree okay i'm a company
and i make a game and it's a 60 game and i can sell it for six dollars got enough content
what incentive is there for me to keep making more content for it to keep players invested in
your games i already bought it uh have you heard of no man sky yeah yeah yes a game which
flopped a game which everyone bought and then immediately refunded you see i didn't play it
until next where are you going where are you going with that you said they've already bought
it so why do i need to do anything else like just because they bought it does not mean the
people who bought a physical copy can't refund it and oh they did it was it was unprecedented
if you remember a lot of stores had policies but they said like return your no man sky copy and we
will refund it because of what happened where was that oh wow it was in the toy store that i worked
at well nowhere in america do we ever have the agreement hey yeah you can return that game you
already opened in america you're fucked oh well we got a better system over here if you're unsatisfied
with your product you can return it basically under any circumstances we are jerks someone's
like stop talking lee i'm barely even talking right now like i don't think i've got a word in
in the past 10 minutes not that i care i'm just saying it's funny um yeah i was gonna say we could
fucking talk for hours about the ethics of not only we haven't even talked about loot boxes which
are just like satan at this point um but microtransactions in general uh i'll just try and
carry on because the last thing we need is to actually have a whole second podcast on this
you know uh big supporter here you have inspired others it's always sunny and old around ryan
direct stalls and part two jj's back up now on my page keep it up um very well thank you
want to hear a joke part two is coming the 14th i don't when did i say that it was coming the 14th
i don't remember saying that i don't know i forget i i think the only thing i've ever said is that
the end of february and the hope was uh gonna be this year i don't think i ever see this is why
you're encouraging me to never make an announcement about when a video is going to come out because
yeah i i try to stop doing that as well because something pops up or what happens is i'll watch
it back and i'll keep adding to it and adding to it and yeah i hear you i i never tell people when
something's finished because like the best stuff comes when you're just you like you're it's done
you're not really trying to look for stuff you're just watching it down and then like the best ideas
come in your head wolf isn't here let me show for him then everybody should watch pan's labyrinth
it's a great movie why is that shilling for wolf i guess wolf really likes that movie oh yeah sure
but i'd say that's shilling for um yummel del toro yeah but yeah no go watch it it's good wolf is
probably too busy playing metro exodus to be on this episode i believe he's in work but we will
see if he's played that or not i'm paying more for purely cosmetic reasons the amazing lucas for refab
i really i don't see why not we'd like to have all kinds of guests i suppose um that'd be that'd be
interesting if everything lee says is to be mocked then why listen i knew i knew it was going to be
mocked i well the things that he said that weren't mock worthy we didn't mock right he didn't mock
everything yeah i assume they're talking about the fact that you said you you do throw in lines
that are going to be marked it's not like lee is saying everything he says is supposed to be marked
but i love the mockery you have to understand like i wanted to piss people off of that video i know
that sounds childish and stupid but yeah like it's just it's all on purpose man i love it all
and i really love the fact that people thought it was fake like i love that that people left that
comment a lot of people said this they were like dude i thought you were trolling and then like
four minutes in i realized it wasn't troll i love that because that means at one point in their video
their mind was just blown and they were like oh my god no this isn't troll dude that's great to
me like i love that stuff i don't know when people when people can't tell if i'm being serious or not
i think that's a failure in life no dude no you gotta you gotta look at it as you're you're blowing
their mind like you are you're taking them for a ride no you're keeping them on the edge of your
seat what what's in earnest or not that's true that is frustrating but also it's like dude
you're you're clowning these people in a way like you're literally keeping them on the edge of their
seat and that kind of reminds me of the whole like jokes on you i was retarded the whole time
yeah like i want people to be on the edge of their seat because they're legitimately interested not
because they're just confused about things coming out of my mouth i get it you don't want to be over
the top with sarcasm but you still want it to be delivered you know i don't know yeah no they
could be interested but also slightly confused i mean that's but that's if i'm trying to communicate
something i don't want confused i hear you that's like language no that's that's ideal
what's up guys first time commenting ps got milk of course has majorly seen maulers critique at all
uh i skim through it watch the few minutes what do you think you know i think you pick apart stuff
that is in my opinion kind of nitpicky but then again if you honestly have a problem with it i'm
not going to say you're an idiot i mean i'm not watching films the way you do so those things
just don't bother me but yeah like i there's some things that are just holes that you can't argue
with um but again it's like there's just people that don't watch movies that way and it just
it might be a shame to you but it's a shame to them that there are people watching it like that
so i i don't think there's any like right way to watch a movie i think there's there's one thing
you should do which is not have a whole planned movie in your head when you go into the theater
and again i'm not saying you guys did that but a lot of people did i mean they bring it up a lot
and i don't know who these people all right well i i've watched a lot of reviews of people bugging
out and uh i don't know this is what i'm finding one of them be uh like everyone in my video
like kevin smith just i mean just for an example i mean you know kevin smith he he he did a good
job at voicing the sentiment that i'm sure a lot of people felt which is we wanted to see luke do
like cool saber twist you know so that's why i put those guys in the video you know it's like
they they did a really good job articulating the common criticisms they they said them all i mean
the holdo thing the everything was covered i think you don't know bombs uh so i don't know
by the way patrick williams is someone who actually says there is a wrong way to watch a movie
well yeah i mean if you go in like with this thing of like a list of expectations you just
said there wasn't which one is it that's the wrong
stop it
we can't make it up we don't know what you're saying your mic is all awful sounds like you're
moving it around or something and he's gone it's like he's like shaking it to make it work
uh leah i just yeah go ahead read it leah made the same mistake too then proceeds to blame po
oh we we did go over that extensively so that's arguable yeah if you kill your enemies they win
admiral holdo yeah um ryan johnson literally said rose didn't fit in star wars but he just
meant it was something it was something new it was like for this yeah okay no like really
just because something new doesn't mean it's good i i agree uh an entire warship that is
pretty much the equivalent of a super battleship for a couple of shitty bombers sounds like a great
trade-off yeah that's a pretty excellent trade that you'd be a fool to not make yeah i'd have
to agree with that people are very it's interesting that people are very concerned with like the
details of the space battle and you know there's nothing wrong with that it's part of the plot
it's stuff that happens in the film that it is the star war no i know yeah it's the movie yeah
it's how i get invested in the characters they're making decisions i'm just saying it's interesting
you know yeah it's interesting that people care about the plot yeah right yeah jill's gonna
chill molar and rags have you patience of saints i couldn't do what you do i mean it's been it's
been chill it's okay there's been dude he's fine this guy doesn't even get he's like he's
not even flinch rags is stalwart he's a paragon of of righteousness isn't that right rags yep
there you go that really can't tell the difference between rags and veto i'm sure
you guys kind of sound alike what's a little little bit i don't i don't know you guys
well enough it's all i'm hearing is everybody talking over each other i don't know when rags
is talking and vetoes talking i can't tell the difference oh green circles over my icon that's
when i'm talking gotcha uh what troll meter should i get on amazon mine broke what what
they're saying that troll meter oh i got you finn was conscripted to be on the resistance
plantation this talk is a macro aggression that's a fucking hilarious comment um unrelated question
redland media recently did a review of the often overlooked 1984 classic top secret have any of you
mueller rag or wolf seen that movie we haven't seen it but we want i want to because i saw their
thing on it i really do want to see that there's there's some movies on my list that i do want to
see that's that's probably at the top yeah that movie looks hilarious um uh then he tells his
nephew he is beyond redemption misunderstand misunderstanding of the character and the force
does he say that about kai though i can't remember wait did you say what beyond redemption luke
say that but then he definitely tells ray that like you're wasting your time trying to turn him
good you know i guess yeah that counts brain uh tlj equals prequels prettier cgi and dead ot
hay rags oh there you go you gotta admit at least the acting was better let's at least
come to that conclusion i mean you really got mark hamill what wait what's the better acting
and better what's better than what i i i think at least you can agree that the acting in the last
shit i was was better than hayden christianson come on just come on um what character i mean
it's better than christians anyone you want even the lamest character i think was i mean i'll still
i'll stick to the i hate what they did with this character but i think mark hamill did an amazing
job mark hamill was better than hayden christianson but i think adam drive was better i've Adam drive
is allowed i mean i i don't get what he's trying to do though i don't i don't know if that's i
haven't seen him in anything else so i don't know if that's a character thing or a script thing
it's like it's like daisy ridley is like i can't like surely she's not the best actress for this
role because she has issues with like emoting in speech if so yeah oh well yeah i i mean i've
been looking at a lot of clips because i've been making the tfa stuff i don't know what it is about
daisy ridley's portrayal of ray but she seems to have so few facial expressions to make um the
open eyes open mouth and then like you say that about the other characters too or just her
even i think even uh harris and ford's doing a better job than she is in that movie and
he's he kind of say that about fin he kind of makes like three faces
um i don't know i think he's he's kind of he's kind of a joker as or like a jester like we
mentioned before like the whole he's so he's like oh oh oh oh my god oh and it's just like okay
there's a lot of faces you're making i guess a lot of slapstick reactions to stuff in uh you know
i really like oh sorry god uh kylo is strong but there's nothing that hints that luke wasn't 90
69 times stronger than kylo um i don't know i don't have a fucking clue what the power levels
are ray kind of broke the meter when she defeated kylo and luke funny in the dragon ball uh movie i
just saw they really like i mean i know this has always been a thing in that series but it was like
oh his power level is 3 000 oh man my power level is 6 000 i i guess maybe some people
would want that info here i don't know uh majorly needs logic for dummy's book right now and you
mean like the math like logic like the math logic yeah i don't i don't know shit about that
that's some that's some no not intelligence stuff yeah luke has given up its crap suicide by cop
the not so great yeah hayden christianson's not a bad actor but he's bad in that movie just like
natalie portman is bad in it like it's just it was not good direction the performances are just
across the board week i'd have to watch the third one again because i remember that uh
i mean you obviously remember the iconic shit like him getting super pissed at obi when all
of his limbs have been cut off not like that was you know uh that was fun yeah i don't know i'd
have to think about it and it would be a comparison of to which actor in the other film i haven't
watched him in a while uh luke is more entertaining i mean it's you know luke is
much stronger in the force than beam by sheer virtue of time and training again yoda yoda could
have slapped luke around in esp but luke was physically stronger and more vital than him
fair enough major lee do you think that luke skywalker milking scene was important or appropriate
absolutely loved it when i saw that i was fucking cracking up i i like when i first saw that i
really wanted to just hug ryan johnson i wanted to be like dude you're the man it was so funny
i mean here's this guy drinking blue milk out of a tit it's hilarious
all right it wasn't an udder it wasn't an udder it wasn't like udders are tits
yeah but it was it looked like a breast you know i had like two or like round uh
protrusions on it wouldn't what would the distinction even be really because isn't
that what others are supposed to be yeah no one calls it an udder though everybody calls it tits
yeah i mean if you weird to say the woman's got udders someone's like yeah we get it lee uh rags
equals jotaro major lee equals steely dan i i don't know the reference what a steely dan fan
but okay i'll have to look up jotaro uh i guess this is a question for lee when did snoke turn
kylo's heart and why like mauler said it it hasn't been really covered in detail it it it's
it's uh something that should have been in a flashback or whatever you know but it's not too
late to go back and explain some of that stuff and it also wouldn't be terrible to explain that
in the third movie i mean now that kylo is i mean again you can debate this but now that he's at
least more bad than he wasn't you know um maybe now it's time to revisit that but again if they
don't i'm not going to be bothered by it oh that's jotaro i can see i can get why you are he's the lost
jedi who's going to train ray now the books will train ray ray will train ray doesn't need any
training of course all lightsaber fights in one of the fighters getting axed ignore the hundreds
of times where the fights ended with both parties unscathed never mind maimed yeah i mean that's
referring to when you said like what are the two things that could even happen well i mean i just
think him wounding him would be i don't know i i didn't see that being a possibility but you know
it's not terrible uh luke could have been on that island protecting his remaining students
and preparing the fight for the first order he could have been striking from the shadows
yeah absolutely another option that's what people thought he was doing yeah i mean that was the
consensus and that no there was there wasn't a consensus i think most people assumed he was like
training or gearing up to do something i mean most people would guess that based on everything
that we've been told about a character that he's probably going to be act we assume it was proactive
rather than the opposite of that yeah we assume that he's acting consistently with his established
character yes well again i mean this was one of those meta themes that this movie was aware of i
mean ray says to luke leah sent me here with hope if she was wrong she deserves to know why we all
made a theme i'm telling you when she said we all deserve to know why she's talking about you
the fans we need to know why you are here on this island we need luke skywalker what the fuck is
going on because that's like the scene is we're watching the scene i mean that's that's what it's
about it's like we are characters in this movie almost that's what meta is a 20 year old
okay but you could also say the film goes on even if we're not even present i know i'm just saying
that that line was about you as the fan you deserve to know why luke is there so i mean
that's just storytelling well i'm just saying the movie was aware that people had that expectation
yeah i mean they had their explanation and that's pretty much what our problem is yeah i don't i
don't uh i don't hate you for that uh lee how much moonshine have you drunk to come up with this
utter garbage i've never ever tried it is yeah no it's nasty have you tried that right
moonshine no i i am from arkansas and i have not tried moonshine i'm not a big liquor man
not so great this guy says this guy says i this guy's saying i imagine and assume too much
yeah you know maybe i do but again these are things that really never bothered me it's not
like i'm sitting here with a list of flaws and like trying to come up with explanations for him
i just never thought of that stuff like it never bothered me enough for me to
even talk about it so yeah it's going to sound like i'm assuming and making shit up but it's
like dude this is the first i've heard those complaints so you know hmm i don't know what
else to say about it yeah uh you can't introduce a character with this level of importance into a
pre-existing canon without explaining him the emperor was a one-off there was no law he had to
conform with in the ot the other argument that i would say that makes it so the emperor is not
the same as snoke is that the emperor's existence doesn't contradict anything uh snoke's existence
it's like how the fuck did he get there when the republic's been in power that's like the first
obvious question um and we're and so he's so old that he would have been alive during palpatine's
reign so where was he then and it's just like just obvious things that it would nice to get them you
know i said that i totally said that when i saw tfa i was like dude who is this guy how did he
become the new leader you know what what's the deal here but by the time this last jedi storyline
gets going with snoke and he's you know he's abusing kylo and they have this relationship
now it just i don't know it just kind of got swept away but that's just me you know this is
literally the not so great debate too it's just funny because uh i'll be interested to see what
wolf thinks as a whole in the same way some people say luke and tlj is commentary on ptsd and that's
why it's good i respond with rose and fin is commentary on workplace sexual harassment
um yeah i mean they highlighted a strong issue someone saying what would bother you lee could
cathin county ryan johnson do anything that upset you yeah i have a lot of problems with the force
awakens i just really think ryan did a good job with what the cards he was dealt it's a tough thing
i mean people you know people had more expectations in a way for this film because they really were
expecting luke to do something in this one i mean we already had that and now it was probably
doubled down for this film and yeah there was plenty of stuff that could have happened that i
would have hated i mean i can think of a billion things but i just think they did a good job with
what they're given they did it okay the way that they did it right yeah i mean it's not perfect
yeah i i'm i'm with you guys i think it'd be fun to see all three guys together and
high-fiving on the falcon but all part of me also well okay i'm just saying some people have said
that and you said you guys literally what you said man you you never said you'd be cool to see
luke con and lay together high-fiving on the millennium falcon no it's maybe not high-fiving
that was the joke part but you know what i'm saying a lot of people have that opinion that
it's a missed opportunity and yeah i i kind of agree with that but at the same time it's so
uh also respectful to the old films that they don't try to repeat all that stuff and they don't
risk making it like this corny reunion so you got to look at it like that they they just didn't
want to cheapen the original iconic image of these three guys on a falcon it's so much more
special because it it wasn't really have to have a character say it's salt so that you know it's not
no it's not hot that was funny that was funny yeah i with garth edwards yeah that was no it
wasn't funny it was fucking pathetic it was silly you gotta let you know it wasn't a bad
like that that scene yeah i'm laughing at it not with it if you know what i mean yeah well
they wanted you to know why there was redness underneath the whiteness it was just not explained
that that's explained why it's not hot it's not snow guys yeah you're right it's this isn't
off just in case you're clearly recreating huh um kylo confronts luke on crate both discussed
they want to destroy the old orders and build a new hux tries to kill them with 80 80s and they
save each other's lives they are the new antagonists of episode nine i guess they're
presenting another option for crate who is the new anti oh oh i got you uh efap drinking game
take a shot every time lee says maybe because he's presenting a hypothetical vision of the film i
pray for a swift death dude i i don't i don't like making like definitive statements if i'm
not 100 sure about something you should use maybe a lot when talk when speculating on on
theories or things that we're not agreeing on that are in a film i'm just being respectful
if i if i want to give you an idea like this is definitely the case this is what they mean here
is that we're going by what's in the film and the defense of it is a hypothetical that doesn't
exist within the film i'm curious how you would like so for example when vader says i am your
father and it's revealed no less stuff happens if we come out of the cinema from that film you go
man i can't believe vader is luke's father and then i go i think he's just referring to it like
a metaphorical sense like he's a mentor i don't think he's actual father like maybe he's just
saying that you know i am your your i'm sure some people interpret it that way people apparently
interpret it no people people thought he was lying to luke i'm sure love averages yes somebody will
have thought that and all the people who's oh dude it's just like with kylo telling ray you're
you're i'm not not your brother it's like you know a lot of people think he's lying even though it
came out of her mouth but you know it's possible that he put it into her head and made her think
that yeah i mean it's anything is possible you got to say maybe with the shit we're in the middle
of the trilogy we haven't seen out where it goes yet is there anything you can say that's definitive
about anything ever in a movie like if someone gets eaten by a t-rex do you go they were eaten
by a t-rex you go ah that might have been a projection like a lie from someone else
that could it could be it could be a puppet it could be a clone it could be
i don't think i go that maybe han solos survive that's all i wanted i wanted to know you have a
light it's good that you have a light yeah yeah i got something to find somewhere there's a line
somewhere there's some people who don't have that line and it's just like a philosophical nightmare
just right does not have that line you know no i i technological nightmare uh anyone who likes
the channels of these fine gentlemen will love strat head g i don't know that channel productions
channel good breakdown of game design spell it uh strats dash edg strats dash edg and then productions
dash edg um productions hey molar and rags wanting to both to know you guys help me through the
toughness in my life with your individual content and efap it's not to say you guys are the reason
i'm still here today uh thank you so much you guys are awesome thank you very much zachary very kind
um the ones like lee didn't have a plan did you want me to have a plan like should i have showed
up to this no no it was always just gonna be i didn't plan anything i just like who planned yeah
no i thought it would be respectful to like not come in with a bunch of shit i want to speak
vita had everything planned a plan went according to plan just i'm glad you feel that way star wars
story right man my plan was for my microphone to keep breaking by the way um oh well i was gonna
say hopefully we can make it now to the end stress uh star wars story writing one through three and
five six seven through nine suffers from the writers prior knowledge that they have to another
two films to explain shit i suppose it's an interesting thought the fall wasn't made with
the strict idea that they're five and six but then they could they could add them on while the other
trilogies were like we have two films to go so we don't have to explain everything
hmm i don't think the prequels really suffered in that way yeah because the prequels you can knock
the first prequel off and you'd still have your story pretty much totally um not to say that
phantom menace is worthless just that uh two and three would function as the history of darth vader
just as well as one two three do more goes on yeah yeah uh kylo is so tortured crawling in my skin
uh would you say lazy writing equals bad writing for example i would say death note has a lot of
lazy writing but i'd never say it's bad writing lazy usually means they took an easy way out
accidentally i'd say death note has a lot of bad writing but uh it's just lazy isn't necessarily
bad like you could lazily attempt to do something and it turns out okay yeah i would usually do it
in reverse as in i see someone who's like how do we get our heroes out of this and then one of them
goes i have a sphere that just does it and they press a button they get out i'm like god that was
fucking lazy well i thought it was pretty lazy when r2d2 randomly woke up at the end of force
awakens but you know do you know that jj has given like four different accounts of why that
happened the first one being that it just it was sad yeah it's he was in low power mode uh i don't
know this is like an abuse victim covering for their abuser i think they're referencing you lee
i'm so sorry i don't i don't want you to think i i feel abused here don't don't feel that bad for
me he doesn't hit me i fell down the stairs into his fist i hit his fist with my face
someone's like stop reading the comments lee should i stop reading these am i not supposed
to be really up to you i i don't know why are you commenting if you don't want me to read it what's
the point uh this guy strikes me as someone desperately trying to make the best of a bad
situation i mean no i'm loving this situation why would i think this is bad this is your show this
is how it's going to be it's this is it it's this is fine i'm loving it i would have quit i would
have quit five hours ago if i wasn't having fun lee you argue snoke's identity doesn't matter but
this character basically undid what the rebellion fought for 30 years ago yet we don't know we was
or when where how or why you did any of these things i think it did matter in in the previous
film i i was also not invested in his character because i had no details about him same with
general hux thought he was just like one-dimensional villain but then in the second one they elevated
their characters you know right off the bat they give hux these comedic moments i thought that
really made him likable and same with snoke you know you see him treat kylo like shit he becomes
this personality all of a sudden and at that point it didn't matter what his past was because
he was interesting in the moment at least to me you predicted it more a conversation with lee can
only become toxic i actually did expect you to be toxic from your video i didn't i didn't think it
would go as well as it did how would i be toxic what by being like a libtard like what would be
toxic because the way that you like you you you ripped into a lot of people so i was like i wonder
if that's how it goes in an actual conversation or not dude i was never about to like cover you
in any of my videos you're doing your thing but oh no i i meant in like in a live conversation
i thought maybe you would uh do that way i didn't know um but no like i i mean once we get to the
end i could say it as a complete thing but i mean i i think you've been uh a very good guest
same for veto and i feel bad that there's not really any super chat questions for veto but
i feel like it's probably because people love to pick the brain of someone who loves tlj on this
channel i think saying i'm a shill for efap dude whatever man whatever you guys want to interpret
out of this i'm okay with it i'm it's called being friendly yeah i'm a shill because i because i like
to have manners okay the main complaint about star trek discovery series is that it doesn't
respect the star trek canon and or philosophy that doesn't uh that it doesn't feel like star trek
major lee how is discovery a solid star trek series what do you mean by that i think it totally
feels like star trek yeah it's got a different tone it's a lot darker it's more adult but i think a
lot of people wanted that and i think it could really they're trying to sell the license i guess
not yeah well star trek discovery is like the tlj of star trek it's so fucking divisive i've
only heard that it's bad i have never heard anyone like go out and i'm not as big of a fan of it as
i am of the last jedi it definitely has flaws but i'm really enjoying it i think the stuff with
the klingons is so well done i mean they made them really bad and every scene on their ship
is just like that the drama is so interesting and you know there's klingons that do want to fight
in the war there's ones that want to break away it's like there's all this stuff going on and
you know again i i shouldn't have been brought up the fucking show because i don't know nearly as
much about that shit as i do star wars but i'm enjoying it i honestly am i think the acting is
really good uh it looks phenomenal the like cinematography is amazing you know it's just a
it's a tv drama you know what you know uh the joker and lex luther from the animated series
of batman and superman are excellent compelling non-conflicted pure evil characters or villains
sorry i assume that's about because you said that it's not fun to have a villain that's like
one-dimensional i guess it's okay sometimes like i you know i made the argument in solo
that i thought driden was kind of one-dimensional but then again he also fit with the archetype
that he was he's this crime boss he's supposed to be an asshole he does he fits with what he is
he he kind of felt like the same character he played in gangster number one i think it was
like a little echo to that but you know with snoke yes it would have been boring if he was just
the emperor are we talking about snoke or kylo here who are we talking about
he's like that that's it sounds like a like the like the reason was it is what it is no i think
with star wars we've seen a lot of villains that are just straight bad we got darth maul we got
count duku we got the emperor you know kylo is this new type of villain that actually has
possibility at redemption but maybe not it's like it's keeping us on the edge of receipts
or at least people that are liking it at least uh major lee is better than jack and eric for
coming on efap while rags is here yeah i mean rags you have kind of like an american accent
like are you where are you from i do have an american accent no i mean like like uh you have
like a slight twang right are you from the south or no arkansas okay okay cool all right so now i
can tell the difference i'm sorry uh wait why did they say that do you do you rag on people
no it's the other people who have been invited to efap have refused to come on if rags is here
even though they have no i guess it's good i did absolutely no research into you guys i mean
i also didn't want to come in with like you know this grudge or anything like that i i just don't
care it's like a lot of people say nasty things about us that aren't true yeah i don't even want
to know anything right crazy i don't even want to know shit you guys don't seem like you're even
conservative at all are you that's the best thing i've ever from someone who disagrees we haven't
really got we haven't really gotten political at all in this disguise you guys haven't said
anything well except for your like racist joke about black guys kissing whatever whatever but
yeah i didn't you guys you guys didn't come off as like ultra conserve well the it's just it's
become a meme that if you don't like the last jedi you're conservative apparently that's a thing
and then i did say that in the rap video i just put out which i don't know if you guys have seen
but oh get get ready to have material uh yeah i mean that's just a funny thing i like joking
about that yeah obviously not everyone is a freaking conservative that hates the movie but
it's fun to say that and poke fun at them i don't know i just think it's really funny
you guys haven't seen that freaking insanely idiotic rap video i just uploaded dude you're
gonna have a field day with that i we haven't but i i'll i'll make a note you're gonna you will
crack the fuck up and be like why the fuck did we just have this idiot on uh leo was a goddamn
jedi in the extended universe uh well that's non-canon anymore sorry disney killed it uh
capitalism hoe the biggest plot hole of a new hope is the stormtroopers saw them jump into the
trash and uh after they left the trash compactor they should have been a firing squad waiting for
them yeah you could say the stormtroopers probably just assumed they died in there um i think you're
doing what i did you're doing what i was accused of doing um what i would say is i don't know that
that's uh that's a strict line i'd be like do they know exactly where that goes without checking
plans right yeah i was gonna say like how do they even know that goes to the trash compactor and
could they see that's what was happening for sure it was like they're clearly moving or running they
might have had to check the area first to make sure they weren't just hiding um and then guys
there there should have been a line where the stormtroopers say where does this go yeah but
troopers never talk and we assume they're in competence uh yeah but yeah no i think i think
i'd be okay with that if we had a um a quick a quick throwaway line for why they would have
been able to is like if they're coming out of the place and they're like um how do the stormtroopers
not find us that they go we have to head to the maintenance shaft or try to head them off at the
wherever it was yeah to explain it a bit hon is like that shoot could lead to the hundreds of
trash compactors they'd have to check them all yeah something like that i don't know separates
the waste by size and the big waste area um fans have waited 35 years to see these characters
back on screen together let's not give them that kathleen kennedy um yeah i again it's like a lot
of people are saying that that that's one of the it makes you appreciate the original that much
blasting i i just think it's it's a flaw and it's also a strength i don't see how it's in any way a
strength especially another story unfolded for me it it makes me really appreciate the originals
where they were together i mean if we cut off your dick so that's like saying someone shooting you
in the dick makes you appreciate all the time you had a dick yeah exactly exactly you agree okay
all right then moving on uh luke searches kylo's mind in his sleep and he sees ben has killed
people that snoke influence has already turned him so ben was evil to begin with before he even
woke up so what was the point of luke not killing him or of luke holding the saber over
uh i guess there's a lot i'm not sure exactly what they're referring to but maybe they're
referring to luke feeling guilty like why would he if it's not his fault that any of this is
happening he's already evil maybe it would have helped to see exactly what he was seeing
you know what i think what i agree you're saying why does luke feel guilty about i'm not sure
they said what's the point i'm not sure exactly what they're referring to the point of which what's
the point of their question well i don't know sir okay uh tfa and tlj ruin the ending of return of
the jedi inexcusable i mean yeah that's tfa destroys return of the jedi hardcore
it reverses everything it kind of made it feel for nothing yeah oh well we haven't again movies
later we're down to one well i disagree with much that major lee says i have to admit that he has
the fortitude to come on here with a three-on-one conversation very much a true i mean there's no
other choice i don't have anybody else i could bring i mean if you had said i don't know fucking
only come on if rags doesn't we just be like all right then the kiss you don't come it up
but uh if you said i don't know can i bring a friend we'd be like sure i don't have any friends
uh but uh i'm joking but yeah it's just like i'm just doing this because people were really
getting on my case about it i mean i i didn't plan on it but once i saw how important it was
to people you know your show uh i was like okay if he's down i guess i'm down i just didn't think
you would want to do that oh well um unfortunately and this isn't on you it's on it's not on anybody
but uh when you have fans of two sides uh talking to each other excessively you'll have them say
stuff that doesn't even come from us so like they might go lee is too cowardly to come on efap
and then fans of yours will like go uh they ignore them at every turn because they're scared
this the whole time it's like i wasn't even aware you wanted to come on i was just like oh i thought
that was a possibility no i the five fans that i have yeah they're they're probably not even aware
this is happening well i have some fun with it uh one will raise the stakes introduce the yuzang
vong who would make no sense and it's too late but hey stakes are raised yeah hey subvert those
expectations baby that's what we're all about let's be honest here's what everyone really is
thinking let's be honest everyone really wants to know if it's going to kiss making a return
oh and fish uncar plot is coming back that's what we all care about simon peg you know what's funny
uncar plot literally uh is like ray's adopted father there could be a lot there but we never
got to see they could revisit him he he was a cool character i think going to the rhino milk casino
to win some memes it's new yeah yeah it's definitely new if that means you know why did you
kill younglings well it's a great band name uh why did you kill the younglings well you know
is that what i said you know hey rags i tried out hellblade good video bro
oh thanks i'm glad you tried it out hope you liked it you need to play the game what is it like 30
bucks it was my game of the year for 2017 really that's surprising hellblade yeah that's cool
hey guys i'm never able to catch these lives and i wanted to give back for the hours of entertainment
ps rag is is a weird grape it's true kylo still seems like the most normal one kylo still kills
luke it's not embarrassing at all oh right the whole uh the story wouldn't really be embarrassing
for kylo because ultimately he still killed luke as far as anyone knows we don't know if
kylo knows that luke's dead i mean he might he might have an idea because he said this would kill
you but he also was pretty fucking pissed when luke disappeared he wasn't thrilled
uh an efap debate with major lee i wouldn't miss this for the world too bad i'm stuck at work
hopefully you have one of the jobs that lets you uh maybe put something on the background i don't
know uh major lee is t posing and letting out hot takes yes hyperspace a star destroyer game
over at the start how would i not what what would i do instead of hot takes like what what else
what's the alternative uh cold takes like always is a movie right very entertaining fuel isn't a
thing when you every ship has ion engines also you make micro jumps also there is over 10 000
fighters in enemy fleet yeah yeah we that tells you where where these super chests are currently
at and isn't it implied by the movie itself that the empire 2.0 literally can't remember their name
has more fuel than the rebellion when they say that they're going to chase them until the
rebellion runs out of fuel yeah i just all of it makes no sense i it's like yeah no people really
care more about this than anything it's it's just it's not even even if it logically makes sense it's
just boring as hell i'm like well okay it's the least thrilling movie well and other ships around
well people go on it felt like the right rhythm
uh hey lead i don't remember the death star battles in six and four they were like oh i
don't remember that did that happen gee i mean the the sentence itself will be supported by
the following sentence which is there were like hundreds of tie fighters a new hope is at least
20 to 30 also vader had an escort maybe maybe it's leading up to the hundred in episode nine
there has to be a progression that's a that's a one where it's just like let's just
you agree right it's dumb that they would say so few tie fighters i don't think it's dumb but
yes that is something you could be bothered by and i wouldn't think you're nuts yeah all right
been efapping since bill bobaggins wolf still waiting for a man to come on molly and my favorite
youtube have been introducing your content with my friends happy efap to us all happy efap good sir
this whole movie wasn't intended so let's ignore it wasn't intended luke's projection needed
foreshadowing like a naruto teleport when ray hits him it's okay for villains to pull powers
out of their ass but not heroes i don't think it's a line where they said right no i mean there
was that one line where kylo said you couldn't be doing this it would kill you to ray i think that
was enough um that's that's just that's it combines to it's a bit weird though because it's like
that's snoke putting their two wields together sort of to have them talk it's not like
well maybe from luke's perspective he was still i don't know yeah sure it's not like there's no
sorry connecting ray and kylo yeah we've had it and out here
here wait what do you say sorry look out for me and why is ray why was snoke connecting ray
and kylo to get wanted to test him he wanted to see who was going to turn was kylo going to be
the bitch and go with ray or was ray gonna get corrupted by kylo and be his new apprentice i
thought he explicitly said it was to convince ray that kylo could be saved and to bring it here
yeah he was just testing to both of them there he wanted her to be his new apprentice and when
she wasn't down he's like all right kill her no he said kill her from the beginning yeah
he was always planning on killing her yeah it was it was all just to test kylo well no
it was to get the location of luke skywalker remember that's the first thing he does he
forces out of it change they pile on the reasons oh wait why could he changes his reasons i don't
know yeah oh could be both well remember if you remember um the like when he says we have to
complete kylo's trading it's like epic as fucking tfa and then it turns out all the that was silly
what are you silly dark side trading really he's like we have to come to the base and meet me with
kylo ren like all right dude he wants to complete dark i i don't know man i am we haven't seen it
once in the hollywood movies seeing a sith master teacher sith apprentice or whatever they are dark
side users that's a good point that's a good point i want to see how how they justify their position
how they consider it to be the best position we've seen a bit of it in the prequels with duku and
shit but uh yeah no that'd be cool yeah uh ray should have fallen to the dark side while kylo
returned to being a jedi i mean i'd watch that story i just wanted to be well written that's all
if that's what very un-disney like yeah it may make it work uh possibly believable
po was too perfect and ray isn't explain this oh yes you said the po was too uh too perfect
ray has a lot of flaws i mean she makes this terrible mistake of getting involved with kylo
i mean that's not perfect she believes in people too much what a horrible flaw she has such a she
has well she she might be believing in the wrong person she might be believing in a guy who really
is just not redeemable that's a flaw we don't know if he's redeemable or not how about the fact that
she put all of the stock in kylo and luke and not herself she has like a confidence problem
i think she just she went herself to do it i'm pretty sure she's confident yeah yeah i mean
yeah i mean she doesn't have that many flaws you're right she's very i wouldn't say that any of those
two are flaws all right well the whole thing with ray being like a strong woman it's just
you know she grew up in jack who she lived by herself okay well i wouldn't go that far
you know she she grew up on this planet by herself i i just assumed all right we know she
could fight we've seen her fight these other scavengers um and then you just got the fact
that she's the hero like she can't we can't see her lose so it's just she has to be the most
powerful i don't know because it's not because remember i go see a movie i'm like if the
younger girls would even inspire i'll scream uh someone said it'd be inspired by people failing
isn't that the whole point yes well she failed enough she did enough what do you mean
i don't know it was sad a couple times it might have just been her face we don't know
the black hawk down they shared the plans like yeah in normal movies commanders will allow their
their teams to actually feel like there is some semblance of hope i love they address that in the
movie like they he highlights to her that give us hope and then she just gives him an analogy
about hope it's the most bizarre fucking response just like excuse me he like already knows it
poe really got uh poe really got the shit out of the stick but then again the moment where he
leads everyone and laius has follow him it's such a fun moment i mean you really feel like this guy
learned something he's a better leader now i don't know what he learned to escape to save
people escape to not fight yeah fin wanted to help luke didn't do that after he destroyed the
dreadnought in the opening scene he escaped yeah yeah but this was like there this was like the
moment where he learned like okay i'm gonna say the quote that haldo said i'm gonna do what she
did let's let's escape through the back and not fight with luke he didn't have anything to fight
i could see what they were going for but it just doesn't make sense yeah i don't know i love that
whole ending man it just doesn't that scene when fin is like you know given his little speech and
the the force theme plays underneath like it really feels like the two trilogies are melding together
you know i i love what you got i know it's i know it's just a music cue but i mean really
a lot of times these subtle little things are what make it feel like star wars i mean
to me just hearing c3po's voice is like the ultimate star wars thing ever
there's little just sound effects that that make it feel like it relates or you know
i don't know it could be what whatever makes you like star wars some people like
c3po's and people like the star the lightsabers you know there's so much to like in this series
and this film is just packed with it but you know and you should write reviews for uh
say you know all those places reviews for what places reading the critical reviews again
it's just packed with so much packed bro it's packed originals it's like a pack of sigs
it's so inspiring um and it's major lee would rec bench appear at an argument very true esap
you really think that i'm i'm honored that you think that because he is apparently like the
ultimate debater but i really don't see i think they're goofing on you i think i think it's a
goof yeah no i was gonna say there's no way they think that yeah i don't mean they do no 90 of his
arguments up dude and yeah so what yeah he's he's he's implying it's like it's not something that
he cares about some of this is a warning for death for me yeah yeah uh po killed the entire
resistance by being a whiny by being a whiny and sending fin on a mission which resulted in holder's
plan being exposed by dj po can't be trusted doesn't follow what his holder did nothing wrong
oh that's i think i think we talked extensively about that yeah we've given that argument some
time um in your thana's video you said we have to look at the events from the character's
perspective in that case po made a mistake by bombing the big ship too as everyone in
the story believes it you've just said something that doesn't make sense so from po's perspective
he made the right choice from all the other characters perspectives he made the wrong choice
that that's in line with what i said about thanos uh i miss the not so great debate guy can you
replace lee with him please he was so much better at no he was i think lee was better than that guy
uh go get yourselves a couple of rounds of rhino milk it's on me boys afterwards you go look at
werman of course i know was it a rhino i didn't i didn't get that oh that's that's that's the core
efap meme right there don't worry about that uh gotcha kyle killed his father this neka deserves to
die just saying it's good doesn't make it good it was a wrong kind of fan service luke blowing up
8080s would have been better fan service i don't i didn't necessarily want that myself there you go
not everybody agrees with that well this is the thing right i'm curious what your take on is on
this so a lot of people say like oh fuck what did you want him flinging around destroy them all and
then someone's like okay what about he holds all of the uh the blast and then fires them all back
into themselves and blows all the heads up and i was just like what about they all blast he holds
them all and then just dissipates them yeah that'd been cool it just you know doesn't have to destroy
everything it shows like 100 shield or something so okay let me ask you this if he did that let's
say he deflected lasers what would happen after that would kylo get killed by him because if he
can do that well we just gotta be able to fight where he could spare kylo or he could allow kylo
to murder him and for whatever reason so you would so you would have preferred if like kylo
actually killed him or no i would have hadn't cut kylo's arm off make him so he lets so he like kind
of bitch smacks kylo makes him his bitch and then what escapes with the resistance and kylo
is just sitting there like in time out long time out he's been seriously wounded and been given
fight he like cuts his face off or something no that's a vital bit i just think it doesn't go
in line with the mistake he made he he made a mistake he hurt this this poor kid and he's
just trying to do what's right i mean it really is what he openly said that he didn't want his
forgiveness it's the um it's a reference to what he said that when the sun goes down he goes bad
that literally happened in the force awakens it was it was imagery it was a symbol but it you know
vampire kylo bed well kyl bed so yeah i wasn't saying that was a literal thing but yeah it's a
meme it's fine that it's beautiful also seeing that i think as well uh yeah where are we
but but slice and dice that piece of junk out of the sky this whole argument can be summed up with
why if i say hello or are you kidding after my point does it make my argument more valid
oh i did that like once ray shot three ties down like walter white through pizza
yo that was fucking awesome when he landed that pizza throw in one take
thanos stabs i am at an infinity war major lee slice and dice hell yeah ice and dice mola please
put it all makes sense in the april fools video my dude also i'm loving this efaps stimulation
that's what i need after work oi vey also major lee won because the sheer sophistry destroyed my
brain there you go lee please uh as a proud australian i hereby grant rags the m-word pass
yeah i give him two i'm i'm from i get the n-word pass oh the n-word as a brit rags has got
permission from me to say mate oh mate oh i feel so good to get off the chest
oh you could call me mate it's just the time that you dropped that word it was a little
it felt a little condescending but it's okay ray low seems what ryan johnson was going for
i i'm apparently that's not unanimous but yeah some people think so rags hates this so much you
can hear the vitriol i love the show wait we were supposed to be responding to a video was it just
the debate it was gonna be a video but it just evolved no more video we don't need we don't need
videos yeah we got plenty of stuff the last time a major jedi character fell in love 98 of the order
was wiped out yeah yeah that's true you know these things happen wait so what if you think about it
there really is not much else you can do that like honors the original theme of you know anakin
and padme being the driving force that turned him into darth vader maybe ray is going to be the force
that makes him insane amount of things that you could do you have this huge universe and all of
this creative freedom at your disposal all of the money and time and writers that you could possibly
access yeah but i think this was pretty damn good considering how bad it could have been
absolutely awful i would think a solo i'd take oh it's terrible too i'd roll the die take anything
else so you're not feeling any of the new disney films right that's your opinion um rogue one was
none of i don't think any of them are good rogue one was the best but it's still me
rogue one is my favorite because it fucks with the other ones the least you see i have a lot more
respect for people that just hate all of them more so than someone who would say like oh solo
was better than tlj it's like dude put the crack crack i think solo was better than the last jedi
yeah it's done better than the last jedi but they're still it's not setting the bar high
well yeah see i don't know about that but okay you know i don't care that much although at least
all the characters i understood their motivations and okay paid logical decision i mean it was it was
a safer movie than last jedi that's for sure it made sense if that's what you mean it was a
classically structured movie from lauren's cancer so you didn't find as many like plot holes in it
then in solo oh not really i don't think i can't think of any off the top of my head oh i mean it
has its selection sure but um i just think that it structurally functions a hell of a lot better
than tlj because uh tlj is just built on the shoddiest of foundations that whole chase none of
it like i hate to say it's just none of it makes any fucking sense from the get-go and then
everything that develops doesn't make sense it's just um it's it's like the least movie movie
there is in terms of uh going from event to event it to me always seemed like they just had loads
of payoffs they wanted and then they were like how do we string this together because a chase
i mean yeah no you're not wrong it's just again there's just so many people that really don't
care about any of that but that doesn't matter we're talking about the like the qualities of
the movie and how they're consistent with their own rules so every time you say but other people
like it that's an entirely different discussion that has nothing to do with the points no i'm
just saying that doesn't mean it is definitively bad you have to just be like i got bothered by
this we've explained why objective was bad so whether people liked it or not it doesn't matter
that's a separate discussion you're ignoring you're ignoring a lot of opinions that love
no opinion that's the point opinions don't matter we're not looking at this we're talking about
entertainment this is like no this is entertainment we're talking about the objective quality of the
plot structure and it's some people think adam levine is good i think he's the worst thing to
ever happen to music but am i going to say that his music is definitively bad just because i think
it's fucking trite and garbage no no no that's a that's a terrible analogy i'm just saying if
people love something it's not objectively bad we didn't that those are completely unrelated
things whether people like something or not has nothing to do with this objectivity all right
it's all good i mean like don't that's how definitions work is the confusion here do
you think we're saying objectively nobody likes it when we say that or i mean i i feel like that's
kind of what you're saying maybe not on purpose but yeah by saying that it is definitively a bad
film because this is a plot hole and it bothered me it's still not bad whether it bothers us doesn't
matter no no don't tack that on at the end it doesn't matter it does we're talking about
whether it bothers us or not doesn't matter wait so to give you an example lee maybe this will help
you the disappearing knife i never noticed that like for ages i had to be shown it eventually
like a few months later that was always a problem whether or not i noticed or cared about it
i mean the the the fuel thing that you guys are talking about is way more of a thing than that
knife disappearing that's not my point my point is whether or not i care about it however i feel
about it has nothing to do with it being an issue that's exactly what i'm saying i mean
i'm not saying the movie is definitely good because people love it i mean i acknowledge
that it's bad to people but we can point out individual aspects and we could show and demonstrate
that objectively therefore yeah but you know it has nothing to do with how we feel about it
do you know what objectivity is yeah but yeah okay i mean it kind of does though but i hear
what you're saying no no no it literally doesn't but it does because i don't feel what you're
feeling no no no forget feelings it's not about feelings stop talking about opinion
watching a film no it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what we feel that it's about i asked if
you knew what objectivity is and you went straight back to feelings okay do you know what objectivity
is yes can you define it for me it is when you have an opinion that is no it is something that
no you fucked up try again i don't know what's your definition of it it's not mine
right just do it just just just give him what you heard you guys like you guys love like
fighting people over objectivity and subjective i've heard these arguments before then then you
should be able to define why is this such a thing that you guys have have to always argue with people
about we don't always what is objectivity yes it's something that is not influenced by feelings i
know what it means there we go okay but it's still a feeling if something isn't bothering someone and
it's bothering you that's feeling no we just went over how there's issues that didn't bother me
they are still issues but to say that the film is bad it's like what all those critics just
lying they didn't like it we're talking about specific things in the film the disappearing
no it doesn't have to bother us it doesn't matter if it bothered us or not we are talking about
the objective quality you love that word but like what even does it's like what did you just say
were you about to say what does that mean but you defined it you know i know yeah i know what it
means but like i don't get what you're what point you're trying to make though objectively that is a
flaw in the film well the knife thing yeah of course it is i admitted that it's a mistake
that's that's all we've been saying but the fuel thing is one of these things that it's like
that was intended and it's just you know that that is your opinion that that is a big flaw
it just is but a lot of people don't give a shit the knife isn't anyone can no one can deny that
that's not a mistake yeah it's that's that's not why it's a mistake that no one can deny it
you understand right like if someone said i deny the sun exists that doesn't mean the sun no longer
exists objective no i'm just saying that is like obviously an accident that knife thing right so
so there is that's objectively an error yeah that is that that's it we've done it that's it
that's all we wanted that's it but all i wanted to say is that's not that's not similar as the fuel
thing but whatever that's in your opinion it is as important so that's your opinion
and that's fine dude i don't i don't hate you for that just say in my opinion this is as bad as the
knife thing well we were talking about how bad the knife is compared to how bad yeah we thought you
were i'm sorry i thought you were i thought someone said that okay my bad thought i thought
that was the point you made i'm okay i'd have to look back on how everything just went but i'm
almost i could have sworn someone you disagreed hardcore with the objective thing but now it
seems like you're on board with it what do you mean i disagreed with the objective you were like
you can't be objective it's not possible i thought you were saying that the film is objectively bad
because of these plot holes and not all of them are equally bad so you can't say like okay this
is the thing that made the film bad that's your opinion so many people have different reasons for
hating this film i guarantee you there are people that don't give a fuck about those plot holes but
hate the movie for other reasons do you think the quality is defined by how much someone enjoys it
i hate to say it but kind of yeah we're talking about entertainment i mean there are movies that
are terrible that people love and you can't say they're bad because people get enjoyment out of
them why would you make that distinction that they're terrible yet people love them because
okay so if it depends on the genre because something like this it's it's different than
critiquing like a four quadra you know this is a family film and it's meant for all these
different people around the world i'm sorry it is so there are things we disagree with that
i like the accusatory tone no there are people that are probably not you guys that may be
listening to this most people whatever yes who would hate the fact that this is becoming like
this diverse evolved inclusive thing oh no this is a reason why people hate it okay there you go so
that's something that you could argue is a flaw but that's also something that some people fucking
love about it and empowers them okay is the room objectively good or bad okay if you're
gonna use the room as like think of a different movie dude come on that's the question this
you know how many comments i've gotten on my video are you like the room it's like dude
get another movie yes the room is bad we all know okay all right well so you can
is that objectively bad so the room is objectively bad well if you're asking me is it like just
worthless no people let you know i didn't say that it's not that's they didn't say that dude
you got to use it different objectively bad you're riding this objective thing like it's
like it's the question is the room objectively bad if you are talking about like film craft and
acting yeah yeah it has blatant fuck ups yeah it's like oh it's entertaining yeah but it's
entertainment that gives people a lot of people love a lot of quality do you see how your position
is untenable i'm saying you have to make the distinction between like this kind of bad and
that kind of bad nothing is black and white like you guys just want to be like okay this is a bad
film you you admitted that you like stuff in the last jedi right so you have to at least say
it is not a fully bad film no but we're saying that whether or not we like something really bad
would be if everything was bad to me like fully bad is when every single thing sucks
and you know every single thing in the room is bad arguably yeah i would disagree with that
i disagree with it too i like when they rate movies you know critics and it goes from a lot
of people only bad decided that that's like the worst movie ever made so i don't care about them
i'm just saying what people are saying i don't care what other people are saying
the point is and i like the you use the word craft in there at one point lee so um
storytelling or story writing is a craft oh yeah so we're let's let's boil this down as far as we
can see if we can well i don't know if you'll agree with this anyway but let's just say would
it be theoretically possible for a movie constructed of a story to be definitively uh of bad craft
in terms of writing yes if yes absolutely if the writing has no dramatic effect and the audience
is really not invested so what the craft's efficiency will be determined by the audience's
reaction hold on are we talking about the the writing only writing only okay there is plenty
of ways to have bad writing i know a lot of people say this movie is bad writing and yeah
if you're talking about like the plot holes yeah you could say that could be better but there's
also so much stuff in this movie that is genuinely impressively written i mean just the fact that
they were able to make a movie that not only is a totally fitting sequel to force awakens it works
as a sequel it also is a sequel to well okay but i people think that so i don't care what people
think stop mentioning what people think we don't care what i don't think then why am i on your show
dude because that's why you're here not those people we don't care about those people so we
can always find somebody who thinks something it doesn't matter so you only care about what i think
about and not other people yes that's why i didn't know i was the center of the ocean well you're the
you're one of the two you're here dude i i don't think that my opinion is the only one that matters
i i'm as you could tell i'm referencing a lot of people all right well it doesn't what other people
think it pops up all the time oh yeah well some people think that it doesn't matter you could
always find somebody who thinks something it's strange that you a connector you you you acknowledge
the craft but then you seem to judge the degree of quality by how much people enjoy no no no i'm
talking about a general term here so like you take a carpenter who's trying to just create an
accurate what you're saying structurally sound uh smooth chair complete with all of the greatest
joints and then everyone in the world hates it that does not mean it's a bad chair by the standard
set in the craft it would okay i think i think what i was trying to say was that when you're
writing really the most important thing is to just make the audience care to make you want to see
more and in in that sense this movie succeeded i mean you got to at least admit that you were
because i didn't i don't care so i don't know that there's a movie that exists that if everyone
watched it everyone says they don't care about it dude this i mean you're right now you're okay
fair enough but that's what i'm saying is that that standard is ridiculous i don't understand
yeah it's it's supposed to be a standard it's you're doing it by whether or not people care
well that's what percentage of people have to care for it to be when you when you write a script
you can't just say oh this character did this you have to establish why are we caring about
this person no a script can literally do that yeah but it's not as effective people won't be as
invested depends on how solid the it depends on how solid it is what are you saying you're saying
the movie doesn't need to make you care so like you'd agree that a story is defined by a progression
of events right that's how we go you go a b c d e f g so like that's the reason we don't go from
luke sitting with his aunt and uncle and then cut to him fighting vader who's like well you got the
payoff for his that's his complete arctic yeah but we didn't get the progression we don't know how he
got there so um the what we're tackling is all of the continuity all the problems we have so
continuity in in character in the uh comparison of the theme applying to the narrative the
what the film tells us this is what we see and all of the law and everything that came before
all of them can be considered continuity issues because that's what storytelling is
so you think this film did more telling than showing that's what you're saying i'm saying
it fails continuity on most significant levels it fails to tell a story within the standard
of storytelling it's a badly written film but i understand that it works this is gonna go on for
forever so it is because i'm just gonna repeat myself i'm just gonna say no it's fine you no no
here's here this last time well this last time i'll say this i i won't i won't this will be my
last word you think that the continuity is bad and the story doesn't grip you and all that stuff
you're not wrong for feeling that way you're not gripped by it okay but so many people are that's
it i'm done i won't i won't repeat it i'm the final word i will see before we move on together
the rest of super chats um when you acknowledge the continuity errors like the fuel like the
whatever else just acknowledging their existence then we've agreed we're done objectively
subjectively how much it bothers you is completely up to all of us individually
objectively poor subjectively could be incredible
yeah i mean it's that's what rags is talking about when he says objectively i hear it i feel
it it's just you know you you gotta give a little more credit to the fact that this isn't
the only this isn't the consensus of everyone who saw the film i don't have to give any credit to
that that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine we've not said anything that would contradict
that that's fine all right anyway gotta give credit gotta give credit so uh uh akhan said
wait so what was hans motive in esb i'm not sure what he's referencing exactly esb i don't know
empire strikes back his main motive is escape in that movie is most of it yeah and away from the
empire i mean they were one ship they didn't even have a choice um i still feel bad reading stuff
like this this guy is so full of shit sorry guys can't keep watching see you next week so
i hate to make you lose a viewer it's it's fine uh this guy is writing 50 shades of dark side as
we speak hopefully disney didn't have the option of a palpable sexual tension tension between kylo
and rail virtually any character in my opinion too mature possibly ask fin about wait ask about fin
not knowing about hyperspace tracker then knowing about it he was a janitor on star killer on the
supremacy yeah i've heard that argument it's i was gonna say well i would do our best to actually
like wrap up so i'm just gonna try and shoot through these now uh how would you objectively
criticize level design that's a whole topic can't really get into it right now uh the inside of the
falcon is like jared's door beautiful uh short art and good luke is better in the sequel trilogy
get out lee you're a joke i now have cancer thanks to this podcast major lee gave me cancer
mark hamill himself thinks that luke wasn't really luke in the last jedi because he plays the
character of course he's gonna have like dude mark hamill and andy circus 100 percent
understandable why they weren't nuts about their characters dying they play them the only person
that was happy about his character dying that's not the reason he had a problem the reason i'm
just saying it's understandable that he didn't like the risky direction that his character was
taking it he thought it was going to be easy and giving the fans what they expected i get it he's
not wrong i don't have a problem saying it would be easy it it would be though that would be lazy
it's been 30 years meeting fans and finding out what they like about luke skywalker and then some
guy came in threw it out i don't see how that would be easy apparently it's very difficult
because they didn't do it no no i don't i don't agree major lee's defense the last jedi the longest
meme in history lee i'm a film major i specialize in script writing directing the last jedi is
objectively bad you you type of people make me not want to try my best to make a well-written
and directed story not let me discourage you dude i'm nobody like please take it take this
less seriously lowered so much who the fuck am i like don't let me affect your writing or whatever
you do um is this stream still on when i saw the notification i was fighting with the highwayman
close to prosperity in fcnd what's that car cry new don oh molar rags veto shut up don't you know
that nothing is true of course make sure you read this i knew that tell lee to f himself wow
that's thank you love you too friend yourself lee friend yourself go friend yourself three hours
have gone by and no videos have been reviewed well it's gonna this is this will be the first
efap where that's happened i think right next time yeah reviewing a big video called the last jedi
um that response at the end from lee has earned my respect from literally only watching the efap
that focused on him way better than eric jack and quinton of course i heard a lot of you're not
wrong and i'm not going to argue that from the guy who's super happy about looking at women
yep yeah what's wrong with that tell me what's wrong with that i i'm not getting the flaw in
that statement or anything like that i gained a lot more respect for lee after this and if i was
on board with your film critique style i would certainly be subscribed love the stream nice
fallout video veto thank you thank you oh for vito i'm okay i made a fallout video it's it's a
meme oh okay that's great my fallout video that's i think it's a meme jesus there's so many efap is
including myself is you should see the efap memes uh thank you for coming oddly oh there you go
nine is co-written by bvs guy with jj yeah there's terry oh yeah even dc's worst animated movie is
better than most of the live action stuff well i saw flashpoint paradox i really liked it uh what
do you guys think of man of steel and bvs you should do an efap on twin prefix why you're wrong
about mos and you're wrong about bvs and make a couple of good arguments and a bunch of crap ones
i um don't watch vetoes what killed the dceu there you go that'll be the character we might
check out something like that at some point um we've got loads of things planned for efap honestly
even the name of my video it's no who killed the dc extended universe go watch it you're gonna love
it six times isn't brennan frazier gonna be in a dc movie i don't know he's gonna be a doom patrol
on tv it's gonna be a one of those dc they have their own streaming channel now yeah good because
last time he plays a robot man so you don't even see brennan frazier you just see a robot oh well
you get his voice i guess uh six times watching plot holes efap genuinely not bored oh there you
go last efap wolf said he had it pre-ordered on on stream before they took it off don't worry
he has a metro oh yeah he does have it i just don't know if he's played it yet did you talk
about kylo and ray mine bridge or carlos was in the cave and ray was in the millennium falcon
after snoke's death and the last jedi i think they're saying like how she we don't see her go
from thingy to thingy we just hear that she got into a uh snoke's escape are they saying that
oh right right right yeah yeah okay um how about the fact that kylo and ray were still connected
even after snoke got sliced that could mean either he's alive or that now they're connected for good
which is interesting yes episode nine will answer that question as someone who covered you lee i
appreciate you coming on efap you've got balls i lost more brain cells listening to you than
watching even jelly and you and a lot of respect from everyone though there you go i'm feeling it
coming to netflix baby rags is your mom is it the new version or the old one i don't know
old one rags is your mom's single no she's married to my dad um could have been like
she'd be like my mom's dad anyone get big jared vibes from lee creepy baggage um jared is that
like subway jared i'm assuming jared's another meme on this podcast i don't know i can't keep
track of his meme history with the show it's thick man this shit is dense you guys got lore
jugara is the best waifu you uncultured swine rags once said that jared is like water on tdp
so that begs the question is jared wet i'll give the definitive take on that right
i mean i i said that jared is a likewise he's very loose and he flows he's not like a rock
he's like a reed blowing in the wind there he is relaxed he goes with the flow he follows his own
path kathleen kennedy is actually responsible for indiana jones land before time back to future
bringing the ghibli films to us it's a shame she tied herself to this right herself tired herself
to this yeah i have no idea what she's specifically responsible for i don't
know how much influence she truly had on everything you know who the fuck knows
uh air can be humid but can it be cold wet rags another one for you all right yeah yeah there you
go uh fapping to efap my proudest fap beautiful color isn't real little babies that haven't
heard about chromaticity of black body radiation plankian slash black body locus and wavelengths
prove it i'm assuming he means they prove color i don't know oh no no color isn't real for adults
either uh love you guys okay you got leon here i'm impressed young mauler well he wanted to come on
and we're always uh we're always okay with someone who's been covered to just jump on if they want to
more money for sla nash i know rags and wolf we should hear him it together
yeah we've never mentioned before right um it's been it's been one week since you looked at me
slash cocked your head to the side and i'm angry five days since you laughed at me oh wait is this
lyrics um i think do you cock your head up people is that like a thing you do i mean i don't think so
one week that shows that one week stand powers greater than force powers change my mind
what are stand powers like a superfan like a stan i don't know is that what i am am i a stan
is that what they're saying i have no idea um khaki ion did you lay this egg
okay all hail efap yeah lee there wasn't a consensus about anything going on on that island
good there shouldn't be i'm glad
that's the thing right the conversation was about what do we think of where they took it
i was just saying people were expecting him to be reading books and training and yeah
good that shouldn't be the consensus i'm glad good to hear uh maybe jar jar wasn't the key to
all of this funny how q at drive yards the largest producer of capital ships in the galaxy made all
the first order star destroyers without the republic noticing yeah this is a serious question
for veto what kind of sound what kind of sounds of satisfaction would you make if i were to feed
you ice cream sandwiches and tickling your belly button while sucking your toes it'd be horrendous
and not not suitable for human ears give me a call later and uh you'll hear some squealing some
shrieking uh groaning mauler mauler rags i need your help claustrophobic is my game attack
it's a play on my old last name i just changed my name to williamson i need your help thinking
of a new game attack so that's no that's no small feat i take i take names seriously especially
when i create them for me so except from mine of course it was claustrophobic and it went to
williamson i don't really those two things like i don't um what's a cool online name that no one
has yet guys um i'm not sure we might have to get back to him on that i don't want to just spit
out an answer pimple popper 69 i mean yeah they're welcome to use that if they'd like to you know
probably accurate majorly you have no clue what star trek is and what it's about
fair enough uh to rephrase the question why did luke decide to abandon everything on account of
something that was going to happen anyway and not caused directly by him it seems snow created
kylo more so than luke he feels responsible you know he really is now he is what's motivating
snoke snoke is trying to find luke and you know get him get rid of him i'm sure he feels responsible
for it my issue is just we have no substantive background of it all i have no idea what the hell
happened and it'll be interesting if nine it wants to nine could do so many different things uh
yeah it'd be pretty tough for it to be strong i would say uh corny does not equal stupid i mean
to tie some old-fashioned sentimental majorly stop using stupid as a synonym for corny stop
murdering english in front of the englishmen did i say stupid ever i don't even remember saying
i'm sure we won't say that at some point tonight i feel like stupid i don't know if that ever came
out of my mouth honestly i love the room does that mean the room is objectively good no it
doesn't saying the movie is objectively good is like saying the earth is flat
well well ringing up the room is like objectively bad emotional response is irrelevant to objective
quality molly you like making poo yes gotta ask why doesn't eric and jack like rags are they
homophobic i don't know we never we never really knew for sure what it was that they had against
rags specifically uh because the thing is they never met him as far as i know uh art is about
emotional reaction however that says nothing about skill and craft behind it a less skilled artist
can draw something i like over a good one i mean this is the thing if you get into any craft
you'll have all of the the artists in the craft having a series of standards and and requirements
and ways to improve right all these things like stories aren't just anything like i think
someone i think was left foot media on twitter said something like um three men walk into a bar
seven women leave and then the apple rolls down the hill and the explosion killed 17 people you're
like explosion from what you used to be like the only way that story makes sense is if we get a
reveal later that all of that was some like fucking acid dream from some guy uh right so like you know
if you if that's all you had that selection could you call that a story i'd be like probably not not
not a story at all uh so it implies there are standards what we actually hold for uh
what constitutes a thing and what doesn't and then the degree to which it can achieve it so
but uh stan powers are from jojo's bizarre adventure from party album cv so that is the
last super chat thank you all very much incredibly generous um and and and kind of you all i know
that we didn't do any memes this time around but uh the next efap we will definitely do them we've
got some great ones on the way you got one long meme you got me i i guess uh if you guys want to
