for about five until we got a couple of people in okay you guys excited i'm very excited
i was born excited it's been like a week since we've actually done this a week how much can
happen in a week on the internet people can get banned from twitter you know stuff like
that can happen no nothing okay man youtube really wants me to watch this video called
why i don't like ninja because it's recommending it to me twice why are they not like ninja
ninja i don't know ninjas in general or like a show no like the twitch streamer oh yeah
what's wrong with ninja he seems like a nice guy i don't know but you seem like a nice guy riggs
yeah and then people get to know me and then what do they say i was right
beautiful really he's not like his twitter profile at all
venom and unbridled comedy when i mean venom isn't quite oh yeah so i didn't even get to
tell you guys venom is like a full-on horror movie at the beginning like creepy music and
like this enemy that like stabs the shit out of people and like puts its tendrils on their face
and they're like and kills them and they have like a broken leg with a bone sticking out and
it like reconnects back like all this gross stuff and he's like oh and like they're walking toward
like like a zombie they think of like you know the scary sort of enemies they're just
fucking walking as deadline because they're just like zombie faced but not zombie walking
sort of like determining like oh god and then it's like what doing this now doing this
eddie brock stop being a pussy and start eating people and he's like oh man i don't want to do
that and like falling over and hitting people in the mean so you're just like hmm bit strange
and there's like this rigmarole with an ex-girlfriend and a doctor who want to help eddie
by taking him into the hospital and getting scans and there's like funny shit that happens there
and there's a dog who's like annoying and you're just sitting there like whoa and it cuts back to
this horrifying creepy monster person who's still like stabbing people and slowly getting towards
you just like what am i it's confusing so yeah that's what people mean when they're talking about
like the tonal mess i'm not sure a lot of people are saying that tom hardy uh was the problem as
in like he's playing the character really funny while the film itself isn't i'm not sure where
they're coming from with that because it's like he's not the only one making jokes i should put
it that way but uh i'd have to watch it again but yeah i've told people like i don't have any passion
to actually cover it i i came out of the the cinema just like well that was a thing i guess
because venom at least like graphically eat someone in the movie well no every time he eats a head
it's framed so that you can see like just the top of their head and venom facing the camera and then
he like bites towards the camera and then it cuts to him like holding a headless corpse and you're
like okay oh that's fucking lame it is but he does eat like three people's heads i think
that so that you know you can't he's a sub-satisfaction it's venom known for eating
heads i've never actually i've never seen anything with venom in it before that's the thing i haven't
read comics all i mean i saw spiderman 3 but i don't think anybody's going to be saying that
that's a uh a great interpretation of venom um that's the other thing a lot of people are asking
is it better or worse than spiderman 3 and i was just like uh how can it be well well i can't say
that anymore i was about to say how can it be worse than spiderman 3 but then i realized
half the movies of this year are worse than spiderman 3 i was gonna say i feel like i
for whatever this is worth i would rather watch spiderman 3 than venom right now at least
spiderman 3 has like a couple good scenes yeah yeah i'd agree with that venom is best comedy
of the year i don't know the predator is quite good competition for that um deadpool 2 plus an
actual comedy like yeah uh but yeah so venom not very good but also not bad enough that i
felt like i needed to do a video at all because there's kind of some stuff in there i thought was
amusing so much stuff that doesn't make sense though like the rules that they just throw out
the fucking window all the time but yes uh i wouldn't recommend anybody who likes venom from
the comics to go see this probably gonna be frustrating and they i shit you not dude there's
uh does anyone know who carnage is i'm vaguely aware of carnage so at the end of the film you
get the you get your first roll of credits and then there's like a scene and and uh eddie brock is
like okay dude you gotta stay quiet while i while i go here okay and then venom's like okay man
and they go in and it's like some guy who's like yeah he requested to speak to you of all
people i don't know why that that sort of thing it's very like silence of the lambs prison style
thing and he walks in and it's fucking um woody harrelson with like all this it's like a red
springy hair and he's like writing eddie's name in blood on the wall and it's so silly he just
goes like um you know eddie when i get released there's gonna be carnage that it cuts to the
credits and he's like oh so i guess that guy's carnage tune in for carnage it's such a like
oh you guys you guys want to be marveled don't you that's cute but uh yeah i have no idea how
venom's doing in terms of actual money or whatever but i seriously didn't even know it was out yet
so that should say a lot well i mean it's not like they needed this whole lady gaga thing going
on to try and like make it even worse but it looks like that there's this weird campaign where
loads of people are like badly rating venom to prop up the lady gaga movie that's coming out at
the same time oh like there's a few articles about this and it's like an actual thing where people
have been reviewing the film without seeing it and trying to push the lady gaga film instead
it's just like okay a bit strange um so yeah people do people realize that
one film doesn't have to do badly for another film to do well yes it does
talk about demographics like the people who are seeing venom this is the people who are
seeing the lady gaga film there's like yeah i'm sure everyone who watched venom is like a hardcore
lady gaga fan is the complete opposite groups of people but sure i mean you would you would think
that that would be like something marvel and star wars fans would do if star wars didn't you know
suck now not lady gaga and venom fans i mean yeah if it was like another superhero movie or whatever
be like oh that kind of makes sense but nope can you picture a single person you go go to the
cinema thinking i'm gonna i'm gonna watch the venom film and although uh you know it's a tough
choice now lady gaga's on the table you know so yeah if anybody was curious it's bad but i'm not
complaining to cover it um the next thing we should probably just probably have mentioned
i suppose you can say whatever you want about this wolf but um the design of wolf has lost his twitter
permanently yeah i i'm perma-banned it's so sad i what was the chicken uh it was a couple of
tweets i sent them to fringy let me bring them up real quick because they were super not bad tweets
they were actually like you'd think that they'd just be common sense um on twitter first yeah
yeah well the first one is uh are you shitting me ford was the one making the i should say
i was banned because i defended kavanagh there we go it'll be fun once he's confirmed and everyone
pisses and moans yeah so the first one is uh are you shitting me ford was the one making the
claims you retard she has the burden of proof not kavanagh you really expect him to disprove
claims you have no evidence for to prove them in the first place how dare you know the retards
called someone a retard that is fucked up dude i've called people worse i know you
on twitter too and then the second one was uh fuck off with demanding proof from the defendant
to disprove something that never happened in the first place so i said maybe due process is a good
thing and i got banned so there we go can't use twitter well there's your due process
yes well yeah i mean lesson lynn wolf you only say mundane things on twitter
that's what happens when you defend republicans on twitter someone even said in the chat uh wolf
are you hating on the jews again it's like no i hate it on the jews and they didn't ban me for that
i mean defending kavanagh like from what i understand of that story is um ridiculous did
you see there was a tweet that i think that would be a good way to yeah rags you responded to on
twitter where someone was like how do i tell my students that they're about to hire uh someone
like him as a justice or whatever and it's just like um tell them about due process like this is
a thing we need you can't just it's like god forbid we actually get to the point where it's
just people say a thing and then it's true like that's really bad there there is literally no
proof at all and her own witnesses are like this party never happened and it's like how is
this even a thing because believe women believe their vipers oh right i forgot about that yes
wolf is permanently off twitter you'll never find him on there ever again unless you decide to make
a new twitter yeah which i don't plan on doing because well at least not anytime soon because
i've genuinely been like a little happier without having to look at twitter all day
it's actually like weird i can actually like pretend things are normal i don't have to hear
about people uh losing their minds over something trump said oh yeah crazy a nice break for you um
and then the only other thing that we should probably mention is that the next efap which
just sounds so funny to keep saying is gonna be about uh the tro video we're finally gonna do that
it's been a while but different reasons stream on my channel man youtube's borked um yeah rise
can't seem to fix it so we're gonna do it as an efap now um which by the way for anybody who
actually doesn't know because we never really say it it stands for every frame of pause
just in case anybody hears the description you should put in description every frame of pause
episode that's that you know i i need to redo all the descriptions for all the older ones as well
i'm very lazy when it comes to my second channel because it's like my my tism channel so i like
not having to do things on it but yeah i'll definitely get around to that but that's what
it stands for some people but tism doesn't come easy so uh yes that'll be happening uh it'll
probably be the ridiculously longest one ever because the video is like an hour and 40 minutes
so 24 hour stream guys yeah we're doing it 24 hour stream for autism awareness which brings us
to the guest we have today the wonderful cinema sins sins also known hi i was gonna say your actual
human name but fine just just interrupt me dude god you make such a bad first impression yeah so
anyway how um how do you do sir i'm really good at bad first impressions um yeah uh yeah
see uh i'm i'm not gonna lie i'm a bit more hungover of this not quite than i'd like to be
but uh um i think i'm gonna have fun should be good good uh do you wanna i mean so for anybody
who's like completely unaware the last efap was it the last efap we did i think it was the one
before the last one we did movie bob after that one didn't we i think so yeah to the one that killed
me it was like a major headache uh so there was a i made my my video on black panther because i
really thought the film was terrible and uh uh cinema sins sins responds to it's not
just cinema sins right you've got like a whole bunch of different people you've been responding
to yeah and uh he decided to respond to mine which which i mean you know i'm all i'm all for
it but we weren't hugely impressed by it and um i think what is it you said you want to do now um
sort of make a video sort of giving your perspective on black panther in relation to my video is it
yeah uh i i i went and fucked it with the uh the first video it was essentially because i was on
a pretty tight time schedule which i've now just realized is the reason that the video was bad uh
so i'm not going to pressure myself to get videos out quickly anymore because fuck that it's uh it
made it made me make a bad video i hate being rushed for videos too whenever a new film comes
out i'm like well i bet i better get this done within a week and that's still considered
extremely late compared to like you know angry joe and jeremy johnson all people get it out like day
zero i had to rush to get my jurassic world 2 video out because you got yours out two weeks
before mine you say that wasn't my fault but because of the amount of fucking zephyr shit i
had to go through my video didn't come out until like normal time okay well yeah but i had to
fight with zephyr too for both videos um how how did that go with um
with zephyr anyway what whatever became of that exactly the meal they just dropped their claims
when i took uh rags when you emailed them i just uh even though i wasn't at 100k at that point i
just took the email address from youtube that you showed in your screenshot typed it in and even
though i didn't have 100k they still helped me and they looked at they uh went to zephyr and they
were like two and said you need to get with you know wolf here because he's getting fucked over
and you can't let you can't let these companies do that yeah so i contacted them and they sent me
an email uh telling me what they said to zephyr and they basically said um we don't really see
the legitimacy here can you uh uh clarify it and they never replied and then they just dropped
the claim and youtube reinstated my video so what happened for you mauler with your i kept reuploading
until i got past those stupid bots it finally worked apparently i was convinced there was
someone manually doing it but well it says if it's manual or not isn't it wasn't it one
it doesn't didn't it say no it's it's way it's way too fast to be manual well it might
only tell you not uh now i can't remember because you like fight well it says one manual well yeah
because it says if it's either automatic or if it is manual yeah yeah so what happened was i got
hit with the music one and then i messed with the music enough or at least what i thought was
enough and then i got hit again so then i took it out entirely and replaced it with the stupid like
flute vision and then i got hit for just visual content id on something from the cam vision i
was like okay so i removed that and then um like the second it was uploaded it was a manual claim
when there was only um screenshots i believe this could be wrong like i can't quite remember because
it was a while ago so then i got rid of every single part that had any kind of cam footage in
it just and tried to recreate visuals like for example when i said that um she gets away with
being a secret by putting a hat on like like they're in a place where if anyone spots them
they'd be in trouble and she just puts on a hat and you're like oh i guess that works and i just
like had a clip of a monkey putting on a hat instead because i was just like i don't know what
else i could do for this and i eventually got passed and it stayed passed that that was my
experience which is fucking annoying but uh with with wolf you would have had to have chopped up
the trailers to like nine seconds apiece and put them out of order i think in order to get past any
um bot claims i don't i never understand them taking down fucking trailers like
no that's it's really silly because if someone reuploads a trailer that literally benefits the
people that own the trailer does it not you'd think but i guess they think that wolf's channel
is trying to make money off reselling trailers i don't even have i didn't even monetize those
videos i didn't have monetized i didn't even get monetization to work until like a month ago
i've looked i've literally had a video takedown um because i've had a trailer playing at one
quarter speed in the background as i talk over it and i don't even use the whole thing
it's uh the bbc knows nothing about fair use but literally every content creator from like
you know zero subscribers to 100 billion like they all everyone deals with this
and it's all it ever is a game you're just trying to figure out how to out play the bots
but if you have manual takedowns you just fucked like you have to get like a partnership or
something um yes anyway in the bots that's the thing about the bots for youtube is like
they're wrong 98 of the time which makes you wonder well yeah because like they often don't
restate their claims and they'll often have youtube be like yeah that's not fair and you're
like yeah they're almost like almost all my videos are confirmed um to be to be good to go
but i mean like the the ones i lose are very rare you know it's not that they aren't monetized in
the end it's that you know 80 of the views come and go before it can get monetized again
it's annoying for all of us but uh yeah i was gonna say we can i figure we could begin with um
i i think black panther's almost like to the point of terrible where i i would put it in the
lowest tier i i think we re-watched it and i would say that it's like i have trouble choosing
between it thor the dark world and iron man 3 they're like my most hated mcu films um wolf what
was your take on it i can't remember well i when we watched it the second time i disliked it even
more than i did walking out of the theater and i'd say oh right yeah i'm right there with you i'd
also add hulk to that list oh yeah i haven't seen hulk in so long like i forgot what happens in the
film it's i don't blame you it's a really forgettable film and uh what about you rags
i haven't seen it from start to finish non-stop but i've seen a lot of clips a lot of clips and
things and what i've seen has not been very good and finally what about you jay i think it needs
more rhino milk uh you have to own the meme it's better that way but you i'm assuming you'd put it
in like high high rankings compared to other marvel films i really enjoy watching it i'm not
going to pretend it's flawless but i i think it's a really enjoyable watch i think i also think it's
like the room oh whoops i just sent you an invite by accident ignore that
but more like uh i sort of i i can overlook the things that i know are
pretty silly in it and just enjoy the story that's being told i quite enjoyed for for that
but it's it's not it's not uh a masterpiece i would say i mean there's there's definitely
good stuff in it in my opinion but there's uh there's some not so great stuff in there as well
so like what would you say is your biggest issue with it wolf
oh man where do i begin uh i just think it's really dumb
i i can't really narrow down one single issue because the writing is pretty terrible throughout
but there's just like some parts that are like okay that's dumb like the whole uh tribal fight
that's a bit of bad writing that contradicts the world built that world building in general is
horrendous but then there's other lines like kill mongers throw me in the ocean so i can
be with my ancestors that was yeah i don't know if you want to contend that but like most people
pointed out his ancestors oh wacandans wasn't his uh wasn't he half wacandans i'm not sure if i'm
getting all right i'm not oh right his his dad did uh data local as far as i know so technically
speaking i suppose his ancestors are everything with his hat with his half ancestors yeah all
black people are related to all black people well i mean you know that's that's actually beside
the point like because technically speaking we all came from one continent long ago we're all
african once you go far back far enough but so basically i can i can be in that movie and say
bury me in the ocean with my ancestors and it would be just as much beer and shit it's it's
awkward because of the fact that we this made very clear that his he's he's all of this is
motivated by what they did to his dad who's wacandans it's like wait wacandans yeah that's
another thing the wacandans referring to white people as colonizers when they you wacanda was
not colonized at all kind of kind of odd um i mean they must have seen uh they must have seen
it going on around them though right i guess uh which means that they never actually they chose
not to do anything and obviously that's a part of the film to be like they made this mistake for
for ages and ages which again that sort of comes back to the whole trial by combat stuff like i
i really have trouble believing that across the eons of wacandas since the stone age never had
a leader that wanted to spread out um because killmonger is apparently the first dude who
actually considers doing that but to an extreme obviously you see right i have no trouble with
the idea of them having like a tradition of that ceremony where they they they they take up then i
got they ask if anyone wants to challenge for the throne the the only real issue i have with that is
that when someone does challenge for the throne they take it completely seriously see i would
think it would be like i would understand them still having tradition if it wasn't sort of a
a law-based thing like i i i i'm i'm sure i'm sure that uh the queen still has like
ridiculous powers that if she's tried to use everyone would be like no why is that she she
probably she probably there's probably some things she can do that if she did we would be
like what the fuck and we just didn't know it was an actual rule that hadn't been abolished yet
that's probably true um but like the the idea that they they do it alone this there's there's
a lot of ways to break down that part of it that that just is so bizarre to me like uh
well i i'm trying to find a way to not sort of veer off into a different topic by accident
because i'm trying to stick to that whole trial by combat thing the he's retarded it's a little bit
it's it's it's like if you're gonna chew because because there's the theory right i think you said
in your response that um they have someone for the fight and then that doesn't necessarily mean
the person who fought becomes king that was what i thought when i watched it like that's not in the
movie but it's possible uh because my theory would typically be if you're gonna pick the person who's
the strongest and best suited to win a trial by combat they're probably typically not going to be
as suited to the lead in a calm and collected fashion let's put it that way uh i i find it
ridiculous that they never actually spread out as well it's but you know like i'd probably rather
refocus to the more important parts of the film because if you take that sort of fantasy and just
say it just works that way leave it alone you're like okay so what story did i tell and like my
biggest issue personally is probably Killmonger i think he he makes no sense in so many different
ways and it probably is amplified by the fact that he's adored online by a lot of people like
yeah that was a weird thing because i had uh i mentioned in a video when i was responding to
beauty players criticisms of the mcu or rather marvel in general but it was all mainly the mcu
um because if you took it and applied it to all marvel films it didn't really fit so uh
he was saying he was talking about how people idolize superheroes and that and he thinks it's
damaging because you can't actually get superpowers and he doesn't seem to think anything like he
seems to think that people just idolize superheroes for their superpowers and then they get gonna get
disappointed when they can't actually get them but that's a whole different thing didn't you find
interesting that he's like so hell-bent on basically being like let's provide weapons to
these people in these different parts of the world and then take over and it's like Killmonger is
aware of the avengers right yeah this won't be easy you're gonna get flattened by iron man
obviously uh several other people and yeah like that's that's one aspect i suppose i'd rather start
at the beginning which is um what is if you got an answer for what the secret is that everyone had to
keep why how do you mean so they're like we he's like why didn't you take the boy back and then he's
like um we had to maintain the lie yeah they had to maintain the lie what lie what are they talking
about i i assume they're talking about the the secrecy of waganda but i'm not really sure how it
how it fits well i was gonna say wouldn't they can't they just take the boy and then
i don't see how that would reveal the secret um we have a few people going what what what did
what did where did he go is that that's the part that stopped me in the cinema because as soon as
they as soon as that opening was shown i was just like oh i wonder what the conclusion of that scene
would have been and then obviously they reveal it as the film goes on and i and as soon as they
made the realization that they left the boy i was like why the hell did they leave the boy
let him find his dad executed on the floor i was like what why would why wouldn't they take the
corpse why wouldn't oh there's a lot of stuff here because this is don't they talk about like
how people are supposed to be given a proper burial at some point as well i i don't remember
i might be i might be mixing up two films who knows uh i can drop that the fact that they left
him there and then the entire reasoning behind it from both his dad and from forest wittaker is that
they had to maintain the lie they had to keep the secret and then to charlotte's like you were wrong
and it's like well yeah but like i agree with you but why did they do it what are they what were
they wrong about no see right if uh if you if they take him back to wakanda then people will go oh
this this boy's missing you know i bet there's a secret city somewhere in africa that's the
immediate place they jump to they're just like that's it i knew it um so yeah there's that part
of and that's what creates killmonger right so that's a huge issue for me but then if we if we
ignore that um killmonger's like disappearance for an hour in the film and we find out that
he's doing it all so that he can get claw kill him and deliver him to wakanda as a chip to get
in sort of thing that's that's what killmonger's doing from the beginning of the film to the end
let's say or at least uh to the middle so why didn't he do that to claw immediately why did he
allow him to get that weird bit of vibranium to then trade with thingy and he's not even involved
in any of that bit if you remember like the car chase and stuff like killmonger's just what is
what's killmonger waiting for because it's like he gets claw gets captured and that allows killmonger
to then kidnap him from them and take him but it's like you already had claw and then you let him go
on this crazy adventure and now you're taking him back to to go it's like why didn't you just do
that in the beginning i i don't know maybe just like uh smidge just what he was doing anyway
just what he was up to because he could have been killed if killmonger was killed by black panther
that would have no sorry not killmonger if if claw was killed by black panther in the car sequence
and then taken back to wakanda that would have screwed over killmonger's plan completely
see if i had to if i had to essentially write a scene for the movie like guess what is
going on i would say maybe maybe killmonger thinks that if he draws attention to claw before he kills
him that the wakandans will care more when they kill because it's like you know they've dealt
with claw in the past but if they make him like an immediate issue if they make him sort of a
headline and then he takes net and brings him to wakanda i mean maybe that's one thing you could
do but i would definitely have put killmonger in the car chase scene in some way to have him
trying to puppeteer it in some way uh because the other angle is that somehow killmonger knows
that there is a faction in wakanda that want claw dead more than anything like that the guy
from get out he's like he's desperate to get claw dead like okay how did killmonger know that first
of all and second of all it's like the if you would re-redone the film in a way that uh killmonger
was like right what i'm gonna do is set it up so that claw can be captured and then stop black
panther from being able to pull it off so it humiliates him in wakanda and then i come in
with the victory which i think would make more sense but like that doesn't happen at all
yeah see the thing is i like killmonger as a villain um but i like him more just because
of his presence rather than anything else i just think he can he he sort of carries the scenes he's
in do you do you like the swaying he was doing whenever he walked around i did not notice that
like picked on it with wolf yeah it's it's like he has to move his entire body from left to right
with every single step he takes a bit weird is this going to be one of the things where i go
back to watch the film and i can't unsee it maybe i certainly noticed it i don't wolf him but uh
yeah so there's those there's those elements that there's the um he was pretty lucky that
he wasn't killed on the doorstep of wakanda because they're very selective about that sort
of thing then he was lucky that tachala actually accepted the trial by combat when there was really
no benefit to him doing that it was a very strange choice i would like to just see the
other version of the movie where uh tachala says no and he goes oh fuck and that's the end yeah
that's that's right there's a lot of little things that could happen that would have done
that sort of thing and then there's um tachala losing to him despite using like you know uh the
the standardized weapons for their culture that tachala should be basically have been learning
about for his whole life which was a bit odd to me i understand that kilmongers they trained
whatever specialist person but you'd think that um he'd probably lose in in that environment
maybe maybe not that's not a huge issue compared but i mean everything we've already covered sort
of just destroys him as an element of a villain to me i'm just like yeah none of that makes any
sense he's just here because he's here and you know that's not even including the um his his
lines about being like if we gotta kill their children then we kill their children it's like
oh wow okay i mean that's where he's the villain right well of course that's that's a very
villainous things to say but obviously i i think i say in my video but it's just like why were
people saying that this guy is like the greatest villain in marvel mcu that's like such a cartoonish
thing to say we're like we're gonna destroy the entire doesn't he say we're gonna rule it right
and it's like you're gonna rule it right by killing all the corpses of children like good good luck
mate oh no that's that's truly that's just uh that's before you know kill everyone then start
ruling right yeah yeah we'll set our principles once we've killed all the other people um
but yeah i think that's probably my biggest issue with with black panther without covering more of
it is uh kill monger is probably one of the crappiest villains not because uh like i would
say because of inconsistencies and just like a fucking terrible implementation compared to there
are other villains who are like characterless but they're consistent in the if they're a cartoon
like um the dark elf from thore 2 he's like well i can't remember what his plan is he wants
to like destroy everything or whatever i can't remember anything about that entire film really
i can remember thore was on a train at one point and that was quite funny and that's about it
yes i believe that is a thing that happens i can't remember i actually watched that again
within the last month that i've already forgotten all of it just to get a refresh but
whatever it doesn't matter um he's like a crap villain but he's he's consistent from what i
remember he's he's just not very good he's like oh he's not very exciting let's put it that way
um see i i think kill monger was really exciting and i would take him over a sort of
much duller villain that makes perfect sense any day um i might agree with that like but i'd still
say like i'd still have to be honest and be like yeah it's still bad though like i'd probably maybe
i'd enjoy it more but um because like my point overall is that black panther is poorly written
like as much fun you can get out of it like yeah sure i i wouldn't stop anybody i personally was
really bored watching black panther and then thinking about it started to frustrate me that
was that was my personal experience well see the first time i watched it i did uh fall asleep
i have no comment on the film i was just incredibly sleep sleep deprived um but
you know maybe uh maybe there's something there you know i've
so i i did have to go and uh re-watch it to well i re-watch any film that i'm talking about but
i did specifically realize when i was halfway through it oh shit i haven't seen this part before
oh wow it was i fell asleep when i was first watching it right after the dollar died if you
skip the entire part with the car chase and the weird area where they trade the vibration stuff
i think the movie still makes enough sense you just have to you know fill in the part where
they capture claw and it probably would have been a bit more like do you remember the bit where
where the car gets exploded and like the girlfriend is on like the driver's seat and
it so slowly slides across the road in a very like looney tunes fashion yeah it's very odd
it's the kind of they were just like huh i was seeing that just kind of like thinking
someone somewhere made the decision that that should happen yeah but anyway uh if if if anyone
else has anything to say i was gonna say like we can watch uh someone's actual video on um
i guess explaining why black panther has the best marvel villain um we've covered captain
midnight before i've never been impressed with his videos but i've already seen what other videos
does he made the last one we did with him was he was defending Han Solo film he was saying that
it's not as bad as people are making it out to be it wasn't a great defense in fact we by the end
of it agreed with a lot of his points because he criticized the film do you remember that
no it's like one of the first e-faps or whatever but he basically like starts recognizing a bunch
of flaws with solo and he lifts them all around we were just like yep yep oh um let me see
was that the one where he like showed a picture of the two guys who were originally going to
make solo and then rags made a comment something to the effect of this looks like a younger
version of me or something i can't remember because i can remember every single word
that jerry genesis has ever spoken but i can't remember what video that you're referencing
i mean this i mean i don't know if that's indicative of the of the video but uh
let's just give this one a shot because i'm i haven't actually seen this video yet but i've
been we nearly watched this a couple of times just because i've always wanted to see a video
explaining how kill mong is awesome but uh here we go i guess
let me tell you a story okay it's about a young boy born into a royal family but raised in
poverty his father was murdered by his own brother the king of a secretive powerful nation
after being left behind he was trained as a great warrior vowing that one day he would return to his
homeland destroy the evil king that brutally killed his father and become king himself
finally letting the rest of the world share in the wealth and life-changing technology that
his uncle's family wow okay that's a really nice way of putting uh kill the entire world
take over look at the way he's done this little halo um yeah good guy he's just searching for
justice the way we i like the generalization right so it's like um he was left behind after
the evil king killed his dad sort of thing and it's like yeah but we have no reason for that
to happen and tachaka was actually a pretty good guy too from what we know in the mcu
this is a confusing thing that he did how dare you purple wash kill manga right here
yeah what the fuck i think he might have drawn these these things himself it's a nice little
where's his stupid little candle hair here's the thing here's the thing you can take any character
be they a villain or a hero and reduce them to the most basic possible explanation of their
character and say that in general it's good but their depiction is everything i'll see how long
it takes for you guys to see who i'm talking about but um it was uh let's let's say um an old
warrior who had seen no uh who had seen the stagnation of his government and saw to overthrow
a league of assassins who were actively destroying his beloved civilization after an attempt at a
murdering they attempted to assassinate him once they found out he was trying to bring
uh positivity to his to his people and thus he was able to they failed and he was able to
counter attack and erase them from history and thus starts is uh his his beautiful civilization
in exchange uh Bilbo Baggins i mean i was trying to remain vague but maybe oh someone in chat's
already guessed it a lot of people have that would be Palpatine it's um okay i can you can
describe anybody as rags just said like i mean you someone people it's just like Hitler i think
what i said but uh yeah if we just leave out certain bits it does sound like a nice little
story doesn't it like yeah again if you just talk if you just talk about the general then um
sheathed nothing wrong sheaved no it's just strange first name of the
sheave palpatine they had greedily kept secret this doesn't sound like the story of the villain
far from it in no it doesn't sound like the story of a villain because the way you just described
because you took out a whole lot of valuable concepts missed the bit where you threaten to
kill children but he is the villain black panther fact this has the structure of a classic hero's
journey the poor orphan boy going on an adventure to defeat a murder got an adventure to kill children
you can't you just you can't leave that bit out i'm sorry this is ridiculous
there is kind of a big deal mystical powers you know i genuinely think that they fucked up when
they put that line in black panther they should have had him say a speech without mentioning kids
because i feel like when they put it in kill the women and the children too and everyone's like
sounds good everyone on the council has like looks they're like oh shit what the fuck if they had
not had that bit and just had him say that we'll kill them if they deny us sort of thing that's
enough we're gonna say yeah that's a villain you don't need to be like by the way kids too it's
like oh all right maybe we should leave that women and the children too i i think it's as overt and
silly that a kid executes do you think children go like sand at least anakin felt some remorse
after doing it you have a kill bug and never actually killed any kids wolf okay he was well
he said he wanted to true but of course telling the story this way leaves out some very important
pieces of information yeah like the fact that our hero has killed countless people
and seems to really like it or that his final plan while admirable in some ways
well hey hitler was an admirable guy i said genuinely not even trying to be hyperbolic i
would like to ask him is could you look at hitler in any way and say some of the stuff he was doing
was admirable his paintings were nice well you like you like dogs he was nice to animals he was
trying to bring germany back to being a full power you could somehow twist it that way he was trying
to save his country from you know stagnation something like that white power public health
and safety um he continued the autobahn project and if he agrees with that actually like well
at that point you just don't even need to don't even bother he had a rockin fashion sense i love
that he said like i had to leave a few things i was like yes yes you did will lead to the death
of thousands if not millions of people and that when you really get down to it his actions seem
to be mostly motivated by a deep-seated rage that causes him to lash out in vindictive and cruel
ways classic hero really one way to put it i'm confused he did a sort of like the pitch as a
hero now the pitch as a villain i'm assuming he's gonna comment on how like that's reconciled within
him to create the best character or something so i do want to like i do want to give him the
benefit of the doubt and essentially you i i don't get the i don't get the impression that he was
describing him to say that he was a hero just to say that he was being portrayed
as he would portray a hero in a lot of ways i suppose he's saying there are aspects to him
that could be considered as a part of a hero's journey which i wouldn't necessarily disagree
with but um like like in general but the problem with black panther is like i said the from the
get go it's like oh he was his dad his dad was killed and he was abandoned it's like yeah but
why though that part doesn't even make sense if it was like if tachaka was a bad guy which by the
way they could have done it that way they could have been like tachaka was an evil sort of dick
king at first and then he like grew wise as he got older but obviously we yeah yeah i don't
actually really like to see that just then i just think there's a lot of ways they could have
made it for example imagine like a huge rant from tachaka where he says like uh we can't
we couldn't take in that kid because he's you know like the black panther universe equivalent
of a mudblood where he'd be like you can't he's a he's a crossbreed we can't bring outsiders to
wakanda and then his son could be like what the fuck dad i don't like to see that and yeah and
but we don't really maybe there was a cut thing i don't know when you take all this into account
it's hard to consider killmonger any sort of hero but writing him off as a straightforward villain
doesn't seem right either uh do you guys uh what was the first minute of this video i i happily uh
called killmonger a straight villain there's not even a question he is a villain he is a villain
absolutely like the guy has the only his intention is to take over the world via killing
several people including children remember when he poisoned the museum lady who did absolutely
nothing just because she was there remember that's that's what a good guy does remember
he killed forest wittaker but his motivations yeah well the road to hell yeah remember when
he killed his girlfriend just because oh yeah lucky what do you think of that uh jay the uh
they have a scene to show the girl and she like kisses him and he's like yeah and then the next
scene we see her he ends up shooting her through the head i believe no through the chest which is
weird because she just dies instantly yeah i mean heart shot yeah i mean i i personally don't think
i would do that no i mean from a filmmaking standpoint what were they going for with that
i never understood it i was like okay so we she doesn't even have a line of dialogue from what i
remember or she might do but it's like oh he has a girlfriend you're like oh okay and then he kills
her and you're like oh is he like really evil is that what they're going for i feel like i i feel
like they were just sort of going he was like i i don't know i feel like they just sort of wanted
to seem like he was uh i don't think they wanted to think they were an item properly i think that
she just i mean at least my impression of it was that she was just some girl he was shagging
rather than anything else yeah maybe but i don't really know why they would uh do i mean it does
make him seem more villainous the interesting thing is you could have cut here from the film
right because she doesn't actually have relevance but i'm assuming that the reason they included
it was to show that he's like he's ruthless and you'll do anything to you know get his to win
yeah i mean the light about killing children does that as well exactly yeah um what was an
anakin i was up i i was kind of with you to a point up until the you know it's like you can see
him like in the council they were probably like yeah this is a great plan yeah yeah then he says
killing children they were like whoa whoa whoa now whoa there's a line that has been crossed
um oh but yeah someone described him shooting his girlfriend as the easiest breakup ever
no strings attached he just went he was a good person he just wanted a nice quick clean breakup
it's true um i wasn't very clean what did you think of uh killing claw in general by the way
as a writing choice like the character i mean because i quite like claw and i was like why did
they get rid of claw where i think i just like andy circus i i'm i'm gonna miss claw it felt weird
like he was introduced in what was essentially the biggest stepping stone film in the mcu
being age of ultron only to basically be in about half an hour at most of black panther and then
die he was like oh i was i feel like for me it did raise the stakes because he was a character
i tried to care about and uh him dying was like oh shit people i care about are dying in this film
and it sort of it made me more invested in it yeah i probably i mean you know this is way too
controversial considering how the film runs but i just be like i would have preferred if he was the
bad guy to be honest overall but there's another question that gets raised i don't think i actually
i i forgot to have it in my video um claw is like a trillionaire what is he doing with vibranium
what is what's he up to he just wants more money yeah i mean that's the kind of work he is just
he could never have enough money i i could totally believe that he does this for fun or ever but
i feel like they just leave that detail out they don't reconcile it like you could just have a
henchman being like claw you're you're rich what are you doing then he's like i don't do this for
the money you'd be like oh yeah you need some money to to uh promo his uh his mixtape oh right
yeah that just reminds me of how my favorite part of the film probably is bilbo and claw those two
i i just like them in the film i find them entertaining i think they're both great actors
i was just like yeah that was fun for the brief time they're there at least i got the
entertainment value of just thinking that golem and bilbo accidentally wound up in this universe
well people looking forward to when dr strange and bilbo meet up because of the sherlock connection
but i mean oh wait and and lord of the rings oh the hobbit sorry isn't it because of uh bennett
cummerbach played oh yeah we got that we can make a a reference like i'm fire exactly it'll be great
i don't know do you see the um in infinity war someone posted a tweet saying something like
they had a missed opportunity to have uh someone say no shit sherlock in front of both
robert jr and bennett cummerbach because they both played sherlock and bennett cummerbach like
responded to the tweet saying there's a reason they didn't have that it's because it's awful
it's like oh man i'm a suck to have gotten that from bennett cummerbach
so anyway it's part of what makes him the most compelling antagonist in mcu history in my opinion
he doesn't just give tchalla a conflict to overcome he also makes him question everything
about his family his position and this country that makes well it makes his dad look like an
idiot yeah i wouldn't i don't think i could go that far i'd be like what why couldn't he just
cite something that would make a bit more sense because like he makes him question himself about
everything he's like well not really he just highlights the fact that his dad did a thing
for some reason and we never really find out why and then afterwards afterwards the child
does changes oh he does he wants to do the whole policy thing but i'm not sure if what would you
say is the reason that he did that because i would cite the girlfriend before killmonger
i mean i think i think i definitely think that uh at least the film wants you to think that
killmonger had a hand in it sure but he's like a monster he's like horrible horrifying monster
i like to think that basically each gentleman oh these these are some more ideas maybe if we
don't kill children like you know you're taking a bit we're gonna go we're gonna take your ideas
killmonger we're gonna cut a couple of things just a couple of points we're just gonna cut
details really he's like he's like in a room but they're both wearing glasses of a clipboard he's
like so killing killed children can we knock that off the list he's like no you're like okay okay
maybe not all kids he's like no all of them you're like oh man you're not being reasonable kids
and he's like it's a start it's a start we gotta have a little intervention here
killmonger killing kids he wants to do a not the best room everyone's there you need to talk about
you killing children you know how he says that um you can uh we can save you and then he's like
what so i could be in a prison i remember being like dude take that opportunity you might be able
to get out again you know that killmonger's like you may as well just let me die because i can't be
asked to be your prisoner forever and it's like no just just pretend like your reform be like yeah
dude i want to help you with your new plan yeah woohoo i totally buy though that he would be the
kind of person who's like oh yeah i'm dying for my beliefs yeah yeah i was just saying i'm not saying
it's a problem i'm just saying that's what i would have done i'd be like sure i'll go to your prison
that's fine i only regret that there are children left unkilled and like a week later uh you get
visited by T'Challa he's like hey man you're like hey man i was thinking killing kids is just the
wrongest thing to do that is so bad no one should ever do that you know he's like you're like so can
i come out around like that's all that you had a problem with before right i think some not just
a fun marvel villain but a fantastic complex character in general i applaud your cleverness
richards but even when a panther cannot hear his victim what okay i guess that's fine okay i do not
like this animation look it is now i can see a lot of people taking the title of this video as an
attack on loki who many consider to be the best mc i go with thanos at this point i go with thanos
i'm with thanos what about the two internal logic in fairness was this video made before or after
good question why black and the captain let's see if because i'll give him leeway if that's the case
captain midnight i would still think it's arguable i would i would understand if someone
said that he preferred loki to thanos i mean i wouldn't agree but i'd like oh yeah well see
my problem with i don't really have a problem with loki i just don't find him as interesting
i really like i feel like it's tom hiddleston rather than loki to be honest i just enjoy him
while with thanos there's a lot for my brain to chew on with thanos if that makes any sense at all
bebby 28th so when did infinity war come out that was in may right or april war release
oh yeah so this is two months before so that's fair okay so we'll give him credit for leeway for
that yeah absolutely i i can see you yeah who have you even got to cite for good villains
in the mcu outside of vulture vulture is probably dr octopus oh well no mcu man well he's not an
emcee oh okay i was yeah i was just uh it would be it would be loki vulture uh if we ignore thanos
i'm not even sure who else is left at that point certainly not any of the iron man villains they
were all terrible uh captain oh where zemo i like zemo a lot then you've got yeah basically no one
left oh ego some people are referencing from guardians too he's he's all right i like ego
i i'd say i don't really like him as much as a villain but yeah it's complicated yes it's
complicated red skull no he's too red skull was lame he's too evil yeah a little bit too
mustache twirly for me hulk's dad from ang lee hulk
oh that was uh that was chris kristofferson right oh no nick nulty i believe it was one of those two
i can't remember who but i think it was nick nulty in in in the ang lee hulk um fistcrum the
daredevil show i mean that's i don't know if we can have soldiers i like i like winter soldier
i just didn't think he was overly yeah he's just like a santana well that i don't really think
he's much of a villain he's more of a victim to be honest yeah sort of uh the villain more
than anything really for the villains i really like him as a character i i don't think he i
wouldn't count him as a villain though i'm sorry i can't consider ultron i thought that ultron was
kind of poop he's two i love and that's the thing i love james bader's voice and i like
the ideas involved with ultron but man was he goofy and it was oddly goofy for what was supposed
to be like i wish he was more mechanically precise you know really played the ai yeah angle
a bit more he makes so much like a like a borg or something you know yeah for a character that
wanted to literally destroy the planet every time he came up on screen i was like this does not
strike me as the kind of character that would destroy a planet he's like a jokey kind of dude
i don't know it just didn't work for me i remember thinking from the trailer that he was going to be
extremely creepy like very definitive in every action he takes and uh you know single-minded in
a goal but also has information like i love the idea that he was um the anti-iron man he was like
just as intelligent but um had a different solution to the world's problems you know like
iron man's like we need to uh wrap a suit of armor around the world and he's like well if we
just kill all of the people that are a threat to everybody also kind of twisted logic like that you
know i also like the idea because someone there was a video that brought it up it was like uh
it would have been cool to have twisted ultron's goals to have um been in favor of defending the
earth against thanos like that was his ultimate plan because he knew thanos was coming or something
like that and that he was like we're gonna get rid of all the humans and re redo them all with
bots instead because they'll be much better as a defense against thanos and you just be like they
could have had a few drops of clues in ultron but the problem is i don't think they had any idea
what infinity war was going to be when they were writing age of ultron so they plan a little bit
ahead but not completely but overall yeah loki's cool i like loki don't mean it to be tom hiddleston
is great as loki and i'd probably rank him as one of the best characters in the entire mcu
but for me at least loki works best when he's not the villainous lead but a supporting character
he was my favorite part of the dark world and one of my favorite parts of ragnarok for a reason
that's the type probably the only good part of the dark world i really like the dark world
wait what i just thought it was i just thought it was kind of fun to watch people fighting oh
it's okay rags it's just it's considered one of the worst if not the worst um i don't actually
have a lot of arguments for it because i can never remember what happens in that film it's like yeah
i just like the i just like people fighting it's i just remember really i remember watching it
theaters and uh just like half the theater burst out laughing when like the fucking stupid elves
fly in in their spaceship and then um god what's his name idris elba like runs across the bridge
in the goofiest way ever to stab the ship and climb on it it was it was hilarious um the whole
like the the the references to uh norse mythology as well i remember i was talking about that before
oh god yeah it kind of spit in well all the thor movies kind of spit in the face of the
actual norse mythology are you but it kind of got ridiculous in that movie not to make a tangent
we'll do this as quickly as we can but how are you finding that aspect of god of war four
um well yeah the same thing with well the thing is is that uh at least from like the first three
god of war games like they kind of spit in the face of greek mythology in a lot of places oh god
yeah it's a complete mess they're just like this stuff happens here and here we'll take random
things it does the same thing with god of war four but i can ignore it because i mean we're
talking about a greek god in a norse world which would not ever work so i can kind of be like okay
i'll just i'll just play with it uh people so let's say uh rags calls himself a movie reviewer
which i don't wait what while liking thor because he likes people thought yeah i like the i didn't
say it was good i just said i liked it because i i like the effects it's okay chat put put your guns
down all rags i thought it was fun i just i thought it was a fun movie to watch because like
elves fighting greek people or thor people norse people i remember seeing dark will deny man three
somewhat like togetherish or at least within a certain amount of time and i remember thinking
like yeah i'm pretty much dubbed with the abcu that was like my low point and uh i can't remember
someone said i'm sorry someone said rags is not a movie reviewer he's a handler get it right
yeah that's right oh wait yeah genesis oh yeah fuck i completely forgot about it like that's
thing with uh like me in movies i am much more predisposed to like movies than not like them
yeah but it doesn't stop you from talking about the mechanics in them
yeah like that's why i when i watched um thor the dark world i was like oh stuff's always happening
i'm like things are constantly going on uh like the effects and some of the weapons were really
cool like the like the black hole grenades i thought were really neat you know it's stuff
like that and i was like oh good stuff happening things that's just why i liked it i mean if
anything how many movies has rags said that he likes that me and mauler both hated i know
annihilation is one of them quiet place you liked a quiet place didn't you or yeah i liked it yeah
by the way we're on we're on the minority on that one i think most people like uh annihilation
as far as i know we'll see how chat reacts to it now um what's what's your take on the dark world
jay i cannot remember it at all i fell asleep on that one too it's it's just it's definitely
the most forgettable mcu film i mean i don't think anyone is going to disagree with that really
well the incredible hulk i literally cannot remember it like at all i remember hulk punching
things a couple times and that was about it uh the guy from pulp fictions in it as well
he's like the main bad guy sort of he's abomination i believe the guy from pulp fiction oh yeah there's
a lot of guys from pulpit uh tim roth tim roth is the one i was looking for oh okay um see i think
i think you could you could be watching thor the dark world and you could be halfway through it
and realize that you have no idea what's happened up until that point and that's that's not because
you've not been paying attention that's just because of how the film feels yeah to give like
a really good sort of perspective on what sucks about thor dark world i'd have to watch it again
and you'd have to talk to me like five seconds after because if you had a day i would have forgotten
it like i just that's how that's that's the problem for it but um sure i would happily agree
that loki is probably the best part of it like yeah as opposed to the other good parts of it i
still i like i like loki in avengers he was the villain in avengers like because this guy said
he's better as a supporting character which is he isn't he always a supporting character outside of
oh wait he was the he was the villain in thor one wasn't he yeah yeah well he was one of like three
villains in thor one oh yeah because you had the frost giant people and the giant machine that
fired lasers right he was so if there wasn't there like evil humans too some of the chance
of that like the last jedi and don't cross lines all right you can go no no no look jokes are we
we all like some jokes we all enjoy a little humor all right but don't take shit too far
that joke is too far someone will take that seriously and think i actually liked the last
jedi oh he applied it to you i found out where you leave someone said rags likes the last jedi
i will hyperdrive my mazda into your house have you seen have you seen our podcast before
we really i don't think we've had a podcast with starls i think they're i think they're joking
good good good um but yeah uh i've liked loki in pretty much all the films but i can't remember
him in thor one to be perfectly honest i liked him as the bad guy in avengers i will i'm putting
that out there i i thought he was great i i enjoyed it it's probably why he had the slot for
like number one villain until thanos knocked it off i suppose i can't think of it if i prefer
any other ones but whatever we shall let this man continue excels at in avengers he represents a
pretty cut and dry challenge for the heroes they need to band together as a team or see the entire
planet taken over by him and his alien overlords it provided a great skeleton for joss weeden to
write entertaining team scenes around but that's about it loki's lust for power i'm so glad that
captain america doesn't have that stupid fucking mask anymore yeah it looks like they've opted for
not only taking masks away but making it so that everyone's masks are nano suited on now isn't it
so yeah it's all the talking yeah but the best parts of the like the avengers movies are like
how all the characters interact and talk and i don't just i'm gonna i'm a bit of an avengers
one nerd because i like joss weeden a lot which is fucking controversial to say these days uh
there's a scene where there's several scenes where thor is trying to reach loki and he almost does
he says that like um you've gone too far this has to stop and then loki says it's too late
and then he says no it's not we can do it together and then loki decides to stab him anyway
like the that that's the thing that happens isn't it it's not he's not just a one-dimensional
like evil man and you know he deliberately lets himself get caught he fucks with the um
the characters quite a bit like i i feel he's selling him a bit short in avengers one that's all
and then and remember he was in infinity war too he was for a little bit isn't explored with that
much depth within the film itself this isn't the case with killmonger the conflict he presents to
the rest of the cast goes far beyond he wants power and is willing to kill to take it it makes
them what no it doesn't um does it do that i mean i i guess it does in the sense that he's like i
want power but i also want to kill all the children that's how he's layered i just want to
so i suppose it could be in saying he wants power for other people instead of just himself
yeah but he wants to be the overlord you know like it would be like me being like yeah i want
rags and wolf to have level five strength as long as i have level six strength like hmm fair enough
he wants to rule right you know um again this would go over so much more smoothly if they
hadn't had the stupid library so he's gonna kill shit and children had a children children
and just that that one aspect's a bit awkward but that's the cast goes far beyond he wants power
and is willing to kill to take it it makes them confront the sins of the past and question their
own priorities the sins of it's not well those sins can't apply to tachala because it wasn't
applied he wasn't born yet he didn't even know about it and the sin doesn't even make sense
love to that or if he was born he wasn't you know around to see it happen
he probably yeah he probably was born he was just back home or whatever um
but like this this is very hard for me to swallow considering how the
the choice for them to leave behind just didn't make sense that's that's where i'm stuck still
and it's this that's the i think that's the issue is that they could have written it so
it made sense they had opportunities to do so um yeah i mean like it's not like they went with
their i mean it's not like they went with their first draft who would do that um nobody would
ever do that because let's be clear here what tachaka tachala's father did to eric was pretty
deeply messed up yeah but why did he do it yeah gosh even if there was a reason for it well shit
let's just kill children well i mean he's tachaka didn't suggest that he's but the the no tachaka
suggests let us kill the children's father and then leave them homeless that was the other thing
that i didn't really pick up on until the rewatch with wolf um when he kills the dad it seemed
unnecessary he like stops the gun and then he just fucking kills him you know he's like boom
and then you know fuck it you're dead it's like oh man i i gotta go all the way now i've stopped
the gun may as well kill him wait what i have the claws i gotta kill a child's father he turned
to blind eyes that kids suffering for decades he turned a blind eye to that kids suffering for
decades why though just anyone and even if i mean i don't even know if that's a fair take
the kids suffering it's like you could argue he turned a blind eye to the world suffering
couldn't you isn't that mowing line with the films so the rest of africa's suffering to the
rest of wakanda outside of the dome yeah they don't count they don't count as the leader of
the most technologically advanced nation in the world and someone we know has spies everywhere
it doesn't seem like he ever once checked in on eric if he had he would have seen an incredibly
angry and broken person who was yeah i don't necessarily disagree with any of that we're still
stuck at the beginning though turning into a killing machine he could have done something
about that instead either out of anger or simple shame he looked the other what do you what do you
mean though out of anger or shame anger for war and shame for war these things aren't covered
where are you hiding your weapon behind your shield he's using it to help prop it up as a shield
god right you know nothing into here do you know nothing about trial by combat i know that you
don't hide your weapon behind your shield wouldn't that be funny if he like kicked his shield hard
enough that his spear like sliced his neck did actually i just read something in the chat did
did tachala tachaka how would you have known about the kid anyway or i guess he would have
known through the spy question mark because the the the guy was spying on him through young forest
i mean they already accepted anyway right because tachaka's like we had to do it to keep the secret
and you're like you were wrong it's like god damn it talks to him about why he kept the sacred
also look at that guy's uh outfit there he's got like overalls for the
he would have power on all of it and allowed a monster to be created in the process and that
makes sense because turning a blind eye to suffering seemed to be what he did with most
things happening outside of wakanda all don't all that's been like the wakandan national anthem
for how many thousands of years that's the thing and it's like i agree with that part
but they never fucking have any kind of anything for why they left uh eric that's his name isn't it
there's like a scene missing or dialogue missing and he's just sort of just been
he hasn't even provided a reason yet i'm waiting for him to like maybe invent one because obviously
we kind of need one but he sort of he just said he was out of shame and anger
or he said he was possibly out of shame and anger which again is just like what do you mean what
are you referring to this is relevant editing the fuck but let me back even was that
yeah it's black panther playing with yarn because that's what black people that's what cats do
it was like a mobile game something it had like a buy gold button so i assume it's a shitty mobile
game i love how you had to catch yourself and rags your races we have to we have to whip him into
shape there does that's what black panther does he plays with yarn because he's a cat his panthers
all of this is interesting sure but it would be nothing without a great actor to bring it to the
screen thankfully ryan kugler knew just the guy from his previous role in kugler's fruitvale station
man name i mean i don't i don't really have any criticisms food stand and i actually really like
creed by the way have you guys seen that uh no i've heard it was really good though i'm not into
those kinds of movies but i heard i heard it was really good yeah i'm not super into boxing movies
and but you know or fighting movies in general but you know i heard good things about it any
comment on uh his acting for killmonger oh i think he's a good actor i mean i've seen him
i mean the movie's horrendous but fahrenheit 451 despite that movie just being a slap in the face
to the book he did pretty well in there so i don't think he's a bad actor i just think he takes
bad roles at times well yeah like i said i i don't really have a problem with uh he's the nicholas
cage no he's he's more like um what's his name he was in alien covenant um michael fastbender
he's like he's a really good actor that he was in so many bad movies oh yeah he was an assassin
snowman um oh fuck yeah he was in that too jesus he's in i know michael fastbender is
a great actor who has like the worst agent ever he's been in like two good movies
well team role as wallace on the wire as a teenager michael b jordan has always been great
at roles where there's a lot going on just under the surface with wallace it was this childish
innocent he's good at playing roles that have stuff going on under the surface even though i
would argue that killmonger is extremely blatant about his motivations i'm pretty sure he describes
them throughout the film but hey not knocking this guy i would have wanted i would want some
clarification on what he means by there's a lot going on under the surface like with the character
or with the scene or with probably the character in terms of secretly white under all that black
skin well if that is that is a rude what you just said how dare you to be fair oh it's a rude okay
we all are black on the inside technically we all yeah isn't that how that would we all we all would
have had black ancestors on pangaea right oh wait was that before humans well that was a that was a
good it was way a few million years no sorry that is but that is uh we all came from one
continent it was my point sorry yeah i mean we were all brown at one point and to brown we shall
return i mean i guess if you want to get super specific with it we kind of are all the same like
slithering insect oh right yeah we're all stardust we're all amoeba
no we're all descendants of adam and eve because six thousand years ago
people in the garden of eden rags shut up
the truth is that you three knew no matter how tough he tried to act this was a fundamentally
decent little kid playing at being a drug dealer with creed it was insecurities
okay this is this is weird he's trying so obviously the intention here is to run a thread
through all of well through the character on the wire the creed and killmonger i'm more interested
in how he's going to try and assess that killmonger has stuff going on under the surface as opposed
to being like i'm not crazy here right like killmonger was very overt yeah i reckon he never
believed that hanging he never really gave the idea of internal conflict or anything like that
wolf you'll take all this uh i i just tried to get over the fact that he was like this
kid played a great drug dealer no that's that's straw bad if he said he played a great kid thinking
he was a drug dealer you're the worst he played a lot of the nervousness and anxiety of being in
his legendary father's shadow in fantastic four he oh god oh no you don't know what oh
you know what he was in that movie he was i forgot that movie was a thing it's usually like
someone has to bring it up for me to even remember it this looks like the cover of a spy kids movie
fantastic i believe is whatever what why why is he referencing fantastic four because it's not
the kind of movie you want to reference in a good life he dude he's got very few films to choose
from i imagine he wants like am i great i'm not even trying to be like conspiracy theory here he
wants to just prove that he plays complex characters so he's just applying it to any
film he could find that he's in let me see what oh god he was in that horrible red tails movie too
man he's in a lot of bad you didn't like that movie because you're racist exactly no that's why he
didn't like black panther too and forced all right how come every movie where michael b jordan plays
a black character you don't like he plays a black character look it's nothing against that it's just
you know i think he's a better asian character personally anyway you know let's just not talk
about oh okay there you go oh okay yeah anyway in black panther what he's playing boiling just
under the surface in almost every scene is rage and a lot of it silence it really comes subtle
we only strangles the old lady it doesn't seem like he's containing that rage very well
the subtlety of the rage beneath the surface as he strangles people
rage beneath right he does a lot of shouting he makes a lot of statements about how evil the
people he's trying to take down are i don't yeah but under the surface under the surface there's
even more it's even he gets even worse he's even cipher rage that is after earth i'm sad that i know
that you know because it's just the stupidest fucking name ever rage sit down tonight
good night mind is when he gets buried in the sand and takes a trip to the spirit realm
for tachala you just have to say that as if it just makes sense in the spirit realm it's buried
it's sad visits the spirit realm you're like yep one thing that really comes to mind is when he
gets buried in the sand and takes a trip to the spirit realm for tachala this was a very sacred
very peaceful process where he gained encouragement he had a whole fucking shout out with his dad in
the peaceful realm if you remember he's like you were wrong you bastard you piece of shit
why the fuck did you do what you did this i was like oh shit you're embarrassing me before the
other panthers dude hold your shirt up panthers in the trees are like should we go this is really
awkward oh that's what that's one thing i do want to bring up um to is it j right yep hi did you
notice that there's only like six kings oh yeah just maybe no there's trees in the background
there's one over there there's a whole bunch of panthers on that one why yes why in the spirit
realm of these lore is specific six dude the pat the cabra pads right there's just there's
hundreds of panthers are lying there it's like like a bush in the spirit realm the floor is lava
he's eating from past kings for eric not so much his vision takes him to his childhood apartment
the spirit of his father still lingering there he reverts to a scared and angry little kid
and you really start to feel for him yeah i honestly one of the better scenes i actually
found that one decent enough that he has that conflict with his dad even explains how he knows
all about wakanda through like a little book that he found that was a secret but on our second watch
i did say that um how in the world wouldn't forest wittaker have known about that book
and how blatantly bad it is to leave something like that you know in in the human part well in
the non-wakanda place but either way it's fine it was nice to get that little bit out of kill
monger despite how much nothing makes sense about him to me but when he rises from that
sand it isn't in sadness or maybe even a sense of closure that he got to speak to his dad one last
time not at all he comes out with pure unadulterated anger and hate but unlike many villains it's not like
every other scene he's in yeah like yeah what a difference it made yeah i mean well the idea is
that he was doing it for that very reason then he sees the reason again and he's like yep still
doing it for this reason it's rage but something very understandable and grounded in this way he
actually reminds me of one of my favorite non-mcu bad guys magneto now that i think about it kill
monger and magneto have a lot in common um no no no nazi i get i already know how he's gonna
connect them it's just like yeah but and i'm not even one to defend the x-men films i like them a
lot there's a couple problems but like magneto versus xavier is supposed to be the kind of like
malcolm x and martin luther king jr right that's the like the idea and that mutants are
magneto fights for mutant rights with violence while xavier is trying to
incorporate and work with and stuff but they whitewashed history to compare magneto to
kill monger that feels weird to me but sure i'll give him a shot
and both are trying to take down society yes can we throw hitler in there please
brutal childhood take down society how many villains does that apply to that's the guy from
thor 2 uh technically loki because loki's trying to destroy in thor 1 and in avengers um i guess
what did phano snooking half the galaxy pretty much destroy every single society ever someone
in chat said that doom guy has more personality than kill monger makes more sense than kill
monger that actually does make sense because doom guy's like pure rage but it's presented in this
i don't like this characterized way also i'm confused take down society wouldn't it be they
want to change society rather well i guess you have to take it down in order to change it i guess
one wants to uh make it just completely mutants and the other just wants to make it completely
adults adults oh right uh it took me way too long to catch magnia was like we're not so different
eddie as we know it both had very brutal childhood well one was in the literal holocaust oh my god
named eric really i know okay look one was in the holocaust the other's dad died i think one has a
little bit more to go not to mention let me do this with two other characters uh we'll take spiderman
and star lord they both want to help people they both had a childhood in which their loved ones
died they're both named peter it's like yeah so yeah there's so much more let's take um
let's take uh tony stark and tony montana you know if you they both they all have our name tony
if you just replace this they both have access to high power weaponry um if you just replace the
one it's evil all right let's see what else he's got both are even named eric with the k
except not really most importantly though both have goals that are in many ways very sympathetic
and they make some very um okay magneto's like mutant supremacy this is a good thing
i don't know what his valid point is exactly
oh jared's in chat if you want to say hi
hi jared we're talking about comonger i hope you guys are doing awesome stay rad everyone
do you want to jared you stay alpha do you want to try see what his reaction is to throw in an
invite for the next dishonor wolf podcast or well i don't know when the next dishonor wolf podcast
is going to be but i will keep him in my thoughts in my heart just like i always do
because there's no way you can contact him on twitter anymore no way oh wait well i can always
comment on his videos and even if he deletes his channel he's going to make a new one about 12
minutes later so i'll be able to always contact him yeah uh there's there's an ongoing argument
about the differences between sympathetic and empathetic and i believe it's the difference
between understanding why they do what they do versus uh relating to what they do like being
like yeah i could definitely see myself doing that and so if we're going for the whole like
you can understand killmonger and magneto's uh goals i'd be like i can understand magneto's
his history is being a part of the holocaust and deciding fuck it i'm gonna fight back with
violence because that's how they're treating mutants it's like okay cool and then you got
killmonger who's like they killed my dad and they didn't help everyone around the world they just
stuck to themselves in response i'm going to get rid of every world leader and kill everyone involved
who defies me including children until i can rule the world the correct way it's like what i mean i
think his motivations are sympathetic just not what he decides to do because of his goals like
yeah i actually maybe because i'm correct me if i'm wrong but magneto's goal is actually
the same as xavier's it's just their methods are different he's like he wants world peace and he
randomly is like you know what i agree with you xavier i'll be a good guy but then he's not it's
like that happens several times he goes from uh bad guy to good guy to bad guy in every single
movie do you remember how in days of future past they bring him in to be helping that he ends up
being the film's villain shit yeah they're like let's break you out of jail and he's like thanks
i'm gonna be the bad guy now oh fuck that was a mistake it's almost like he deals with whatever
the most what he feels is the most realistic ends to what his goal will be sure um but like
killmonger's goal is to take over the world which is not gonna that's retarded like you're just a guy
with the k except not really most importantly though both have goals that are in many ways very
sympathetic and they make some very valid points but their methods to get to those goals are far
too brutal and murderous for our protagonists to get on board well for the audience to get on board
i mean we can assume he's saying that too i suppose there would have been better to phrase
it that way though it's like as if as if the child is the only person that's the problem with this
no i don't know because right after he is sympathetic in many ways and i'm like
these cutaways are very strange i'm not sure i understand what they're for and like he wants
to go for a different format every time right because it was like an old cartoon this one looks
like a newer cartoon and the other one was like a game very strange i don't really understand why
they're here and also because he's only got nine minutes like he's obviously this is a very quick
video so throwing these in i mean this i'm not i'm not saying this is why they're here but it
certainly helps to pad it a little bit well you know he's gonna throw in that betterhelp.com or
something we'll see i don't know i don't think i can't remember if he has sponsors or not because
i remember i've seen two videos of his before
according to Black Panther co-writer Joe Robert Cole in a lot of ways what T'Challa and Eric
want are the same things but Eric is coming at it from how do you how would you sum up
what they both want as the same thing really what Hitler wanted wasn't that different from
what everyone else wanted there were just less Jews involved could you i was going to say you
could summarize it as being like you know nobody's any different because everyone wants something
but i'm curious because aren't these two like antithetical to each other in the film
isn't that kind of the point because T'Challa only wants to sort of expand Wakanda after
Eric is dead so i'd like to say that they sort of want the same thing it's like not really
Eric is coming from a place of pain and T'Challa ultimately finds a place of empathy
and T'Challa ultimately finds a place of empathy that's a strange comparison
yeah i'm not sure about this from a place of pain and T'Challa ultimately finds a place of
empathy this is what puts Killmonger a notch or two ahead of the rest of the mcu villains
okay if you say so
not only is his goal emotionally grounded in a way that say malakith's plan is
fucking stupid looking elves civil war was out at this point how is how is zemo's plan not
emotionally motivated what about vulture i'm pretty sure spiderman homecoming is out at this point too
uh why would you like what's the point in going for the bottom of the barrel being like you see
it's better than the fucking dark elf like yeah i can't even remember his name so or what i can't
tell you what his plan was i'm pretty sure he was like he had some kind of the ether was supposed to
do a thing the red stuff i'm waiting for anybody to fill in the blanks here because i just can't
remember i think his name was malakith we're trying to figure out what his name is well he
just said it he just said it here it's mal some if if your name begins with mal sorry you're going
to be a bad guy that's malevolence that's an evil name yeah yeah no point comparing it to him if it
like at least bring loki that would have been a better shot and to conquer the nine realms and
thor the dark world just wasn't there's a sense that if tachaka had just made a few different
choices eric and tachala could be on the same page he's just summed up why i don't think it's
well written if he just made a few different choices it's like yeah i agree as family but
by the time we meet killmonger literally murdering people in the first scene we see him in he's just
too far gone and there's definitely why is it i just like why does why an element of tragedy i don't
know too far gone as a villain yet still sympathetic somehow to that when he's bleeding out under the
wakandan sunset arm in arm with tachala but refusing to get the life-saving medical help he
needs you can't help but wonder who this guy would have been if things had played out just a little
differently in his life so even though yeah i agree with that too and again the yeah if things
had been different if if the dad hadn't made a retarded decision yeah interesting stuff i was sad
to see him go and kind of wish he could return to the mcu loki style he was at least given one of
the best and definitely one of the most thought-provoking deaths in any model you mean like you
mean like how he was stabbed through the heart and managed to survive for like an hour afterward
yeah which completely i got a lot of i think i told rags this i got a lot of criticism for
making that comment uh there's a couple comments that were like no you can totally survive over
i got a very very long email from a doctor who said he noticed a lot of people saying
that you can survive a knife to the heart for extended periods of time you can't it is literally
impossible you up the heart is very important yes very literally i believe the email opened
with something like the heart is an extremely important organ well you get stabbed in the heart
you're fucked what if the charlotte puts one of his balls in it oh that's you know that's a great
point he could have balled his heart well yeah he's giving the old heart ball he said something
like if you said if you sever any of the like pipes or tubes or whatever the fuck
goes on in the heart in total uh you've already pretty much guaranteed yourself a heart attack
like immediately is what he said um he said you might be able to survive uh for like a minute at
most but if you even try to move you will definitely die and do you remember how far they travel
they have to walk all the way to the elevator then walk from the elevator to the edge of the
cliff and it's like oh his heart had vibranium in it well this is the thing some people like yeah
but he had the super juice it's like what do you think that means i think that he that the heart
healed and that also didn't i don't i don't hate you eric i just want to put my balls in your heart
it's an emotional scene film one of the most common criticisms of mcu villains is that their
powers are a lazy mirror of the heroes this goes all the way back to obidiah stain and the first
iron man who basically yeah i mean i don't know how you guys feel about this but like i really
liked obidiah stain up until he got into his suit and then he became a really retarded villain it
was like what the hell is your plan do you remember he's like i'm gonna be honest i thought
he said opening scene and i was like this isn't the opening no but he's also right about like
mirror enemies as well i i agree with that but they took the criticism to heart okay and as of
as if you took all of the villains from 2000 i want to say 15 and onwards the mcu is doing really
well well except for kilmok like completely opposite to this guy that assessment i think
basically becomes iron man but bigger and when the trailer for black panther drop why wouldn't
you throw more examples in there that could have been fun you'd be like oh and this one is just
thor but well loki's the enemy to thor it's not really thor but bigger is it then you've got
captain america fights red skull which isn't exactly red captain america but bigger then you
got hulk who fights a slightly different colored hulk yeah that's a good example of
he just fights bigger hulk you could have done that um opt i remember hearing those criticisms
again and it's true in the third act to chalice fighting bigger to chalice this screenshot sums
it up he's fighting bumpier to chalice kilmonger does get a suit almost exactly like to chalice
but it works better here because in this movie that's actually kind of the point oh so why isn't
it the point in iron man actually i'm sorry i wanted to hear your take on this when i when i
make my point j but uh isn't the point in iron man that uh he actually makes it blatant himself
he says tony in your attempt to stop the proliferation of your weapons you've given
the world its biggest one and like the idea that tony's working throughout the film to stop people
from using his weapons to destroy shit and then uh obadiah stain is using what is his newest and
most powerful weapon against him wouldn't that be considered a part of the film yeah i can yeah
actually no i do think it is sort of the it does make sense in iron man for it to be the way it is
like i'm not even a fan but i think it makes sense from the film's point of view i don't think it
makes like a very interesting fight but i think narratively it makes good sense and like i don't
know about how you feel on this but the fight between the two black panthers this film was uh
my least favorite part it's oh i don't even know where to begin like the cgi man whoo
playstation playstation the rhinos oh god everybody hated the rhino cgi it's just rushed
that's all it was it's unfortunate because i you can probably guarantee that the people behind it
had the talent to make something better but they were told you have like one week to make rhinos and
they were like what make it a rhino no eyes of the wakandan people in the finale they fight in
almost the exact same suit one purple and one gold and when they do it's not because they want
to beat the crap out of each other i mean they're more black both of them but sure i guess the the
purple and black gold tinges although definitely that too it's because they're fighting they want
to do a little bit more than beat the crap each other that's the thing is though like when i was
watching it i was almost confused i was like how can they possibly beat each other and then they
were like oh by the way the thing randomly removes their suits and you're like oh and then you realize
good thing that's the thing you realize if he was wearing the suit from civil war that probably
wouldn't have been the case i'm assuming because this stuff is like nanomite the get all over you
and so it wouldn't have the best part is is like his suit isn't even like uh being affected by the
train by the time he stabs him the whole thing you know like it's just like oh wow that that
little space happened to open up next to his heart and you stabbed him at that moment too it's like
that worked out well man was there a space that opened up over his heart because i thought their
suits were like reformed by that point i think that's what happens isn't it it's like the suits
are all blotchy and then he stabs him in the heart and then it the train's gone it's just too late
and when they do it's not because maybe i have to watch the movie again but i really
dearly don't want to do that and beat the crap out of each other although definitely that too
it's because they're fighting over two different visions of what the black panther and by extension
wakanda represents i don't even think killmonger gives a shit about black panther he just wants
the power in the suit because they're useful like i don't think he gives a shit about what
black panther represents i don't think there's ever yeah i doubt he's he just doesn't seem like
the principal type yeah i just think he sees it as tools he doesn't give a shit about
any of that i don't i think he actively despises black panther and wakanda for
the history that they've chosen to you know do think of all the children i could kill
the chala comes out on top this is a marvel movie after all so it probably doesn't come
as a surprise the hero emerges victorious but after eric dies some of the points he
made still live on he may not have won but he did manage to permanently change the way
that wakanda relates to the outside world yeah but that was happening anyway there's a scene with
the chala is like we do not open our borders and then the girl is like we should though and he's
like hmm and then killmonger stuff happens this is what i mean because the girl has another
talk with him later and then she's at the end as well i think i can't remember but
i will concede that killmonger probably got to chala to agree to to to it but i think it's
more motivated by the fact that his dad did the crazy stupid thing originally that's what made
chala be like okay we are kind of evil again it it doesn't make sense that's my biggest issue
or one of them anyway so in the end even though i could never consider killmonger any sort of
great hero like he is the guy willing to kill his girlfriend at the drop of a hat why wouldn't you
call him a hero in general much less a great one well yeah he did say that he couldn't and then he
referenced the fact that he just murdered his girlfriend randomly and i'm like i'm just sitting
here like yeah but this is why i could never consider him a good guy he's a horrible person
and you could be like yeah but he's horrible because of his history i'd be like no just because
your dad was assassinated does not mean you need to start killing children and innocent people and
strangling old women that's not how it works who is the old woman he strangled again once he wakes
up from we fucking laughed at it when we rewatched it oh yeah that part he literally he's like bit at
all she's like we can't do that he just goes block and she's like what the fuck you doing while you're
strangling only i get the grape juice now it's hard to deny that he had a positive impact on
chala there's enough shame he had a positive impact in the same way that Thanos had a positive impact
on the universe he brought us together in the same way that he had a positive impact on the juice
it's all very very vague he gave them all a huge victim complex that's continued for almost a
century to kill his girlfriend at the drop of a hat it's hard to deny that he had a positive
impact on chala there's enough shades of gray to him to elevate him far above the usual comic book
villain that makes him not just my favorite character in the black panther but my favorite
villain in the entire mcu but you said he's the best villain you said why black panther has marvel
is wait what why black panther has marvels oh right i was confused by that title for a second
but you see what he did he's made a statement of fact in the title and then in the video he was like
in my opinion is different it is different maybe because you get the click with the title because
we assume oh he's gonna argue like objectively why it's true and then at the end he's like by the
way this is just my opinion you're like here's how he compares to this one and this one and this one
because as we all know guys for the 22nd ad if you say in my opinion it means you cannot be
criticized that's how that works hey i hoped you liked the video i will be back next week no ad
just subscribe well i guess it's an ad for his channel but that's okay isn't it wolf yeah i mean
i guess he's not shilling better help you know the the depression scam that's uh as shane dawson
was doing that right i'm pretty sure he advertised a lot of like a whole ton of youtubers it's a scam
do you know that for like for fact apparently it's like um the therapist it's like free like
temporarily like for a very very short amount of time and then you have to pay like ridiculous
amounts of money and then the therapist uh sometimes will like cancel on you it's like
almost it's comparable to the candid situation okay um but yeah what's uh what's everyone's
takeaway from that video any of you can go first he was not he was not convincing he didn't really
make me like the movie anymore
that's basically just i mean i didn't didn't say anything that i thought
this is this has changed like this has changed my perspective i just sort of went in thinking
yeah kill monger i i enjoyed i enjoyed seeing him and that's basically how i feel now
uh have we have we changed your perspective on kill monger at all or do you feel the same way
i feel you've pointed out stuff out to me about his plan i'm like yeah i'm not really sure why
he did that i still like him as a character but uh yeah i as uh as plans go not the uh not the
most sense making of plans yeah fair enough um i'm gonna try and get through these super chats
now as fast as i can rags have you got is it right to say you got 16 minutes
uh i've got yeah just about all right i will try and i mean because we're gonna start up the
the video on predator next so i don't know if you would rather just go now or if you'd
rather go when you have to go completely up to you um i'm sorry i was i was in another world
there for a second what would you think i was saying because we'll we'll start up the next
video soon and obviously you're welcome to stay for as long as you can or if you'd rather leave
at it like if you know what i mean like it's like a middle part so you've you've completed
one video and you don't have to start the first bit of another one or you can stay for as long
as you want it's up to you i'll stay as long as i can sweet uh i read that one uh the spirit is
the best comedy to have comic book movie trappings i've have you guys seen the spirit that was like
not a sequel but a sort of the next one from sin city of the same style i believe of uh
like black and white with select colors highlighted but i don't think anyone saw it
sam l jackson was in it i think the only spirit movie i know of is the one with the horse
yeah no i don't know that one scallion of the him or on uh i just want my super chat to show
up on stream see your bundles of sticks wow wow that is offensive because both wolf and rags
like sausage i do sausage is really good i'm more of a bacon guy myself though
depends on how the sausage and bacon tastes if they have to you know if i have to choose
i'm going with um going with bacon consistency is important pineapple pineapple on pizza is
it heresy that is a question absolutely i like pineapple on pizza what a bundle of sticks
i wonder you like the rhino milk my it ain't right it ain't fucking right my answer is simple
because it's like well i don't like pineapple so it doesn't matter if it's on pizza or not but i
do consider it it's putting it on pizza is like i don't know being like hey you can have some toast
accident you can accidentally put my like i had pineapple nearby and i moved my hand carelessly
and i accidentally knocked some pineapple on this pizza it's like i accidentally destroyed the best
food in the entire world which is objective pizza is the best food and you know why because you
can have any topping so whatever food you like the most you could just choose that as a topping
it's pineapple can you can you think of like anyone in the world that doesn't like pizza
anyone communists well they don't like food in general so
job communist don't like i i had a friend they're not a friend anymore but they used to argue that
um uh something tasted sandwich flavor and i was like what the fuck is sandwich flavor
and they were like there's so many different kinds of sandwiches like i used it i was like
it's like it's like some it's pizza flavored he was like yeah that makes sense and i was like
what what do you mean you depend what pizza it is he's like well every pizza has cheese and i was
like no it doesn't though in defense in defense of him when when people say pizza it is almost
certainly meant that they mean like dough and cheese you know the thing is there's a lot of
pizzas that aren't that though yeah i know but just just in the colloquial sense whenever you
say pizza we all pretty much i think i would give you i would give you it for pizza but what
about sandwich though the only thing that's consistent about that usually is bread and
bread's coming completely different like yeah not even all bread tastes the same like you have
sourdough and ciabatta and rye and white and wheat and really testing rags his knowledge of
breads today um uh he's already named more breads than i know of yeah it's gonna say uh
white bread brown bread banana bread uh you have baguettes toast isn't a type of bread it's just
what happens to me that's cheating bread brioche um uh pita bread um ciabatta i think you might be
reading it off google now no no because i used to work in a restaurant um uh corn bread uh
pumpernickel and pumpernickel's often confused with rye that's a made up word no uh are croutons
bread are they little chunks of bread yeah like little dry chunks of bread um i said pitas but
we also have tortillas right i just wanted to let you know there's like 2000 people right now
listening to you list breads um there's english muffins wait does that count
sure surely they do because they're kind of i should know the answer to that because english
muffins are they're kind of like crumpets aren't they you test you've already breached my crumpets
my knowledge of bread is already done and dusted are bread are bread sticks it's its own type of
bread or is it just like bread in the shape of a stick well because i already said crazy
yeah crazy bread crazy bread is above bread so yeah um god i really don't think i can think of
any other kinds of breads um jen is guessing that you used to work in subway for what you said
no because i know a lot of things like like pumpernickel you could you could substitute
it for rye and most people don't know they wouldn't know the difference um oh of course
i should have thought of it earlier but we were talking about tachala and of course there's
chala bread oh that's right someone in the chat said uh alt right youtubers list breads is
i shall i shall continue claw should have been the main bad guy he was far more interesting
and better acted how do you three feel about that oh pretzels
oh wait can you reread the question because now i'm just thinking of claw should have been the
main bad guy he was more interesting and better acted yeah i mean i i'm not sure about better
acted i fucking i just like andy circus and i thought that claw was interesting to me so i
was like yeah i'd take him as a main bad guy i'm not sure he would have made sense story-wise as
me but i mean it would have to be a completely a complete rewrite to making the main bad guy yeah
i agree well it had to completely rewrite a whole lot of things about black panther but
wolf how dare you implying rhino milk fantastic uh wakando would still lose the war because the
world finally had a reason to wipe that disease infested eyesore of a continent off the map
i don't think that's just wow he's just been africa uh love you guys should have been the
antagonist love you guys keep it the good work wish they didn't kill claw and made him made him
sound made him sound isn't that maybe he just wanted him to sound exactly like smiegel
i'm not sure there's many interpretations of that um oh my god maula i was just rewatching your show
well now it's live uh death to all colonizers legato donut is donut a type of bread
from tri gun who wanted to kill everybody is a better villain than kill manga
message wait somebody donated and then message retracted interesting i didn't even know you could
do that that's very strange uh pouring myself a nice glass of rhino milk for the stream seriously
though good to see you here css there you go cheers friendly it's good to be here uh i've been
watching each of your channels for a long time and i find them to be both informal and entertaining
the vitality and passion put into each video featured is not easy to find this day and age
so keep up the good work and stay safe thank you very much illuminati illuminati fucking hell
illuminati i believe is the name illuminati no no he cares stay down and that was a hundred
dollars as well so we're gonna get the vigilant christian very generous and that was a nice thing
that he said about all of us you guys should be like cool my god thank you yay oh my god i'm so
sorry about those responses someone said so out of the loop what the fuck is rhino milk
so when you milk a rhino that's the liquid that comes out yeah it well we assume mcu ultron
incorporates tony's personality while originally was mapped off hank pimp and was far more creepy
logical in his motivation i would assume the comic version of ultron was probably better
than the film but obviously i don't know and yeah i did know that he was uh hank pimp was involved
as well they didn't do that with the mcu uh the dark world is a plot hole in my brain
ah that's actually yeah you could actually say that for for pretty much all of us
a hole in my brain uh for more three friends and i went to see the new predator movie first words
out of my mouth and i walked out was fuck that movie we were all pissed well my video should
be satisfactory then because i hated it um were you gonna say something then someone i feel like
i might have interrupted somebody well i gotta i do have to be on my way very well i will catch
you guys later on the flim flam it's it's been fun ranks we'll see you next what was it wednesday was
the plan i will see you next day okay oh there he goes okay so um now that faggot's gone i know we
can actually have a proper stream now for fuck's sake god uh speaking of north mythology have you
guys read rick reardon's latest book series magnus chase that are based on northsmith i mean i
certainly haven't wolf might have probably not um no no i have so many books to read fucking nerd
people keep like telling me have you read this book why don't you read this book and i'm like i
have 200 books i have yet to read oh damn we got one for rags it says i was a console gamer a few
years ago now i'm a maniac who just bought an rtx 2080 ti rags was right um he said love you guys too
i'm so sorry that rags just left he must have done that deliberately he must hate you but uh
thank you thank you very much um big difference between loki and kill manga was that loki was
adopted by his father's murderer yeah that's actually a good point in terms of uh i think
this is the thing loki has a lot to say about that in the uh in the film um it reminds me of uh do
you guys i know wolf has seen game of thrones have you seen it jay i've not well i've seen the
first season and then i forgot where i was in it and i haven't picked it back up i'm actually
sorry it's season two well it's not too much of a spoiler or anything it's theon is uh told to
appreciate uh what net stark did for him and he's he has a line where he says something like yeah
everyone keeps telling me how i should be so uh thankful to my captors um for how well they
treated me or something like that and it's kind of similar to loki's position in a way i don't know
the connection um does looking at the last jedi as a troll movie help because if you look at it
with the trash that followed it looks like ryan and kennedy we're trolling i mean there's a lot
of theories about that but i'm pretty convinced that was something they thought was great i mean
millions of people thought it was great too you know a lot of very respected channels on youtube
thought it was a masterpiece so i'm convinced that they believe they did a great piece of work and
they're not very respected anymore well yes there's been a a resurgence of i don't even know
what to call it stuff happened uh it's been fun but i have to go to work tomorrow good night
good night sir um humans come from africa apes come from europe
what didn't everybody everybody was apes at one point though right
oh whatever i don't know what the species are common ancestors whatever that seeing venom tonight
when can i expect a review uh it's at the beginning of this video but basically i'm not
doing a video on it because i can't really see much of a reason to um rags profile pic is cropped love
that floofy sheep touch i thought oh yeah well it would have been cropped because obviously it's
just the face uh shawl from x-men first class is the best most evil villain that was kevin bacon
wasn't it i can't remember his goal was sure he was like he his power was to like turn explosions
into energy and then like kill people with it or something you could also make himself younger
you could absorb that energy yeah uh fun note stain in the comics kills himself so tony won't
claim a moral victory over him by arresting him that could have been cool in the film obviously
and all i remember from first class was when they like tried to nuke the each other and then they're
like let's nuke the beach instead oh yeah the russians and like the americans just go yeah let's
nuke the beat that's a weird and then uh magneto's like no i'm gonna nuke all of you then
and then um xaviors like no don't do it and then he gets shot in the spine and then all the nukes
fall and then the russians and americans are like let us be friends now and then they completely
forget that they try to nuke the beach and yeah i hope you invite weekend warrior to efap with
you that is something i'm gonna look into because a lot of people have been asking for weekend warrior
obviously we've got to do the tro response first which we can't have a guess for that because it's
going to take so long even with me rags and wolf uh i like pineapple on pizza from my point of view
you are the heretics that's you know different uh read a response theory i guess well you know
that is an anakin quote and anakin was a bad person so there you go you're a bad person
at least he's better than the dark elf that's true and someone said isekiel so thank you all
for the donations uh i will read any any more that come through after the next video which is
going to be um specifically chosen because for one i really like predator it's like one of my
favorite films wolf is aware of it and i believe jay watched it today in prep for this so i did
you've got it nice and fresh uh jay's channel involves responding to cinema sins and that's
something we haven't covered on this podcast yet because we find like how would i explain this
cinema sins it's like a joke to us like the other people like just right or whoever else uh they
really try and come across as intellectually breaking something down and offering insight and
it's like okay let's see how accurate they were just like captain midnight was sort of going for
that cinema sin you guys you guys go ahead i got a piss real quick okay wait for you to come back
you're right no you can go ahead do it do it um so i mean what's your did you ever like cinema
sins jay was there a point where you watched some i thought this was fun when i started my i've
i've always just enjoyed watching cinema sins just sort of as background noise but i think
as soon as i started making my series which i did because i did i made it because i enjoyed the
content i wanted to sort of well basically i made it because i just sort of wanted to make something
and i thought this would be a fun thing to do and then as soon as i started thinking about
that video is more i thought yeah when you think about them too much it's much harder to enjoy
so i like it as background noise i don't really like it as uh anything more than that was there
a video that made you go hang on a minute like you like this too much the video on the force
awakens literally starts with uh you know how the opening scene of the force awakens is
snoke star destroyer moving in front of a planet and it's silhouetted in front of this
of the planet um the the first sit on that is uh jimmy says it's a shadow um and he he says
he said he describes the sun as i'm sorry i have to i have to figure out what he said because
there were lots of layers to it of just he uh he said it was a shadow when it was clearly a silhouette
and you could tell because the stars behind it you know well just yeah it's like it's like a
moon or whatever right or like a another planet or something um and he's like that's a shadow
and then he also says um when he mentions the sun he says this galaxy's sun like how can you say
the world like that's that's not what a galaxy is a galaxy if it only had one sun that would just be
that would just be a sun so you know i was thinking there are like several flaws and we're
like about two seconds in the video so that's the thing that made me go you know you know what i
think maybe this this isn't this isn't flawless movie criticism well dare i dare i ask did you
think he was flawless at one point um maybe when i was about 12 okay well because i was going to
say i remember the novelty when he first released videos i believe avengers is one of the first
films he covered and somebody sent the video to me with the tagline it's like the film is not as
good as you think it is and i remember watching it and being frustrated and being like this is
ridiculous but then as time went on i was like oh he does this to like all films and i started
kind of enjoying it just as a sort of uh i don't know someone making some you could watch a film
and then you could watch his video and be like oh yeah there's kind of a fun take on it i guess
but then it got to the point where i was just like good god the jokes are not funny anymore and um
i can't even tell how tonally i can't tell how to take his videos like i'm not sure if i should be
learning from this or if i should be just pretending nothing actually comes from a place of
intelligence or not i don't even know what he was trying to get across with it and then i
watched a bunch of videos criticizing him and i was like yeah i'm out the only video
oh i'm sorry you can go ahead the strangest thing about it is that uh when whenever he's
asked about what he's uh what he's talking why he why he does what he does he'll give different
responses just sort of depending on how the question was phrased so i've seen him say uh
oh no it's it's all satire it's all just jokes uh we don't intend to be taken seriously we're
not making actual film criticism a lot of the stuff we do is wrong and that's intentional for
satire and then in other at other interviews he'll say uh no we think that there are serious
problems with hollywood at the moment we made this series to just sort of show those problems
and uh to get across what we think the actual problems with movies are and what needs to be
fixed so how can you go into making a series with both of those viewpoints and not come out with
like you know those are conflicting ideas you can't put both in the same series or at least
the same video yeah and a lot of people started to compare his videos to his actual takes right
like he had a channel i'm pretty sure he took the channel down now where he actually like did his
initial reactions to films and they were like how come your initial reactions often reflect
these videos if your initial reactions are actual criticism and then these videos are just jokes
because that makes sense yeah so and yeah and so it's gotten to the point where i don't intend to
ever watch his videos or cover him because he's kind of a joke but he is probably the most popular
if you could call it film reviewer of sorts on youtube i'm pretty sure he has like the highest
numbers i think it i think it might be the only video or videos that i liked from him where it
was his uh i think it's like a two-part series on uh completely eviscerating the fourth transformers
movie because oh my god that movie was was not the one with megatron could transform into cubes and
i can't even remember it that movie was magical and how incompetent it was
well you really felt those two and a half hours drag well i have to like i can't you know you can
ask me the same question i just be like why did you watch it and i can't answer the question myself
but i may as well ask you well i i watched it when it came out because it was like oh they're
trying to actually do something different from like the first three which are like the exact same
thing but it gets progressively worse so i was like well maybe it'll be good and it was like no
it was so it was so much worse than the others so much worse that michael bay was like let's go back
and with the fifth one and try to rekindle all the things people still hated about the first three
but hated slightly less than number four and it was like oh and they got a fifth one as well right
that was the newest one that came out was that yeah yeah that was what that was what he did he
everything he undid pretty much everything from the fourth one including the megatron turning
into a cube cloud it's it's hard to talk about that movie because it just makes me laugh every
time i think about how retarded it was um well that was if both of you have either heard of or
know anything about but what's your take on cinema wins i i really like cinema wins i haven't seen
him i mean i know of him but i i'm just not really interested i'm just i want i want the
in between i don't i'm not a huge fan of either like i don't want to only have us like i need to
watch more of cinema wins but i think cinema wins is more accurate to the film question mark i
haven't seen enough of him to actually claim that definitively and i do like the idea that you try
and be positive about everything it's a it's a noble endeavor i suppose but i mean it's if you're
actually like if you're actively ignoring sort of writing issues just to make people feel better
about a film isn't that just as bad as ignoring the good things in a film to make it look bad if
you know what i mean i think either way when the when the premise of the show is just to point out
everything good about something people should understand that you're going to ignore the things
that are good or bad respectively so would you say that they're no worse than each other then
in a way i personally i prefer cinema ones just because generally i find it a lot easier to enjoy
a film than to dislike it um plus i think it's genuinely easier that most films will have
something that you can praise about them i mean you know you you can take uh what's that what's
a really just everyone agrees is a trash film like a room i've not i've not seen the room so i couldn't
oh my goodness i know it's on my uh it's on my bucket list you should yeah you should definitely
check that one out you'll you'll have some fun with it but um yeah no you're right there are
always ways to just argue that something's good if it has a human in it you could be like i relate
to this human because they do x y z and it's neat because they make choices above but you'll often
have to like the guy was doing with killmongers like you have to just sort of skirt around certain
things you can you don't when something is a problem it has to actually be a problem
um but as in with cinema sense format uh with cinema sense format something has to be like
actually an issue before they can really talk about it but for something to just be a win uh
it seems more like it can you can you can pray something for not being shit like you can be you
can say this could be worse and that's technically praise could you not do the reverse of that this
could have been better i mean you could but in my experience they don't do that yeah sure um but
yeah let's let's give this a shot this is actually relatively new as well that's why i was interested
because i didn't realize he hadn't covered this yet so i can see how cinema sins is doing these days
what's possibly the uh in 13 minutes or last thing oh it's for clickbait i reckon how does
it even it's a it's a big like clickbait trope to have uh a number in the title of whatever it
is but why i don't know but i mean apparently it works it gets more people to click what you do if
there's a number in the that's crazy because this is the thing i'd read the title and i'd be like
what does he mean in 13 minutes or less does he not know how long his video is you know the video
is the video is 13 minutes and 42 seconds so it's more all right yeah whatever
f**king with cheernan man die hard hunt for red october and predator even without the last action
hero 13th warrior and thomas crown affair he should be a legend and it's a sin that he's not
didn't he go to jail for tax fraud i i don't know that's probably why he's not a hero or
legend or whatever and besides i like the last action hero so screw you bad it's uh it's it's
very much a a satiry film so it may be it's complicated to argue why it's uh it's good but
yeah he's made some good films i agree was that a sin bicep oh the f**k is that a sin i don't know
i see he also made it a sin for the biceps so bicep shin oh it's a sin that he's not a legend
how is he question is he isn't he a legend because he made these films i don't know okay
why am i even bothering this this is how it's gonna be through the whole video isn't it
oh sorry i i've gone ahead a bit he should be a legend and it's a sin that he's not
bicep shin also pretend that's just like a meaningless bicep nothing that's like there
are some biceps on the screen let's say something with bi in it and that's literally like one of
the most iconic parts of the film people love this bit why would you sin it you would unsin it
you would give it negative not to mention that wouldn't be bi-ception because that would have
to be a bicep within a bicep that's that's not what this is anyways this is like a two biceps
next to each other a dual bicep pretending to be adversaries when you're really friends measuring
their dicks just for the benefit of the audience cliche he really likes the cliche thing doesn't he
yeah i'm not even is that a cliche pretending to be adversaries when you're actually friends to
measure i think i've seen it a couple of times would that have even been a cliche at the point
that this movie was made though probably not but i don't think you would care 87 this came out of
yeah of course you wouldn't care depending to be adversaries when you're really friends measuring
their dicks just for the benefit of the audience cliche what's the matter the ca got you pushing
too many pencils are they really arm wrestling in mid-air have you ever tried that it's nearly
impossible it's like ernie saw over the top well you if you are arm wrestling mid-air you need both
parties to essentially be fair and hold their uh their elbow in the same position you rely on the
other person doing it in good faith which i'm assuming because they've done this before is what's
happening it is tough to arm wrestle mid-air though he's right now that now that you think
about it there was when he referenced that cliche there was uh hon and lando when they first met
but you know but instead there is a reason for them to hate each other though and they're
not and and he actually betrays han as well that's true four months before this came out
doesn't uh doesn't i've forgotten this this guy's name uh was it dylan yes uh black guy's dylan
so uh doesn't dylan betray dutch anyway well he doesn't betray him he just tricks him he says
we're doing this for x reason and then turns out it's y and he's like well i got you to do the
job anyway i mean they're good by the end of it and yeah this is the thing we arnie assumes
they are friends there's no reason why he wouldn't assume they're friends at this point up until that
i imagine if everything had gone right then arnie would have never spoken to him after what he did
you know like that that would be too much sort of thing couldn't help himself channel my team
always brooks alone you know that i'm afraid we all have our orders major and that works well
if arnie's team lives by its rules it turns down this job and we have that's the point they accepted
the job under the assumption that they were working alone and then they throw dylan in as well
and he's like that's not the deal and he's like yeah well we all have our orders no movie so of
course they have to accept any and all last minute stipulations this is general of course he has to
accept stipulations for his general okay arnold apollo creed jesse the body man this was kind of
the expendables before the expendables felt the need to exist also how was that i said
we said the body in the future and then we just stabbed the fool's butt then like how fucking
dare you oh jesus he just points out something that's a thing he's like yeah okay cid you're
like oh governors were together in two movies this year including the running man it's like
1987 was giving a terrible warning to california in minnesota that only elon musk could have figured
out but he was only 16 and is anyone paying attention to this i i think i am but nothing's
going in my brain it's like any sign was giving a terrible warning to california minnesota and you
almost could have figured out but he was only 16 and nobody listened okay nobody was happy to do
and how of course that's a sin too okay the best jungle camouflage is face makeup designed to make
you look like you like a wrought iron fence that's halfway through being knocked over
uh someone in chat might know better than me if a monk is there he might know better than me but
i'm pretty sure that's legit that's like how you do actual covering because the idea is that um
you're not supposed to cover your entire not you're not supposed to cover all your skin
that's not the goal it's you're supposed to break it up so you don't look like a face
as in you can actually keep i know it's the it's i can't remember if it's like a british american
difference or something but i know that uh face camo stuff it doesn't have to cover every part
of your skin that's kind of this is where i'm going with this is it's supposed to break your
face up that that's the point of it i'm pretty sure this is not um not actually a thing that's
wrong but you wouldn't know that from his you know i could just google it but i don't think
i can be asked because we'll be here forever if we if we google everything he says jungle
camouflage is face makeup designed to make you look like a wrought iron fence that is halfway
through being knocked over who's our backup no such thing old buddy this is getting better
what kind of elite crew strike force alpha unit ranger seal delta team thing doesn't maybe sort
out these details i don't know before the mission begins well it looks like he assumed they did have
backup he just didn't check it i don't know is that such a big and i don't think he would have
denied the mission if he had known that previously he said he he wants to work alone that's another
thing yeah i don't know this doesn't seem like a problem but again this is interesting because
it's like so is this a legit conversation we're having right now about a flaw potentially in the
script or are you just are you joking yeah who knows okay if this is eye black to help with glare
from the sun like baseball players use you've gone too far if this is like robert downey junior and
tropic thunder you've gone way too far well that that's not as far as as robert downey junior when
no it's not specifically less far i assume it's partially a reference to the fact that he's like
billy's like you know i would have to check but i assumed especially considering his character
that he's more native american compared to the rest of them and that that could be actual like
i don't know tribal style paint that he's using instead of um he did like take off his shirt for
like no real well he's the hunter out of the group isn't he like this is yeah arguably spiritual or
something but he just references i think that would go and like go with his character but it
doesn't matter because this is a joke question but he had to beep ladies and gentlemen the former
governor of the great state of minnesota no one will be but that's that's that's the it's in the
movie it's not a real thing seated during the barely visible walking through the jungle portion
of the movie what what why was of the great state of minnesota no one will be seated during
the barely visible walking through the jungle portion of the movie what anybody what does that
mean that doesn't make any sense are you saying it's not exciting i don't know of the great state
of minnesota if i was gonna be seated during the barely visible if i was gonna make the point that
a part of the movie isn't exciting i would have made it at the like five minutes of credits at
the beginning that's just sort of over vague footage of people arriving in places no one will
be seated so as in like people are going to go get on the edge of their seat maybe yeah someone
in charge said i think he's saying it's boring it's like okay fine if that's what he's saying
fine walking through the jungle portion of the movie anything to you oh it's just another rebel
cool cool cool is anyone going to mention the pirate plank behind you
helicopter that they found this is not a plank pirate plank
is this supposed to be like an ironic joke or something why would it be pirate
i really hope this is i really hope this was intended historically but how would it
just just bear with me here what if what if that's actually noah's ark and he had a plank
so he could throw the animals off when they misbehave that would that would totally make
sense of the world of predator and this is where noah's ark landed so that's why there's a
plate i just love the idea that is um you know i'm 90 sure that's a part of the helicopter they
found but if cinema citizens convinced that there's a random pirate's plank in the middle of the set
why would there be a pirate plank i guess that's what his point is it's like you have to comment
on it's like okay the yards up here because it's super obvious and man-made utterly demands you
comment on it show off you literally landed 15 minutes ago i'm pretty sure your water supply is
doing just fine no need to bear grills the local wildlife so quickly but you'd be saving water by
doing that yeah plus that's showing what kind of character he is yeah he's he's on with nature a
little bit that's kind of the why even bother right like why even bother here grills the local
wildlife so it's a sin guys wait bird kicking i knew this man seems likely also didn't what
what why would that be unlikely they're both specialist groups that do hard task jobs and
hopper was assigned to the exact same for the exact same reasons as arnie's team was
why wouldn't yeah i i can buy that they've met you know they're both they're both ragtag teams
that do these sorts of missions that's why we would assume that they probably are aware of each
other because they'll often be chosen between but fine someone in the comment in the chat said
you're the worst predator i've ever heard of but you have heard of me i know this man seems likely
also didn't the dog tag say ce hopper maybe old jim is just fine knocking back some brew somewhere
and poor calvin iseko hopper got predatord instead oh is ce um is is that a name or a rank
couldn't he be a rank i suppose it could i don't know i genuinely have no idea but he does say
jim hopper and that does say ce hopper but uh for starters it could be that he went you know jim
was a middle name he just didn't go by other than with his friends or something or it could be a
rank i don't know but fine someone suggested corporal ensign to look corporal ensign yeah it
could be that again i'd need to talk to a military friend to be able to know that for sure actually
couldn't we just um let's just google predator we're gonna be googling half the shit for this
video i'm just curious if they've got like a full name or anything ce is not a rank it's always name
captain jim hopper was the commander of the us army blah blah blah blah um
yeah it doesn't mention like a full name or anything
i mean that could be that could be a mistake but again yeah it wouldn't fucking matter but
yeah fair enough i don't know i really i'd have to get someone else to confirm
if it's a real mistake then you know what fair enough like that's that seems to be the point of
cinema sins is to point out inconsequential stuff rather than anything game breaking
yeah that's the thing i'm like i give him that one but i don't know if it matters at all to
anything he saw a guy chopping wood two lookouts in a nest some guys eating and a headshot
assassination but he did not see any fuel dumps yes there is one but he doesn't know that and
neither do any of the rest of these guys dutch sets the truck rolling into the camp with a bomb
on it but well hang on he said he's gonna attack the fuel dump and what he means by that is send
the truck into the fuel dump as far as i know why isn't it reasonable that he would have seen it
like we only i don't this seems like a weird thing too because we're assuming that dutch would
have looked around the whole place we don't see every isn't this the area that he fires the car
into yeah i remember and he says he's going to attack the fuel dump meaning either that or
some guys eating and a headshot assassination there's some guys eating i'm pretty sure that
area is the fuel dump let's see any fuel dumps yes there is one but he doesn't know that and
neither do any of the rest of these guys dutch sets the truck rolling into the camp with a bomb
on it but no one ever sees him or looks back to see where the truck came from that's completely
reasonable they assume that the the car has just gone off his tracks they want to stop it
yeah like you know what you know what you know what i need to do right now is look over over
at the truck to see if there's anyone there yeah like a good use of my time if you see a car
run away car go past you i imagine especially if this is a place where you chill you probably the
first instinct would be like shit stop the car you would i think it's reasonable to assume that
it's gone off on its own as opposed to someone's attacking you but whatever and how convenient for
him that the old ass truck that isn't even being used as a truck anymore still has perfect alignment
and continues straight into its target it was already aimed didn't need to have perfect alignment
because it was already in position and we already knew it worked because they were using the actual
rotary to to use a well i believe i watched this film recently it's like stop trying to
these are the sids why did you guys even plan anything and you had a grenade launcher just fire
a dozen grenades in here because they fucking launched a car that exploded into a building
that killed like seven people why would you not want to open with that why yeah why why would you
fire a dozen grenades when one and get the same job done yeah why would you plan things
when you can not do that and blow shit up and they knock out with stealth all of the watch tower
people before doing the like launching grenade shit this is a very bizarre sin as well sort it
all out later jesus and yes there's a hostage they want to save but i'll be damned if anything
they've done so far shows any regard for the life of that hostage they don't even know where the
hostage is yeah i'd agree with that it's pretty reckless they could have hurt him in the in the
process but they do find out the hostage is dead anyway but no yeah i'll give them that but again
like it's a part of the genre being that they're supposed to be 80s action people which they and
they they do ask about the hostage at one point someone in the chat said why fight a battle when
you can go home there you go apparently carl weathers is a great ventriloquist because i
didn't see his lips move an inch when he said that i swear to god no one in this scene filmed
this scene on the same day this is as good a time as any to point out that the subtitles for this
movie keep switching between telling me these gorillas are speaking spanish and russia like
they're not even trying to tell me what the english would be they just keep saying speaking spanish
and speaking russian why even tell yeah that's because that's because you're not supposed to
be able to understand it's not important yeah it doesn't matter to the film whatsoever
in fact the the aspect that they're speaking russian is all we need for the plot because uh
i believe mac brings it up he says that these guys were some of these guys were russian
but the subtitles are not for people who want to know what the rest of the dialogue is just
because it's not it's not important it's just for people who can't actually hear the film for
whatever reason this is funny why even tell me the language they're speaking if i don't get to
know the words because the fact that they're russian is important to the plot not what they
say the fact that they're russian and like even if uh even if that wasn't important even if what
language they were speaking wasn't important if you're not supposed to understand the dialogue
anyway what what else should the subtitle say it's just like words yeah for all we know the
words were get them or blow them up or run away it's like do you really need that is that was that
detrimental without it i don't know tell me the language but it's interesting because he's supposed
this is a movie that's been out for what fucking coming up to 40 years like you could have you
could have given it a rewatch to know that them being russian is actually important to to dutch
in terms of figuring out what dylan's been up to but never mind they're speaking if i don't
get to know the words also why hasn't the predator killed any of these mother he took out an entire
other team of american special forces you're asking why the predator didn't assault the base
that had like fucking 30 to 40 people in it isn't he just like that's not what the predator does
yeah why would the baby maybe the new predator would do that but yeah see this is this is why
a lot of people are like does cinemasins watch these movies and you're like i think he does but
he deliberately plays dumb with a lot of this stuff he's like how could you assume these are
problems and here to save the hostages but what the predators don't know these russian spanish
assholes are here okay fine let's foolishly say he was strong enough to stay upright with the
kind of recoil that bfg would kick back still that kind of minigun spits out up to 6 000 rounds per
minute not only are there not nearly enough shells on the ground but considering we see this gun
firing for about two minutes during this i mean i'll give you this fine just who cares though
yeah it's ridiculous that he's one manning a fucking portable minigun
the only reason they get away with it in terminator is that he's a machine that could
probably actually pick it up and use it like that but you know jesse ventura is not only a man but
he actually has wounds as well it's like yeah but that's the point that the film is like look at how
ridiculously overpowered these people are and then look what happens to them when they come
up against the predator jesse ventura could probably do that i mean this is the thing we
could have who knows maybe this is a custom made minigun maybe it's just jesse ventura's magic
butcher block bloodbath the 12 000 rounds of ammunition alone would have weighed almost 900
pounds wow he actually went to that length to prove that this is a problem i'm impressed we
did we have no idea if that's like accurate at all that's actually a good point yeah for all we
know that's not true but assuming it is it's interesting you go to the lengths of those lengths
for this issue but not for like other stuff also this type of gun is so powerful it usually needs
its own dedicated power source to operate much like my college girlfriend yeah didn't you have
a backpack that could have had a battery in there but also i think that was just for a joke that's
don't be my assumption as screenwriter knows this maybe the director too but this character sure as
does not know this knock knock who's there i'm i'm a who i'm gonna go ahead and say if you take the
time to deliver a lame joke to armed men before shooting them that they will shoot you first
aren't you glad i didn't say banana but but they he caught them off guard i was gonna say one of
them was collecting papers or something and i'm pretty sure he delivered the line because he
caught them off guard but again i think that was a joke i don't know if that was a real criticism
you never know the thing the lines are so blurred with what's actual criticism what isn't
you just may as well go you can you can just as easily go oh it's uh it's terrible because
none of the criticism is valid you can also just as easily say oh it's fine because it's
not at all real criticism and this is my fucking job to talk about this shit i forgot myself here
well this is the thing this is why i can't cover cinema sins i never fucking know what the hell
you could take every criticism one way or the other it's so confusing if they're central
american i'm a goddamn chatteman too much racism there for me to even unpack uh is that racist
he's saying i didn't catch it well so he said that um if these guys are central american then
i'm a goddamn china man as in these are russians uh these a lot of them are russians so they're
obviously he can tell because base isn't the typical russian race white like this i mean i
think it might just be saying that saying just the phrasing is racist oh well is it racist because
they would typically be white people that they've just killed when central american would
make them ispanic or at least like you'd be able to tell that these people are not central
american if they were russian and then he says what's what's like the complete opposite of
of uh black skin he'll be like well white or china would obviously be pretty fucking different
so he's just he's only commenting on the fact that it's pretty clear
that uh they aren't uh the race that they assumed they were but i guess no it's racist smaller it's
super this is kind of my point is like is pointing out race racist someone just said in the chat it's
the current year it just it's not a it's not a comment from mac to be racist he's literally
pointing out quickly how they know that these people aren't central american i think it just
might be about the language i mean he never i think it might just be about the language he
chose but like i don't know i don't i don't know if that's considered a racist oh do you think it's
chinaman like he considers that to be a slew is it i don't know if i've like it's one of those
things i've just never really been aware of because i've only ever really heard it used
like properly like uh so i don't know if it's like a slur or anything yeah that's interesting i don't
i don't know if i just assumed chinaman meant a man from china a lot of racial a lot of racial
slurs start out being like literal descriptions of the place that the person is wrong with that
all right well if if that is a slur then fair enough i had no idea i think it's technically
like supposed to be or at least technically looked at nowadays as a slur because it's used
in regards to like all asian people oh okay yeah that could make sense but i mean it's so
inconsequential and means so little it's not worth bringing up he doesn't like he doesn't
ever bring up real like proper social issues he'll always just say like for any any social
issues give me like sexism homophobia racism whatever he will genuinely just cover it all by
saying like that's racist interesting that he said too much racism there for me to even unpack
sin it three times and let's move on like okay i don't know if he's making a legitimate point
there like is he actually even if it was racist though what would it matter i mean this was made
31 years ago i mean to be fair you can't just like brush stuff away by going oh it's like
it's of its time what do you expect but yeah we can we can i i would happily admit that it's um
a slur if it actually is used like that i just didn't know but i'm interested to hear his take
on this he's seeming i don't know if this i just want to listen to the way he words this is he like
serious about it if it's essential american i'm a goddamn chatham too much racism there for me to
even unpack sin it three times and let's move on no see if it is just a slur how is that too much
to unpack that count that's just does that mean he's referring he's probably referring to more
than just that then i don't know is he i mean if it is i think we're really too far into this
i was gonna say we've clearly put more thought into this than he ever would have considered so we
may as well move on traces get the men ready to move i'm arnold schwarzenegger and this is my
thinking face behold how much it appears as if i'm thinking son of a bitch okay
respond to that like honestly i'll give you that one because that made me laugh
what i like does does arnie not portray that he's thinking there is that uh i mean that that's kind
of the charm of it i mean you listen to some of his lines and you can clearly tell that the accent
is kind of getting in the way of it like um coming across naturally i guess but that's kind
of part of the charm of arnold schwarzenegger i mean if that's what the point of this is like
arnold isn't a very good actor dig you'd be like all right fine if i did i did really enjoy just
his accent in this film it contributed it made a lot of people say that uh predator is one of the
like the films where arnie does his best acting and as far as i'm concerned he's he's not bad in
the film he's like i wouldn't say he's bad compared to like you know mr frieze you can't
you can't bring up mr frieze and be like oh it's better that's like bringing up the dark elf again
kill longest better than here's as if i'm thinking son of a bitch is dug in like an alabama tick you
mean nick saber my men are not expendable what who's nick saber i don't know anyone in
chat want to tell us who nick saber is son of a bitch is dug in like an alabama tick you mean
nick saber my men are not expendable let me look it up lick saber also laughing at my men are not
expendable they're like i don't know you're saying why would you you're saying it's funny
because they get killed so it's a football coach at alabama at university of alabama what
this is the wrong nick saber i don't know that's the only one that comes up no so would you i don't
know enough about american football would it be like to be dug in in american football would be
i don't know enough about football to really everyone's saying is a football coach so it must
be that sinuses literally just uploaded everything wrong with deadpool 2 i'm gonna cover that soon
air surveillance says we got gorillas all over the place we never see any more gorillas the
rest of the film just fyi because they're running away from them they point this out
this guy has the stabbing sensitivity of data from star trek the next generation how did he
expertly stab the scorpion went out stabbing any of this guy because he's a fucking trained army
you don't have to be trained to like stab a scorpion he clearly felt it like the knife clearly
went in him a little bit so yeah but also hang on he said how did he how did he do that without
stabbing any of this guy's shirt or flesh i could probably do that yeah i reckon i could do that
mac was chewing gum in the scene he's put gum on the end of the knife as well
that would make it a lot blunter compared to an actual knife just fyi
yeah that doesn't seem like i think i would be able to do that
of all the things they do in this film that doesn't seem that unlikely
my shirt or flesh exactly how many times has he done this before
i'm sunny landom and this is my laughter noise behold how much it sounds as if i am laughing
making someone in front of someone for their laugh all right
okay yeah over a minute and 12 seconds of predator vision which is basically black screen
with some sporadic thermal splotches barfed up onto the image this is basically blindness if you
ask me yeah well the whole point is that we have no idea what it is and it's supposed to be tension
suspense and then he walks right up to the scorpion implying that he was he's in the
position now that we just saw our main character yeah did you mention i mean yeah sure he could
say oh it doesn't look very good one years ago
wouldn't seeing only heat signatures and hearing only garbled audio put you at a fairly large
disadvantage that's the point the predator does have a disadvantage hang on surely though i was
saying this and just thinking it's showing that he has different senses to what we have
true well he's saying that like isn't this vision not even that great and it's like it's precisely
how arnie nearly defeats him up until the end like it's it's not very fun if your enemy is 100
percent impossible to defeat so his weakness is that he views everything through heat signatures
like lots of lots of species have different senses like this isn't
don't dogs have really bad eyes eyesight and really good smell isn't that
well he's saying like it puts you at a fairly large disadvantage overall it's like but the
predator kills the wall except what yeah i don't think it's that much of a disadvantage
there's such a weird point there's so many ways you could break that down
this movie is 85 people silently walking through the woods while tense music plays
yeah except for all the other stuff i agree so don't you kind of get the sense the predator is
with him he easily dispatched the team set before that he's been watching them since they arrived
but it's yes that's literally what he's doing he's a small killer he'll do it one at a time
he does not want to just kill them if he if his only goal was to kill them as fast as possible
yes he would have attacked them by now don't you get the sense that the predator is fucking with
them yes that's literally exactly what he's doing that's why i get the sense of that plays recordings
of themselves to them like of course he's fucking with them i mean if all he wanted to do was kill
things he could have just used his shoulder rocket and blown up all the the whole camp
beforehand if you wanted to kill things he probably didn't like he probably brought like
actual mass destruction weapons to us that's the thing he doesn't he's not interested in
simply killing he wants to fucking fight them and please note that the first person he kills
is the person who runs off for good reason but they still he waits for them to be separated
before starting it's like again so many ways to break that down instead of laser offing these
kill mongers he's just watching them march through the jungle he's like a horror movie ghost
fucking around for a while instead of just immediately killing the ones needing yes that
is the point god damn it congratulations you figured out what the plot is we can't
pull this one at his accuracy exactly uh comma major or it's nothing major laziest escape attempt
ever basically she might as well have blown air on the guy or tickled him great whistle by ernold
here let's slow that down and admire how he makes that noise without god like to me i'm just like you
must be desperate dude like you're like oh this adr dubbing exists this is the thing
adr is in like every film i do adr technically speaking for my videos right i'll like
if i fuck something up i'll re-record and it's like oh i didn't say that originally obviously
my face isn't on screens you can't necessarily tell but it's okay dude it's okay i don't ever
want even moving his lips why is predator making these clicking noises and giving away its position
right before it attacks what difference did it make why like do oh okay let's say he did it for
excitement he did it to creep out his prey he did it to distract the person because they were
confused does it matter that's just a noise it makes yeah it could genuinely be how it breathes
who knows ah red paint there's no blood how the do you know that what do you mean how does he know
that she hasn't got any wounds she's not mortally wounded yeah god he's
he's a fascinating channel because you start to wonder it's like how the hell did you get popular
and it's like well uh do would you argue it's like he's absorbed every single person who didn't
like every film he's covered and now he's pretty much just got everyone yeah i think yeah there
is a lot about of just especially films people haven't seen is i think there are ones that are
like really get people in because if you haven't seen predator you'd just be like yeah this all
sounds uh pretty reasonable um uh so and you do see you know like a lot of the comment sections
people going like oh i guess i won't bother with this film then i'm like no i never get that why
would you because this is the thing some people like you should cover cinema sins more because
he has an impact and it's like well if i don't know about your take on this but can you believe
the idea that people watch his videos and go yep this film is probably bad i struggle to think of
any intelligent people watching his videos in general i i mean this is the thing you could
i totally had to start watching it casually you're just being like eh this is kind of fun
but to actually be like okay this is legitimate criticism and predator is clearly a flawed movie
you're like wow it's like you're gonna watch it like no a lot of the people watch you watch it
i get this i get this said to me a lot just like um why do you take this channel so seriously it's
all just jokes and i can get why people like watch it for that reason i mean my response to that was
always just why do you assume i'm taking it seriously why do you see my video and immediately
assume my video isn't just jokes but that's a whole different like kind of worms but i think
like the majority of his audience don't really take what he says seriously well that that's the
thing right so i think one of the first things we talked about was how i've never assumed that
cinema sins actually hates these films i've just assumed he wanted to try and cover the bad in
every film and if that's his goal fine whatever but people are taking it as if these films are
bad which i don't know if he if he paints every single film with the same brush then obviously
there is no standard we would assume right i mean though he does you can tell when he specifically
really doesn't like a certain film oh i'm just gonna add like five extra sins here just because
i'm still watching this piece of shit like he will say stuff like that if he really doesn't like a
film or if actually this thing is unpopular and he thinks like that's what people want to see
genuinely can't understand watching it for fun that's fine but people who take it as a review
of a film is just woof and this is the thing to reassure anybody who's listening those people
exist and it's the reason why jay's channel exists it's like we need to need to help these
people understand that um like a lot of the lot of the defenses is oh it's just jokes and then
you'll look at a clip and it's just he gets something wrong about the film by taking something
out of context and he says something that isn't really true like how is that a joke or satire
that's it's just wrong and like yeah that's the thing it's like it's almost like uh the other
people will say it's my opinion over on cinema sins you'd be like but it's satire it's a joke
it's a he'll need he'll just has to say a word that means what you said is invalid
yeah anyway let's see what else he's got major you better take a look at this you better take
a look at this cliche just god damn it look at arnold's outfit here it's pristine no sign of dirt
sweat blood or anything else you'd think you just spent the day watching nfl red zone and not you
know blowing up a gorilla compound after crawling in the dirt and sneaking through the jungle for
i mean yeah i can kind of agree with that should have should have put a bit of shit on
him there to be like you know a bit of a bit of rubble and dust and whatever else this actor is
too clean for my liking couple hours all painless is waiting animal fakeout jump scares are the most
annoying jump scares i don't think it was a jump scare i remember that part it's not a jumps it
just pans over or at least cuts over i mean you could tell it was like building up to something
but i don't think it a jump scare is what it was building up and even then again 31 years ago it
wouldn't have been a cliche even if that was meant to be a jump scare and on top of that it's
distraction as well because the predator does kill him seconds after this the president doesn't
really understand like the concept of what makes a cliche a cliche in the first place he just says
it's a cliche as though this movie was made yesterday the thing is what the tension would
have been real for the for that i've forgotten his name as well i don't know blame i think the
character is so the tension would have been actually real for him because he's hearing
like rustling in the jungle while he knows he's being stalked he the music reflects how he's
feeling and then he's like oh it's okay it's just a thing yeah for me it's contextual and
like i said this is not a fake out basically it's like there's rustling oh it's just an animal and
then it pans up and the predator's there and it fucking kills him like to me i'm like that seems a
bit maybe he's gonna cover that this is the greatest squandering of ammo ever put to fill
he skipped it okay he did love your cinema sense in under a minute good thing all these weapons have
the unlimited ammo cheat code activated on them well i'd say again context so blaine is killed
his clearly best friend goes nuts and fires the minigun into the forest trying to tag
whatever he just saw which looked to be like a fucking ghost and obviously the team catch up
with him and just join in the fire again because like why not i i suppose you i i could understand
it's wasteful i just i don't really what's the point of this is to the point this is to show that
the predator survives it not only that but uh there's there's a sort of meta element to this
that i hesitate to use against someone like cinema since i don't think he'd accept it but
this is supposed to be this is how you solve problems in 80s action movies as an actual
cliche at this point like you just watch commando and a bunch of other films um and it works as it
did in the compound earlier but this does not work on the predator they they they brawn their weaponry
is useless against the predator or you know it does tag him in fairness but that's again more
interesting than not tagging him at all i would argue but fair enough otherwise shooting this much
without a target in sight might be considered wasteful this prisoner girl that is somehow being
held captive with a couple zip ties is the only one to see the going how how is that somehow being
held captive like you can't get out of those he's gonna say you can't just tear off zip ties
i dare you to try jeremy uh but that's that's interesting it's like oh somehow she's the only
one who manages to spot this it's like yeah that could happen yeah that's true why shouldn't she be
the only one who notices that it's not like it's it could happen i'm not you know you could be like
why didn't the um the team find it they go and look where everyone was shooting this this shit
was quite close to them if i remember weren't they a little preoccupied with something else at the
time to notice like some weird green shit on a leaf it's literally like if i to try and get
super nerdy on you i believe they're in a group and it's a little bit forward and to the left is
where the blood is and they go and search off into the middle right and they say they can't see
anything and then as they leave she picks up this like it's believable enough logistically i think
but i will happily admit it's a little bit of a stretch there you go alien blood on the leaf and
because she's seen terrible decisions in sci-fi movies before she's gonna that's not a terrible
decision she's fine i mean she's curious about the luminescent blood i don't know to be fair if
i saw something green and louis like if i saw some green luminous fluid my first instinct
probably wouldn't be i'm gonna touch that no same i would probably be like i'd want to play
with it a little bit move it around poke it i don't know i'd probably get a stick and put like
see if the stick disintegrates what i would say is like this may have been a valid problem to have
if the blood did something but it all it does is allow her to tell them later that it's bleeding
so like who cares if she touched it doesn't actually have any effect on the film whatsoever
yeah i mean i guess i guess the same could just be her first instinct when seeing
when seeing a green glowing goo is to touch it but i mean they've just shot the predator
it's like he's trying to say that this is on par with uh i can never remember the character's
name but you know the guy shoving his face inside the alien egg and and that uh the uh
face hugger comes out and implants the alien in his chest and oh yeah it's not the same you're
touching some weird green stuff on a leaf you're not well this is the thing is he like i'm totally
willing to discuss any flaws the predator film has but you never know if this is like should
this be discussed or is this just a joke one or are we does this even matter and you're like probably
not i'm bill duke and this is my sad face behold how much it appears is if i am sad
and what any any any takes on that one i got nothing i'm bill duke and this is my sad face
behold how much it appears is if i am sad he's like is the sin that he's not really sad and
that it's just pretend is he saying is this bad acting yes the film is that his point bad acting
is do you think it's bad acting well no i think it's good acting i think it's fine i guess he's
saying is bad in order to be as dexterous with these tools and machines as possible wouldn't
you think this creature might shave down those finger claws a bit i'm just saying someone needs
a critic here where's the girl i could waste several minutes debating which of these fools
is more to blame for the girl disappearing dude they they they was tripped wires for whether
or not the thing that's been hunting them has just been activated of course they lost track of the
girl it's also pitch black like come on and it doesn't even there's no effect on the plot because
she stays which is actually important to how she's developing as a as a captive in the film but
ultimately it's mine using the trees um duh why would they assume why would you assume that
why would they assume their enemy is using trees
of course we know because we get the perspective of it but fuck it l the predator is actually
surrounded by a barrier of impenetrable trees yeah oh reference you've been very good with the
memes today i don't know what it was duh duh duh she speaks english but setting aside how and why
she speaks english why did she wait so long to reveal it to her captors why was she trying to
escape she was trying to escape and then because of the predator she decides to work with them
that is in the film even then what why would she need to reveal it to them it was what reference
what i mean what uh relevance would it be to be like oh hey i speak english by the way it's
like okay you're still our prisoner these people have captured me i'm gonna be as helpful to them
as possible that's what i mean she tries to escape up until the predator reveals itself
and then she's like okay fuck it i'm with you guys yeah why why is this a sin there's no reason
for anna to suddenly change and be helpful other than yes there is no reason for it to suddenly
be helpful oh come on this is probably the stupidest point he's made so far
like you know what i mean like how did you not watch the film
she actually helps when they send up the next traps she's actually helping them
it's like ah he did the all i pulled out my knife and it seems like i might tell you i don't
understand how you could have you could see this film and say there's no reason for someone to
like even if even if she was completely inconsequential like a completely different
thing that she was changing her mind on that would have no relevance to the fact that the
predator is there if you're in mortal danger you're gonna just change your mind about stuff
like being presented with something that could kill you is going to change your mind on stuff
regardless of what it is apparently not apparently for all cinema sins understands about the film she
is the predator that'll be a sin in coming but i'm actually cutting a free trick if it bleeds
we can kill it yeah i guess i mean maybe it wasn't blood at all maybe she saw alien earwax
or snot she literally says to him it when when the big man shot it it bled or something like that
all the information he has from her is that it bled he hasn't even seen the glowing blood
shooting shooting it could have made it sneeze i guess
maybe it's space gasoline powering some kind of space suit gizmo true true actually but
you'll catch the important part of what dutch says if it bleeds we can kill it if that's true
it bleeds so uh yeah maybe it was space gasoline powering some kind of space suit gizmo i thought
wow he slowed this bit down didn't he point is jumping straight to blood with silly jumping from
there straight that's just kind of borderline certified necessary for copyright is it not
no i mean you he you can you can show i think it's up to nine seconds before you'll get hit with
an auto bob but like he obviously wanted to just show the bit where he says the line instead of
playing anything else because he never usually shows a clip this slowly they say nine seconds
but i mean in my experience i mean i got um hit i've been hit i think three or four times for
two how to train your dragon movies and for the emoji movie of all things because i would
want to clean that as mine as well uh so yeah it's and i didn't use clips longer than nine seconds
in any of those videos so i don't know yeah i don't i don't always know the definitive rules
i had a lot of trouble with the jurassic world video but so i just i just tried to use as like
as little as possible of the actual film but like he didn't need to do this for this bit considering
all the other stuff he's shown in there i mean i guess but yeah i just find it funny because he's
played it so slowly that's our old pal pretty updo during this oh so exciting jungle sneer
setting montage is there any reason for them or us to believe he isn't watching them lay all these
traps um isn't he uh doing stuff with um one of their bodies like he just captured Blaine's body
he would have had uh hawken's body from earlier and we know from seeing the film that he uh skins
them and cleans their skulls so we can naturally assume that he's doing that and the pred is not
going to see what they're doing really he's only going to see them working on something he doesn't
that's the point he doesn't actually understand the wood or the the lines and that's why it works
on him because he doesn't Dutch actually says this he says he can probably see their tripwires
but he can't see this so you won't quite understand what they're doing yeah and as we know he doesn't
like to attack them unless they're alone which is the next time he attacks is when dutch is alone
oh she literally went from prisoner and zip tie cuffs to speaks english now and is helping with
the physical labor this answers his question from earlier because she doesn't want to die and that's
the sin yeah what a what a crazy thing that a human would want survival that doesn't make any
sense stuff in 60 seconds what makes you think he's gonna come in through here their trip well
i also like that he brought up the zip ties again yeah he really he's got a thing for zip ties
apparently doesn't every tree for 50 yards this is the only way in okay first of all in to what
where you are what makes you certain it's after you when it's spent all day what makes you so
sin it's after you what i mean it's only killed two people in your group already and someone just
highlighted as well yeah the healing scene is um just before they start making all this
this shit so we can just naturally assume it's doing that too and when it's spent all day
watching you build these traps and never once tried to kill you again they were all together
and that's precisely why dutch tries to go out on his own why aren't you watching the film they
watching you build all these traps and never once tried to kill you second of all you were in a
jungle you're not on like a skinny island or peninsula you're in a jungle that thing could
easily go around and ignore your 50-yard trees and this dialogue is almost offensive yeah but
it does get hit with the trap so dutch was right i don't even know at this point
dutch's assumption was correct is what i'm saying it's like the film proves him right so i don't even
know why he's saying this the demon who makes trophies of man we just call that the oscars
dutch is that a sin i mean i guess it's just it's just a joke i guess like yep
double dutch look how far out here dutch has wandered beyond their traps into the middle of
the supposed battlefield and nothing so the predator either doesn't want to win or doesn't
want to win yet but he gets caught seconds later why why sure enough though after all these hours
spent setting obvious traps out in the open the predator does choose that moment to show up like
he chooses the very moment that someone decides to go off on their own just like he's been doing
this whole time weird that isn't it almost like the predator does it by design such a strange piece
of continuity that's how well he knows the story beats he's busted up pretty bad major i can make
it um leave it right you're fighting an alien that can blend into the forest no what do you mean
leave seriously he's actually saying that they should have left him did you catch the part at
the beginning that you made fun of when dutch said none of us are expendable so he made fun of
that because it seems like apparently they are expendable and now he's disagreeing saying no
you should be expendable don't get him don't get him at all background the wounded are all on their
own as far as i'm concerned he didn't kill you because you weren't armed no sport he's right but
it kind of ruins the fun that he's right and there's no good reason he should have figured
that out on his own anyway but whatever movie's gotta earn why not i mean it's just it's it's
more of an assumption than a hard truth but i'm i'm cool with it i mean there's a lot of little
things that would give you the impression that this thing isn't simply like hunting them to eat
them or whatever but like it is curious trophies out of their bodies yeah and it's curious that
he didn't kill her that's auntie's assumption it's like why wouldn't he kill her it's like well she
was weaponless because she was our captive like that could be something someone in the chat said
you guys are all you guys all have autism predators want your final fluid come on
oh god we're not judging this with the new film in mind no if the predator is this visible while
not even moving how did it set off that trap earlier right next to dutch and he didn't see
it honestly once you know what you're looking for i'm not sure this came well this obviously
well they don't know what they're looking for they die when they see it
this is gonna say the person who just found this thing is about to be made it's just just fyi
i'd take a severed arm continuing to shoot a semi-automatic weapon as much as the next
guy but that finger definitely came off the trigger when it bounced
that's it after all that billy build up we don't even get to see another unrealistic fight with
outdated visual effects did you just answer your own question did you just answer his own question
why don't we get to see it awkward i'm sorry but like yeah no we didn't need to see that fight the
point is very clear they're leaving the big like they don't want to show the predator as much until
the end is what i'm getting yeah the big fight is between arnie and the predator not between billy
and the predator not only that but this is sold first for the horror factor not for we want to
see our hero go out with a bang it's um do you guys remember like uh they're running and then
we see billy like this and then you just hear him scream and they all turn around and they just
stare down the like the alley because they know the predator's coming for them next honestly i
think leaving it to the audience's imagination is much more effective i i would agree with him if
not for how this film progresses we get our payoffs with the predator with arnie not with billy
yeah really just gonna schlock block us like that
wait what that predator plasma cannon thingamajig blew a hole the size of minnesota in jesseventura
and blew the right hook clean off apollo creek it blows through flash but it doesn't quite blow
through steel as effectively as flash what are the odds of that what did it hit on him it hit his gun
and it blew up the gun all right i didn't i didn't see that and he's like it blows through flash
easily why can't it blow through guns as easily it's like because when i was watching this i was
thinking the same thing but i just didn't yeah it destroys dutch's gun that's what makes him go caveman
mode as well because he doesn't have any weapons no how is it leaving dutch here with just a flesh
wound because the gun blew up and the shards of the metal went into his arm making him bleed
yes very simple
classic shorts and airline and all but exactly as she's supposed to do when she does indeed arrive
survive get in it get in it what is what is what is that question what get get to the place that
we can leave from what does does he think that she's gonna see the helicopter and then she's
gonna stop and then a mass effect style wheel is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen it's
gonna be like get in the chopper or stand still i can't even believe that's the question he's
asking he's like what the fuck is she gonna do with a chopper it's like escape why would she do that
i like the idea of her arriving there just going if only i'd been given more instructions
you know this video makes a lot more sense if we assume that jeremy thinks that she wants to die
like all of the questions he's had about it if she wants to kill herself this all makes sense
well this is an annihilation so we can't apply that logic there we go make much more sense
oh hey guys i know i'm just a local gal with the look at all the shrapnel's right there
not only that but he's saying so she gets to the chopper and she says i'm a local gal with the
blood of your colleagues all over my shirt and all but i was distinctly told to get to this chopper
so all aboard um she directs them back to dutch and they save him at the end and yet she knows
their names so she can actually confirm that she was with them and that some things killed them
all while she was held captive she has information she can use she can speak english why is this hard
to believe i don't understand oh but i was distinctly told to get to this here choppa so
all aboard predator already shot him he's crawling because the predator shot him so why is the
predator doing nothing right now whilst he crawls towards a weapon uh did catch the power he said
about sport right didn't he already answered that same question earlier yes this guy's dumb
as arnie flies off the edge you can clearly see he is above the trees and rocks but of course when
he lands he has somehow been transported to above water my question is why even let the pov shot go
on long enough to see the ground below yeah i can agree with that yeah i suppose i i think you could
probably edit it so you didn't have that one bit to help continuity that's fine i mean i know this
was made at a time when you were probably editing with rocks and sticks and such but jeez why make
it so obvious this stuntman looks nothing like arnold and i think the movie is kind of really
can't see his face oh man here we go i'm about to on one of the coolest and most iconic moments
in movie history first of all the mud is almost certainly not cold enough to lower or mask his body
temperature enough to make him invisible to the pret how do you know that you don't know that the
mask strictly works as a as heat temperature detectors work on on earth it's alien technology
maybe that's the predator see him through through like trees earlier like i'm willing i'm willing
to accept it the um i find it hard to believe that the the the mud was enough and if you look
at like the palm of his hand you can actually see the mud isn't covered enough so that should bring
up like a little red dot or whatever but yeah like this this is obviously the film is saying
whatever happened to arnie with this mud it was enough to fool the sensors on the predators thing
that that's what the movie's saying second of all even if it were cold enough he didn't coat his skin
fully or properly third even if the mud were cold enough and evenly enough applied all over dutch
from him crawling on it that doesn't mean the predator would be blind to dutch it just means
the dutch shape he sees is now a different more blue color colder than the branches and rocks or
warmer and not the same color as humans normally read but still the predator should see it dutch
size blob right in front he does they show it in the film and he mixes in with the rest of the
background i'm not even kidding you can watch this i would pull it up but it's a really cool
part of the film where the predator scans past and you can see dutch's arm and his face mixed
in with a bunch of trees and shit and you're like the predator doesn't distinguish it he just looks
past he's like nothing's here but obviously he's probably gonna leave that bit out fourth what
about his eyeballs doesn't at least some heat radiate from the eyes oh there's a substance on
me that might have blinded my foe i shall acquire some from my shoulder to take a closer look so the
audience knows for sure why this happened yeah and then arnie actually says he couldn't see me
they do work their ass off for the audience to understand what's happened even though it's
pretty obvious but you know again that's a very small problem the good news is at least they
didn't make him actually verbalize he couldn't see me damn it if you knew the psychopathic alien
hunter was trying to track you down and somehow figured out that mud kept him from seeing you
wouldn't you just slatter that stuff on before going anywhere i think the assumption is that the
predator has given up on him assuming that he exists and arnie understands that and that's why
he has to call him back because he's like i'm not actually dead but i suppose to be safe you should
probably put the mud on sure he just fell off a cliff and the predator went down the cliff as
well and couldn't find him yeah so i wouldn't if i was a predator at that point i would not assuming
yeah it's pretty unlikely that he'd be alive the predator was like yeah he's definitely fucked
in fact maybe he did notice arnie saw that he was cold and thought he was dead
that you know you could put it that way that's that's an interesting way to look at it i suppose
just saying if it were me i'd be so covered in mud it would look like mr hankie was going out
for a jungle stroll you might think this is where the movie went full home alone but that only shows
how young you are because this movie is where home alone got all its initial ideas from home alone
was literally pitched as predator with a kid i doubt that i have no idea i i don't think that's true
yeah it'd be unlikely i think but i'd like to see that movie maybe this is a joke again this is one
of his trademark jokes would you would you watch a home alone predator crossover where uh where
the kid has to fight against the traps against predator i mean i i would give it a shot if if the
predator was played by danny devito that's that's when i'd be involved you could call it child
predator oh dear who are we gonna say oh no kevin spacey kid in the suburbs also once again very kind
of the predator to peace out for a long stretch of time so dutch can booby trap he thinks he's dead
arnie has to call him back okay watch the film dude this is getting annoying
section of the jungle in broad daylight let's talk about how dutch tied this vine to this log
he wrapped it around one end over and over and then tied a knot above that and somehow that
multi-ton log hasn't simply fallen straight down out of that not secure wraparound vine
condom i don't i don't think jeremy's ever seen a condom i don't even what was he saying that it's
impossible that he could have tied the vines to the the log to make it go up the way he tied it
maybe wouldn't have held it which i can i can get behind that i guess yeah i did i i was about to
say like i completely agree but the film is telling us he did a knot that did that like whatever we
just move on someone in the chat pointed out why does it matter if it's daylight or the predator
doesn't see in that vision anyway yeah that's true daylight or not doesn't matter i guess
he just wanted to point out that it was daylight i don't know just do any of the characters know
that the predator has that kind of vision though i guess we assume that arnie figured it out at
that point but he was the same color as all of his surroundings anyway the mud yeah so we had
we had choice maybe he just thought you know i'm the same color as the background that's why he
didn't see me and that's why he doesn't keep the mud on as well because he doesn't realize that
it's working as heat camouflage at night in the jungle when he knows an alien kill bot with heat
vision is hunting him he's not though he thinks he's dead like how many times do i have to say
this arnie calls him back because he thinks he's dead and he's gone heat vision fire here in a bit
when all his traps are ready he's going to roar into the jungle to draw the predator to it and
my point is why why would he do you want to save the line again i mean yeah i guess i may as well
uh the predator thinks he's dead the predator is a different part of the jungle with his trophies
so when arnie calls him back he goes to the source of the sound are we done is that enough
never need to do that with this f***ing signal fire going yeah no unless he chose to test fire
that into the most rotten deadest tree on planet earth this arrow is a lie i guess that tree was
rotten and dead i guess yeah sure you can you can shoot a bow and arrow into a tree and it'll stick
right uh probably probably not with what those arrows and that bow is but i mean who cares it's
just supposed to be a point about how powerful it is like again these are very i don't want to say
the word nitpick because it's just everywhere they are nitpicks and that's the point they are
things instead of saying that i'll just say they are things that do not matter they don't these
things do not affect anything else they just think it's like the adr thing it's like yeah that's a
thing it really is so it's the point though to be because if it was if it was talking about stuff
that really mattered um you can see that the last jedi video i personally have quite mixed
feelings about the last jedi i don't hate it as much as luke but he doesn't mention any of the
things that you would actually consider i mean no he mentioned he mentions like he doesn't think
luke has been done justice and that he most of his complaints are just sort of um he complains
a lot about the fact that fuel is a central plot element he says like oh why why is fuel
suddenly an element when it's never really been mentioned before in star wars and you're like can
can you actually talk about the the film and the things that are wrong with it i mean you don't
have to convince me that he would have made a bad video on the last jedi considering this but
i mean there's a reason i stopped watching his videos right i've not exactly gotten a
resurgence of like yeah i should watch more of this because this just makes me annoyed
of all the evil things predators have done i think killing a platypus might be the evilest
well even if i buy that whole mud on your skin thing applying it directly next to a raging fire
seems counterintuitive also what is he looking at did he find a mirror out here
all the the things he just said i'm just like do i do we need to respond i think at this point i
just want to get to the end all right i swear if chris hansen popped out right now i take off 50
wouldn't all these explosions be counterproductive for the predators heat vision probably wouldn't
whatever the predator version it's panicking because something's attacked it it can't see so
it's firing everywhere i don't think it gives a shit if it can see or not because it's enemies
yeah because it can't see them anyway exactly but sure i better be careful shooting these
these explosives or i might be able to see it even less than not at all he's asking why wouldn't
they have developed a weapon that would have been more non-explosive i mean i guess but still i mean
it's super effective though and it seems judging from the rest of the film it looks like that
system does not get in the way of the predator's vision even a little bit humans can't see through
explosions and we use explosives as well that's a good point actually we use rocket launches that
we can't see through them but we use them so kind of smith and wessoners have developed a more
non-explosive weapon system oh no the predator's unfair space laser is broken that's too no it's
space laser still works it's it's invisibility thing that got broken there he uses the plasma
caster again in a moment so a bit awkward who needs breadcrumbs when the alien antagonist
is bleeding in intervals this regular yeah it's kind of weird that you know you wounded the the
enemy that bleeds luminescent blood and you were able to track that that's just
like when something is wounded blood comes out of there like that's how that's how cuts work
easily killing him here the predator traps his skull instead of easily killing him because he
wants to have a one-on-one fight with him did you watch the film come on man oh wait he actually
he actually says it because he wants to fear fight i'm assuming there's still a problem then throws
him against a tree then leaves him and walks away and takes off his mask because he wants to fight
fair here at the end now that he's fought unfair the whole movie to wipe everyone else out and i
wouldn't say that i think it's more to do with the fact especially when he takes a close look at dutch
he's fascinated by how this thing managed to do this much damage to him and so he wants to prove
that he's still better than him i was saying it when i was watching as a like a respect thing
like you seem like a noble adversary i'll take you on yeah like i'm not going to use my fucking op
weapon to knock you out i'll fight you normally like and he still beats the shit out of him up
until he gets the the upper hand with the log under dutch beside this is backed up in predator
two um this is a thing they have respect for their enemies that's a thing predators do obviously
it's ruined in the new predator film but we we don't we don't talk about that yeah the only
predator movies i've seen are this and alien versus predator movies i you need to see predator
two and predators they would be the remaining ones that people would probably recommend do not see
the new one it is so awful i'm probably going to watch it at some point just for the uh just for
the the comedy alien and honestly he can right the hell off this does mean that the predator has
found a suitable mate right that's where this seductive strip tease is heading no why does
some predator look like he still sees in heat vision and other times it just looks completely
red if i didn't know better i think you were just cycling through cool 80s video effects
probably because yeah he's they don't actually have an alien vision piece of technology that
they were using they just i mean i guess they could have used an actual infrared camera my
assumption by the way this is just going from what we see in the film is that predators do see
in heat vision and the mask basically like what would you call it like um focus is it
i think so that's what i assume we because it's really blurry when he has the mask off
compared to when he has it on that's just like glasses that's what i got from it
sex and making it up as you go you don't have to read predator ease to know a good old-fashioned
pointless bomb countdown when you see one that actually bugged me in this just uh how much how
much the bomb countdown felt like an actual bomb oh yeah you know that the film wants us to believe
that arnie could pick up that it's a bomb and like it's a completely alien piece of technology
but it still goes beep beep yeah beep especially if you're if you're kamikaze-ing why would you
want that to happen uh like why would you want it to beep at all i don't know why would you like a
delay oh i guess to give time for friendlies to get out of the area potentially i don't know
it could it could still be a respect thing again but yeah yeah because we assume that the reason
he nukes himself is to prevent any predator gear from falling into the hands of humans basically
because it definitely gives arnie enough time to escape so we assume that the predator was okay
with that happening but he did kind of look like when when he was doing it he did kind of make a
ha ha face of i'm gonna get you know with my explosion that's yeah that's to be interpreted
i always looked at it as um you're not getting my shit like you won but you still don't really win
because you know how the predator makes trophies of his enemies it's like you can't make a trophy
of me bitch actually i guess that that makes sense and this is the thing for all we know
um you know the the beeping like that might have been optional he might be able to instant nuke it
he might be able to set it for an hour and he just decided to set it so arnie could get out of it
i don't know what we've seen of his technology i would guess that that's the case and yeah there's
a lot of inference to do and that's why predator's fun is a very it's a movie that doesn't answer
much of anything it's just like what do you think that this is all about and you're like can you
make it make sense or because what you can do is uh assume stuff that's contradictive or assume
stuff that makes sense the the what we're displayed really isn't contradictive at all
which is just uh only if you interpret it one specific way oh there's a couple of people
saying that i'm writing the movie uh for it which is a criticism i have for uh people approaching
the last jedi i i've literally said several times it's inference you can absolutely do that
if someone infers like like like jay just did it's like why would the the thing do that it
wouldn't make sense just giving uh people an option it's like we we it's giving like a warning
to your enemies it's like well we can assume that's what it's doing we could also assume it's
doing something else and it's like whichever one makes more sense or less sense you could go with
completely down to you i suppose but it's not it depends on the context because it's not a
definitive contradiction it's not like the movie is definitively said the predator wants arnie to
escape because he likes him or some well i mean that wouldn't even be a contradiction even if
they did say that what were you saying yeah i was saying it was it really depended on the context
because in the context of the last jedi there are a lot of people that write the movie for it
but that's not the same as predator where you have to infer something for example like it makes sense
that they they didn't do the hyperdrive thing up till that point because nobody's tried it it's
like wow that's quite the inference you make it there but like no piss and that doesn't even make
sense because if you remember hux like immediately reacts as if she's gonna do it
just like clearly people are aware of this so you know that this is what i mean you can infer it
just depends every time on how much you're actually ignoring parts of the films to sort
of try and come up with a conclusion about it but anyway let's i i forget how he ends these videos
it's just with uh i want to be the people's governor space oh yeah and there's like there's
like stingers at the end they're like jokes right these aren't actually jokes so we don't
actually need it'll just be like clips that are like things that he thinks are similar he'll cut
clips together to draw parallels between stuff hey technically we're still at less than 13 minutes
so yeah he's right that that's he did a good job with the title there uh he named his video
correctly and that is that is something he got right um but yeah that's that's cinema sins for
you i i'm i've just reminded myself of why i'd ever watch cinema since i have to deal with this
every week well yeah i was gonna say you made like a this is your this is your whole thing
right this is what you want to do i'm sort of trying to branch out uh and because it started
out it was just sort of a i mean it was sort of a i want to make i want to be able to make
something regularly and this is something i can do regularly but now that i'm starting to take
YouTube more seriously i'm trying to branch out into other stuff and sort of making this a general
criticism of criticism channel which is how i ended up talking about you also we don't need to
address that video you um do you are you interested in like sort of maybe getting to the point one day
where you don't do any of that anymore and actually just make your own sort of reviews maybe
um i i like what i wouldn't ever want the channel to i mean i wouldn't i have multiple channels this
is by far the most successful i've got and i could see myself getting to a point in the future where
i don't upload regularly to this channel anymore i just sort of uploaded if i felt like it
um but i i wouldn't really it's not something i see myself wanting to stop anytime soon
it's like you must be having fun doing what you're doing right like yeah yeah because this is a
thing a lot of people might be like like oh how could you we responded to movie bob uh the last
time we did this and like the chat were getting actively infuriated listening to him and like wolf
lost his mind like there are certain results you can get from certain content creators like i would
actually start to find it painful to keep watching cinema sins videos because like how many times did
i have to try and clarify what was even being said like i don't even understand him half the time
and this is the thing i don't think i think he has a decent voice the format is quite
i want to say slick i don't think it's like amazingly made just uh it's it's easy to see
it's nice to see but it's a format that loads of people have just uh taken up and started
using themselves yeah i think the format is really a good idea but yeah like he's i use it
i don't find much substance so i'm just sorry so yeah i never get that interesting and half the
time people do questions like why are you even bothering responding to him he's not he's not
legitimate as a source of criticism it's like well some people do find that he is i'm sure you must
have had a had a moment maybe in your life where people have sent you a cinema sins video maybe
said like see the movie isn't as good as you thought or something like that you'd be like oh
i mean i have i have a lot of uh a lot of people saying different things about me to me about
cinema sins and it's just just there's interesting there's uh the two main criticisms i get of just
for doing what i do a brilliantly contradictive i'll get people saying um this is actually what
you're doing here is silly because cinema sins is fine and there's no problem with their content
because i mean they don't really uh i mean they make mistakes but everyone makes mistakes and you
should just uh you know ignore that and let them let them do what they do because they're fine
and like okay and the other one is always oh don't take them seriously they're not meant to be
taken seriously it's like it's what they say themselves in interviews which we already said
we already talked about uh because they literally contradict themselves when they talk about why
they do what they do yeah uh in some interviews they'll say oh it's just for jokes and satire
and none of it's meant to be taken seriously and in other interviews they will say oh we want to
point out actual genuine problems in films and i think they tried to do both in the same video
and i think that's why it falls flat we get that impression right it's like he's he's got a lot of
problems that are like legit but tiny to the point of just being like i don't even see how this is
relevant really then he's got a couple that are like if they were definitively true they represent
quite kind of big problems and how the the plot runs or whatever but they're oftentimes ignoring
information and he's got like i want to say like 60 of the video was jokes but not not like
they weren't really jokes insofar as they were like made like jokes they were just sort of
jokes insofar as he said words that didn't really mean anything and like certain references that
just flew over my head as well because like you know people be like ah uh whatever that guy's
name he's an american uh football coach it's like okay what does that doesn't answer this at all
see what he didn't do which uh he does a lot of um he's in fact he does this so much that i've
recently banned myself from uh from talking about it as much because uh a lot of what he does and
in my experience he'll generally do this like maybe at least five times in any of his videos
is just compare two things and that's the sin actually he did do it and there's quite a lot
to say he had a lot of like points out a mundane thing or connection then he's just like that's
a sin you're like it was so he does that so much that i had uh that it started out of me as me
going oh he has that movie has that movie has that and that's a sin for some reason and then
it just sort of i had to say that so much that i cut it down to this movie that movie and i had to
say that so much that i've banned myself from saying that phrase now i was going to say you
probably try to not cover his jokes i imagine too right because that's just wasted air time almost
he was like yeah that was a joke yeah wait because it's not like it's not like the jokes
don't mean it's not like you know the fact that it's a joke means that the words don't matter
it's like he still said the thing and the thing do you mean like if he sort of tells a joke
while performing a form of criticism it's like yeah oh so i might want to recognize the fact
that that's actually criticism so yeah if he'll be like you know uh it says a joke and there's
like here's why that's not stupid though but yeah uh he's a he's an extremely successful channel
so you know more power to him because this has worked but i found it fascinating to find out
that there are several and i say like there's more than like 10 people who are doing everything
wrong with and then video games or movies oh there are so many and yeah and they're all
they've got a an element of success like they're actually it's it's crazy i was like there's a guy
with like 200,000 subscribers who's doing the exact same thing as cinema sins and i was just like
wow i didn't i know you know about this because we uh talked about him uh the other day uh no
bullshit literally has a cinema sins clone channel that he doesn't post to anymore it it blows my
mind because then you've got the counterculture of channels like yourself where there's people just
watching these videos i mean technically we've done it today where you just respond and there's
channels that are really successful of that alone as well it's just like cinema sins has created
his own like cinema sins has created a sub-industry yeah it's crazy to think about that's how popular
it is and i suppose that's how popular talking about media is in general like people just really
like i mean that would explain me and wolf's channels as well we we both tackle games and
films mainly so just the the whole like the movie industry is only and especially the movie
criticism as an industry is just really growing fast you've got you've got so much it's become
like the the concern has become like which are the people we should be listening to and there's
there's a lot of talk about that isn't there and yeah like plus also a big element of the like
politics gets just rammed into it as well because a lot of films there and you've got uh i i don't
want to open the can of worms that is uh any i don't want everyone i don't really want to address
anything political at the moment i mean if i do address political stuff i want to spend a good
long time thinking about it because like this isn't just film that picks this is shit that
actually matters so like when when you were talking about politics day i was just sort of
like i'm gonna i'm gonna stay quiet for this bit because it's a it's a full it's a full-on
minefield of it is and avoid it in my in my videos as much as possible because uh i don't
know it just it feels like it's it's it's now novel as an idea to have a channel that doesn't
mention politics at all because that's rare yeah i mean if i feel like something is important
it needs to be mentioned bring it up but i won't dwell on it there's people there's people arguing
in the chat about whether or not i've covered games i i have covered games uh as as what you
need to do is just look at your channel they got the righteous door just said maula did a fucking
eight part dark souls 2 video series what about that is movies um uh oh so see this this can't
not be mentioned um i i did bring this up on v stream but i've spoken to v and sargon literally
just because they were like wanna chat and i was like cool and we talked about movies and now
people are like well as as evil Loch Ness has just said uh maula hasn't got the balls to call him out
i literally don't give a shit at what politics people hold when we're talking about fucking
films i will talk to h bomber guy about movies i will talk to sargon about movies those two can
have their political fights as long as they want i just want to talk about movies you can keep me
out of it i don't give a shit yeah there's lots to be said for that it bugs me because like
why why does everything have to be about politics for fuck's sake yeah how many times have you and
me talked about politics that's actually a good point you'd think we would have wouldn't you but
no i mean you maybe we've made like a reference once or twice but most of the time it's just
we're talking about movies and video games lately it's just been like me spamming you with quotes
from god of war four and i didn't give you updates if we have a sea moose we're just like
yeah that was shit oh that was shit this is yeah we it's like if we ever hang out outside the
podcast we're usually going to watch a film that's that's commonly what actually happens the last
one we watched with black panther it was wonderful yeah because you never pick out good movies aside
from spider-man you can't say that so many people hate spider-man homecoming what did you think of
spider-man homecoming uh j i absolutely loved it yeah i i really liked it loads of people hated
it one of my favorite mcu films see why would people have against it well the most common
criticisms i've found is that it's too dissimilar from the comic which obviously i can't i have no
reference for um there's a couple of comments about uh some of the mechanical things like he
doesn't care enough about giving away his secret identity because obviously his friend and his
auntie find out in the film and he doesn't seem to really care but both of those were accidents
so i was just like i don't know i don't know none of that stuff is really film running uh
people didn't like the fact that they turned flash into the like his flash supposed to be like a big
buff white guy and he's i'm pretty sure flash is like not that at all in the film and he also
plays like multiple roles that guy but like these are things where i'm just like yeah but
if we start talking about all the good things in homecoming like these things get flushed out the
toilet like like easily because there's a lot of good shit in it but the fact that it's different
from the comics isn't inherently a bad thing well no i i don't think so either but i know that's
the reason for a lot of people to not like it um the shining uh the movie is like so far from the
book it's actually kind of insulting in a couple cases but it's still a really good movie even
though it's nothing like the book well i mean civil war is my favorite mcu movie and apparently
it goes a decent chunk away from the comic like significantly i was like okay that's fine with me
you got to look at it objectively as its own thing as much as an adaptation right it's a movie
it's not a comic i can i can say that the shining is one of the worst movie adaptations i think well
maybe not one of the worst but it is a really bad movie adaptation however it's still a really good
movie even though it's nothing like the book comic books and movies are such different like
forms of media that you to faithfully adapt a comic like there are so many comics and if you
actually faithfully adapted them like panel for panel on the screen on a big screen it would be
terrible just because it wouldn't it wouldn't go across so well like you know you know i'm saying
we've got how comics are formatted especially when they come out in the little issues they come out
and they're not uh they're more serialized and they're i i'm talking about my ass i've never
actually picked up a copy but uh my impression of them is that they are short and serialized and
you can't make that into a movie as well when i get that there are longer ones but i just i would
want to hear why the thing because i was talking to wolf about this like i have criticisms of uh
game of thrones that i can relate to the book but i can also make arguments that have no relevance
to the book which i think is important as a difference you can talk about how it's a because
this is the thing adaption it's like does that mean they have to be 100 loyal it's like well no
usually it means that you're as loyal as you can be while maintaining the fact that you're a
completely different medium there are some things you just have to change like mauler i think uh i
think we talked about it how uh aria and taiwan didn't interact in the book what they did in the
show and it's great it seems awesome so yeah and this thing is it's complicated and this is the
thing if someone said like i don't like it because it's so inaccurate to the comics i'd be like oh
that's fine but like it doesn't mean it doesn't make it bad though that's like that's not definitive
i can understand why you didn't like it say for example you're really attached to something they
did in the comic and you're like oh they're adapting it to the movie that's so sweet and
then they do like a completely opposite thing i can totally see why you would find it frustrated
but it's like for me i'm just like there's not evidence of bad quality that that sounds to me
like they decided to take certain elements and then make their own story which can go really
badly but it can also go really well you know if you're if you're at the point where you're
saying that something's bad because it's different from something else you've got to at least at
least make an attempt to say why the changes they've made have made it objectively worse
unless you're just saying i don't like it because that's fine for instance can you
argue why the dark tower is bad without referencing the book at all i have not read the book
absolutely i mean i i've made a lot of references to the books in my video of it because i absolutely
loved those books and i hated the movie but it's way more than just a bad adaptation it's like just
a horrible horrible film that's that's kind of how i feel if you ever catch me saying that something
is bad because it's too different from the source then try and you know you can always ask me it's
like what about itself and this doesn't apply to stuff like saying the last jedi is worse when you
consider the originals it's like well that's a direct sequel it's not the same as an adaption
just just to clarify if anyone's making that confused with that but like literally turning
a comic into a film i feel i feel like you get a lot of leeway to be able to uh change up how you
would sort of sort of present the story but obviously there are some things like lord of
rings isn't 100 accurate a lot of people get frustrated that um tom bombadill isn't in it
but there's i i don't think that he needed to be in it you know no he didn't really add much to
the books aside from world building anyway and there was plenty of world building in the films
to make up for it so yeah um hopefully that sort of puts that to bed i suppose um i'm gonna read
off this next selection of super chats quick uh have you guys watched any new jared videos if not
please repent and queue it up uh they're pretty much saved for wolf's podcasts assuming they um
you know whenever we do them so not recently but i do actually you know watch some of jared's
videos every once in a while depending on what's on offer i don't know if you do wolf
but sometimes i'm like hey i'll check it out if it's like a movie review sometimes i check it out
yeah they bring joy to my life to watch a jared video
oh i just sorry i do randomly cash stuff in chat um i disagree people who grew up with the characters
and spent time with them for years are understandably pissed if the characters
fundamentally change no matter the medium that doesn't counter anything i said
yeah i mean look i um people can be pissed that doesn't mean the thing is bad
yeah i mean i can't uh think off the top of my head maybe if i
like took a while to really mull it over i could probably think of some people that are some
characters from movie adaptations that are completely different from the books but um again
it really depends on the quality of the film as a standalone because you can still say that
adaptation sucks while still being a good movie like i said uh the shining horrible adaptation
uh pretty much i mean shining is a pretty actually a pretty good example because uh
i don't remember what the black guy's name is oh well anyway in the book he actually had a
purpose in the movie they just shot all over his character is it a bad adaptation if it's a good
product at the end or is it the yeah yeah i would say it i would say you can be a bad
adaptation but still a good movie well i'm saying that would the adaptation be good if the product
turned out to be good but you know i mean like you take a thing you adapt it and the thing is also
good wouldn't it well i would say it would be a good standalone but not a good adaptation because
to adapt something you like it goes without saying that people expect it to be like the thing you're
adapting because yeah i'm genuinely i'm not even trying to point out something yeah i'm literally
just like curious as to how we would define adaptation yeah well when i when i say adaptation
at least i mean like i if it's a bad adaptation in my eyes it means that it didn't follow what
it's adapting sort of to stay loyal or uh to stay loyal enough to get everything right
like uh the it movie i really love the i love uh the it book and i actually really liked the movie
even though it changed a ton of things from the book but it still got the important stuff down
being the characters the themes and everything they go through um so that that would i would say
would be maybe not a horrible adaptation but like a mad adaptation but it's still a really good movie
so just to clarify then sorry do you want to go i was just going to say quickly the fact that they
don't have tom bombadill in the lord of rings movie would be considered a a notch against them in
terms of an adaptation then um well i come from the kind of unique perspective of i didn't really
like tom bombadill to begin with but um but by principle you would still have to say that yeah
that fine right like yeah i mean in all fairness though tom really didn't play much of a role in
the books to begin with aside from just it's part of the world building because he was mentioned
one time at the very end of the two towers and uh it was something to the effect of they were in
shilab's cave and sam was like man i wish tom was here here and i at that point i forgot that tom
was part of the book in the first place and i was like who's tom and then i was like oh that crazy
guy in the forest yeah like i'm pretty sure i'm on board with this i just wanted to clarify because
i always sort of looked at it as to adapt something is to change it from what it was to a new medium
and that could mean that you could change a lot of stuff along the way oh yeah i mean there there
was a lot of significant changes from lord of the rings book to the film but there is still way more
intact that i would call it a very good adaptation even despite the things that they changed or took
out it's kind of subjective it depends on uh well it really depends on a book to book lord of the
rings i would call an excellent adaptation the shining i would call a shit adaptation but they're
both good films question mark yes yes interesting what's your what's your take jay so i i've just
realized i'm i'm completely distracted you're completely distracted i have i've uh i i tuned
out of it there oh well like i i i'm just interested on how people take all this because
like i said if if you take a book or or even a tv show or whatever and just turn it into the
the other thing um it's almost like depending on how much is the same determines how much your
adaption is well how much of a good adaption it is but that'll have no effect necessarily
on how good of a thing it is in its own medium would that be oh yeah i i i agree with that like
to to an extent i think that making like some changes that you can justify for the change of
the medium means like that doesn't necessarily make it a worse adaptation but um if you would
say i mean like 50 shades of gray would be a terrible adaptation of the shining like yes
it's terrible in general so it's about it is a terrible zone but i mean the shining would be
a terrible adaptation of 50 shades of gray so i mean if it's completely different and it's
if it's different without really reasons that you can understand i would say
or like justifiable reasons i would say that makes it a worse adaptation yeah it's interesting
because um i just uh i i don't know i don't know how everyone generally feels odd i wonder
if if this is sort of like an accepted thing or not like the say for example something that you
can't have uh in a in let's say something that was adapted from one medium to the next so like
um i'm trying to think of like if you adapted a movie to an audio book for whatever reason
then there's certain things that can happen or at least i'm trying to think of what could be in
a movie that can't possibly be in a book because you could always describe visuals and sounds so
what could be in a movie that can't possibly be in a book yeah i can think of things that
are in a book that can't be in a movie okay wait go for that like for example uh well reference
the lord of the rings um in the movie the you know the huge eye on top of barad door yeah that
that's not actually in the book there is a part where uh when uh Frodo looks into gladriel's
mirror he sees a flaming eye but there's not like a literal actual eye on top of the tower in the book
they had to adapt what is basically um symbolism and um fuck what's the word i'm looking for
metaphor yeah that would work too symbolism metaphor we don't actually know what's on the
tower they just describe it is it or sort of well there there is nothing on this tower in the book
um they just took a part apart from the book and because Sauron never actually appears
physically in the book they had to kind of give him a presence in the movie because it wouldn't
make sense otherwise without the uh without the context that the book gives and unless the movie
decided to go into just unreasonable amounts of exposition then which would detract from the movie
as a whole then they had to make some kind of physical representation of Sauron so they took
something in the book and then kind of made it into something different so there is like symbolism
metaphors and there's a word that i keep thinking of good in terms of adaptional bad in terms of
adaption um well adaptation i'm sure the right word is there taking well i would say it's good
because they did take one thing that was in the book and they applied it to something that they
needed to do in order to adapt it into a movie like convert it into movie yeah because uh the
way that they used that uh Tolkien used Sauron in the book they couldn't do that for the film
because it would kind of detract from it would make the film kind of boring because there would
be no physical evil presence to really latch on to if they just said oh Sauron's coming and then
they never showed anything about it then the movies wouldn't have had the impact that they do
but because uh the way that the books describe it they get away with it yeah like how you can sort
of you could have like a vista in a book or a song in a book and then when you actually see
it sang or see the actual thing in a movie you can be disappointed because it wasn't quite what you
thought it was even though it could be accurate to what was described in the book if you know what i
mean yeah so it's like an accurate adaption in some ways and also in other ways i mean this is
the thing right because i'm interested in seeing how the comics were adapted in marvel if at all
but the fact is like obviously i can't even judge it and it's not even it's not really relevant to
me as to how good of it how good it is as a movie because obviously it doesn't need to function as
anything but a movie but if someone said to me like civil war for example is an awful adaption
because it doesn't have anything from the original comic aside from the fact that it's a civil war
between those two characters i'd just be like okay it's a bad yeah i mean that that would be
that would be a relevant thing to say you you couldn't really say that civil war was objectively
as a standalone film because of that but you can't say that it is a bad adaptation
i don't know because i never watched it i've never read the comic no it's saying well that's the
thing if someone what i'm trying to say is like if someone said it is a bad adaption objectively
i just be like all right it doesn't bother me because i'm obviously i i'm just judging it as
a film not as an adaption um yeah that's i was gonna say if i just read out these next super
chats i assume that we're pretty much good at that point because i'm surprised we actually got
through two two videos without spending you know 10 hours that's impressive if you want to see the
room to watch wrinkle in time 2018 not even exaggerate yes i've i've heard that's so funniest
but we should do that sometime wolf me you and a couple of others get some drinks oh absolutely
i'd love to because i genuinely think that you should just because it's hilarious but yeah no
let's let's definitely watch it together that's funny okay um bread and unbridled rage that must
be referencing for good rags uh good not might be a useful way to describe adaption perhaps faithful
would be more appropriate yeah um yeah i guess it depends on your meter for what makes a good
or bad adaptation which can be subjective yeah it's a very complicated subject i quite it's
quite interesting obviously yeah by the way jay if you actually had anything you wanted to say on
this because i don't know if you're still distracted or not but i've uh see i've never
read or seen any of the lord of the rings so what i know it's the biggest it's the biggest
part of no culture i still need to get on board with oh my god you got it okay when you watch the
movies only watch the extended cuts i know that yeah i know that um people kind of use the extended
cuts it's like a get out of jail free card for shitty movies but the extended cuts were actually
like required because they're so unbelievably long like we're talking the whole trilogy is 12 hours
jesus it's amazing it's seriously it is the best 12 hours you need to see before you die sort of thing
people in the chat call me a heresic i mean it's it's kind of you don't meet many people who have
in fairness we found out recently that rags hadn't seen aliens please don't tell me you haven't seen
aliens i i love aliens oh thank christ oh thank god i sat through i sat through the second alien
versus predator film just because of how much i haven't seen resurrection yet though you this
this makes more sense because you did tell it wasn't you that said watch resurrection you were
more of a fan of alien than predator right that's what you said to me yeah i mean well i'd never
seen any of the predator films other than alien versus predator before today it's just it's
interesting because like i was a super fan of both so i was like avp is like a dream come true that
was like well this was and then you watched it i really enjoyed avp but i wouldn't ever
like say that it was a good film the same as like suicide squad i love watching it but it's
like a it's like a fan film in uh how do i put this it's like it feels like someone playing in
their back garden with the two toys like i'm smashing together they're fighting yeah and you
got to watch that with like hollywood level you know prosthetics and graphics stuff and it's like
that was kind of neat but i mean yeah i i would never say avp is a good film but i could enjoy
watching it from for the very superficial elements of just seeing predator and alien smash into each
other i guess see the the only reason the only real thing that i had that i was just like pretty
disappointed by with it other than the fact that it's not very good was just how uh just how
shit on the xenomorphs get because obviously i was just there for the xenomorphs it was like hey
you know who's uh who's who's funny is i feel the exact same way in reverse i hated how much
the predators got shot on because one alien kills two predators they put like the the predators are
the uh like come out on top he nukes them all with his thing and the predators are the ones that are
like i mean we we spoke about this before i would yeah but the predators are technically speaking
on top because let's be honest aliens are essentially creatures that are running around
killing stuff while predators are actually the predators have a society they're like they're
people they're a species who do things while aliens run around killing things like i'm not
saying they're not intelligent but predators considering both of these these factions technology
i would say predators are typically going to win every one-on-one fight uh out of
most of the time especially because they actually have scanners that pick up aliens as well
like specifically the thing the thing is is what i said to you last time we were saying this is uh
i think it would have been a better way to approach alien versus predator would be if it
was the predator's first ever encounter with the xenomorphs yeah and i would i would love to see
that in a movie but the thing is man like every single new alien or predator film that comes out
is just a goddamn sack of shit there seems to be at this point i enjoyed alien covenant how
i don't know i just i liked it i thought it was fun well i mean you said you liked avp i
liked avp enough to enjoy it do you think covenant is bad and you enjoy it or do you think it's good
and you enjoy it i i didn't really register enough to really decide how good it was i didn't get an
impression it was amazing uh i felt like that was stuff you could actually read into it patrick
williams uh loves alien covenants you're in good company i'm kidding um i don't know who that is but
i feel i'm pretty sure i've heard you referencing before i've said you don't know who he is you
should check out his plot holes video it would be fun for you to respond to that one that's the guy
actually you should just watch her stream of us watching his plot holes video uh what was i
gonna say um yeah apa ben just said in the chat by the way wolf that he hasn't seen lord the rings
oh god arbor come on
you just have to see these films uh biception might refer to the biceps insertion which is
the space between the elbow and the start of the arch of the bicep i i don't think it's that well
thought through i was going to say you're giving him a lot of credit there this is
left foot media would be an interesting guest cheers i will look into it i've heard of left
foot media a couple times also somebody sounded like one of you was going to say something then
i didn't catch that oh so i'm fairly sure that the biception thing was he took two words that
would vaguely relevant and put them together and that's how he came up with that i think you're
right uh so needs the autism spines that's the reference to the new movie her top 10 anime
alliances cinema sins is really fake to be honest i've chuckled at some of his jokes but taking
these videos of serious analysis is mega autism oh well there's a thing we've covered how a lot
of people will be like why are you taking it seriously and it's like well some people do take
it seriously they really do like i don't know why you see people who don't like fully take it
seriously but they still sort of i mean when when jerry doesn't like a film they'll still
like take that to heart and i guess you know this film is i guess i won't bother with it but
so often the reasons he has for disliking a film are superficial and also wrong like you know you
will point out plot holes and claim everything stupid and you're like but but no well like it
was a common theme in the predator one everything he said about the girl was like wrong just relatively
wrong because there was some stuff he said that was like had room for discussion but he just kept
even contradicted himself on the girl it was just it was rough listening to that you will see
sometimes he'll have criticisms like that and then he'll actually take that into saying sort of
and that's why this is actually a bad movie and it's not like you know it's not like he's just
approaching everything with the sort of you know we're just putting out the mistakes sometimes he
will actually say no i don't like this movie because and sometimes it is stuff like that that's
not actually been thought through we're being asked what we think of cinema ones we've already
talked about this we yeah but some people in chat don't know these things because they just popped
in uh dust special okay dusty s said uh really enjoy css here hope to see him more on efap well
that'll that'll be for the future the problem for efap is that every guest we have is like i'll
come back and it's like good god we'll never have a guestless episode even though we have to have a
guestless episode next week but um i've i've had fun with you with you jay how have you found it's
been fun to be here it's a very silly podcast isn't it i like the idea that somehow i made
a terrible video well like i mean i don't think it's as bad as you said it was but i can see why
you thought it was as bad as you thought it you thought you i can see why you thought it was as
bad as you thought it was i've said probably that i'd rather make friends than enemies honestly
like i'm so tired of making enemies i've made enemies out of so many people i've never even
heard of i'm just like okay can we talk i love the idea you just saw that and you're like do you
want to come on show oh wait this is the thing i i hate the idea of not letting the other person
have their say about it there've been times we will accidentally have that happen or something
that might happen in future but genuinely i hate the idea of basically being like no don't give
them a platform that's the last thing we need like no no let's let's talk about films i like talking
about films there there are people i wouldn't want to give a platform to um oh like like horrible
well like uh personally like there are people who just i think don't have the critical thinking
like or the like the i just not i feel like some people might find this controversial but
i'm just gonna go no bullshit i don't think should have a platform well see okay so well
if you know who no bullshit is obviously don't you unfortunately if he was like can i come on
eve out and talk about films i would be like yeah but i mean and we'll cover what are your
videos with you that'll be fun because we'll just be like what the fuck were you talking about this
whole time like this i mean i i don't think anyone should not have a platform because i
think everyone should be able to say whatever dumb shit they want and expose how much of an
idiot they are yeah and this is the thing if we had a choice between no bullshit you or whoever
else i'd be like well yeah but no bullshit's pretty much going to be on the bottom of the list every
time because like why would why does he's never been impressed with his videos i don't know why
he would want to come on here anyway like that'll be a strange circumstance but i i think i understand
what you're saying like it's there's some people who'd be like why would i even bother
yeah i say i i see like obviously you want him to be able to have a platform you don't want to
silence him because the stuff he says is stupid you just want to let people know that the stuff
he says is stupid yeah yeah um and this is the thing imagine we covered a video from his which
we actually have on waltz podcast i think and then he said like you've blatantly you know
misrepresented me or strawman meal rather and he's like and you won't let me on your podcast
because you know that i'll rip you apart or something like that we'd be like okay fine come
on you know like the idea that we're being unfair even if he is a piece of shit that sort of thing
yeah it's like i wouldn't want to do that because it just i imagine it happening to you is kind of
where i'm coming from it's just like yeah that would suck so principally wise we would rather
open it up to anybody um my computer's going to sleep okay i'm back but preferably not like
you know accepting absolutely anybody who asks more so it's it's much more fun to actually have
content creators who also critically analyze film that's usually the place we're aiming for
but you know uh cinema sins should be forcefully ifed by rags i'm afraid he's gone but he may have
been on board with that a question for css of all the movies cinema sins is covered which one do
you think is the most egregiously wrong as in the the cinema sins video but i think i don't know
they're all sort of just generally i don't i can't really pick like a top a most wrong video
because they've all just sort of got the uh they've all got their tropes in them and they're all
sort of like they will generally have about the same amount of mistakes in it i mean there's not
been any individual one that i've gone wow this is so below standard if that if that answers your
question it's just they're all sort of about the same if like if i was to answer it's like
whichever one i watched recently that's the worst one like is always fresh on my mind
but uh i'm assuming you're saying that they sort of he has the exact same approach for
pretty much everything so they're all just as bad as each other i mean there'll be ones where
if he's doing a movie that there's actually a lot of flaws in it and a lot of uh plot holes in that
it will generally be a better video than one where he has to stretch for everything
because whatever he does he's going to try and make the video at least like i think 12 minutes
is is his standard i've not seen one below 12 minutes in quite a long time so if there's
something like uh deadpool for example which i mean a lot of the things that are in deadpool
are really cliche but are really cliched rather but uh a lot of that is on purpose so that they
can subvert the cliches and make jokes about them but then they'll still be like oh this is a cliche
or help really over analyze the matter jokes and that it's just like this kind of film does not
lend itself to your format because your format is all about finding logical holes and that
and deadpool doesn't give a shit yes it's definitely complicated to try and do it with
deadpool for christ's sake this is like try half of it is going to be deliberate that the other
half might not even be clear i mean it's funnily enough him attacking deadpool will be like us
attacking cinema sins you know it would be like you can't fucking say that because that was a joke
although we'd be like well deadpool will be a lot more obvious while cinema sins would be like you
can't even tell if it's a joke or if it's bad writing or if it's him actually making a issue
with the film he can't fucking tell yes i think because he does he does all three he makes like
genuine mistakes sometimes because we all do write him up um then he uh he will also like uh
apparently make mistakes on purpose he said he does that but he will then also put them together
with genuine criticisms so it's like you know the mistake the real mistakes are there the genuine
like the criticisms are there and it's no distinction between any of them you have to figure that out
for yourself why would he admit that he sometimes makes deliberate mistakes is it is he saying it's
supposed to be funny i think he's i don't know i've not really seen the whole of you i just
because i've seen uh i've seen videos about him and i've seen that referenced and i trust the
sources strange stuff uh the person who asked that by the way said uh i also commend you for coming
on so you've been commended uh you guys are apolitical you guys are apolitical usually besides
rags much always throwing in a new atheist jab on christians every episode i mean that happens but
the fact is me wolf and rags are all atheist as far as i know obviously you could argue that's
political bringing it in at all but we really do like i mean i can think of only two occasions
and one of them is this episode yeah it's it's very rare uh how bad is the venom movie i really
like all your guys's stuff because i was actually going to go watching next week but if it's that
bad i'm not gonna i'm not going to i like marvel's a franchise i thought it was awful but like
entertained by it it was kind of fun there's lots of stuff i enjoyed but overall like in terms of
structure is just a bit of a mess so maybe go to try and find out from other people you trust if
you want to see it or not because i didn't hate it i just thought it was kind of bad it's like
you know uh watch adaptation the film they paid coffman to adapt the ghost orchid into a film
and he turned it into a meditation on the subject of adaptation itself so in that case that would
be a bad adaptation but potentially a good film i suppose um have you guys played slash read the
metro series metro 2033 last light metro 2033 34 35 is pretty interesting oh oh boy i'm a huge metro
fan boy i've read all books i've read metro 2033 like six times so i i i'm like in love with metro
and ever well everything that has anything to do with dimitri kluchowski i i know nothing about it
i'm afraid i mean you're messing out no i've been told but this is the thing dude i've got like a
lot of stuff to catch up on while every day i'm like well time to work on the tfa series it's
like why don't you watch i'll play metro it's like no oh you know tfa or we watch terrible
movies because that's that's what we do you know like yeah like like we're gonna watch wrinkle in
time right have you seen teeth it's my go-to terrible movie i've not actually seen it i only
know exactly what it is though uh i i saw it and then i was like well that makes me feel bad
and then i never watched it again it's fully one of my favorite films just because of how bad it is
call it be a heretic when he hasn't even seen lord of the rings
how dare you i'd say that not seeing lord of the rings is a bit more sin than not playing metro
um yeah so thank you thank you everyone for your generous donations and i suppose we can stay for
a little bit if anyone's got any questions for uh j our guest cinema sin sins well i
am personally going to leave because i have to eat and i also really gotta take a piss again so
we're probably gonna be about like five minutes or whatever but enjoy your pee yes and cinema
sin sins or j maybe i should have just called you that instead i'm retarded i'm sorry that's chill
call everyone yeah i i apologize for insulting you in our last efap you know what right
you you know what right i would probably have done the same thing in your situation reacting
also it was funny it was fucking like i was laughing along and realizing like this is
i'm i am being made fun of here but this is funny shit yeah i mean well i mean i like to make fun
of people and i know the funny thing is is uh the way that i met mauler is he insulted me in one of
his videos and people like told me mauler's throwing shade at you and i watched the video
and got to the part where he talked shit about me and i thought it was hilarious and now we're
friends well not to mention by the way that we promote each other in our black panther videos
but we did it while insulting each other i believe like i said i said something like uh
yeah you fucking you make shit videos he has a link i think people were like why do you guys
hate each other i think uh you said something to the effect of like oh no no that was your
jurassic world video where you said i know he's the worst thing ever but it's okay we we have a
fun little thing people in the comment section like wait so do you guys hate each other or not
it's like i am linking his video yeah i hate him yeah people uh for a while thought that i
hated you too and they were like why why are you always so mean to mauler and i'm like we're friends
um but yeah i realized that uh not all people are like me where they'll just like see someone
shitting on them and then like laugh it off so you know you go that's i think that is genuinely
rare what happened with me and you because most people will like the second they've seen that
you've done settle said something like that they're like well you're definitively my enemy now
there's no way out of it yeah yeah yeah so there's no no uh vitriol no earnest vitriol between
with what i said about you in your video yeah i completely i was done like even if like even if
i literally stood by if i stood by literally everything i'd said in the there's still stuff
in it that i stand by but uh i did rush it and uh i yeah i there was a lot in there that i will
i would change and will change when i redo it um so i can so it can actually be like a decent video
but uh i reckon i forgot what i was saying when i started the sentence i'm just just
i guess you just say goodbye to wolf i think he really wants to pee
that's my assumption well well if it was good meeting you and mauler i'll see you next week
of course sir goodbye see ya bye
yeah um i mean we may as well just pretty much finish up there i hope you had fun it's a very
silly thing we we we pulled this together because we were doing it sort of casually anyway and i
was just like we could stream it and then we did and now we've got an actual name for it and this
is the seventh episode i believe so you know fun stuff and uh the goal is to essentially
watch these videos with people while also commenting on them as content creators ourselves
which is essentially what you do on your channel right yeah yeah so it works it all works um i was
gonna say if you want to i'll i'll link your channel in the uh in the chat and you can try
and pitch to the to the chat why they should subscribe to you don't i've made really bad
videos and that's not how you do it you should join and sub
um if you like wasting your time or um if you don't like good content then go and subscribe to
my channel if you if you like good content then go go somewhere else you you he responds to
syllabusids if you don't like syllabusids you're probably going to find a lot of
entertainment on there in terms of just oh my god yep he's wrong about that he's wrong about that
and then you're branching out to a lot of other content creators as well so that'll be um
plenty for you for you to work with especially as a as a growing channel uh obviously in the
description of this video you can find links to wolf and rags uh their channels next week on
wednesday we're going to be doing the response to tro which is probably going to take like seven
hours it's going to be ridiculous this video is of course going to be unlisted on my main channel
but you can find it on my second channel which is being linked in the channel right now and that's
pretty much it hope you guys had fun and thanks of course again jay for coming on and uh had a bit
of pleasure excellent um goodbye everyone goodbye
