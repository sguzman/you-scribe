no no
down
and
that you carried on watching more of a few in a row
half I have,
how far are you
about halfway through a season five I had to stop for a while so Mrs. Jordan could catch up,
Mrs. Nerotic could catch up
yes and Mrs. Nerotic is
episode you know the one
I'm not allowed to watch Buffy without her from now on it's kind of a thing so
got to do what the boss says once in a while
haven't gotten the title right I knew I was going to forget something
give me one moment don't panic chat
you're all going to panic
oh
fifty eight
the
let's come up with a good title what do you reckon everybody
should we call it was season eight of Game of Thrones
bad question mark or good or
there goes something better than that come on you're all weirdsmiths do it
the battle for season eight
no that's lame
what about the Game of Thrones debate
yeah
the season eight debate
I mean a few Game of Thrones
trial by combat
there we go
I'll take that I'll take any of these
I'm putting it in and
as long as people love it we'll keep it
trial by combat
but with
what what name would you like in the title
yes and IRL is fine
very well
Nerotic
there we go that'll update
and hopefully you know it won't say efap gaming anymore
sorry about that everybody
oh well
I'll do anything right for this
it's all a game
it's all a game that we play
all change is saved excellent now
the
yes
we should probably talk about a few things before we do any kind of intro let people
sort of
blow in a little bit
how about that
that thing that came out recently
does anything come out recently? Batwoman was bad
actually I was going to say
I couldn't imagine watching Batwoman
no are you sexist?
maybe
but I just couldn't
I couldn't imagine
like I watched a few episodes
I watched a season of The Flash years back
for funsies
and that was all I could really do
of like CW
superhero stuff
what is the best show on CW
or is it Arrow?
the 100
the 100 is amazing
oh wait wait I mean
I mean out of the Arrowverse ones
all of the hero ones
I know
The Flash and Arrow
are probably the two most likely of it
yeah the first two seasons
of both of those were pretty good
season one of Arrow is very good
TW show
yeah fair enough
I was going to say
quick update about eFap movies
again because I know that
people are still like where's the Doom video
this is simultaneously
a promotion of a thing
and information at the same time so
those who want to see the eFap
movies Doom you can actually
watch it on eFap.me
the website held by Kiba Kins
oh
if you go to
I'm going to do it right now
then
go to
episodes, minis, movies
and gaming
and you hit Doom and it links you to a player
that's embedded into the site I guess
now you can watch it there
so for people who are like we don't see it
there you go but it will be up on
Moolah as soon as it goes through
I'm trying to thing with a friend to see if we can
keep it live
on a channel on YouTube for two weeks
once it goes through two weeks then we probably assume
that we can do it by copyright and I'll try it again on Moolah
but that will be the third time
for some reason they like to strike it once you put it live
it doesn't matter whether or not it's unlisted
it's really annoying
as soon as that one goes through then Fellowship can come out
then Two Towers, then Return of the King
then God Gojira, King of the Monsters
King of the Monsters
and another one
should I keep it a secret Rags
or should we tell them
I think you've already told them enough
the secret is to always want them leaving more
there's another movie on top of the Godzilla one
that's currently being edited
and it may shock you
I think a lot of people might be shocked
but anyway
go to the website and do that
and use it and if you feel
as though this is an amazing site
which it is
I would like to give some support for maintaining it
there is a donate option
at the bottom for Kiba Kins
it basically just means that
it'll keep going
obviously
as eFap itself is
supporting the site as well
it's just do whatever you
feel that you would like to do
in terms of, because it's just a great website
and that moving it up is
something we want to do
if everything is smooth right now
there should be a link to it in the current
livestream, I'm going to make sure that's true
because
it's really very incompetent today
yes it's there
it says a fan site that's all about eFap
you can find a link right there
excellent
that's pretty much it
I haven't actually got anything else to say
oh
so somebody mentioned
when we were talking about YouTube's demonetized words
in titles that it was funny that
gallons was in there
demonetized word?
and they recommended that I put
gallons as a test into the next
eFap
I did, the one we were talking about Joker
I said we were looking at gallons of
Joker critics or something like that
and that video did get demonetized
but I don't know if it's because of gallons
but it would be funny if it was
woah, does it rhyme
with something that I'm missing?
I don't know, someone must have used gallons to say
something horrible at some point and YouTube
are like, that's it, that's gotta go
that could have been it
who knows
you never know with YouTube because they don't tell us anything
no, they don't
have they said anything about that demonetized word
list? I would have thought they'd be like
they don't want to damage control that shit
be like, ahh, not true, I swear
they do what they always do
not answer
another funny thing happened
that I suppose I should acknowledge
cause I got tweeted about it like crazy
way back when
a user made a meme for us
where I was the guy in Kingsman
shooting a bunch of people in the church scene
that were all representative of different
efap villains and
fights and stuff
there were even some references to things beyond
efap in that video, it was really well edited
it had loads of references, it was really cool
somebody made one for Trump
like, just as a meme
in general, someone made one where he was
going around like, he was doing the same thing
but he was shooting like, CNN and other
things, and like, obviously Trump fans
are really happy with it
that's the thing, non-Trump fans
were like, this is horrible
it depicts him killing people and they're
celebrating
and the people were like, isn't this the meme
that made for you as well? I was like, I don't know, you can make
for anybody I guess
it's a meme within the movie
I mean, it's a
Englishman killing a bunch of Southern
church goers
I mean, Kingsman is okay
that's kind of a meme
I liked the first one, the second one was
weird and now they're making a prequel, right?
yeah, they are
I only saw the first one
it's not my cup of tea
I think it'd be okay to kill a bunch of church goers in the first one
yeah, they were probably a bunch of right-wingers
and it's okay to kill them
yep, they ain't people
hey, people
so, that's about it for like, interest stuff
that I need to get said
now there's enough people here for me to be like,
oh, and welcome to eFap, number 58
we covered a video
about Game of Thrones
a while back, I believe it was
episode 56
no, it was with
Mr. GG
oh, that was the demonetized
weird one, actually
the author of said video was
interested in discussing
our perspective on Game of Thrones, and here he is
hello, Yezin, how do you do?
hi, I am Yezin, slash
Yezin IRL, and I'm here to
talk about some Game of Thrones, some
Season 8, it's gonna be great
we've brought
Nudrotik on, as a
representative of the side that is
let's say, unhappy
put it that way, that's the
nice way to put it, unhappy with Season 8 of Game of Thrones
and probably Game of Thrones as a whole at this point
but welcome
aren't you all on that side, though, other than me?
pretty much, yeah, but I was gonna say
me and Rags are probably gonna try and take a little
bit of a backseat
so that we're not gonna, we don't wanna be doing
the whole like, all three of us ask you
a question at the same time, and you have to answer all of them
we'll be, we'll try and
let you guys discuss the topics
if you will, but probably throw
some comments in here and there, just to have
some level of structure, so that it'll
be interesting
I was gonna say we kinda
did it with Major Lee, most of the
time, out of the three people
two would be silent for a decent amount of time
while it would be exchanged between
the two others, but
we'll play it by here
as they say, and see how
everything goes, so, yeah
Ned Roddick is, go ahead
yeah, well before you, I mean
I'm curious what everyone's like
background of the series is, like
just show, book and show
like, where is that?
Ned Roddick, do you wanna go first?
sure, so it's
I watched the show
for the first three episodes
loved it immediately
it became the greatest thing in my life
and right around that
time Dance of Dragons came out
bought that, bought all the books
read them multiple times over one summer
and continued doing so
over years and years
just had the audio book
on a constant loop in my car
on my phone
books
got into the lore deeply
went to all the Reddit
pages, I'm a big fan, or I was
a big fan of Free Folk, I heard that change recently
and I haven't been there in like a month, but
yeah
I love the Free Folk
and, yeah, just
obsessively got into the show
into the books and was
spouting ignorant
remarks like, this is gonna be
better than Game of Thrones, or better than Lord of the Rings
and, why was I
wrong, and got a bunch of people, got a bunch of my friends
in the show, I had a comic shop at the time
I don't know if anybody's heard that, I might have mentioned it a million
times that I used to own a comic shop, I had viewing
parties there of episodes
and
yes, bought all the comics
everything, everything
they had to offer, I bought, I became a
massive fan
and then Season 7 happened
I started breaking a little early
Season 7 was what really
started doing that
I was still in
but the
Westeros Express and
particularly what they did to Littlefinger
was just completely
out of character for him
and
didn't work for me
personally, narratively
within the show, he became
an idiot
got suckered by
the Stark sisters in
the space of two episodes
which normally they would
have built that thing up over time
and we got a glimpse
of what was to come for Season 8 for me
and Season 8 was just the straw that
broke the camel's back
I see
My history is all the way with
it was Season 2 it just aired
and too many of my friends at the same time said
you need to see it high rated and I watched
I think once I was done
with the finale for Season 1 I was like
I need 10 million seasons of this
and the fact there's only one remaining sucks and I remember
watching it all in the one day and was like oh there
it is it's done now and I have to wait a million years
I remember watching
the premiere for Season 3
the Red Wedding and then
that's when I read the
books after I had
finished Season 3 so I was like I can't wait it's impossible
I have to know all of the things that happened to all these
and then Season 4
rolled around and I was really
happy with who they cast for Oberyn
and how they did everything
I thought it was just like I was just a super
happy book fan and then came
the last episode of Season 4
which I despise and I kind of
want to make a video on it one day because everything
I just don't like anything that happens in that episode
that's one of my favorite
episodes of the entire show
well
maybe we can discuss that at some point but I
absolutely hate it
it ruins
Tyrion Laddister beyond
repair as well as a couple of
other things but more importantly I was like
I'm done the show's killed me I can't believe it did
this and Season 5 came around and a couple
of my friends were like we're gonna watch it you know watch it
and I was like yeah I'll watch it and I was just like
the heckler almost
I was like yeah this is
some good stuff in here but that's stupid
that's stupid
Barristan's death that
I was just like so beyond
insulted but I was like yeah okay fine
that happened that's cool
Season 6 rolled around and I was like okay
it wasn't as bad as Season 5
you know maybe there's maybe and then
more baits from the White Walkers and I was like
you know what I'm gonna see this
through probably just because I want to know how
this all goes where is it all
what was it all for? Season 7 happened
and my god
like the stupid zombie plot
like I couldn't believe that
that was the thing they did
white hunch
and then yeah I mean I've kind of skipped over them but
we have like Stannis
in Season 5 we have
Blackfish in Season 6
got Littlefinger in Season 7
there's all these endings to characters
that are just so
unbefitting of
what we've come to understand about them or at least
what I came to understand about them
and then
I was getting to a degree of
hype for Season 8
because of
just who was in it who was
who was doing what like
Supportionic was supposed to be in charge of a bunch of episodes
and I was like oh I like him he's good
and the fact that they were like oh this is the biggest thing ever
and I was like oh it's not really
to me I thought it was gonna be pretty hard for them to fuck it up
I was like this is
your options are simplistic, obvious ending
or surprise me with some stuff
but they chose
what I think is one of
let's say there's a billion ways you could have ended it
they chose like
the bottom 100
like
weird ways it was in there and I was just like
wow
and I was furious after
Season 8 Episode 3
absolutely furious and it reminded
it was the same feeling as TLJ it was like wow
I really cared about this show even though I pick
the end of Season 4 is where I dropped off
I was clearly not off the train
sometimes this stuff makes you realise that but yeah
that's me
and those two stories
are relatively long
Rags, explain your extensive history with Game of Thrones
My extensive history of Game of Thrones
begins when
Mahler contacted me one day and said
Rags I need you to look at this
I need someone else to understand
I need you to watch this
and it was Game of Thrones
Season 8 Episode 3
now up until this point
up until this point my
my understanding of Game of Thrones was purely
tangential
in the sense that I'd only heard of it
I knew really nothing of the characters
I'd seen memes here and there popping up
but I basically had no
understanding at all of Game of Thrones
I didn't care about the show at all
so we watched Season 8 Episode 3
I said Mahler this is absolutely
fucking terrible
and
then he started explaining me the context
of a lot of the characters and we went through a
lot of clips and even later I went through
a whole lot of clips to get
back stories on characters and things that happened
and I was like man
I am like I'm really
really sorry that this happened to your show
because this is awful
what I'm watching is an absolute abortion
of the cinema
and then I just kind of followed along with
the discussions he was talking about
and I'm
pretty much convinced based on all that
I've learned so far that
Season 8, especially Episode 3
going on a lot of just
completely logic
devoid decisions are made
and insanely stupid things happen
regardless of who
characters are and what their back stories
are and a lot of context you just see
stupid stuff being done
that is just to me
insane
everything from fight choreography
to
battle strategies to
just things that people do that seem so
bafflingly stupid I just couldn't
I couldn't believe it
So I guess as a
just to underlie this
I find that there's like
kind of two main different
kinds of complaints about the show
and particularly Season 8
some are logistic
and then some are
narrative
so logistic stuff is like
fight choreography
like why did the Dothraki charge
why
and you could say
that's motivation on some level but
the Dothraki aren't really characters
so it's like
logistic things like why
how was Euron able to snipe
Rhaegal out of the sky from behind
like dragon stuff like that
and then there's stuff like
why did Daenerys burn the city
why did Jaime go back to stuff
like that
I am someone who
sympathizes more with the logistic
complaints like the logistic complaints
a lot of them do make a lot of sense
to me like
they're really really really
stupid
cause I'm not a big battle strategy
guy so it's not really
it plays out like a CW show
quite frankly
the things that they do and the things that they do
ultimately impact
do people survive or not
are the walls breached
what happens to armies
stuff like that
it's important stuff that happens
sure
I'm less knowledgeable about
characters I just have
the ability to look at things that don't make
any sense whatsoever or just
outright
stupid and don't make
sense and I'm like wait a second
this doesn't make any sense at all but it's something
that's happening
so my investment in future actions
that people take is being crumbled
away by constantly stupid
decisions
I mean I'm sure we'll get into those
for me the areas that I find
complaints are and the bigger
like you know the real
vitriol towards Season 8
is about
character choices
things that characters do like
Jamie going
back to Cersei probably
one of the most unpopular decisions
Daenerys
burning King's Landing
Jon being
stuff like why
are these things happening
to my favorite characters
why are characters making these kinds of choices
those are the
places where
you really see a lot more like rage
and that's the area where I
have
friction with a lot of the rest of the fandom
because I don't agree
I do think that people
are more often than not
wrong about the characters
not
the writers made the wrong choice with the characters
and I'm sure we're going to get into that
alright yeah I think that works as a good intro
that's a good little taster for all
that's to come
I don't exactly know what
we should tackle first in any particular
order
but
I'm interested in asking a few things
just what I
got from the video sort of
so you could call them
the two conversations we're probably
going to have is stuff specifically
to do with season 8 and the stuff specifically to do with
criticism in general, meta
fans, all that stuff around it
if that makes sense? Sure, absolutely
so like I guess
opening question
what to you makes a fandom
toxic?
what is toxic to you?
well there's a lot
of different things
I think in the case of
the Game of Thrones fandom
right now
the thing that makes them
particularly toxic
is sort of an overinflated
sense of their own understanding
so like people look at the show
they're like this is
who the characters are
I've decided that
Daenerys is this
based on my interpretation of who she's been
I've decided that Jaime is this
based on my interpretation
of who he's been
people see things that contradict
what they
believed about characters
and then they decide that
they don't
there's no introspection
the writers are wrong
someone else did something wrong
I was right the whole time
so that is I think
what fuels the toxicity
the inability to look
back and say huh, maybe I need
to look at this again, maybe I need to
reconsider this
maybe I was wrong about stuff
instead we're getting a lot of
just really like oh
these writers are incompetent
they don't know George R.R. Martin's vision
I know George R.R. Martin's vision
even though they spoke to
George R.R. Martin, he told them his vision
and then people
are like no, they didn't get it, I get it
here's what's supposed to happen
here's what Jaime would do
here's what Daenerys would do
I think that's kind of a taste of how
I see toxicity
I guess Gary, what would you like
response or?
Yeah, okay, so my just real quick
toxic fandom doesn't
exist, it's just fandom, it's always been there
we can talk to each other more
so if we want to label it toxic or not
I'm not too sure, of course there's a few bad
actors in there who just want to get nasty
for the lulls and stuff but
for the large part I've done
a lot of live streams so it was mauler
talk to people in length
other YouTubers in length, other
friends in length and
I really don't buy into
like I had an ending in
mind and it didn't meet my ending and
I don't like it, I think anybody who has even the
most basic understanding of Game of Thrones
or the books and you do have to separate
these two things and I have a hard time doing
it myself and let me
preface this by saying the
exact ending for
Jon, for Daenerys, for Jaime
I can certainly see those things
happening in the book, it was
contextually, it didn't make
any sense in season 8 because it
required a lot more time to build
up to that because that's what the
foundation of that series was, this was
Lord of the Rings where they tell you
how the armor got paid for,
how they fed the troops, how to boil
leather, this was what
people bought into and then
it just abandoned that towards
the end to rush to an ending
to get it over with because they split
the final season, they
wasted a lot of time on a
lot of characters that they didn't follow through on
and they had to rush to an ending
and I think that's the general consensus
as far as Jaime acting
out of character, well he did because
they didn't build up to him returning
to Cersei, they didn't
finish his redemption arc at all
and
the same to Arya and Daenerys
and Jon's whole
relationship was forced,
and you know what, can
we blame that on the actors not having
chemistry, maybe, but it all fundamentally
falls to the writers in this
and the writers' decision
to take a two year break
in between the series but not work
on the series for the entire two years
They also
They worked on the series at the time
They were in and out, they weren't as in there
as they were before, they even
mentioned that in the documentary
That being said,
they didn't allow themselves enough time
to finish, they were
heavily reliant on George
to finish the book and I think George
Not Finishing Wins a Winner had a
large part to do with
the derailing of this series
and we have
so many people who were not
happy with this and again
I am not going to say these people didn't have
an understanding, listen I'm
no expert on anything, I
read the books a lot, I watched the
show a lot, I think I have a basic understanding
and I would think that a large
portion of the fandom does as well
and I think
it wasn't satisfying
I don't think people, I personally
don't have an ending in mind for anything
and George can pass on all the
information he wants but it's
it comes down to a matter of talent
if this is considered mean, sorry
it's a fact
Dan and Dave don't have the talent
George RR Martin do
they adapted it
great in the beginning but
I can't understand how
anybody would argue that the
adaption was good towards the end
okay so there's a lot to cover here
the first thing
so what you were talking about earlier
about people don't have an ending in mind
they don't like the way
it's done so
it's not what was done
it was the execution
that's kind of the
the phrase that's been
thrown around a lot
a lot of people present that as the
consensus but it's really
in my experience
a very false consensus
like a lot of people will say that because it
sounds good and it makes
them sound objective
but like for example
on the
the subreddit, the book
subreddit, Song of Ice and Fire, someone made a poll
about like do you want
would you like
George RR Martin to do
these things
in the books and they are like the big things
like Sansa, Queen, King, Bran
Daenerys, Burns, King's Landing
Jon kills Dany, Jamie goes back
to Cersei, yes or no
and in almost
every case except
Jon kills Daenerys
people said no
they did not want that in the books
and again it wasn't
overwhelming, it was a little bit
over, it was like 60%,
50%
in all these cases, the poll had
something over it, I mean again
it's a sample size of maybe like 2,000 people
but right there
you get the sense that okay so
people actually
so some people yeah they'll say
it's the execution but for a lot of people
they're really just not
going to be okay with
King Bran ever
and there's a lot of like
I don't think that's a fair question though because
we saw the build up to King Bran in the show
and it was awful because they skipped
they made a terrible decision
and skipped a season with Bran so
people lost connection with that character
you can say
if you tell somebody the ending
about context they might not like it
but if they say read George's
interpretation of what
no but the question was
do you want to see
George adapt this
and those people have
five books of Bran
they have five books of Jon
they have five books of Daenerys
and they don't want George to get there
again that's not everyone
but I think for me
the idea that there is a consensus
is just not true, there is no
consensus opinion, some people
don't like what happened, some people don't like
the way it's done, a lot of people don't like
both but this idea that like oh well
I like
some people say like oh you know everything
that the show did I would be fine
with it if it was done better
some people feel that way
but not everyone and
when you have such a large fandom
with like so many expectations
you're never going to get that kind
of a consensus and you do see a
lot of, a lot of people did
watch Game of Thrones like
sports fans, like
they're rooting for a team, like a lot of
people like Daenerys is my
character and I'm all for
I want Khaleesi to win, I want
Daenerys to win, a lot of people are like
Jon is my guy, I want
Jon to be the king, I want Jon
to kill the Night King
so a lot of people watch
it through that context
and there is like a
people aren't that rational
there's an emotional drive there
that colors how they interpret
everything around that, for one thing
like someone asked me like
why is it that I think
that I'm so positive
about the ending and
part of it I think is that
at the core of it, Bran
was my guy
and so I had this like
bias at the ending
where it's like yeah, I want to like this
because Bran was
my dude and he is the
king at the end and so then
I was able, I think I was able to look at things
a little bit more
I was able to look back at things and be
more open to what the ending was saying
because it gave me a thing that I wanted
whereas other people who didn't
get anything they wanted aren't
really willing to go back and rethink
their opinions or rethink
the ending because there's no
why, why would
they want to like something that
shat on their favorite character
I think it's possible for
a fan to know a character better than
a writer
If you believe
death of the author, absolutely
and I do believe it's possible
for fans to know characters better than the writers
I think in most
cases fans do not know
the characters better than the writers
I think
do we want to pick a character and talk about him?
If you'd like
do you want to pick?
Let's talk about Jaime
Everyone loves Jaime Lannister
He's a very popular character
I was talking to a friend
how would you rate
Daenerys's turn
and I gave it an 8 out of 10
How would you rate
Jaime's turn?
10 out of 10
I literally do not think a single
thing should have been done different with Jaime
and that's a very
unpopular opinion of the fandom
I'd like to hear more
about Jaime, how you guys feel about him
and give my opinion on that
Well, it's up to Gary
you and me, what do you want to do?
You go ahead first
I went first last time
So, how would you explain
the line
the innocent I never really cared for
them?
Yeah, this is the line that gets talked about the most
I would explain that line
with it's literally true
If you go back
over Jaime's story
there is not a single
instance of him
going out of his way
or expressing a lot of
concern for the common people
and the
instance that people always go straight to
is Aries
He killed the Mad King
Saved an entire
city
But if you think about it, self defense
Jaime would have
died too in that fire
Right?
You think he killed the Mad King
in self defense
I think he killed
the Mad King because
the option was
die
your father dies
you never see Cersei again
that's it
or do something that is
arguably also honorable
and within your vows and you get to live
So naturally, I would
cite season 3 where he explains
to Brienne
did it because if he hadn't
thousands would have died
That's not actually what he says
I actually knew this was going to
come up so I went back and rewatched that
scene literally right before this
What he says
is if your king had asked
you to kill your own father
and then stand by where women
and children are burned, would you have done it?
If you actually look at
the context of that scene, it's
not about Jaime's
deep concern for the common
people, it's about
honor and reputation
The last lines of that
scene are
by what right does the wolf judge
the lion, by what right
He's upset because people
see him as a bad guy
even though he
upheld his vow
to protect the innocent
Absolutely
That comes after he's made
that decision
Yeah, but the thing is
when you look at his emotion in that scene
that's what it's about
So he's so torn up when you're watching that
scene and a lot of people are like oh he's torn up
because he's thinking about all of the women and children
that would have died, no he's torn up
because of how people look
at him
but when you made that decision
wouldn't you rather live
wouldn't you rather live
then
wouldn't you rather kill the crazy king
and live than burn alive?
I don't know that that was actually
the definitive result
even, we don't know that Jaime didn't know
where the safe areas of King's Landing
would have been
There were no safe areas of King's Landing
There clearly were, and the King's Landing was
burned by Daenerys and all the deposits
went off for the wildfire and yet
there's still plenty of people who survived
Well in the show it's not
entirely sure that all of the wildfire
is still there
but
Jaime himself
says that he didn't
in another scene that the crazy part
or maybe it's in the same scene
that Aerys didn't think he would
actually didn't think that he would burn
he thought he would rise again to the dragon
So Jaime believes that
Aerys is going to die in this fire
I don't think he was like well
you know I could not kill the king
and go hide
anyway so we're taking
the scene right? You have an
interpretation of it, I have an interpretation
of it. Can you kind of see how
like both of these are valid
right? No, I don't see how
this is valid at all
Okay, well
in what way? Like what is invalid
about it? The scene is about reputation
Jaime himself
So he's outraged
the biggest moment in his life where he had to
choose between the honor to
three different, he mentions the king
the people and his father
and he chose
the people because
it's pretty clear that that would be the right choice
ultimately to save the most lives
and he's
punished for it, that's his reputation
and it's all thanks to Ned Stark
Ned Stark's the reason, Ned Stark
could have changed everything if he had actually
addressed, listened to,
understood everything about Jaime but he's too
quick to judge, he's too altruistic, he judges
Jaime immediately as a betrayer
he killed his own king, probably to save
his own skin, what a piece of shit
but ultimately- Jaime
Ned Stark doesn't know
about the wildfire, Jaime never
tells Ned Stark about the wildfire
In the books he never tells anyone
in the show he tells- No, everything I
just said is contingent upon that
Sorry, could you explain that again?
So everything I said is contingent upon
Jaime not telling Ned that
because that's Jaime's
conclusion, that Ned immediately
judges him the worst possible
scenario, and it's done
Right, um,
uh, Jaime
Ned judges him because
he's sitting on the throne, he killed
the king, his father
was taking the city, Ned
Ned assumes, because he is
presumptuous, but, I mean
for understandable reasons, he presumes that
uh, Jaime was
just acting
in the interest of his house. Which he wasn't
Which he wasn't
but at the same time, Ned
doesn't know about the wildfire
Jaime, in his mind
he's protecting him, he's defending
So we're highlighting that the selfish
point of view is the lie
is the failure to understand the scenario
is the thing that everyone understands about Jaime
that isn't true? No,
it's, the thing about A Song
of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones is that
uh, decisions are never that
clear cut, right? There's always like
two sides to every decision
um, and this is very true of Jaime
it's very true of Daenerys, it's very true of a lot of
characters, like with
um, with Ned Stark
there's this question of like, oh, is
is he all about honor? Well
no actually, when you find, when you
really get into the secrets of Ned
Stark, he's actually all about
family, so there's like
two, like yes Ned Stark is
honorable, but he also puts his family
above honor, it's like
yes, that seems honorable to me
I was gonna say that's maintaining an honor
Well, that's the whole point of Jaime's
character is that he's trying to decide
which honor outpaces the other
Ned Stark obviously
places the honor of his family's
lives above the honor to his king
Yeah, and in that
instance, so did Jaime
but the point isn't like
Ned Stark is wrong, Jaime is right
the point is that
Jaime doesn't
he sees an ill
in society, in the way
people judge other people
based on these contradictory vows
and he's torn up about it
but what he did
didn't show, it's like
he didn't risk his life
for the common people
and throughout the story he never does again
He doesn't risk his life for the common people
No
So by common people
could we boil that down to innocent person?
No
Common people is
non-nobility, people that he doesn't know
like civilians
so Brienne of Tarth
not the common people
So how many characters have satisfied that?
In the story
very few, the story doesn't really
follow the common people but the thing is
he doesn't, Jaime is in a
position to do things for the common people
all the time, he just
doesn't
He gets absorbed by the personality
that he'd accidentally created for himself
that's who he is up until season 3
that's when everything starts to crack apart
That's not, that's
part true, part not, again it's like
yeah he's absorbed by this personality
but once you're absorbed, that is
who you are, there's no like
fake self and fake self, like you are
what you do
I believe that he actually owned that persona
until he was faced with a bunch of
serious choices that he couldn't escape
and then he comes to realize this isn't me
I'm not Jaime Lannister, the king
slayer, the person who will
be with Cersei over everything else
I do care about, how do you, I'm confused
how do you justify this idea that
he doesn't do anything for the common people when he was at Winterfell?
Yeah, go back and watch those scenes
what is the thing that drives
Jaime to go to Winterfell?
It's Brienne, when they ask him
he looks at Brienne, he says
he repeats Brienne's words back to him
later he goes to Brienne and
he says the reason I'm here
and I'm not the fighter I used to be
but I would be honored
honor to
fight under your command
Doesn't he say that he made a promise to fight for the living?
Yes, he says it to Cersei
he says it to Cersei, again
it's about honor, his honor
to the people
not to the people
Well, yeah
sure, you can say it's interpretation
but what happens is, I have my interpretation
you have yours, and then
at the end, the show
contradicts your interpretation
and affirms mine
not just yours, other people's
one interpretation
is affirmed by the show at the end
one is contradicted
by the show, and people are like
bad writing, rather than
maybe this interpretation was wrong
maybe this interpretation
that Jaime- A large portion of the
fan base is wrong
Yes, because that's the way
the story functions
the story is intended to hoodwink
you into rooting for a tyrant
the story is intended to
make you think that characters
aren't going to do certain things
Jaime won't burn his daughter
Jaime won't go back to Cersei
That's not rooting for a tyrant, that's rooting for someone
who then after the fact becomes a tyrant
and then people's opinions change
people weren't rooting for Daenerys after she
became the tyrant
No, Daenerys was a tyrant the whole time
and we'll get to Daenerys
but
with Jaime, I mean
again, there's this idea, no
he really cared about the common people
well if you care about the common people, you'll do things
the common people regularly, right?
but he doesn't, like
what's he doing in- No, that's the point, is he's
absorbed by that persona
but that's part of who he is
like, it's, he does
in his breaks, it shatters
when he's brought to the brink, literally
the living versus death, he can't
do it anymore, he can't be that person
again, this is
scattered, what he does for Brienne
is crazy for Jaime Lannister
that's why everyone starts to like him at season 3
and they're like, wow
well, again, he
he- and you can't argue that
he's in love with her at that point, because that would be ridiculous
you what?
you can't argue that he's in love with Brienne
by the time he saves her from being raped
there's no way we're in love with that point
well, are you talking about the bear?
or saving her from being raped?
when I said saving her
from being raped
okay, well with that, I mean what he did is he just
he just
said, hey don't do that
when he knew full well that Jaime Lannister
that everyone understands
and knows would never have done that
you can tell, he's wrestling within that
scene, he keeps having loads of
looks towards what they're doing, where they're taking her
and he knows what the right thing is
it's not what Jaime Lannister would do
to Brienne, I think Jaime admires
Brienne a lot
because she represents ideals
that he really
wants to embody
yeah, absolutely she is him
but he's been trapped inside this
persona that was created unfairly by
Ned Stark
no, Ned Stark didn't
she isn't
him, she's a version of him that he would
like to be, he never is
he never fully finds that
that's the thing, Jaime is complicated
he's torn between these
two selves, and at the end
he sort of realizes that
who have
it's guilt at the end
he's like, look at all
the awful things I've done
that is who I am
you're saying like, oh no, that
that's not
the real Jaime, that's the persona
the dialogue is awful
oh no, it's great
he argues he's a hateful person
alright yeah, go ahead Gary
okay, we can, and I know
this is what this is about
is parsing out details, but
I'm gonna borrow something from our good friend
Robert Byer Burnett
Ferris Similitude
it's whether the audience buys
this, because the fan
is the arbiter of something
is actually
because they're buying
this product, and if this product wants
to continue, they do need to please a large
portion of the fans, not everybody
but enough to keep it going
well it does not keep going, it's over
well, they got a prequel coming
out, right? I'm sorry, I'm just
so, yeah
so
Mahler just pointed
out, Jaime going
back to Cersei, again, would make
sense if they had finished his
redemption arc
because he didn't want her
well, I mean, it could be argued, he was going down
there to save people, right, because he wanted
to go talk to her, but then he
ended up not wanting her to die alone
and he probably felt like
she didn't have anybody else in the world, there's a million ways
you can interpret, but the dialogue
was crap, him fighting
oh, I'm blanking on
his name now, Euron
at the end was just
dumb as hell, and then walking around with
a mortal wound for like an hour afterwards
I mean, people just checked
out at that point, and you have
to continue, this whole
series was based on
grounding fantasy
and making it like
digestible to normies
and it was, for the longest time
and they bought into this stuff
and normies are
the vast majority of people who
watch this show, honestly
and
they just lost it at the end
Jaime was acting out of character
because they did rush absolutely everything
some of the dialogue was just
terrible
and then a bunch of
stones falling on
when they could have walked 15 feet to the left
and they would have been fine
and then
the whole room was collapsed
they're not going to
it wasn't all collapsed
it was just parts of it that were collapsed
they're trapped in this room
there's nothing, there's no where
some of it is going to collapse
some of it is not
it was utterly ridiculous, the room they showed us
after the carnage does not
resemble the room we saw when everything
was falling apart whatsoever
alright, well that's logistic things
when you get into the logistics
well it deals with the death of important characters
it's kind of important
obviously you do agree
they aren't going to
frogger around, he's mortally wounded
she's losing it
that's it
they're trapped in this room, they can't
figure about the rocks
should they have staged
the room to look a little bit different after?
the fans aren't reading a script
they're watching a completed piece
of art that is visual
and that's all part
of it, that's all part of it
and if they don't execute that well
then that's part of his character
not being executed very well
even though it got executed
there's a big hole at the top of one of the piles of bricks
and Jamie starts pulling bricks off a different pile
it's like why don't you just climb the pile
with the gap and at the very
least they would have survived
by being at the top of that pile because as we saw
nothing actually falls down on it because Tyrion
sees it later
it's a bizarre scene
well this is still character criticism
because they apparently have no sense
of survival for some reason
but that's not like
stuff like maybe they're
exhausted and dying
or at least he is
like I said he was moving bricks for a different pile
he kept the energy to go from the beach all the way up to the top
of the castle and now he's
dying
he was moving bricks for a different pile
he had the energy he expected to row
seriously out to Pentos
I mean he wasn't going to row
to Pentos
what do you mean?
he wasn't going to row all the way to Pentos
what do you mean?
he was going to find like a boat
where?
out on the bay
what one of your own ships and just hope they let him have it
no like a
sailboat
like again and this is
stuff like it's kind of hopeless at this
point like Jaime knows either way
he's trying to get Cersei as far as he
can he's trying to get Cersei and his
unborn child as far as he can
he doesn't know that he's going to
survive he doesn't know how long he's going to survive
and I'm sure like I don't know
so he would take actions to extend his
survival time especially the survival of his
lover and child
he's trying his best but at this point
he's dying
again this is stuff that I don't really
get too much into like that's not perfect
but like whatever
I mean all I'd be after is you'd have to
consider it was pretty bad the way they did it
even if it's just from a logistical point of view
it was pretty bad
I honestly
I'd have to go watch it again
like this kind of logistics is
more than what I get into
and if people are upset
by that like I understand
I mean I guess the characters
are wanting to live as logistics
or something
is a character wanting to live
logistics
I don't think that at any time
I get the sense that
they don't want to live
I get the sense that they don't see a way
that they can live
well the big open hole
I didn't even see that
while I was watching like
I'm not even lying
but when we get into like
for me it's more about
like who is Jamie
why did he go back to stuff like that
is more of where my attention is
because that's where more of the complaints are
there's this
there's this sense with Jamie that like
he goes back to Cersei
oh it's out of nowhere
I don't think there is a redemption arc
Jamie is an exploration of
redemption but he's an exploration of
the limits of redemption
there's only
so much that this guy can
change
at a certain point he has to
think about
who he's been, what he's done
what does he deserve?
does he deserve to hang out at
Winterfell and live happily ever after with
the most honorable night in the story
no
well that's dependent on the actions that he
decides to take
in his mind
he has not
he's willing to die to protect the world
I don't really
what do you mean die to protect the world?
he's literally on the front lines on Winterfell
against the army of the undead
again it
everyone is going to die if they don't beat them there
exactly every single soldier there
is extremely brave, courageous and
what I would call the upstanding citizen
except when we get to episode 5
where they forget all of that
sure but Jamie for him it's about
his honor and his honor to Brienne
that's where it's at
it's not about innocent people
you're saying why doesn't
Jamie think of himself the same way
we think of him
or the same way you think of him and it's like well
because he doesn't feel that way
I don't really see it that way
why did they write him awful dialogue to shoehorn him
into an ending that we did not earn
as a progression
the thing
that makes it awful is that you don't
agree
with what he's saying about himself
but that's how
he feels like he was going to
kill every man, woman and child in
Riverrun to get back to Cersei
he pushed a kid
out a window
killed his cousin
he's still a guy who's done really
bad things and never
what would have happened if he hadn't pushed
Bran out the window
what would have happened?
it's
depends on how
it depends on
how well
Bran understood what he was seeing
so that's another thing where
a lot of people like to
have you guys seen Breaking Bad?
okay
Breaking Bad, people really
get into rationalizing waltz actions
some of them are
rationalized, they're
rational but they're not sure
some of them are rational
but there's this habit of
rationalizing waltz actions
oh no, he had to do that thing
he had to do that thing
but with Jaime when it comes down to it
the four of the five kings is his fault
him and Cersei
no
yes it is
it's because Joffrey is illegitimate
no it's
they created an illegitimate heir
to the throne
if that secret got out
you can't say that like oh
stop, stop, stop
the absolute
people behind the War of the Five Kings
little finger
the name
the crazy sister
and
we never get the answer in the show
but in the book it's Joffrey that tries
to get Bran assassinated
sure, those are all
true things, they're the three people
who are ultimately responsible for the biggest stones
being moved to create the War of the Five Kings
again this is like
you're just going back
with the dominoes, ultimately though
yes, little finger
is part of it, but little finger
tries to get Ned Stark to make peace with the
Lannisters
when he comes to, right after
Robert was dying
and he goes to little finger and he's trying to get
the city watch, little finger actually tries to get
Ned to make peace with the Lannisters, little finger
is weird, he's always up to
at early season little finger
his whole thing is to never be
how does he justify it?
I don't know if you remember Gary, but the whole thing
again, he's always positioning
himself trying to
it's not clear that little finger was trying
to create the War of the Five Kings
no, it's not about who's trying to create it
it's about who's trying to create it
but if it's not about who's trying to create it
then what is the root
cause of the war? It's
Joffrey's illegitimacy
no, no, no
it's like saying that Ned Stark decided to start a war
it doesn't matter if you wanted to start it
you may have started it, little finger
absolutely started it, whether or not he
intended to
along with Lysa Arryn
and Joffrey Baratheon
but what caused the War of the Five Kings?
what are people fighting about?
well, you got two significant
moments, Tyrion's kidnapping
which results in Tywin starting a war
which happened because Joffrey tried
to assassinate Bran because they believed
which happened because Jamie pushed
Graham out the window
which happened because Jamie
if you interrupt, I'm never going to be able to prove my point
which happened because
Jamie and Cersei are committing
a crime
we might say like, oh, they're in love
whatever, but they're committing
a crime, they're usurping
the throne, Robert expects
Robert, and the entire realm
expects that Robert's children
must be legitimate
right, have I finished now?
they are creating illegitimate children
that's a no
you take the throne, and that's
usurpation
that's really interesting, continue, Mauler
right, so
when Bran was pushed out the window
the most they had was suspicion on
the Lannisters, but they never had anything to act on
that was like Catelyn's big thing
so once Tywin acts on the war
after Tyrion is captured, the only
other element is what happens in King's Landing
which is directly resulting
from Tyrion's capture, Ned Stark
takes ownership of that
move which forces Jamie to attack him
partially kill his men
the results of
the Westerlands
armies starting to assault the Riverlands
which is something that Ned Stark
denights the Mountain for
and demands Tywin return
all of these extremely
complicated things start to unravel
and Ned Stark's
position as Hand never would have
occurred, neither would suspicions of the
Lannisters have happened if not for Lysa
and Littlefinger poisoning
the Hand of the King previous to Ned
whether or not, Jamie
and Cersei have an illegitimate son
under Robert Baratheon is literally irrelevant
to the War of the Five Kings at that point
it's
very relevant because it's
the reason that Stannis and Renly get involved
no, that's posts
that's after all the other shit happens
it's not the War of the Five
Kings until the Five
Kings are all at it
Stannis and Renly would be the War of the Three Kings
fine, I'm just referring to the fact that
war across the country begins
not the specifics of how many kings managed
to make it into the war
if we're going to be completely honest, Baelon Greyjoy
barely even counts, he took over Winterfell
and that was it
sure, sure, but if you
want to talk about it as just like war
then like, well yeah
the war between the Starks and
the Lannisters
isn't just because
Jamie and Cersei
have an illegitimate child
it is in a lot of ways
instigated because Jamie pushes
a kid out a window
and of course you can say just
suspicion, but he did do it
it's the follow-up, it's not that
it's the follow-up assassination attempt
it's that in a lot of ways
there's like a lot
of suspicion around that event
people like Bran doesn't follow what's happened there
Catelyn doesn't go to King's Landing without that
happening and that means she doesn't cross
Parthaterion on the road
everything changes
but again, this is just like
you're not wrong to all these
other events that are important
but ultimately you're trying to say that like
pushing a kid out a window
did not instigate these events
it's the inciting incident, even George R. R. Martin
has said the inciting incident
by this logic, everybody's great great great grandparents
are responsible because they birthed all the people that
resulted in these events
I don't think
that's the same logic
George R. R. Martin has called
Jamie pushing Bran out the window
the inciting incident
of the Lannister Starks
Catelyn to
kidnapped Tyrion
which incited
right, inciting incidents
incited more incidents
really George R. R. Martin
ultimately it's just a secret that
if Jamie and Cersei
were as smart as they thought they were
probably could have kept
but there was also an Ed
peeking around too
it's the first significant event of the TV show, that's why it's considered
the inciting incident, but we could have gone further
back, we could have started further forward
you keep saying that as if it means something
well it
I mean I guess if you don't care
that's true
authors, you're right, authors can be wrong
but again, this is all like subjective
like you say oh, well where did it start
okay, well you can say
that it started here, you can say this
the question is like, does Jamie not have any
reason to feel guilty about the things that he's done
of course he does, and he
does feel guilty, and maybe you
think, no, it was okay
he was stopping a war, well maybe
Jamie isn't the kind of guy that feels
that way, and it's okay for
us to disagree with the characters
about the things
that they do and how they feel about their own
action, but that's
who Jamie is and that's how he feels
and he's always
really been like this guy
who's like you say, trying to
buy into a
version of himself
that's the
King Slayer persona, but is also
really
pulled down by guilt
inciting incidents are subjective, someone said that
in the chat, and that's true
Hitler invading Poland
was just subjective
how do you even conclude that inciting incident
is subjective?
someone said it in the chat
okay, and you don't believe that right?
you guys are saying that the inciting, I'm saying
inciting incident, Jamie pushed his brain out the window
you guys are saying, no, George RR Martin is wrong
it's Joffrey with the
okay fine, the inciting incident
is Jamie and Cersei having sex
now the inciting incident is them deciding
going up to the tower, and just keep drawing
it back
the first significant place
where we can never go back is once
the assassination attempt on Bran
is attempted, that's when
Catelyn knows someone is actually trying to kill him
as opposed to he fell off a wall
well, the idea that
you can never go back, you can always go
back, like there's no
there's no
like Catelyn didn't have to conclude
that it was the Lannisters
she did, because her sister told her that
they are the ones that killed Jon Arryn
right, so you're
do you think that they can inspire him to take over the
throne, which makes a lot of sense that they
would kill Bran as an attempt to start
knocking out all the Starks
why would they start with Bran?
because it's an easy way to kill somebody if you knock him off a building
when he climbs them
well, why would they be in the tower?
again, it's kind of
it's kind of a silly place to take it
I
I think they actually agree with you
and that's why it's unlikely
that Catelyn would have concluded that they
had killed him, or tried to kill him in that instance
but once someone tries to kill him in his bed
it becomes very likely that someone probably
pushed him off
I mean, sure, but this isn't
trying to get this from like
I don't necessarily
not to be overly competitive in this
debate
how is that moment
not the inciting incident
it's that assassination attempt
that's what unravels everything
Catelyn tells Ned
subjectively, you could say
it is subjective
all narrative is subjective
all narrative is subjective
is it subjective that
Daisy Ridley, or that Rey is
a character in The Last Jedi?
no, that is a fact
alright, well, moving along then
so
you're trying to get to this
again, I don't
really agree, but I don't think
this needs to be the debate because you're trying to get
what is objectively the inciting incident
because Jamie is going to believe
you're not counter arguing
we're talking about Jamie's beliefs
I give you a whole bunch of references
like four different ways that moment
moves into all of the ways that create
the war, and your response is that it's your subjective
perspective
it doesn't matter, we'll move
on to that
so do you agree, that is
the inciting incident with the assassination, do you
finally agree with that, and we can move on to whether or not Jamie
thinks that the assassination is the inciting
incident, I do not agree
well then, what's the point in asking whether or not
Jamie thinks that
you can't even get past a narrative being subjective
a narrative is subjective
it's not, that makes no sense
because I don't see inciting
incident that way
did Daenerys kill hundreds of thousands
of people in episode five, or is that subjective?
no, that's
well, technically
we're never given a number
there we go, here's a bunch of tangled Christmas tree lights
you can't possibly figure your way out of this
a narrative is subjective, other than the things that aren't
sure, some things
are objective, like a fact
but what is the inciting, that's like saying
the main character, to me
inciting incident is like main character
who is the main character?
subject, right
it depends on what your definition of main is
right, it depends on your
definition of inciting incident
and once you create a groundwork for main character
then you can assess that objectively
I agree, what is your
definition of inciting incident?
I would say the inciting incident
is the
you know, I would honestly
have to look
more into it, if I'm being totally
honest, this isn't my area
that's fine, so what I would say
my definition of inciting incident
is the incident everything
comes back to, where it all
where all of the balls roll
from, where nothing can stop
them, because everything else is going to be
because this, this, because
this, this, if that's it
then I would again come back
to the pushing out the window
so you think there was only one way for that to
result, that once he's pushed out the window the war was
just set to happen?
yes
because, well
because you're saying that like, they could have just chosen
no, when Joffrey, when Joffrey,
let's follow your, you're saying that like
oh well, no, the inciting incident
is Joffrey sending
the cat spa, right?
but, and
but the fact that it
goes to war is based on people
making certain decisions
right? it's possible
that people make different decisions
yes
so you're agreeing that it was
possible for Catlin to
not
not
take Tyrion hostage, right?
there was no reason for him to take him hostage
when Brans pushed out the window, the cat's
paw leads her to Tyrion, the attempt
on Brans' life leads her to Ned
but did Catlin have to take Tyrion hostage?
how would
anything else take place, if she bumps into Tyrion
on the road, why would she not take him hostage
when she has information confirming that he was the
person who ordered the assassination on Brans?
well, she doesn't
have information confirming
yes she does, she trusts Littlefinger
why did she trust Littlefinger?
because they grew up together
shouldn't she know not to
trust him then?
if you're fucking kidding me right now
I just think that this is
again, you're not going to like it
if I subject it
but again, this isn't really
what I want to be talking about
just personally
I'm not here to
debate the inciting incident
you see it as this, I see it as this
you get to
what's in the line
Jamie's head
we should know what's in Jamie's head
we have to separate again
book
because we know what's in Jamie's head in the book
he is concerned with his honor
he is really stuck on
making sure the star girls are okay
the whole river run
negotiation goes down completely
different
in the
show
and they skip past a lot of his
redemption arc
it had to happen that way
because if we in the book
if we get to the ending that George has intended
if that indeed is it
it would have flipped that and it would have made
sense with build up because George
as you know loves to build up
big grand plans and have them go sideways
that's pretty much the only constant
in Game of Thrones or in the Song of Ice and Fire
but at the end
the audience did not buy
a large portion of the audience
I'm not going to say everybody
personally did not buy
Jamie's decision to just
turn around and go down there
it didn't feel natural to me
it didn't work for me in any way shape or form
and I think I have proof with
Dave Benioff having to explain
everything at the end of every episode
well they've been doing that
since the beginning
even when people weren't
if it was bad before that doesn't make it
okay
they didn't start
explaining at the end because it got bad
unless you think it was always bad
and they were always explaining
before they were explaining
they did not explain as much
as they did this last season
you can't tell me that that's the case
because initially Game of Thrones
has a lot of characters
so it was always
good if you have a group of people watching
Game of Thrones that have the one person who did read the book
that can explain
because there's a lot of characters in there
and there's a lot of information for people to take in
so that was good
and that's partially why they did it
but they started at the end really getting into
character intention and having to
you know Danny kind of forgot
what?
that contradicted everything
that led up to that because somebody
did mention that the Iron Fleet was still around
so as far as Jaime
is concerned, again
subjective, objective, whatever
I personally did not buy into his arc
fell apart at the end
because he stopped being the Jaime Lannister
that we had watched
through the previous seasons
as did every character
when did his arc fall apart?
when did his arc fall apart?
fell apart for me
Dorne
Dorne
Dorne?
so not when you go back to the end
he was still somewhat
on a redemption arc though
I didn't like it
but he was still
on that redemption path but then
it just stopped
everything just stopped
when did it stop?
did it stop? the exact moment
I'll have to go back and look
but it stopped for me personally
and that's all I can really
speak for but a lot of people
agreed with me in my livestreams
and
I've heard that from others as well
so and we can
see in the chat, when did it stop for you
in the chat? when did you stop buying Jaime's
redemption arc?
when did the writers stop believing
in it? because they ran out of time
damn show
looks like the stream
went down for a moment
yeah, it's happening for me too
give it just a second
hopefully it'll pop back up and we can
continue right along
you guys can hear me, it's a good
chance to see
I can hear you, yeah
I can hear everyone
let me see
looks like we've been hacked
no no
no no
yeah
everything just stopped
I refreshed and nothing
let me see
still not back up
yeah, it doesn't look like it is up
still spooling
it's weird, I can still keep the live chat
but I'm not actually seeing the stream
itself
thing
huh
give it a second
I will use the loon in the meantime
hmm
ditch them in post
one second
what did you say was back up?
I see it back up
okay
I don't know if Youtube will stitch those
hopefully they do, if they don't also
yeah, it's back up for me as well
um, Nervotic
yes
I kind of wanted to talk about something
so, I do want to get to Danny
but before I get to Danny
I want to get to Danny
I do want to get to Danny
but before that
something you talk about is like
well the audience didn't buy it
and the audience has to buy it
that's like a big part of your belief
and I do understand that
the question is like oh well
I don't know if it's a belief
it's what I've witnessed
sure, right
whatever word we use for it
I
I do understand that
like this
the premise that this show is being made
for X number of people
and if most of those people
don't buy it then that means
they fail in some way
and based on that
criteria then
yeah sure, like how good it is
can just be a poll
right, you can take a poll
and if 80%
of the people, if 70%
didn't like it then that's an obvious
fail, hell it's 50
to fail
but that's not, and by that there's
really no argument for me to make
but that's not really
the way I look at it
when I look at why people didn't buy it
I don't think it's
about them not
setting it up, again I don't think
that the reason people didn't buy
Jamie's Turn is because it wasn't set up
I think it's because people
had
people would watch the show for an hour
and then read about
it in articles and in fan
theories and talk about it with people
and then build up their own
conception of who Jamie is
and what he would do
and so their own
sort of
expectations
and presumptions about the story
started to bleed into the actual
story, which is why there isn't a lot
of people willing to go back
and think, oh was I wrong about anything?
That to me
is my main
concern is that
we're so sure that we're right
the first time around and we're not
interested in going back and being like
let me look at this again
and see if I'm just
mistaken, which for me that's a thing
that I did, I was very wrong about Daenerys
and I've
gone back since and I've checked out her
story again. Cersei, another character
I think I really didn't understand
till
kind of recently, till I really looked at her story
as a whole and thought, oh
that's what this was all about.
So I don't think that it's just
like, oh the audience didn't buy it, that means they
failed. I think there is an
element of the audience
getting
really
into it.
Well I would say if the goal of the show is to convey concepts
and most people don't understand the concepts
or agree with them, I would say that is a failure.
Do you think the goal of the show is to convey
concepts? I mean I agree, I just didn't.
Not everyone agrees
with that.
I think
that
the reason a lot of people didn't get it
or
the reason a lot of people
the concepts weren't conveyed is because
people are very
kind of
distrustful of the show
by the end. It's screwed over their favorite characters.
It's made a lot of mistakes
especially in
season 6 and 7. There's
premise that you don't have to trust the show.
It's possible that the writers are just wrong.
So it's easy to be like, oh well everything
is wrong then. Fuck it.
I don't know.
If you have a lot of people who say
that
it's wrong for
reason X and you have a lot of people who say that it's right
for the same thing. They're all watching
the same show. How do you
differentiate between the two?
How do you find out who's correct?
For instance, all the people
What's the
methodology that you would use
to tell the difference between a fan
who didn't like the show
because it didn't end the way that they
personally wanted it to end and a fan who didn't like
it because it didn't make any sense.
How would you find the difference between the two?
A lot of different ways. I think you just
have to level a discussion like we're having now.
Sometimes it's easy. If someone's like
oh I didn't like the fight choreography
it's like alright well there you go.
But if someone says like
Well we can take that example. Is that a valid reason
to say the show's bad or an invalid one?
I think almost
everything is valid because it's a
show and people are allowed to feel
how they want to feel about it.
I do think it's about I didn't
I didn't personally
enjoy
most of the
choreography
the military strategy sort of
the way the Long Night episode was done.
I personally wasn't a huge fan of that.
I also didn't
like the
Are You Killing the Night King personally?
Would you have done it different?
I would have no idea how to stage a battle.
I don't.
I'm just asking if you would have done it different.
Not how or anything. Just if you would do it different.
Yes.
Alright.
I think that
people should have died off a little bit more
unceremoniously in that battle.
And I think Theon
should have killed the Night King.
Those are my
really high level
that's what I think needs to
but that's just my opinion.
Alright.
I like Theon killing the Night King.
That would have been cool.
Yeah. I think that
for me, the reason for that
is that the Night King embodies
death. That's conceptually
what he is. And Theon
overcame death by accepting death
because death is an inevitability.
With Arya they had this whole like, oh you say not today
to the God of death. But then it's just like
that's just the line.
Everyone dies.
Like, Theon accepted death
went into it with courage
and he
I think he's about delaying death.
Not about stopping. Right. Delaying death.
But like, I think the
for me personally I think
the more compelling way
to deal with death, deal
with that character is to
embrace it
and
go into it in
a way you can be proud of.
And that's what Theon sort of does.
He overcomes just for like
a second his trauma and he
dies.
But he dies thinking he failed to
protect Bran.
I don't love that.
But
I think that's awfully
insulting to Theon as a character
to have that ending for him.
I don't, I don't
I wouldn't go so
far as to call it insulting. I think it's kind of sad.
But that's the thing.
Like Theon
it's not
there's a line in the books like
men's lives matter
not their death or something.
I'm sure I'm butchering it. But like, yeah
maybe his last
second was like oh I failed
but
he died
knowing that he did his best.
It's not my
favorite but I do
I do
I do think I would have done that
theme differently. I don't like
like Arya
but
by the end it was
not at the top of my list of things
about the season anymore. You know what I mean?
Because when I watched episode three
which was got me pulled into what got me
pulled into all of this when Arya just
shows up from the aether in
stabs him.
I know the first, one of the first thoughts
that I had when I saw that was how the hell
did you get here? How did you get past an
entire army of people?
This doesn't seem to make any sense at all
yeah this doesn't seem to make any sense at
all that you were able to just
apparently materialize right behind him.
And so
that for me
that's one of those things that is a
I don't know if you would call that logistics
however you're using it. But to me
that seems like just something that's
impossible for anyone to do but it just happens
so that a thing can occur.
Those are the kinds of things that for people like me
really take us out of a show.
Something happens
just because it needs to happen regardless of how
much sense it really makes. Those are
the kinds of things that make a story crumble.
Those are the things that make
writing just fall apart.
It's the execution
of these things that happen.
I couldn't agree more with that
and that's what
caused Game of Thrones Season 8 to collapse overall
was they had that ending.
They had a meeting with George R. Martin, Dan and Dave.
It was years previous where he sat down at a dinner
and I'm not remembering this perfectly
but he basically
and he gave him the ending.
It's some context for what led up to it but not a ton.
And they had to fill in a lot of blanks.
That's not, sorry to interrupt, that's not quite right.
He gave them the ending at the beginning.
They knew the
basic ending from the beginning.
He gave them the broad strokes.
Alright, here's everyone's character arc.
Here's all my outline
is what he gave them.
Broad strokes but they
had already made decisions that
wouldn't connect with those broad strokes
because of the
sample chapters we've seen with Winds of Winter.
We were talking about this prior to the show.
Arya's chapter
that they used.
Just completely out of context and it didn't fit at all
within the show and it was executed poorly.
I'll say just to be nice.
So just to be clear,
so D&D knew what the
endings would be from the beginning?
They knew the
very basic, they knew King Bran.
I think they knew
the
I don't know the detail, but they knew the end.
So they had all that time to set it up properly.
Between season three and season four
they got
kind of George R.R. Martin's big info dump.
Here's what I have.
Here's what I have.
Here's the broad strokes. I haven't written it yet.
I hear a lot of people saying they didn't know at all.
Couldn't have. If they knew King Bran.
If they knew King Bran, why would they?
No, they definitely knew King Bran.
There's foreshadowing for King Bran in the
Oh, I don't. You know
when you go back and watch season one, King Bran is very believable.
At least for me.
No, I believe King Bran, but leaving him out for a complete season
is dumb. It's a bad decision.
It disconnects the viewer with the character.
So
and then his just his being robot Bran towards the end
with no build up.
And yeah, it's not really a character once he comes back.
Bran is, you know, Bran is my favorite character in the books.
I love Bran in the books.
Bran is complicated because I actually like
understand why they made the decisions that they did with Bran.
I don't know if I agree with them.
But one thing is like Bran's story is a story written about a child.
And it's hard to take that
and make that a story about a teenager slash adult.
So that's where the talent comes in.
I mean, well, I guess now that we're talking about talent,
this is like a slightly different, you know,
we said at the beginning, like how bad our D&D versus how good is the ending
are very kind of different discussions.
But I do think people are underestimating just how
complicated this story is.
Like for one, like when I talk to most people,
like where did it really go off the rails, right?
They'll say season five.
Is most book fans, most most so not everyone,
like most most people will just say season eight.
But when I kind of like, you know, people are really into it,
they'll start to say season five.
And that makes sense because seasons one through four
are covering the first three books.
In season five, they have to do like feast and dance.
I think people don't quite realize just how impossible
those books are to adapt on to television.
What do you think,
do you think the fact that those stories were spread across two books
is why they had to end up killing Barristan the way they did?
I can't give an answer on that.
My question is,
until we know how Barristan story actually ends,
I can't say that for sure.
Okay, the question wasn't necessarily important.
What I was trying to prove with my point was the biggest issues
fans have with season five don't, to me, tell me,
you see, they had to do that because of the story being all
messed up between two books that they were adapting.
Fans have issues with just straight up singular decisions.
I guess you'd have to specify a little more like who is fans,
what are the issues.
Gary, just remind me if I'm missing some,
but like Barristan's death was a big issue people have with season five.
The death of Stannis, basically Stannis' whole story in season five,
people are very upset with that.
What else is there?
Because I'd have to rewatch season five.
Well, season five has hard home.
It's got Arya's first season in Braavos.
It's got Sansa being given over to Ramsay.
That's a big sticking point for people.
Ooh, yeah, that didn't work out well.
Well, yeah, Littlefinger not knowing about the Boltons was very hard
for anybody to buy.
That was a weird choice from D&D.
Yeah.
So what I'm getting at is that I don't actually consider it the source
of these issues is, well, it's tough to adapt these two books to a season
of TV.
I'm just like, oh, no, it's just very singular specific decisions
they're making that were pissing everybody off.
I'm assuming you know that the act of a Barristan like pleaded with them
not to kill him that way because that's just not.
Yeah, I do know about that.
Yeah.
You know, for one, I like I don't know.
Like I'm thinking it's like Barristan, especially also Sansa's storyline.
We actually don't know where that's going in the books.
There's a lot of really conflicting ideas in the fandom
about where she's going to go.
Barristan also, like some people swear that he's going to turn over
to a young Griff.
Other people, myself, I think he's going to be killed by the brazen beast.
It's going to get killed.
But by the like the shave paint is going to send the have the brazen beast
just kill him because he want he will have killed the child hostages.
We're getting into really book heavy stuff.
For me, like I don't you see, like, I don't know if the thing that you're
saying about singular decisions and what I'm saying are necessarily
mutually exclusive.
I don't personally love season five.
I will say I actually like season five better than season six and seven.
For me, six and seven are my real sticking point.
I think that the difficulty with adapting feast and dance is that you have
you split the books over like half the characters are in one book,
characters or another.
Some of them are in both for some reason.
That's very hard to adapt.
Like some people say, oh, no, just use the boiled leather reading list.
You just do them in chronological order.
But like, well, if you do that, then you're you're dividing up the
character arcs, right?
Like season like book five.
The reason he did it that way is that a dance with dragons would cover
John's like an arc for John Snow.
Like he would start here who start as Lord Commander and assassinated.
But if you split them up, then like then where do you like end it?
Again, this that's where the talent part comes in.
I think the idea that something is difficult to do.
You're paid to do that difficult job that that's your job is to do
something that is difficult.
You know, I agree.
You're saying that something is difficult, that it's hard to do is not an
excuse for failure.
It might be an explanation to some degree.
But again, that's where the talent and the capability come in.
Well, I agree.
Excuse implies like to me, it's an explanation, not an excuse.
But again, the idea of excuse implies that like justice needs to be
done or like if you don't if you hear that and still don't forgive them,
then that's up to you.
If you hear that and you don't like still don't like it, then that's fine.
For me, though, the place where I just kind of interject is that so a lot
of people see this and they're like, see, it's because they're idiots.
They don't know how to write.
They don't know the characters.
They don't know anything.
It's like, well, you know, George R.
Martin has spent eight years like on the last on the winds of winter.
The idea that like all D&D should have just like in a in a year done
this thing that George R.
Martin himself couldn't figure out how to do, which was keep his
characters together in one book.
But we don't have any context for exactly why that happens beyond maybe
lines from him.
What if he's busy with something else?
He's lost the passion for Game of Thrones.
What if he's right?
We only have to write.
Sure.
We have to assume.
But is it not possible that the reason is that this story is so expansive
and so complex that it's actually just very hard to adapt?
And that's not saying we have to excuse them.
But that is why I do it at all.
Yeah, it's almost like why even bring it right.
I mean, they do did do it and they did try a lot.
The thing about season five is like, yeah, I didn't love season five.
You guys seem like you didn't love season five.
Most people loved season five, like if you look at the way it's received
like, yeah, there's like, you know, there's that episode with Sansa
that really stuck in people's crop.
But for the most part, people like season five.
And, you know, I don't like season six, personally.
That's my I don't know what's my least favorite, but that's the season
that I really harp on the most.
People love season six.
The last two episodes of season six are.
Does it mean it's good or not?
Well, good is subjective to me anyway.
Does it adhere to good?
The qualities of good right consistency?
It's not in not in my opinion.
I don't know.
So it's different.
People have different qualities of good writing.
So we have a state as well.
They were offered way more time and way more season.
But they didn't take it.
They were offered that.
But they had a plan that they thought this is going to again,
I don't know.
It's also the idea that like, oh, well, they wanted Star Wars money.
So they left.
I don't buy that because they came up with the outline before they were
offered Star Wars money.
They were offered the stars money very like a couple of few years ago.
They had this plotted out.
And if they really wanted to hurt, like they spent the last two years.
I mean, you can say that they should have done it faster,
but they spent two years on those last six episodes.
And I think that's a good question.
Sure.
You can say that it's shocking.
I think it's more to do with just how again,
we don't like the long night maybe, but like that,
that required a lot of work.
There was a lot of shooting there.
Like the bells in the long night or even if you don't like them,
let's say they're shit, right?
They're still cinematic shit, right?
Like they, so obviously we know why that would take a long time.
Like, no, I don't think anyone's denying that work wasn't done.
It's that the final product was low quality.
Well, yeah, that's, that's the argument.
I'm just like kind of because you might be talking to people who don't care
about if it's hard or not.
Cause I certainly don't care if it's difficult or not.
I care about the finished product.
Sure. I mean, that's well,
we'll I'm sure we're going to get back to the finished product.
I mean, you know,
you know, they filmed the Lord of the Rings trilogy in 274 days.
So it's very impressive.
Yeah. I don't know what else to say about that.
And they skipped a different animal though, in terms of, uh,
I mean, they, they,
they skipped some narrative stuff that was pretty important, uh,
contextually about the ring.
But they had the, the source material.
But they, yes, they did,
but they skipped it and they still executed it well.
I, you know, after I was,
it didn't bother me at all that they didn't bring that stuff up,
uh, because it was executed properly to me anyway,
it was, it's,
I love Lord of the Rings and I thought they did a good enough job showing
some of the stuff that the ring does that they probably could have
explained a little better.
And it didn't take the audience out of it.
Just because something is hard,
doesn't mean somebody shouldn't do anything.
And, uh, yeah,
I think it should be talked about that,
that they made this decision.
Not my position at all.
Right.
That, that because it's hard,
they should, they should, but like, I am saying that like,
so like, I don't know what,
where are you guys are like,
a lot of these communities like free folk and like all the red,
it's like D and D are like,
just talked about like they're the worst,
dumbest people on the planet.
And I think it's like,
how many people could adapt this story?
Like how many people have that talent?
How many people do you think?
How many people? Yeah.
I'm actually curious.
How many people do you think?
Like a percent?
No.
Oh.
Percent.
Yeah.
Less than one.
Yeah.
Okay.
Less than one for sure.
Uh, but like everyone on every subreddit is like,
I could do it.
I know.
Just do this easy.
And it's like,
so I'm not saying that like complaints are invalid because it's hard.
I'm saying that like,
it's hard.
So don't act like anyone could do it.
Don't act like you have to be an idiot not to do it.
That's my stance anyway.
I think I use this analogy with Major Lee about TLJ or defending like
Ryan Johnson's effort.
Just like we've got this target and what I think your picturing is like
they've shot and they've, they've hit just off the bullseye.
Let's just say halfway to the target,
they just missed and this other guy's like,
I could hit that bullseye and you're like,
could you really though?
While I'm arguing like,
Oh, they didn't just miss the bullseye D&D like shot themselves in their head
when they were supposed to hit the bullseye.
Like this is an insane degree of a miss that I would literally reroll
anybody making it again.
Like Tommy Wiseau,
I would take as long as he took the time to watch the whole show in advance.
I would, I would watch Tommy Wiseau.
I know, but I'm unironically arguing that I think he would have had more
respect for the characters than D&D seemed to.
Okay. If you actually mean that.
Well, I mean, just just a small sidebar,
like what would you say is the most disrespectful writing you've ever seen to
a character in just anything in your entire life from an author in anything?
You know, I did not come prepared with that.
Oh, I'm not saying if you don't have an answer, that's fine.
But I was thinking off the top of your head, you have anything.
What do you think of the last Jedi, for example?
I don't care about the last Jedi.
Okay.
I really don't.
Like it's, it's, it's something where like I,
a lot of the complaints people have, I don't agree with.
I think it's kind of a dumb movie.
I think more Star Wars again, we're not going to get it.
I think more Star Wars is just dumb.
I don't think that in your video,
you say that there are characters that you don't think were handled well.
Maybe one of those, maybe you could, are you?
All right.
Are you?
Would you ever describe this disrespectful to Arya or do you just wouldn't
use that word at all?
I would not use that word personally.
I mean, I'm not offended if people use it.
I'm not saying you're wrong.
100% of you use it, but I think that Arya, because like,
I think Arya is a character who,
and then it's like, I mean,
I probably everything I'm saying is controversial to most of the
audience, but I'll say that I think putting Sansa in the Jane
Poole storyline is less offensive than putting
Arya in the Lady Stoneheart.
Because Arya is sort of turned into this game breaking character,
right?
Like we're talking earlier, like, oh,
how does she get past all the soldiers?
Well, for a couple of seasons now, Arya is like,
I can kill anyone at any time because I'm just that good.
Just that good from a few months of training.
And I'm like, that's not interesting to me.
I think with Arya, the showrunners sort of traded out empowerment.
Like they sort of tried to depict empowerment through just strength.
Like she's tough at killing people.
So she's empowered rather than like really exploring what,
like what her spending more time with what her trauma is.
I wrote, like I had a Reddit post about Cersei the other day.
And I think that one of the biggest misses is that at the end of
season six, Arya feeds Walder Frey to his,
or these Walder Frey's kids to him and then slices his throat.
And then opening season seven, she'd killed the rest of his family.
And then D&D are like, well, this is a really dark path.
You got to wonder for Arya.
And then they sort of never have any real consequences come from that.
And for me, that's something that I think was not handled well.
It's an area where like the theme of Arya's,
of a lot of the stories, how war and how violence harms the human soul,
is sort of lost in our, like we see it a little bit in season seven,
which is season seven.
Winterfell is one of the worst stories,
probably the worst storyline they've ever done.
We see a little bit of it there.
So what was that?
I'm just happy that you'd think that's bad.
Yeah.
No, I think that's the worst thing.
Like a lot of people hate Dorne, but it's like,
at least Dorne wasn't like ended.
You know what I mean?
I will give it to you that Dorne was crap,
but I was way more upset at Sansa and Arya outsmarting little finger.
Yeah.
And not only that, but the part where Arya like,
Poe tries to kill Sansa or threatens her.
I don't even understand what those things are anymore.
Yeah.
I think that was, well, to me that was dumb.
Not because she did it, or not because she threatened it,
but because it didn't do anything, right?
If like that had had some kind of consequences,
like, oh, Arya threat, Arya leads like a,
Arya gets so against Sansa that she leads a rebellion or something or
like, I got that stupid.
But if she had done something that had some kind of consequences,
then I would maybe be interested in that.
But instead it's just, oh,
they argue a bit and it gets weirdly violent,
like in words and then nothing bad happens because they figure out that
it's little finger because of course they do.
And then it's over.
I mean, so Ryan refocus, then we talk about Daenerys.
Sure.
That's the big one.
So, uh, opening statements.
So, okay.
Someone else.
Go for it.
You go.
Me?
Okay.
Daenerys' story is sort of about how we can rationalize and support
tyrannical methods when they're being leveled against systems that we deem
abhorrent.
And then when we change our perspective and we see those,
we see those same methods being leveled against the system,
which we have more empathy for.
They start to actually look like tyranny.
So I think in that regards,
the area that people are wrong about is that, oh, Daenerys turns.
She changes completely in the last.
It's like, no, Daenerys just was who she always was.
It's just that the system is different.
I think that's what they wanted.
Um, but they didn't get there because Daenerys, it doesn't like, this is,
this, you might call this a logistical argument.
What the hell is she doing?
Killing a bunch of screaming civilians when her only issue is Cersei.
I would not call that logistical.
No, but are you asking?
So what I'm referring to is like the mapping out King's landing.
You're like, Lord mowers her way to Cersei.
Why?
Well, her issue wasn't just Cersei.
Um, I think you have to look at Daenerys and think, well,
what, what is her experience been, uh,
conquering people and then, uh, ruling.
Uh, when she takes Marine, uh,
the people rise up because they agree with her cause and they're like,
all right, we're with you.
We also want to be free.
So let's make Daenerys our queen.
And so then they, they take the city.
Daenerys is made queen.
And then despite all that, all these people come in and they're like,
well, she's not our queen and she's not from here.
And they start a movement against her.
So eventually you have to deal with that.
Um, in Westeros,
she has this issue where she's being rejected by everyone, right?
Like in the North, they're rejecting her in King's landing.
They're rejecting it.
Like the common people don't want Queen Daenerys because there's no class
consciousness.
There's no sense that, but Daenerys is selling.
We want to buy, uh,
she just doesn't have her ear to the ground on what this society wants.
Like she did in Slaver's Bay.
So what she's doing when she's, uh, she's basically, uh,
uh, bypass trying to bypass that issue.
Like, no, I'm going to rule through fear.
Uh, and in, uh,
when you rule through fear oftentimes in like medieval,
like feudal societies, like, yeah,
it means showing that you can kill civilians with impunity because if you
can do that, you are the top dog.
You're the Lord.
You're the king.
You're the queen.
I mean, feudalism is just a mafia protection racket.
I don't know.
I think living in a castle with a dragon at your beck and call would do that
just fine instead of killing tens of thousands of innocent people.
You're wrong.
Literally just under like a million.
Oh, well, we don't ever get the number, but an insane amount.
I think it would be a safe to say.
I mean, you saw the wreckage, right?
So the population of King's Landing is one million zigzagging as if the
purpose was to try and kill as many innocent people as possible.
Like as if she was doing it as if that was the goal while ignoring the
castle, which was interesting.
Right there.
She didn't totally know.
She, she fucked up that castle.
Um, but I think, but that wasn't, I think that was eventually.
Yeah.
The goal was to, uh, instill fear and, uh, essentially show herself as, uh,
someone that you do not want to cross.
Like don't try and, don't try and rebel against me.
Don't try and replace me with Jon Snow.
Uh, that was her goal.
And she was immediately assassinated by the person she thought would not
assassinate her.
Yes.
Interesting.
Interesting how that works.
That all worked for you.
You know, it didn't work the first time around, uh, it was an issue where like
when I first saw it, I'm like, no, this isn't, this doesn't, this isn't.
And then I went back and I sort of rewatched the show, uh, not the whole
show, but I rewatched certain episodes and like certain parts of it.
And my perception of who Daenerys was really changed on a second watch.
Like I really saw things that I hadn't really noticed before.
Um, and saw that like, actually, yeah, this, this person is first of all,
kind of crazy.
Um, like people say she went, I know she's, she walked into a funeral tire.
Uh, that's crazy.
Um, she had confirmation.
The fire doesn't burn here up to that point.
So she's never been in, she's never been in fire.
She's been in hot things.
She's never touched fire.
Um, well, the second she walks into it and doesn't burn, I think that's
confirmation, isn't it?
Yeah.
Well, at that point, she would actually started to burn her.
She wouldn't have just stayed there.
I mean, she set up an entire like ritual with the dragon.
She was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go in.
If she had started walking into the fire and it burned her, do you think
she would say nothing and continue walking?
I think it's, I'm not a doctor.
It's like, you're not going to hear me scream.
You don't have to be a doctor, mate.
Right.
No, I'm, I'm, I'm, it's a joke.
I'm not a doctor, but I tend to think that if people are burning, they
will naturally move away from the thing.
Like immediately.
You're just naturally aware.
So like, so like, yeah, of course I think that if started burning her,
she'd move away.
But I think a crazy person would do that too, uh, because you would,
your physical impulses would take over.
Anything that anyone could do that couldn't be justified by,
justified by saying they were crazy.
Yes.
Um, but it's, it's not just crazy, right?
Uh, or I don't, sorry.
We've that question.
Could you give me an example?
I, I don't, I don't know what something you, something that,
let me explain this and maybe I think this will answer your question.
Um, it's not just crazy, right?
It's not just like, it's the,
it's like this person is willing to go to a certain extremes
to, uh, to pursue what they believe is right.
Um, like people are like, oh, well,
the nearest never punches down.
It's like, uh, actually she has, uh, and people are like, oh,
Danara's, uh, never, um, never tortures people.
Yes, she does.
Uh, there is never harms, harms the innocent.
She does actually.
Like all of those things, like she has done before, like everything.
We focus on the third one.
What she does in King's Landing, huh?
Focus on that third one.
Oh, which was the third one.
So let's just go through the innocence.
She is killed.
Oh, let's say murdered.
Has she murdered any innocence?
Well, when I said innocent, I mean, someone who is not guilty.
Sure. Yes.
In season five, she feeds a man to her dragon.
Uh, to send a message.
But she's under the impression that he is a man that's a part of a group
that's destroying the city.
She is not under.
She she thinks that, well, let me she's like, I don't know who's part of it.
I'm going to gather up all the the leaders of Marine,
bring them here.
And I don't know which one of you is guilty and which one of you is innocent.
It turns out all of the financiers of the Sons of the Harpy
were from other slave cities.
But anyway, she's like, well, it's probably one of you guys.
I'm going to pick a random one, feed him to a dragon.
Yeah. I mean, were they slavers as well?
So that doesn't sound like they have been slavers.
Yeah, there's a rationale there.
And it's all in favor of
dominating with a peaceful society for the people who live there.
Like that's your end goal.
She's trying to prevent Sons of the Harpy from causing insane chaos in her city.
So let's talk about rationale, because remember earlier,
I mentioned Walter White here, it's actually way more applicable.
Yes, there is a rationale there.
And when I saw it, I was like, you know,
even though that guy might not have been guilty, I'm OK with this because like,
fuck him, he was a slaver, right?
I'm not going that far.
I'm not saying she was morally right.
I'm saying that from her perspective, what she's doing is for the greater good.
But like, we feel that impulse, right?
But when you look at or maybe like the audience,
I think is meant to like kind of understand.
It's a grisly scene, but it is grisly.
But when you think about it, like, did she do it just to send a message
or did she just do it because she was fed up?
This was right after Paris and Selmy died.
You see when she's doing it, she actually enjoys.
Like it's kind of like a cruel and unusual thing to enjoy
that kind of suffering on other people.
But in a lot of cases, Daenerys does like you look at her face
when she burns people, there's like a weird satisfaction.
Well, the phrase. Yes.
Like, as I was saying before, like they didn't.
Is I didn't explore that
like Sansa when she kills.
Yes. Yes.
I like like, again, that was also in my Reddit post from the other day.
Like they didn't really explore those well enough.
Although I will say there is there's a bit of a difference between like
Oh, Sansa is like, this is a person who is specifically OK, wait, hurt me.
Like, this is like a person who has tortured me.
And I know that with Daenerys, it's often and it's with people who had not
you just expressed that you actually felt like a sort of fuck.
Yeah. Who to kill that guy. Does that make you crazy?
I'm exaggerating.
I would never I would never actually
do anything like that.
I would never like support.
But, you know, like.
Here's the thing, there's a good question, actually, maybe
you don't know.
Who knows? No, I'm asking you.
I hope not. But so you can't definitively say you aren't crazy.
You can't say that with confidence.
It's subjective, maybe. I don't know.
It's like, really, you do believe you're not crazy, right?
I do believe I'm not crazy, but I feel like people think it's good.
It's good to get a confirmation.
That's what you think. Right.
Anyway, so with Daenerys, OK, let's take another example.
Joffrey
executes Sansa's father and then forces her to be engaged to him.
For political reasons, right?
Because it's like, I need this to sustain my political dominance
over this country.
Well, really, Cersei tells him to do that.
Well, marry her, you'll get Winterfell if the Starkmen are killed.
Yes.
Daenerys executes his Dars father and forces him to be engaged to her.
That is a tyrannical thing to do, but she does it
because she sees it as for the greater good.
Yeah. But so you remember Daenerys kills the father
without understanding the context of who the father is while Joffrey kills Ned Stark,
who's possibly one of the most respected and altruistic characters in Westeros.
Joffrey, well, first of all, I'm not saying that Daenerys and Joffrey.
Absolutely not. Joffrey is far more sadistic, has no
more morals or like sense of justice or whatever.
But from Joffrey's perspective, Ned Stark is saying that he is illegitimate
and he does not know himself.
Oh, yeah. Joffrey's got a rationale.
Yeah, he's got a rationale.
Like, Ramsay's rationale is I like causing pain.
Joffrey, actually, those are clear.
So Daenerys,
the thing is, Daenerys might like causing pain more than we realize
is part of what I'm getting at.
So when this when Daenerys takes Maureen,
Bares can sell me tells her, hey, look, give them a trial, show them a better way.
Trial is important.
We need to establish a system of rules and justice.
And she's like, and he's like, you know, be merciful.
And Daenerys is like, no, I'm going to be just.
And so she just decides that, like, well, these are slavers
and I am going to crucify all of the slavers because they crucified
children eye for an eye.
So you could say that, yeah, she didn't know that Hizdah's father
was innocent, was innocent of the crucifixions.
Maybe Hizdah was lying.
Maybe things we never know because we never get to know.
Maybe she shows like instant remorse when she realizes that when he says it,
whether or not he's lying.
She does show up.
I mean, she just has to believe it's debatable.
There's a sense that maybe she questions her actions, but she
doesn't remember her face when one collateral damage
little person is killed.
Yeah, she locks up her dragons.
I do remember that.
I mean, I'm enjoying pain there, huh?
She enjoys pain sometimes.
She doesn't enjoy pain other times.
She sees the these people as her people because they have chosen her.
Right. That's for her.
Like these people are not her enemies, which by the time
she's in King of Landing, she sort of sees the common people as her enemies
because they are not rising up like the people of Marine did.
They have not accepted her.
It was the same in the north.
Like, remember in like the opening shots to season eight?
Like, well, may I ask how the people of King's Landing rose up against her?
Oh, no, I'm saying that they didn't.
Maybe I misspoke.
They didn't rise up for her.
No, you're absolutely right.
There is a piece of dialogue where she says the people of Marine
basically did it for her.
She didn't really have to do a lot.
And then Tyrion is like, they can't do it in King's Landing
because they will kill their families if they were to do something like that.
And the conversation doesn't really develop into a conclusion of a rationale.
It's you can desperately see D&D trying to shoehorn in these sorts of like, hey,
they're not being that great.
The people of King's Landing, you know, maybe maybe they deserve to be massacred.
I don't know. They're not doing great.
They're not doing great right now.
Here's the thing, though, is like we say, but this has been set up for a long time.
The nearest has threatened to burn cities multiple times in the story.
Threatening to and doing is.
Yeah. But that's the thing.
That's that's how like tyranny sort of works.
Like you get the threats and people on the side of the tyrant,
like they're never going to do that.
And then they start doing it like because most people
can draw clear distinctions between a threat to do something.
Oftentimes threats are empty.
They're just meant to, you know, further a goal in the actual execution of a threat
and the execution of that threat to a ridiculous point.
But who else is making those kinds of threats?
Cersei.
Cersei, good example.
Is Cersei the kind of person we want to say, Daenerys?
They're like, will lead to the rules, will do this in medical times.
Why would they not?
They're trying to rule.
But what is your point that the threats of.
I think those threats are meaningful and they say things about how her rationale works
and what she believes.
I would never defend Daenerys as a like, I wouldn't want to be friends with her.
Like she kind of annoys me.
I said this in my video.
I'm not a fan of her, but she is well written as far as I'm concerned up to season eight.
She's very consistent.
She will obliterate people.
She will feed them to a dragon.
She'll burn them to death.
She'll never do it to somebody she considers innocent.
All of the people in King's Landing have done nothing.
Didn't consider those people innocent anymore.
Which is ridiculous.
The rationale is not there.
Yeah, that sounds really ridiculous to me.
Stretch.
And there are literal children.
That's the one thing she says she will never hurt children.
And she never wants to see a child at her feet ever again.
So she, again, she threatens to burn cities.
Did you think that she doesn't have innocent?
But why is she threatening to do it?
Because it's like that's like you having to do things.
That's the point of a threat, which I actually double.
No, not just like not just outside of Carth where she's like, again,
you can make the it's like, again, it's like rationalizing like outside of Carth.
Do you not get what a threat is like the point of a threat?
Right.
Let me let me finish outside of Carth.
Yeah, you can say, oh, well, she's starving.
Her people are starving.
She's threatening to like try and get these people to let her in.
Right. Later, she's making the threats to Tyrion.
Like she's not saying them to anyone.
She's not saying them to the flavors that she's going to burn there.
She's like, I'm going to listen up here and I'm going to burn their cities
to the like Tyrion's not he's on her side.
Like, again, there's an escalation to this like.
It's if the idea of threats is that this is a bluff to get things to change.
Like she's not bluffing to Tyrion.
This is what Gary was saying about how like we can actually all see how we get
there in the end, but they've skipped so many chapters.
They've skipped over loads of developing points.
We've jumped way too fast.
You know, I the idea of a threat to avoid violence
isn't isn't foreshadowing for holy shit.
She actually did it.
Right. But what I'm saying is that when she says that Tyrion is not a threat
to avoid. So when we don't know which conversation
are you talking about specifically?
Well, I'm I'm talking about with Tyrion specifically.
I'm talking about season six, episode nine.
She shows shows back up to Marine and then he's like,
what are we going to do?
Whatever. And she's like, I'm.
I'm going to return the slavers
cities to the dirt, something along those lines. Yeah.
But like burn their the fleets and return their cities to the dirt.
So and then Tyrion's like, no, here's this thing about your dad.
Let's try a different way.
And then then also, like, if you want to keep going with it.
And this was the theory and this wasn't to avoid violence.
This was she was workshopping a plan with Tyrion
again with Tyrion in season seven.
And that's not a threat. That's a promise.
Well, I don't know.
I would call it a promise like she's saying she is going to do something.
Threats involved.
If you do something, I will do this.
That's a threat.
If you're threatening to do something threat, a threat is not a committal.
Sure. I'm OK with this.
In fact, threats are often virtuous things to do.
Sure. I don't know.
Threats are virtuous things to do.
Of course, if you don't do this, we will invade you.
You are using the threat to avoid the open conflict. Right.
If that's the intent, but with Tyrion, she's not doing it for that reason.
She's actually considering it.
And again, in season seven, she says like, well, what war was won
without deceit and mass murder?
Like she is she is buying into that system.
And that's the thing is that they are referencing a lot of pieces of dialogue
about potentials while we've been referencing like actual actions and reactions.
As I've referenced actual actions like, you know, when she forces the dude
to be engaged to her, when she feeds the guide was motivated entirely
for greater good, all the people.
What motivated and divided by the greater good.
But that's that's what I'm saying about rationale.
Like we say, oh, it's for the greater good, like for the greater.
We want an example of when she's done something maliciously slash insane.
What could you be more specific?
Has she ever murdered someone who is innocent?
Answer is no.
Innocent by whose metric is.
She has never done that, even in season eight.
She does not see those people as innocent.
She sees what she did for the greater good.
There's a conversation between Daenerys and Hizdah in season five right before
the Sons of the Harpy thing show up.
They show up to the Dragon Pit and she's talking about how
one day she might return his great city to the dirt as well.
And and she's like, by your command.
And she's like, yeah, and these people are because she's saying like the fighting
pit tradition is a point, which I agree with, but she's saying like this form
of like violence is wrong.
He's like, well, they're choosing to do this.
And again, Hizdah is a piece of shit, but he's saying, well, they're choosing to do
this. Why are there reasons wrong to correct?
And to do this to you, I'm going to cite you the episode necessary.
Have you been down there?
Have you seen children, little children burned?
I tried to make peace with Cersei.
She used their innocence as a weapon against me.
Yeah, he killed innocent people in that.
She murdered innocent people in that episode where she has never done it before.
Again, by who's metric who's hers again in her like rationale, like
she literally I guess that might be she does kind of say that.
Yeah, she does kind of say that one of the things that you're using is she has a
conversation with his dart.
Oh, born the the slave fighting is in marine.
So I'm supposed to.
That within a season of time that she just turns like this.
Sorry, so which conversation are you having?
Are you talking about when you were talking about her conversation with Hizdah?
It was around during the very God damn it.
Sorry. During the slave fights.
OK, so she's she doesn't like all all the fighting that they have, which has been
how they kept peace in marine for years and, you know, the gladiators and they
they enjoy it and she finds that warrant.
But she OK, and we how many seasons did we spend in marine?
Was it four, five?
Well, we spent, yeah, season four
or half a four, five.
Every young guy goes to marine.
So we're two and a half seasons.
Yeah. In marine.
Story up, which is basically her learning how to be queen
and learning on the job, making huge mistakes.
We're buying into this.
A lot of it was believable, believable.
I agree with Mahler.
She was like one of the most consistently written characters, even in the bad seasons.
But then she just makes this turn on a dime because they didn't set it up properly.
That's all I've ever been saying.
Again, the conclusion, I can see them getting to that conclusion.
It required two more seasons.
It required her being in Westeros much longer, dealing with more lords.
There wasn't any of that. It felt empty.
Season eight, she had and I know that
the writers will say it was supposed to be this way, but I didn't buy it.
I personally didn't buy it.
She felt like she, you know, we killed Varys too early.
And it just felt like a smaller show because they were rushing towards the end.
They they were just trying to play connect the dots towards the end.
And none of this stuff sold to a lot of people, including myself.
And we can go back and said, well, she smirked when this person died.
So, see, psycho, of course, she's going to burn, you know,
a million people in King's Landing.
No, it doesn't make sense at all when she could have just taken
a straight shot to the castle, killed Cersei and been queen.
And she could she had the Dothraki there.
They multiplied somehow.
And she she did it, you know, that's the whole thing.
It's not not a lot of people bought her just mass executing a bunch of people.
So on the on on this subject,
one thing you talk about like smirking and this is actually like a really
important, it's actually a really important part of the story,
is that when we see Daenerys, which is like, oh, everything
she's doing is for the greater good.
We're rationalizing that this is actually
what drives a person is logic is rationale.
Acknowledging is objective, factual reality.
When really like a person's like drive,
there's all sorts of other drives that actually drive a person.
So, for example, like when she when she feeds the guy to a dragon.
Going the rationale is that she's sending a message.
But it was it was very good in the beginning at doing that.
And it stopped being good later at doing that.
You know, I think it was still good at doing that.
Like, like at the end, the rationale is that she is you.
That Cersei is like she needs to free future generations from Cersei.
Right. That's the rationale.
But future generations.
Yeah. I mean, King of Landing is.
I'm sure it's already 90 percent of the future generations.
I mean, we see we see the peer later.
There is still people.
There is still people. You're right.
Until all of us.
That's the rationale.
But is that the reality?
Like, is that really like Daenerys really?
Is that really what's driving her?
Like, she seems to also have this.
There's this entire like personal, like emotional component
to what she's doing, as is with anyone.
Like for her, a lot of it is about taking back this thing
that's supposed to belong to her and her family.
A lot of it is revenge for the people close to her
that have been killed by Cersei and that have been killed in this war.
And a lot of it is just like.
Again, the enjoyment she gets from.
Burning people that from destroying her enemies.
Did she enjoy doing that at King's Landing?
I get the sense that on some level, there was catharsis.
There's a lot of assumption here.
Yeah. Well, we don't see we don't.
I'm trying to be like trying not to make too many jumps.
So I'm saying like.
What I presume, because we don't see her, she never says,
but what I assume is that there's like a catharsis there.
May I ask why that is your assumption?
Why do I assume that?
Because I think she gets catharsis from
killing her enemies in a lot of cases.
Everyone from Mirri Mazdour to the Tarlys.
And also.
Like when Barristan Salmy talks about the Mad King,
he talk about the feeling of like
like sort of the self-righteous feeling that he got from burning people alive.
So you would say that Daenerys considers the innocent people
by her own words, the innocent people of King's Landing
to be her enemy that deserved death.
Yes, in some respects,
I think something that a lot of people maybe don't fully like
accept about the story is that a lot of these characters are not morally
or ethically or logically consistent.
For example,
when you look at who Daenerys is working with when she invades Westeros,
Ellaria Sand is a child murderer.
Yeah, that's right.
So you recommend to stone the city?
And then Tyrion says, we don't murder little girls here.
That's in the board meeting with Daenerys at the head of it.
And she says that they're all they're all going to have to respect Tyrion.
Yes, what I'm trying to suggest here is she doesn't take the word of the child murderer.
But she allies with the child murderer, like reinforcements are reinforcements.
There is a pragmatic reality to the situation.
Sure. But like, again, like look at how she punishes the slavers
and what how she sort of are the former slavers, like after she she abolishes slavery.
Again, the rationale of like, oh, well, she fed that guy dragon.
He used to be a slaver like, well, Jorah used to sell slaves.
Yeah, what happened to him in the story then?
Well, he's obviously redeemed himself before she can essentially destroy him for that.
How is he redeemed himself for selling slaves?
Do I have to answer that question, really?
What is Jorah done for Dany?
No, I don't mean by the end.
I mean, like right when she meets him.
Oh, we don't know if she what she thinks of him at that point, that specific point.
But once he saved her life, which is what she's under the impression of in the with the wine merchant,
he's pretty much right.
I guess what I'm saying is that like, there's this premise that any slaver that Daenerys
or any former slaver is.
It's OK for Daenerys to execute them because they used to be a slave.
Potentially depends on the law of the land and the context of the situation.
Ned Stark wanted him executed for treason.
But he did.
Ned is Ned is one of the more ethically consistent character, not totally, but he's one of the
more.
But with Daenerys, like I thought we talked about rationale, though, like you were saying,
like, we shouldn't be feeling as though it's justified with Daenerys.
So even though the characters is essentially looked at as the paragon in the show would
have done the same thing.
No, I'm not saying that it's wrong to execute people for slavery if that's the law of the
land.
With Jorah, it's like that was the law.
Well, you do remember they're a part of a caravan or Kallisar, sorry, that is essentially
runs on slavery at that point.
She can't exactly say.
Daenerys herself used to own slaves.
Yeah, but she fought.
She fights against it in the smallest ways possible that she can in season one.
I don't agree that it's the smallest, the biggest way she can.
Yeah, we will ask the guy who has not seen it.
I'll just and you can object the second you think I'm representing the context incorrectly.
So Rags, you are a woman who is 100 percent against slavery, but you've been captured.
No, that's just real.
You you've been captured and given to this king to essentially be impregnated and provide
a son for while he essentially rapes and pillages throughout the land.
And you decide that when several women are captured to essentially be raped and enslaved,
that you'll take them.
That's not the whole context.
Remember, Daenerys starts the campaign.
She tells Drogo, we need to take the Iron Throne and Drogo says no.
And then there's an assassination attempt.
And then Drogo is like, I am going to murder everybody and I'm going to rape their women
and I'm going to tear down their houses.
And she's like, fuck.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
She does agree.
And then when it happens, the difference between threats and actual action, what does she do?
She turns back on it.
Absolutely.
Exactly.
That's very morally upstanding.
I it's more it's comparatively morally upstanding.
No, that no, that's a good thing to do.
It is a good thing to go back on a bad action.
It's a good thing.
Other than the story.
It really does look, I agree with all that.
But you guys are saying it's a good thing to go back in a bad action.
But there is a bad action.
You agree, right?
It's a good idea.
I wouldn't agree with the right to say it was good to go back on a bad action.
It wasn't an action in the first place.
It was only the thought threat.
No, I think if you like, if I started like a campaign and they're like, hey, we're going to
and murder a bunch of people and I'm like, cool, do it.
And then later I see it and I'm like, oh, no, stop.
I think anyone who was offended or not offended, anyone who was victimized by that campaign has the right to take
retribution against me because I started it.
I set it in motion.
She's the only person who tries to stop it.
She is.
And that's again, that's good.
It's better than not trying to stop it.
But you cannot say that she is not guilty of getting it started.
Season one is her most naive as well.
I agree.
I'm not like I like I mean, it seems like the story is that like in here, I feel like there is a sense and
grows from that.
Then that seems like good.
It is by I think there is a sense that people have is the characters going to have to be good or bad.
And there's no like, again, something that George Martin says that he doesn't write like clear cut heroes and
villains all the time.
He likes to write characters that do a great thing on a Monday and then a horrible thing on a Thursday.
And that's really how the story function is that, yes, Daenerys saves Miriam Asdore and the other women
when she sees how they're being treated.
But she also got it started.
And she is in some ways like she should consider that part of what she has done when judging other people.
It is very easy for people when they say something should be done to imagine in their head the way that it
will play out and then upon seeing the reality of what they've done immediately come to regret it.
And then as is a key component of redemption and apology to take action in order to make right things that you
had a hand in making wrong.
And for clarification, these people rape and pillage whether or not she said go to Westeros.
Yeah, but they really upped the ante when she said go to Westeros because that's a big campaign.
According to Jorah, that's not even the case.
They just move through town to town.
And if they don't provide them slaves and women and resources, then they'll destroy them.
Yes, but that specific campaign like Jorah says that this is like this is the cost of war.
This is what we're doing.
So this specific campaign, like the destruction of an entire like Lazarus like that and she's immediately against it.
Yeah, again, I'm not I'm not saying that what Daenerys does there isn't redemptive.
I'm saying that she should have that I'm saying that if you're going to have that sort of like acceptance for Daenerys because you
empathize with her and you give her the chance to be redeemed, you should apply that to other people, like people who
this isn't so much empathy, especially from my position.
It's just recognizing moral actions of characters.
I want to establish your character.
Yeah, because I've I don't I've like never watched the show pretty much.
I've read a bit of pieces.
So I'm just assessing this.
These are actions that are taken.
And I'm within the context that I understand evaluating whether they're moral and I'm well, morality and subjective.
But like I agree that, like, yeah, this is really not really an encounter to anything that I've said, though.
But what we're talking or what I'm talking about is if we all agree on the morality of it, it doesn't matter if it's subjective.
Oh, sure. Yeah, we can all agree on the morality.
But what I'm saying is that Daenerys also should look at the morality of it, look at where she has been and what she has done and how she has changed and allow other people to make those changes.
But she doesn't always do that.
So I guess the question here is, how does she go from the scenario that's been described to be from that to what happened at King's Landing?
Like what what happened to completely flip her around?
What do you mean?
What have like she's people change for reasons.
People don't randomly change.
There's always a reason.
A lot of people close to her died.
She got the sense that she was rejected by the Westerosi society as seen as not the rightful queen, not valid.
But don't the people hate Cersei?
There's hardly any work done in that regard.
Gary, what do you think about that in terms of showing the Kingsland, the people of King's Landing rejects Daenerys?
How much work did they do for that?
Not much. A few minutes, maybe if that we had Varys.
We a lot of that was done through Varys, who was backing her.
And then, you know, what was it, third or fourth episode?
Just like, oh, I don't like her anymore.
I like John.
They did a lot of work on that in the north.
Yeah, not really.
They get they have them give her a lot of stairs, but then they showed that they were actually being won over to a degree when she'd won the war for them.
And we're talking about King's Landing.
I mean, I don't even like John.
You know who he is.
No. Or stuff.
I didn't buy it either.
A couple of dirty looks.
And that justifies killing a million people in the city.
Do you at least agree that like there's so much work that needs to be done to establish these things instead of just a couple of looks?
In this particular case, not really.
No, there is a sense like in the north, first of all, I don't think it was just because that seems like it wasn't just a couple of looks.
It was the looks and then Sansa and then just then the looks given to there, just like a sense that.
Like Daenerys was unwelcome.
And then. And then like moving on from that, like the way Cersei basically turns people against Daenerys, we see some of that in season seven, some of that in season eight, like, yeah, people should really hate Cersei.
But if there's anything that could make people like just be distracted from their hatred of Cersei, it's saying that, oh, Dragon Lady
with a bunch of Dothraki and a bunch of slave soldiers that look really they're super foreign are going to come in and they're going to slaughter everyone.
Like saying Cersei, right, didn't she?
She did. I'm saying that that's going to turn people.
Those warnings and utterly ridiculous decision that sacrifices every last piece of dignity that character had.
Which character? And they're Daenerys.
They were trying to they were trying to sell that what in Winterfell, so people were rejecting her in Winterfell.
Well, Winterfell is completely different from King's Landing.
Winterfell people from Winterfell don't generally like people from the South at all.
And maybe Daenerys doesn't understand that.
But again, that is an assumption we go.
A lot of this is rationale, rationalizing an assumption.
It was not portrayed well within the story.
And we're talking, what, six episodes in season eight?
That's what we're discussing is these six episodes.
And Daenerys turn happened in the last episode and a half.
Generally, we can say, oh, she smirked here.
She smirked there. Nobody bought it.
Again, the closest thing to a general consensus I've seen is and Olivia Clark didn't buy it.
Yeah.
Um, does she know better than the writers?
Well, if we're taking actors than like Jamie Lannister, but we're not.
No, no, no. We're not saying she's an authority.
It's an interesting piece of information, isn't it?
Right. Well, I mean, Jamie Lannister buying his ending is also an interesting piece of information.
He's pretty sad.
As for people buying it, I don't buy that he bought it.
So as for people buying it, I would say that.
A lot of people actually did see Daenerys turn coming.
Yeah, me and Wolf actually said when we first started watching the season,
we hope this ends with Daenerys becoming the villain.
It would make a lot of sense.
Yeah, they executed it was horrifically bad.
I used to feel that way.
Then I sort of changed my mind.
I didn't want and then.
Sort of at the end, like I I didn't buy it.
And then I went back and I watched things over and I re-contextualized it.
I said I would buy it, Amelia.
Amelia, sorry, go back in time.
Fix that. And and said, Amelia, 100 percent.
We'll fix that in the final edit.
Right. We go. Olivia, Olivia Clark.
I mean, you have to know that they are contractually obligated not to talk.
Plus in your show about their own show, and they still did.
So, again, not that there are authorities, but I think that says a lot as well.
I don't know if I don't know if anyone's really talking smack, but that aside,
because, like, you know, actors, they are allowed to feel how they feel.
We don't necessarily always agree with them, whether they like it or they didn't.
When it comes to generous again.
Nerd Roddick, we've sort of I think we sort of talked about this a little bit earlier.
I disagree that whether people buy it is just based on like rational, objective
evidence. I think there is this sense that people want to say, oh, no, I was just being
rational. I like looked at all the facts and the facts don't add up to that.
It's like, no, most people watch shows with sort of the rooting for someone.
They want to believe a certain seems to be relevant to what we've been talking about.
What they're doing, talking about what certain fans out there think about certain
things isn't really what we're talking about.
Well, I mean, Nerd Roddick brought up whether people bought it.
And I think that this is relevant to that, whether people bought it, to me, is a lot
more based on what people want to believe than what is objectively being shown.
Like, do you think that's the case?
Do I think that's the case?
Yeah. And how many people if so, would you say like more or less than half?
90 percent or more.
90 percent. Absolutely.
Like you want you watch you watch Daenerys and like, again, like less than that, like
we've all we've all acknowledged that, like, Daenerys has done some like messed up
things, right? But a lot of people like you, I swear I can show you guys
subreddit that do not accept that Daenerys did anything wrong ever.
Like they are 100 percent.
Maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit.
They were like so behind everything Daenerys does.
They make every single possible rationalization for every morally gray thing she did.
To them, Daenerys isn't morally gray.
Yeah, I can find someone on Reddit who thinks Hitler did nothing wrong.
So right.
I'm saying that, like, like, is this are they right?
No, it's like they're do they're making those rationalizations.
I think that your attempt to show that they aren't right has been very lacking.
The way that we think is whether that is your opinion, of course.
But what I know is my opinion.
But it seems to be backed up by everything I've heard.
Like like which things this whole discussion that we've been having.
So Daenerys forcing a guy whose father she killed to marry her
is not tyrannical.
I never said that.
At well, that's a big leap from all.
OK, so, yeah, killing a billion people after that's totally fine.
Let me do the same thing to you consistent with the character.
John Snow is morally reprehensible.
He killed a child.
Is that a fair statement without context?
So John can write the dragon and John can be the one to burn kids.
The thing like context is rationale, right?
Like like, John, first of all, John killing a child probably wasn't a good thing.
But like, yes, of course, I would agree with you that context matters.
But but what you've been telling Rags is she's forcing someone to marry her.
And it's like, why was she doing that?
Tell him that, too.
Why was Joffrey? Why was Joffrey doing it?
No, tell me why Daenerys had someone marry her
because she was trying to establish stability. OK.
This is why Joffrey, why did Cersei for Sansa to marry Joffrey?
I don't know. Why did she do that?
To retain power.
So are these things comparable to Daenerys committing essentially a massive massacre?
I think that.
Yes or no, we'll suffice.
These things, these things alone, no.
OK, but when you add up the resume, add up the one then add up the resume,
I'd like to hear it. All right.
There's a difference between, by the way, trying to maintain peace
and trying to consolidate power. Yeah.
I agree with that.
All the times maintaining peace can.
Yeah, it can happen.
Daenerys didn't want to marry him.
She made that clear.
She did it for to try and get things rolling in terms of why.
Why did she open the fighting pits?
That's a horrible thing to do.
Well, I agree because it's going to try and help seal the wounds
that are between the two warring classes right now.
I agree with all of this.
But with Daenerys, there's always like sort of a dual motivation.
She wants to consolidate peace.
She cares about again.
All of a dance with dragons is about this.
Her conflict between the the mesa, the mother persona,
where she is the mother of all of these slave children
and the mother of dragons persona, where she is the conqueror, destroyer.
She's torn between these two impulses, like kind of a Shakespearean character.
And so there's always that element of maintaining peace,
but also consolidating power.
What before there was any slave freeing for anything?
What did Daenerys want?
The iron her was her conquering, not just a means to an end.
Was her conquering a means to an end? Yeah.
Which conquering all of it?
Oh, we can pick and choose, I guess.
I mean, did she ever conquer for the sake of conquering
or was it to serve as some other goal of hers?
That was the only way that she felt she could.
What is what would you say is her goal?
Oh, no, I'm asking.
It doesn't matter what the goal is in this context in this question.
It doesn't matter what her goal is.
Her goal can be anything.
It's about whether or not her conquering was just a means to carry out that goal.
It was the only way that she saw to make it happen.
I, you know, I think it's a bit of both.
I think there is a part of her that actually enjoys conquest.
I think it start it is in a lot of ways a means to an end,
but that end is conquest.
It's like, at the end, what is it?
So her conquest is her goal here.
She wants conquest for its own sake.
Her goal is to claim the iron throne.
So is she just wants to be on the iron throne
or she sees being on the iron throne as a way to do something?
Originally, it was the iron throne itself.
Then break the wheel came in, right?
And break the wheel.
What's interesting about it is it's like kind of a vague mantra
that has some some details.
We get some inclinations of what it's about,
but it really like reflects a lot of like, you know,
really like reflects a lot of like, like a lot of historical like ideas
that once we conquer this, the people will be liberated.
Things will be better once I am in power.
Like it's sort of vague.
It's the vague sense of like, I can make the world a better place.
Things will be better when I am in charge, but.
How much it's about actually making the world a better place
and how much it's about asserting herself as a conqueror is
really up to the viewer's interpretation.
Like we have to wonder what are the scenes that support it then?
Are there any scenes or anything that support the idea
that she just wants to rule for power's own sake?
What is what? What would that I think I need more elaborate?
I would answer nothing explicit and as part of my issue,
they missed that in season eight when John addressed the fact
that he's the rightful heir.
That was their opportunity to explore her character
and expose the fact that she wanted to rule regardless of her rightfulness
or how suitable she is to rule regardless.
But they don't.
Well, I guess the first thing I'd point out is what was she doing
for the first two seasons?
Like when when Viserys dies and she's like trying to convince
take the Iron Throne.
Yeah. Why does she why?
Why? Why does she want the Iron Throne?
Because her family were backstabbed and betrayed
and she wants to avenge them, take back their seat of power that they created.
Sure. But isn't that power for power's sake or is it vengeance?
Are you saying it's vengeance?
No, vengeance is a motivation.
Power is a means to obtain vengeance.
If you don't have any power, you can't exercise vengeance.
She considers it right to be on the throne.
She considered she considers it right.
Yeah, I mean, that's what I've been saying.
I guess she considers
initially what she was doing was for survival.
And none of us disagree with the fact she wants to be on the throne.
Right. Well, you're saying it was originally for survival, was it?
Before she tries to get Drogo to invade, but for there's an assassination attempt.
So it was season one.
Survival.
Yes, one. She the first time she talks to Drogo
about taking the Iron Throne is right after Viserys.
This is true of the show and the books.
It's about. You could say vengeance.
You could say an assertion of self, you could say.
Yeah, I think those are like two ways to look at it.
But this is before the survival.
Can well, I maybe this would this would be cleared up a little bit more for me.
If I could be if you were going to say that, you know, we're writing a documentary.
There's this guy named Adolf.
He goes from mild mannered painter to genocidal leader of Germany.
And it was you were going to tell this story, right?
And it's all about him and his childhood until the very last 10 minutes
where it's him becoming fewer and all that stuff.
You know, Holocaust things happen.
Then I would be I'd be curious to know, are there any scenes that have been
established previous to that that I can point back at and say, all right,
this is in this case, Daenerys clearly doing something
that is violent for its own sake, that is for power for its own sake,
where she is acting either irrational from her from her perspective
or anything that she does and, you know, its own context
that would lend to the idea of these the power
and the iron throne and the massacre at King's Landing.
These aren't the end goals or sorry, that these aren't means to an end,
that these are indeed the end goals of what she wants.
Are there any scenes that I could be directed to?
I'm sorry, I kind of got lost with Hitler and all that.
I think Daenerys is more powerful.
Polian than a Hitler, and he did
destroy the point.
That wasn't what was really the point on some of my plans.
Whenever you bring up Hitler, like, you know,
there's a lot of associations.
I'm sorry if you're incapable of seeing past that, but the question I can.
I'm I'm going to I'm going to say the next thing.
It's OK. You're asking, are there scenes that would indicate
that her goal is the iron throne and not
some kind of other means to an end?
Yeah, there's a lot of other scenes that point me to scenes that would make me
think that before, prior to this,
Daenerys is clearly trying to have power for its own sake.
She's not working towards a goal.
She is not working towards some other
well, that's not an idea that she thinks is.
All right, so there's so there's so there are none of those scenes.
I mean, there is there is the again, like I said,
there's the scene where she tries to get Khal Drogo to invade
before she's been attacked, before there's been anything.
What's that about?
You could say that that's about vengeance, and I would accept that as well.
You could say that's about power.
I would accept that.
I think those are both valid rationales for things that she wants at that time.
But if you're trying to say, like, is Daenerys not care about breaking the wheel?
No, like I said before, Daenerys is like a Shakespearean tragic hero.
She's torn between two desires, like the one on the one hand,
she wants to break the wheel.
On the other hand, she wants to be the one that breaks.
She wants it to be her.
She wants the iron throne.
Now, in the books, it's it's more between iron throne and the desire to have a home.
So the show does change it in that regard.
They make her a little bit more.
Politically minded than like personally.
And do you think it's interesting that your reference comes from what is that?
Like season one, episode three?
I mean, I can.
Would you like like like more references or something?
I was going to move on to a point to basically say that
would you not agree that a lot of him motivation to strictly take the throne
because take the throne because take the throne comes directly from the series?
Like she was inspired by the series?
Like it's heard.
That's what she was born to do.
And then as the seasons progress, she molds into exactly what her motivations are,
which is to free the innocent people of the world from horrible tyrants.
Even re-establishes that in season eight, which was so stupid of them to try.
I like I do agree.
I think like the molding, you're saying like, again, it's a thing where like
a lot of people expect like these linear character arcs.
And it's not really what what this does.
It's like just go ahead and reference the scenes and stuff
instead of talking about what other people expect and things.
Sure. Which scenes?
And anyone that I like that one you used in season one,
let's go with anything beyond like a season three.
Um, I would say the scene in Vaist Dothrak,
where she goes back or not, it's like outside of Vaist Dothrak.
Sorry, the Dothrak you see.
She makes this huge speech for Kal-Asar,
referencing Khal Drogo's
speech, a big, like rape pillage speech about how she wants to go to Westeros,
tear down her enemies and their stone houses.
I think that's a reference to it.
Well, I think I think everything in the entirety of season two.
I was asking for answers to taking the throne for the sake of like a power, not fear
threatening to destroy houses.
To me, that is about power, right?
Like like she's referencing, she's going back.
So her motivation in that scene is exactly the same as it's been for the past few
seasons at that point, which is she wants to free the innocent people of the world.
And she's got a tyrant in King's Landing right now called Cersei Lannister.
Well, Cersei Lannister is not the tyrant at that point.
Oh, well, whatever the Baratheons, whoever's in current.
Well, I mean, it's another it's another piece of evidence that Daenerys'
motivations aren't really about tyranny, is that like she
she has the same motivations regardless of who's on the throne, whether it's
Tommen, whether it's Cersei, whether it's Robert.
So, yeah, like there is that that speech is also the entirety of season two, right?
Like that's before she has any free the slaves
motivation at all.
It's just about conquest.
It's just about taking what she believes is hers.
When did you say that was established?
Sorry.
He's in three season.
When was the break the wheel stuff established?
When her interest in protecting innocent people?
Well, I don't think it was never existed.
I don't think she had any impulses to protect innocent people for season three.
Right. She she had no impulse to be talked about earlier before season three.
No, I'm saying that's not the case.
OK, OK. She did.
Like she saw Mary Masdore.
She had like and the women being raped.
She had empathy for that in season two.
You know, she does feel responsible for her her little
caravan of people.
But I think season three is where the liberation theology starts to develop.
I'd agree with you.
She starts seeing what's happening to people who are enslaved like the unsullied.
Absolutely.
She's disgusted with the rulers.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's absolutely true.
Look, Daenerys is not always a bad person.
She's good in some cases.
She's bad in others.
I think the world is better off for Daenerys.
I think that's the question you want to ask yourself at the end of the story.
You think the world is better off with Daenerys?
For Daenerys. Yeah.
Because all those people are free.
And we've taken post the whole show.
I'm talking about the world of Westeros, right?
Yeah, I do.
I mean, like, yeah, all those that's bad.
But like also she freed all of those, dude, slaves.
She freed millions of people of their lives to free the King's Landing.
Yeah, I read their souls.
That's interesting.
And that's that's the the slave cities are actually all bigger than King's Landing.
Actually, you know, I'm not.
I know. Holy shit, dude.
But this is OK.
Being freed and being killed.
Not not quite on the same level.
A living slave is.
Hundreds of thousands of people burned alive,
but it's OK because she freed hundreds of thousands more.
Right. Again, this is like the kind of like simple.
I'm not saying it's OK.
I'm saying that if you take just said that the world's better off with it.
Yes, better off than not.
I think, again, this is like we look at it pragmatically.
I'm saying like if let's say, you know, let's let's say full of string
and cards with these rationalizations for Daenerys.
I'm just imagining that in my head.
Again, I had to tell you, like if so, let's say that for every person
she burned alive at King's Landing, there was a person she freed from slavery.
Would that come out neutral?
Again, we don't know the numbers.
No, you don't have to know the numbers for this hypothetical.
So, oh, you're saying that it's equal.
No, I'm asking you if you think it's equal.
I haven't made a judgment.
I'm confused. Are you asking?
I know. I'll just say it again. It's quick.
I'll say it again. It's quick.
So let's say in King's Landing, she burns alive 10,000 people.
Let's say before that, she freed 10,000 slaves.
Is that does she come out neutral?
Oof. I don't I don't think I think that's like a weird.
Oh, please. Is that like no. Yes, I don't know.
Like, that's that's like a weird, like it's a strange scenario question.
But it's a strange scenario, one that you've already evaluated.
In my mind, she did not kill a million people in King's Landing.
That's not how I interpret those slaves.
Did she free? Probably a lot more than a million.
I think so. All right.
Yeah, I do.
Part of this might be the the books seeping in and my expectations for the books.
But no, I do think that she
like, I'm saying it's like a net positive.
I'm not saying that anything she did in King's Landing was right.
But also like, you know, like she was it.
We can we could just change it.
Let's say that she burns 10,000 people alive, but she saves 20,000 slaves.
She converts them from living slaves to living free people.
Is I don't think I don't think any human being
can do math with human lives in that way.
All right. Is it better when it's the person with people?
What is it better to save one innocent person's life or 10 innocent people's lives?
I would say 10.
Yeah, I thought you couldn't do math.
Again, that's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about like, like, come on, like, like, I'm not going to say, like,
oh, would you kill five innocent people to free 20 innocent people?
Like, that's like a weird, like when it's that specific math,
then it's weird and dehumanizing.
Well, because we're dealing with two ambiguous populations.
So for the sake of finding out whether or not Daenerys was ultimately better.
If we just say, all right, since we don't really know the actual numbers,
let's say the numbers are the they're both equal.
Then what happens?
Like, is the value of a person's life more valuable than a person's freedom?
I again, I don't I don't know.
Like, that's not something that I think any one human being
should decide for other people.
I'm not deciding for the people.
It's just I'm just asking for your right.
My opinion, I don't know.
OK, depends on the conditions of the flavor.
You know, just now when you said that the world was better off.
Because again, this is based on my interpretation
of the narrative and what I see.
I think there is a huge
long term net positive in
King's Landing or not in Slaver's Bay
across multiple cities.
And then there is an atrocity in King's Landing.
That's so it's like, again, morally gray character.
Good, bad thing here.
Good thing here.
Overall, I think probably she did more good than bad, but I don't know.
I think this is the kind of question like individual people are supposed
to wonder for themselves.
Was Daenerys like?
Was the world better off for Daenerys?
What was it not?
Well, I think.
I think I think I vote hard.
No, Gary, what do you know?
No, I think the only people are the only question people were asking
themselves after this were where did my eight years go?
How can I mention that?
All the carnage that took place after she freed the slaves,
not necessarily by her fault, but those people didn't stay freed in every case.
Or healthy people, which people the slavers cities
that were taken back while she was gone, that resulted well, didn't it?
Right. Well, but we presume that by the end, death
took place thanks to both the liberation and the retaking.
By the end, they've they've been liberated.
Like the Bay is renamed on this topic. I'm sorry.
So the point was about Daenerys.
Like she's sure not committing murder to anyone who's innocent
was the main point I was making.
He only ever does it to an insane degree.
It's way too off the map for her character.
And it's why I would attribute the majority of fans
in terms of character betrayals were upset.
I've referenced this before.
It's undeniable.
One hundred percent objective evidence that cannot be defeated.
My dentist didn't like it.
I mean, your dentist didn't like it.
My mom liked whatever.
Like, that's not a dentist outranks a mom.
Everyone knows that's objective truth.
God said. Oh, yeah.
It's practically a doctor.
How do you know my mom is also a dentist?
Because you said my mom, you didn't say my dentist mom.
Maybe she's not my dentist.
It's unethical.
You wouldn't trust your you wouldn't trust your own mother with your teeth.
You can't have you can't operate on your own children.
It's not like a thing.
No, it's like a law.
Like I'm asking you this ain't about the law.
This ain't about the laws about you.
My mom is a legally upstanding citizen.
So if Daenerys came in and killed all the dentists in your town,
I wouldn't trust most legally upstanding citizens with my teeth.
That I don't want to see your teeth then what you think I can find
a random person on the street and say, all right, give me a give me
a get rid of my cavities or replace my tooth and they'll do a good job.
All right.
But yeah, so like with Daenerys,
I think to me, it seems that people, whether people buy in her action
or not is directly proportional to who they thought she was before
and who they thought she was before, varied, varied a bit.
But there had sort of been in the last couple of years sort of like a
a mass appeal sort of like accepting that Daenerys is just a good guy.
There's just does good things and she isn't capable of tiering.
I've not spoken to anybody.
I don't know the conclusion.
Oh, no, no, no. Yeah.
I'm sure there are a lot of there somewhere.
I'm sure in any if you take any audience for any show,
you'll find some percentage of people who think anything about anything.
But I've in all the stuff that I've seen, I've never found people
who say that Daenerys is incapable of tyranny and she's incapable of bad stuff.
They exist.
Oh, I don't know that they're out there somewhere.
I just think that you would be surprised how because again,
one of the like probably central questions to this debate
is how much are people's opinions based on like
rational, rational objective proof and how much are they based on?
Feelings like how we feel about this character, how we want,
whether we want to believe in this from one of those feelings.
What? Well, from what do you think they develop those feelings?
Natural human psychology, you want to root for someone,
you want to believe in some.
I think why don't people, why don't people people today root for Hitler?
Because he was shitty all the time.
All right. Well, not all the time.
He's not all the time. He's nice to his dog.
The point is that there are things that he does his dog like he.
No, his dog was innocent.
Don't fuck his dog.
Hitler didn't free slaves like fuck.
No, here's the point I'm trying to make
is that there are reasons why we generally think of people the way that we do.
The actions in this show, the scenes that they're in,
the things that they do, the stuff that they say, the reaction to events.
So even if people have an emotional
opinion of this character, that's generally informed by something that they see.
Of course, like I said, there are reasons for pretty much everything.
They're not necessarily rational,
but there are reasons for everything that the point of the story,
the point of the story is to get people to like be to like sympathize
with and root for Daenerys is like tyrannical behaviors
until they're turned against the audience.
So this idea that like, oh, well, people rooted for her.
So. She that must mean they were right to root for.
Well, no, was was there any things always right?
No, was there anything that she had done before this
that was comparable to what she did at King's Landing?
In terms of scale or in terms of morality?
And both they go hand in hand.
No, I think I think it's well, yes and no.
I think that. Scale, she's no.
Right. Because she's never.
So do you think that if she had, let's say that the show had played out
in a different way and Daenerys had done this, let's say, in the last season,
do you think that people would still be rooting for her now?
She had done this a season ago.
If this is something that she committed, you need to be more specific.
I don't really understand that.
If Daenerys had committed the massacre at King's Landing last season,
do you think they would have turned against her or kept rooting for her?
I think they would have turned against her. Absolutely.
All right. So people's rooting for someone is very much reflected
or sorry, influenced by the things that the character does.
No, so people wouldn't dream of disagreeing with her.
Yeah. So the things.
So apparently, if people are rooting for her up to this point,
then surely there's reason for it because she's tearing down evil system.
All right.
What evil system was she tearing down with the mastery of King's Landing?
Slavery is an evil system and she was tearing it down.
Where is the slavery in King's Landing?
I'm not sure this is a legit question because I don't understand.
Well, people have debated this, right?
Like there are some people who believe that Daenerys is
Daenerys campaign in Westeros, actually like a liberation campaign
in which she sees the evil of feudalism and is trying to
undermine it or undo it.
That's not agreed upon by everyone, but that's a sentiment
I've seen from a lot of people.
Definitely in the books, like Tyrion likens the the state of
he sees like slavery is just like slightly worse than feudalism
or something like that, like not necessarily with the unsullied or whatever.
So let's say in King's Landing, so I guess there is a feudalist system there.
Yes, Game of Thrones does have feudalism.
All right.
So in King's Landing specifically, I suppose, how does excuse me,
how does the actions that how does the actions that she take against
the people here about system that she finds tyrannical or oppressive?
It cements her rule.
You couldn't have done that in any other way.
How does that fix it, though?
Well, she tried to do that a different way in marine.
Can I ask you an honest question right now?
If episode five played out that she flew over directly to the Red Keep
and we had a cheesy shot where she even looks through the balcony
right at Cersei in the eye and then sends fire into the room.
It like cycles through all the room, blows up all the top buildings,
and she flies up and spits fire down until the entirety of the Red Keep
is exploded, bits of rock and fire hit some innocent people.
They're screaming.
And then the next episode plays out exactly the same.
Would you have accepted that as believable?
Yes, as would I.
There you go. That I think I would have again, like two different
that establishes power pretty well.
Burning down different dragons.
Well, I mean.
Yes, but like different things can be believable.
I agree with that.
I think if I was a peasant in King's Landing, I was watching that.
I think I would be pretty convinced.
And I should remind you guys that like I didn't believe it the first time around.
I like rewatched it, reconsidered my perspective and then came to believe.
Like it's not so we've established there are other ways
that she could have done this that would be more in line
with previous things she's done.
I instead of total massacre.
Well, I don't know about.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't know about more or less in line.
But again, the place where I disagree there is
I don't think that she had never committed massacres before.
Then not committing a massacre here would be in line with previous actions.
Sure. But by that logic.
I'm sorry, you broke up. Could you repeat that?
Sorry, by that logic, no one would ever do anything new.
Right. No, no, no, no.
You can do new things that are not necessarily contradictory
to your own nature, essentially.
Well, first of all, again, like I said, a lot of these characters are hip.
But second of all, it is in her nature because we see every aspect
of this play out in some way is that has Daenerys done crazy?
The issue isn't necessarily as contradictory to all.
We have not established anything crazy.
We've not established that.
I've heard rationales for why she's done.
I think the funeral pyre was crazy.
No, we established that it wasn't crazy.
I did not establish that. No, she did not.
She determines the fire cannot kill her.
So she does it as a ritual. She doesn't determine she is OK.
So in the books, you know, there's the guy Arianne Brightflame, no books.
We don't have to talk about the books, but I'm just as like an example,
I might as well use something that's not even in a song of ice and fire.
But I'm using this because I know
I tend to think about a song of ice and fire.
So in the books, there's a guy Arianne.
He drinks wildfire because he thinks like it won't kill him.
That's actually the show.
Oh, yeah, they do mention it, but it right.
It's in the show. It's in the books, whatever.
He drinks wild, crazy, right?
Not necessarily. Does he believe that he has a rationale?
Yeah, if he believes he's immune to it, that's not a crazy thing to do.
I would say believing that you're immune to fire is crazy.
Not at all. No, there is this literally immune to fires,
but she doesn't know until she tries it.
And then once she confirms it, she carries on.
She confirmed that it happened.
She set up the entire funeral fire.
She was like, I am immune to fire, preparation for something.
And it's actually the same question we asked when you presented this
like an hour ago, if she was burned hideously by the fire,
do you think she would have continued to walk into the pyre?
She would have been physically unable to continue to walk in.
Congratulations.
She was not allowed to agree.
No, but I'm saying that is crazy.
Building a funeral pyre with the intent to walk into it is crazy.
No, it isn't if you believe that you're immune to the fire.
But she tells you you're crazy.
No, it isn't. But she is immune to fire.
How is it crazy if she literally confirms it to be true?
But she didn't know.
She but she doesn't have to know because she has dreams.
That is crazy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's more than just dreams.
She doesn't get burned by the hot water and she doesn't get burned
by scalding hot rock.
She believes you cannot burn the dragon.
That's again, that's just again, that's also you arguing
that every religious person is insane, then.
I believe any religious person that
does like, and I'm trying to come up with an insane example.
I think the road you're heading down here, you can't do this.
What road? I'm I'm fine with this.
Like, I think I don't know, like if you.
What's a crazy thing of never mind.
I don't want to I don't want to insult anyone's religion.
Uh, no, go for it, man.
I'm an amateur.
No, I, I really don't.
I don't know what like a like any.
I guess I'll just use this as an example.
Anyone who like decides like, you know what?
I think I'm immune to fire.
I'm going to like walk into fire and I'm going to be fine.
I think that's crazy.
All right. What is this person been immune to being burned previously?
Not from fire.
But from extremely hot things.
Yeah, sure. Interesting.
So is this a world where magic exists?
It is interesting.
But again, uh.
No, no target is established.
No Targaryens have been immune to fire in this world.
Right. And in the books, Daenerys isn't immune to fire.
She's never the mantra that you guys said that fire cannot burn a dragon.
A Targaryen is a dragon.
Fire cannot burn a dragon.
A Targaryen is a dragon.
Sure, but it's like a metaphor.
There are Targaryens that are burned alive, literally.
That is a part of which is crazy.
That's not crazy.
Taking that shit literally is crazy.
She hears something.
No, accepting it at its word, arguably crazy.
But there's more to it than that.
From what I hear, again, water doesn't burn her.
Hot rocks don't burn her again.
Like she has dragon blood or something.
She's a dragon.
There's no Targaryen that's ever I don't know.
Dragon blood is like a weird fantasy.
So there's no Targaryen that is in the history of this story
that has ever just walked into fire and not burned. Right.
And in the books, she none of that set up stuff even happens.
She's just crazy enough to walk in.
She has dreams and the dreams convince her that she won't burn
if she goes into the fire.
Like this is a character that is like established
as like being on the line, like online, like is that crazy?
Is that not crazy?
So to see her do something that's like also on the line.
Do you have any other examples of her being crazy?
And I'm not saying you don't.
But if you didn't, all you have is something that you're desperately
trying to interpret as crazy to justify her insane actions.
And I think that
feeding someone to your dragon is crazy.
You already established exactly why she did that, and it worked.
Just the act of the dragon.
But why does she do that?
Trying to threaten and squash out the actual leader of the Sons of the Harpy.
Is that the only reason?
Why do I have to?
So as Rags said earlier, what action can a crazy person not do?
I'm that it's contextual.
Depends on the context.
But yes, I'm like, what I'm trying to get across there is that
trying to intimidate the son of the Harpy is the rationale.
The real reason she does it is because she's angry at about
Bares and Sami's death and wants to lash out someone.
I want to ask you a question that's a bit more meta for a second.
We can go both, but love to. Yeah.
I think we talked a lot about Daenerys, but you said that
a fandom could be identified as toxic potentially when they like conclude
poor writing without like further inspection or introspection, sorry.
And they're assuming that the writers are at fault when it may very well be that they're not.
So by that logic, could we say that a fandom is being toxic
when they conclude strong writing without further introspection
that may be required and they assume the writers have succeeded where they didn't?
Only if that leads to you being
rude or negative or like
like abrasive towards other people.
So that actually does exist.
Like there are fandoms that negative.
Right. Like being negative, like calling people like you're an idiot.
You're like, fuck you.
Like, you know, that kind of stuff. Right.
Like chasing people out of like fan communities, like
like there's a difference between like a lively debate of the facts and like, fuck you.
You're an idiot. You don't get understand anything, blah, blah, blah.
But I agree, actually, that can happen because there are fandoms
that are so they stand so hard for their
what it's a video game, it's a movie or whatever, that they
are extremely negative to anyone that
they're extremely negative and rude and
abrasive to anyone that criticizes it.
So I agree that, yeah, that can happen.
OK, then. Yeah, yeah.
I again, I just think that's fandom and we're
broad generalizations aside,
when it comes to Daenerys
Game of Thrones Season 8, which what we're talking about here and why
I believe it wasn't a sick.
Well, it was a successful season as far as ratings.
But there's success can mean a lot of things.
A large portion of the fan base was not happy with this
because they didn't buy into that story.
And while you have gone back and found some things that convince you,
I'm not going to assume that other people and I've watched each episode
multiple times, I feel like I know maybe I'm just a big dummy.
Now, I always consider that.
No, you sound smart.
But I don't buy what Daenerys did because I think it's a huge leap to kill.
There's 500000 people in King's Landing.
I don't know how many people she killed, but
it didn't seem to make sense at all within the context of the story
because they didn't take the time needed, which they have done before.
To go back to my point earlier, they spent.
Two and a half seasons and marine, that made sense.
They needed at least that in her in her and King's Landing,
meeting other lords, trying to politic a little more, failing a little more.
And, you know, it does.
And then we have to have other characters being
destroyed, really played into her destruction as well.
Like Tyrion being written like a complete idiot in the last three seasons,
taking away some of his best work, in my opinion, in the books.
When he basically, you know, when he frees himself from being a slave
because he's just a pure survivor, he plays the game there.
They could have adapted some of that, put it in there.
And that would have helped Daenerys storyline instead of him
just being a moron throughout the whole thing and
just didn't sell with me.
And we can go back and establish that.
There's nothing that establishes her
children in the streets of a city mowing people down.
As Mohler said, she did switchbacks.
She was going back and doing switchbacks.
And this was all.
But as I think we've established here is she's always had
motivation. She's always had she's always felt she's had this divine right.
And she could have felt like she had the divine right to the iron throne.
And I could have bought it if they would have sold it a little better,
a lot better. And it needed a lot more time.
And I think we already have people admitting who within the show
and more will admit it over time that they rushed it.
And who admitted that?
And we had a director, Sapoknik, just recently said that it might have been
rushed or was it was Sapoknik or the or maybe it was the guy who a particular
outsider here, I'll pull up the article right now.
But and.
Game of Thrones director emits finale was a bit rushed.
What's the actual quote?
There is often like those headlines often like, you know, sensationalize
what they actually said.
The game, Neil Marshall, Neil Marshall,
while director of the key episodes of Blackwater, the watchers on the wall,
he admitted it would have been difficult to question showrunners,
Benioff and David Weiss, when it came down to the few installments.
It's very difficult to second guess those guys because they are geniuses
and they have done such an amazing job.
He told the Metro, UK,
inevitably, I would have taken a different approach to directing
on the greatest experience I've had, blah, blah, blah.
I would have definitely added my strategy and knowledge to that,
particularly about battles and scenes.
I agree with a lot of the criticism that it was really rushed.
This was Neil, Neil Marshall.
So that's a director from a previous.
He's not. He was not.
You know, I agree.
Like, I don't love a lot of the what happens in the long
night episode on totally disagree with Neil Marshall.
But yeah, he was absolutely rushed.
They needed to spend more than one episode on The Night King.
But he wasn't involved in the final season.
So no, he wasn't.
But he was a director for Game of Thrones.
OK, that so does that make season eight not rushed?
Again, do you think season eight, what do you think season eight was rushed or not?
No, I think they spent two years on season eight.
I would have preferred.
I don't care how much time they spent on it within the story.
Do you think this story? Oh, you mean like.
I don't I think I would have added an hour
to season eight and two hours in seven.
Yeah. Or not an episode.
I would have added one episode, season eight and two episodes
that season seven thought about the plot.
I don't think it needed.
But then again, if you talk like how far back I can do it.
Give me season five and six, I would change a lot.
But again, that's just me.
I'm just a guy on the Internet.
Like I'm not so am I.
I mean, yeah, I don't necessarily like what I think would be better might
like might not be feasible in a screenwriting sense.
That just I'm just saying that that's my opinion.
I would add everything to six.
I think a lot of stuff played into it.
I think, you know, HBO offered them more time and money.
Yeah, but HBO had their own reasons for that.
And they want to make money.
That's the sole purpose of doing this show.
Yeah. Like I'm personally not, you know,
I don't agree with some things people say about extending.
I do want to ask you guys
and assuming this is something you guys and I cannot, you know,
not everyone cares a whole lot about this kind of thing.
What do you believe that was like the message
or what did the ending mean?
What do you think or what do you think was trying to mean?
Like, what were they going for?
End of Game of Thrones.
Yeah, what was the theme?
And I mean, you could say it with a word, but I think like,
like what was the conclusion?
Like, what was the thesis of the ending?
With King Bran.
And if, yeah, with King Bran, with Daenerys's downfall,
with like all of it.
Well, and again, if this isn't a discussion,
I know some people don't have a discussion.
I think it's I think you can draw several different sort of
you can run with a lot of different things.
Right. But what is it to you?
Like, what do you draw most full?
Like, I haven't.
What do you think they were going for?
Nihilism. I got a total nihilism out of it.
Yeah. Well, it was also very anti-war.
George RR Martin's been pretty open about how anti-war he is.
And it was basically for me, for one,
the message was conveyed poorly, in my opinion.
That's what's making me stutter.
I'm like, it's so blurry,
whatever the message wanted to be in the first place.
Right. Yeah.
But you can you can or maybe you don't have one.
But like, what do you think this modernism, nihilism, war is bad.
And, you know, yeah, like with Daenerys,
I would assume they were gunning for like,
look how good people can lose their way with with Jon.
They're like, look how the righteous have to make decisions
that even they don't want to in order to maintain to their principles.
With Tyrion, they were like, look how a smart person can be stupid.
Like, there's a lot of stuff around there that you could probably draw.
I just don't think that a lot of it was executed very well.
It's your expectations being subverted.
That was it.
It lost its message, in my opinion,
probably much earlier, around five or six.
I do think it's interesting that people say nihilism,
because George R. R. Martin is so not a nihilist.
He's been like really open about that.
He's a romantic.
Right. I just I just think that it's interesting that Martin
might not think he's a nihilist,
but I don't think George R. Martin is a nihilist at all.
I think I think reading a song of ice and fire
and like everything I know, but it's like very romanticist.
It's in there, too.
Also, he's a bit of a maybe an absurdist,
but mostly I think he's a romantic.
I think that's something that's projected pretty well by the end.
Was a song of ice and fire.
You've read it, Mahler.
Was that a romantic tale?
And I see it as a tale of war.
Oh, I don't see how there are
there are individual stories of romance in their degree.
Are you talking about a more metaphorical like romance
with life or life with itself?
Or do you mean like narratively romanticism like T.H.
White?
I think it like it like upholds like romantic value.
Uh, I I still don't catch what you're really saying, for example,
like nature versus society.
It leans on the side of like the idea that society has made us sick
and it kind of glorifies nature.
Like the idea that like children have like inherent like wisdom.
It's a very
it kind of posits that a lot, especially with Bran.
Also, kind of blanking right now, but
definitely like most of all, like the way it's oh, yeah,
individual freedom, like authentic or authenticity is more
existentialist idea.
But like the idea of individual freedom versus like following tradition,
the idea that traditions and society and.
Is these things are what make people sick, not human nature?
And I'm not I'm not I don't think that's what sickens these things.
Uh, some of these things overlap, but I do think that when you add it all
a lot of romantic, he's very for, believe it or not, for like
emotionality instead of and like the soup daddy of the supernatural.
The ending conveys that actually pretty well.
How Westeros sort of turns to a supernatural.
Ideal.
How the maesters and the Iron Bank are these like really like rationalist,
civilized institutions that like actually fail.
What about that ending would be inspiring?
I mean, if we're talking about specifically, like if we're talking about, like, yeah,
inspiration, individualism, a lot of feely stuff, very sub, you know,
a heightened importance on subjectivity.
I mean, if that's what we're using for romanticism, then post-modernism.
Well, yeah, it's definitely post-modernism, it's very post-modernism.
It could, but the whole story, I'm sorry, like, I'm being really brass tacks,
I suppose, right now, but like I would go as far as saying it's the opposite
of inspiring the ending to that show in the end of the show.
I would go as far as saying it's the opposite of inspiring the ending to that show.
It is downright downtrodden.
Like Nihilist is what I would actually call it before inspiring, for sure.
The idea that the hundreds of thousands of people going through all these kinds
of wars and disputes in King's Landing ended up getting burnt to a crisp.
Jon Snow got sent back to where he started.
Sansa just wins Winterfell.
Oh, OK.
Arya's like this heroic adventurer when she was surely set to be, like, maybe
that part's inspiring, pretty arbitrarily, though.
Well, you know, inspiring isn't necessarily romanticism, but like, you know,
inspiring, it's like romanticism, obviously, if you hated the ending,
you're not going to be inspired by it, just it's impossible.
But no, I think the ending is inspiring.
I love it.
I think there are like things about the ending that I really love,
especially with regards to Bran and Tyrion.
And I guess so I guess I'm just
I was curious about that, because like for me, one thing that I think you should do
when you criticize something is like it's to understand it
and it's to understand what it was and what it was going.
And to me, I don't see a lot of people like it.
It didn't have a message.
D&D are stupid.
There is no message. They don't care about message.
There's no message there.
I hate it.
But I think that there is a message there to understand.
And I think that if you see what that is, you still might not like it.
But you should try to see what that is if you want to.
You know, you poured, I think a lot of people tried.
They just can't pull it from what's actually in there.
Would you say that whatever message you are seeing there, whatever it may be,
does it rump any of the execution because of the message alone?
For me personally?
Uh, sure.
Or for everyone, because I can't speak for everyone.
Well, I'd happily believe that a message, a lesson or theme
or an idea that's being drawn from the content.
That's you can get a lot that are completely subjective,
that are based on very minute details that might not even corroborate.
But well, I guess what I'm asking is for you personally,
this message you've drawn from it, it just it trumps any element of it.
It could it could trump any reference we possibly have, I imagine,
or an inconsistency.
The word Trump is odd here, not not because of the president,
someone pointed out in the chat, just because I don't read that if you'd like.
Like, so whatever you've you've seen as the theme,
it can't be broken by any element of the scripts being inconsistent
necessarily because it's such a powerful message.
It hasn't yet.
From my for me, from my.
We're asking can it.
Hypothetically, like can can media fail to support its own theme?
Yes, yes, I do think media can fail to support its own theme.
In this case, for me, I don't think it did.
I don't think that people have any idea
and not because I don't think people are smart enough to get it.
I think everyone is I think like most people are smart enough to get it.
I just think that people don't want to get it and aren't trying
because they for one reason or another, like there are things that let them down
and they don't want to like it.
I mean, I don't know that many people are going to be concerned about
potential message or theme when they feel their characters have been betrayed.
Like it's not even going to come into the back of the head of that point.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
Like for me, the characters weren't like.
But it also sounds like a condemnation from you that they're not doing it.
It's like, why should they do it?
I don't know if condemnation is the right word.
I think that if you want to have.
Like a scholarly academic, I know that sounds kind of pretentious,
but that kind of a debate about a story
or like something like substantial, it's good to understand it.
Like you wouldn't like talk about Animal Farm
without knowing that it was trying to be about like communism
and sort of like the rise, like Stalinism and all of that.
I think it's it's good to.
It might be a quality of if we're taking a story like Animal Farm,
it would be a quality of its writing that you could reach similar conclusions
about the message, even if it's completely removed from communism
in the USSR and stuff like that.
That seems to me like it would it would just it would just be a quality
of the book and the right.
I mean, I mean, like I don't I don't I agree.
I don't think that like Game of Thrones is directly allegorical to anyone.
Of course, there's some War of the Roses.
There's some bubonic plague there.
He Martin draws from a lot of different historical events.
But yeah, I do think that people should.
Try to figure out the message or try to come up with something like.
It's me that I found that like a lot of people.
That's why people like this show, I think they.
Because it was released weekly, it was a water cooler show,
you saw all the sites that were involved with the show get huge numbers.
YouTube channels, you know, Preston Jacobs gets huge numbers.
People wanted to know, they wanted to know the lore.
They were into it. They bought into it.
All I'm saying is the writers did not.
Well, they don't because the writers weren't consistent.
I the people behind the show creatively,
I don't care what their intention was, they might have tried their best.
And I don't think it's a very good tactic to come out and say,
well, people didn't try to understand it.
That sounds a lot like a the episode was too dark.
Well, you didn't adjust your television.
You know, it's like, well, wait a minute.
I bought in your show.
I read I read your lore.
I you know, how much work am I supposed to do to watch a TV show?
And I don't think it's a lot of when I when I do all the work,
then I'm told I don't understand it.
No, I understood it.
I understood it. It just didn't work.
You know, I don't think it is a lot of work.
I think that it's just work that people are.
You're having to go back and rationalize.
I mean, you even said it didn't work for yourself.
Then you went back and no, but the thing is.
It's hard to get a singular message because I don't think there was supposed
to be a grand singular message for Game of Thrones.
And if there was, they lost the plot.
I think there was to the ending.
So brands coronation.
Tyrion gives his whole speech about stories.
Right. And a lot of people saw them like that's dumb.
Stories don't like.
Like people don't care about stories, whatever. But
what it is with that scene is there's a scene in season three
in which Varys and it's one of the better seen this where chaos is a ladder comes from.
Tyrion and Varys are debating.
What is the realm?
What holds people together?
What is what is it all about?
And both Littlefinger and Varys sort of agree that the Iron Throne
is a story like it's an object, but it's also a story that carries
a certain weight that has certain implications and it defines the realm.
And it's a story.
And when you look at what that story is, like it's a story of conquest,
of domination, of might makes right.
And this is like a pretty important scene.
And they cast a ladder comes from it, blah, blah, blah.
So. In this way, like to me, like the Iron Throne is George R.
Martin's one ring, it's like the central object of power that defines the series.
Like it doesn't have any magical power, but it does
psychologically affects people like it's lure the idea that it represents
and more than anyone, it affects Daenerys.
And it affects the way she looks at power and the way she looks at choice
and the way she looks at making the world a better place.
And it's her goal. I mean, she says it.
So at the end, the Iron Throne is destroyed.
It's melted kind of like the one ring. It's in an accident.
It's like Martin's reverse you catastrophe.
And the realm is left without.
The realm is left without any anything holding it together.
And so there is this great council
and Tyrian decides to redefine the values of his society.
By interjecting a new story.
And he uses the story of Bran because
it's a story that preaches the exact opposite values.
It's a nonviolent story.
It's a story about vulnerability and resilience. And.
Yeah, I understand that.
I fully believe I don't know this for a fact that that whole speech
could have come from George R. Martin and because it's called a song of ice
and fire, a song is a story.
It just stuck out like a sore thumb because it didn't fit.
It wasn't executed well at all.
Tyrian, how is he even alive?
I mean, this again, this is something that's been grounded.
They explain things, but we're not going to explain why we're going to let
this prisoner just all of a sudden decide who's king and talk.
Well, Tyrian, I mean, the unsullied.
John is the big question.
The question is, why is John?
Or I mean, I guess.
With John, you could say he's alive because the Northman was going to say
there's more reason for John to be alive than Tyrian.
Either of them should be alive, though.
Well, Tyrian, like, what did he really do?
He threw Jamie Lannister.
It was the trait of the Daenerys.
Well, that's not really like freeing Jamie Lannister isn't really a capital
offense. We don't know who knows that he did that.
What do you mean? You don't know.
Well, who knows who knows that he freed that it was Tyrian that free.
Daenerys says that.
Daenerys says it, but Daenerys is dead.
Wait, you think she didn't tell anybody, despite the fact that she put him in jail?
Who knows if she told it's her hand to the king.
Maybe she was like, oh, come on.
Oh, she don't.
No, we really do.
And like Tyrian at the end, he's sort of just like a pariah.
But I don't necessarily like for me, the big question is like, well,
why do the unsullied leave John there?
Like, yeah, they're Northman there.
And maybe it's like a standoff situation.
And maybe they decided I could then I said I would add one episode.
That's the kind of stuff that I wanted
more elaboration on is the lead up to this council.
So someone said in chat or mention this in chat,
would you say that the room is good because it successfully conveys
the theme of the consequences of betrayal?
The what the room, the room?
Oh, the room. Yeah. No. All right. All right.
I just don't think I just don't think those are comfortable.
I think that's high mark.
So you don't think so.
It's successfully portraying a theme.
I think the room is good because it's hilarious like.
Like, I don't I don't.
I just don't think those are comparable for me, like.
It's successful portrays the theme.
The characters are all well executed
with maybe the exception of Aria
and Buckbron.
I think Bron is annoying and just I don't like Bron.
I like I like everything that happens with John.
I like that he.
I like that he gets sent back to the wall.
I think all of that is exactly right.
Story. I think it actually to me, it does make sense that they would choose
brand, everyone says that like, oh, it doesn't make brand.
Yes, it does. Brand is the opposite of Daenerys.
Like they are terrified by Daenerys.
They're terrified by this tyrannical, overly powerful foreign authoritarian.
Here is like Bran Stark.
He looks harmless as fuck and he represents all of the opposite values.
Of course, they're going to pick Bran.
Also, the deck is heavily stacked in Bran's favor.
Like half the people in that council know Bran and.
Either like or agree with Bran as a person.
Which like makes sense that would be George R.
Martin's ending.
You have this like anti-war narrative and he ends it with like a kid.
All makes sense if they would have.
I mean, because it doesn't make sense within the context of the show.
Oh, why why would you let a stark being?
I just want to go into all of the reasons why that council scene.
OK, so there is one thing in the entire show.
I do agree that Sansa becoming queen doesn't.
Nothing makes sense in the council.
I think the whole North secedes after Bran becomes king.
That's my real sticking point.
And I know why they did it.
I don't agree with it.
I don't think it works.
I think it fucks the scene up.
But I will agree with that.
The North leaving and then making a northern or the king does not make sense.
Yeah, like I said, I'm just I don't really want to go through every element of the
of the council scene because I'm a little bit worn of debating for this long.
That's that's that's.
Oh, yeah, it's been a while.
Yes.
I a more important question, I think, that trumps every question we've had here
tonight is why did you have Christmas music at the end of your video?
You know, I I wanted to try monetizing suit that would be like and I was like,
I don't know what what can I use?
I was like, fuck it, I'll use this.
You tried you added music to try and monetize.
No, I wanted to monetize and I didn't want to use any music that had copyright.
OK, I was like, what is there?
Fuck it. Here we go.
Well, enjoy the world.
Well, we enjoyed it.
I did not see that coming in August as well.
Yeah, well, I don't really celebrate Christmas, so fuck it.
I mean, it's whatever.
Fair enough.
Rags, Gary, is there anything else you'd like to say?
I guess one last thing.
Yeah, when we watched your video, there was a quote.
You said it is fan entitlement that causes literally 100 percent
of misunderstandings being blamed on the writers at no point
are most people accepting that they might have been wrong about anything.
Is that something that you you stand?
Are you down with that?
Is that something that you would still say you accept?
Literally 100 percent is probably too far.
I think there are some people who do accept some.
You mean literally figuratively?
I did. It's the thing that happens.
It's OK. How are you doing there, Rags loading?
I'm fine. I'm I'm tired.
That's all good. Well, obviously,
yes, and is there anything else you'd like to talk about or press?
You know, I could I could go on for another 10 hours.
I'm very, very practiced at talking about too much so.
But yeah, no, I you know, everyone at the end of the day
is going to feel how they feel and.
Maybe five years from now, you watch it.
You hate it even more.
Maybe I hate it. I hate it more.
Maybe five years from now, watch it.
Yeah, it's not so bad.
End of the day, it's.
Like, I appreciate you guys having me on to talk about it, so it's fun.
I think it is an underrated piece of fiction.
And I think there is a really vocal
group that is against it.
And I think there's a lot of people who like the ending
who are probably not as vocal and probably not as visible
that a lot of people don't realize.
Well, I mean, I appreciate you.
You coming on and it was it was it was brave and I respect the effort.
I've got nothing to lose.
Well, it's yeah, it's fine.
It's it's whatever. It's YouTube.
Well, I hope you haven't felt that we were too hard or anything.
I think that it was a it was a good discussion.
Now, if anything, you guys should have been much harder.
Come on, like this is compared.
I mean, compare that with Reddit free folk, like see what that is.
Well, we had a whole we have a whole what our intention was.
We started out there, but our our plans quickly turned into something more free
form, but we have this whole list here of questions regarding
not even necessarily things that are specific to Game of Thrones,
but about writing and thematics and execution and fans and
all sorts of stuff.
But it did go into a lot of specific stuff about the show.
But that's that is fine.
Things just go where they end up going. Yeah.
I mean, if you're ever like, if you ever feel like another like
exhaustive discussion.
Bring me back to talk about those things.
If you're like, fuck this guy, you're also free to not do that.
But, yeah, no, I had fun.
There's characters that Cersei is another one.
Real good character. We didn't get to talk about.
Oh, I mean, she looked out windows really well and drink wine.
It's OK. She executed that.
There's plenty more we could probably talk about.
I was just going to say, I'm trying to.
I mean, that's that's the point of Cersei story is to make us feel bad,
like make us think we want someone to be brought down in like a violent,
terrible way. And then when it happens, you feel bad.
No, that's that's good, though.
She was that's all a person, from what I understand.
She was a very terrible person.
But then I'm glad the sparrows make her walk naked
and it's super misogynistic and and creepy and and is it misogynistic?
Cruel. Yeah, the walk of shame is misogynist.
Would they do it? Would they do men not have to do the walk of shame?
No. Oh, they don't.
Mm hmm. That established in the show.
I don't know if it's established.
I don't think that's established.
In the well, then we'll say this.
Then we'll say this, then if only women do it.
Sure. Sure. If women only women are made to do it.
Sure. But if both men and women have to do it, not misogynist.
So depends on whether or not men have to do it.
In the show, there is another man who is guilty of something
and they punish him differently.
So he was a man who's guilty of like homeless having sex with another man.
So they like they brand him.
They brand him with a with a star.
Oh, shit. That's that's that's worse.
It's worse than you think.
That's that's fucking worse.
That's not misogynist.
That's the opposite.
Well, I don't know.
I would much rather walk through the street
naked gives people something to fucking ogle than it be branded.
Man, she got off easy.
That's the opposite of misogyny.
Well, it's you have to look at the context of it.
Like Cersei's punishment is very gendered.
It's not being branded.
Well, it's also that he is committing himself to become a sparrow
and all of the sparrows actually brand.
So he commits to become which is his avenue as punishment and reprieve.
He has to denounce everything he's about.
Uh, his lands, his titles and also being gay.
Yeah, that's way worse than just taking a walk naked.
Uh, yeah, but that's because that's how he chose to deal.
Again, it's just chose or was coerced.
A coerced, I'm sure.
Yeah, well, I mean, really, not really a choice.
And Cersei is also coerced.
And we also have to bear him.
Oh, no, actually, we have to bear in mind.
Cersei doesn't actually suffer her punishment because she blows everyone out.
So what Cersei's walk of punishment was actually.
Yeah, no, we've been wrong.
No, Cersei, the branding is
Loris's punishment after his trial.
Cersei never goes to her trial.
She.
Yeah, but Lancelot also never gets to be free.
Well, Lancelot. Sorry, Loris.
Oh, yeah, it's like conscripted.
The idea is that she can leave a sept.
Cersei, as long as she does the walk of shame first, he never gets to leave.
He's enslaved there until he's branded.
Yeah, but in the books, there's no there's no walk of shame for men.
The walk of shame, actually, in the books, I know this is the books, but
it's actually Kevin, Kevin Lannister, who
is the real mastermind behind it.
He kind of makes the deal with the sparrows because it's one.
He brokers a deal.
He brokers it. Yeah.
But no, Cersei's a society, too.
So yeah, very. Yeah, it's going to be very patriarchal
because that's the historical context of it.
Very true.
But yeah, I think Cersei's story is done really well.
Sorry, I'm extending this because I want to talk about.
No, it's fine.
And that's the thing that I think a lot of people I didn't.
I first I was like, oh, that was like a wet fart.
Like Cersei just gets crushed by rubble.
Then I went back and I'm like, yeah, the point of Cersei's story
is that every time she gets punished, every time she suffers,
we're supposed to feel bad about it.
It's like the Black Mirror episode white.
Do you do you did you feel bad every time she was punished?
Yes, Mahler walk of punishment.
I felt bad when Tywin is forcing her to is trying to force her
to marry Loris. I felt bad.
Even though she forced tried to force Sansa to marry Joppa.
So it wasn't even close for me because she not only did that sense of it,
she also lied through her teeth and forced all the different people
to address the Syrians, essentially execution.
Not exactly a morally outstanding character.
No, sorry, Chad is begging me to acknowledge that the heist,
the the previous high Septon does do a walk of shame.
They're begging me to acknowledge that.
So is that is that a guy that is a guy?
And they they whip his hands to make sure he cannot cover his manhood.
Good call, Chad.
How subtle is that?
But, yeah, no, I don't know.
I guess maybe you don't feel I do.
Well, I can definitely agree.
I would be surprised if there wasn't misogyny in the show.
In fact, I'm almost certain there is because of the setting.
There was that thing in particular.
Not convinced yet.
Well, if you make a man and a woman do the same thing.
It's not like the things that happen, the way people dress.
While she's walking is pretty misogynistic, like the whole charade of it
is pretty, pretty misogynistic.
How so?
If they call her a whore and a harlot and they.
Still not like.
Is she a prostitute?
No, she a horror harlot.
Is she sleep brown? Is she promiscuous?
He definitely sleeps around.
All right. Well, in the that's not so much an insult as it is a description.
I mean, it depends on what degree, I guess, because he sleeps with her cousin.
And obviously her brother.
Yeah. And I think I'd probably be in the crowd saying the same thing at that point.
Yikes. Would not do that.
Well, you know, yikes.
She sleeps with her own family members.
She seems to be rather promiscuous.
Well, they've had kings and queens that have slept with their own family members.
In the they're still OK, they're the same thing.
They there's the Targaryens used to do it all.
I'm not saying it's right because it's but.
Yeah, anyway, but the point is like for me, like, yeah,
even though Cersei is a horrible person, I sympathize with her
when bad things happen to her, because that's really the point.
It's the question retributivism.
Like in torture and like the public appetite for punishment,
like we shouldn't enjoy people suffering, even if they deserve it.
We should. Justice should be more restorative and less retributive.
And that's really the arc of the entire story.
We open on an act of retributive justice at the end.
Bran introduces a more restorative type of justice.
I'm curious how that would play out.
Doesn't. It does hope to see how it plays out.
No, the first scene, Ned is executing a guy for being a deserter.
And he's like in the first scene, we see the White Wolf.
That's the that's the prologue.
Talking the first scene of the action of the story after the.
It's a part of the story. It's huge for the story.
In fact, it informs that second scene doesn't exist without that first one.
Sure. For those white walkers, did they get off their front porch
and got killed by a blade of an assassin who came out of nowhere?
If we're going to argue semantics, you're like, yeah, the the first scene
after the prologue, then is what I mean. No scene comes up for it.
It's about Ned showing Bran retributive justice in the books.
Actually, he says, Bran, one day, this will be your responsibility.
And I'm like, he is going to be king or something.
And then at the end, Bran said she was going to be king, but she wasn't.
Who didn't Daenerys say that she was going to sit on the Iron Throne and be.
Oh, no, Ned isn't saying that Bran's going to be king.
He says that one day, Bran is going to be in somewhere
and he's going to have to be in charge of justice.
And I saw that and I'm like, foreshadowing.
Well, yeah, if you take a thousand lines
and you can find the ones that vaguely match up, that's great.
Pretty post. It's in.
It's like in the first couple of pages.
But you realize that if he hadn't, you'd be like, well, that's just a line.
Oh, well. Yeah.
And the first couple of Harry Potter, they say Harry Potter isn't leaving
for Hogwarts, but I was always very.
I mean, it's a book only line, be clear, be clear.
But I always thought that line was super important.
It's like the opening promise of the story.
George R. R. Martin himself said that, like originally,
he just started writing that chapter and the whole story expanded out from that.
So, yeah, like Bran Kings checks out for me.
And then at the end, Bran, he doesn't execute anyone.
He's like going to send people to do things
to make the like reconciles, like no motivation to kill anybody.
Because he I mean, he doesn't kill people because he
doesn't see that it's not necessary.
That's what I say.
Yeah, I mean, it's it's that's a good thing.
He so I think it's necessary necessary to kill some people, some people,
but not anyone that OK, the brand doesn't kill.
Yes, and be gone, says Major Justice.
Dude, this chat is wild.
Oh, they're fine. Don't worry about that.
No, I love it.
Brand failed his training.
Someone said Bran kills people using his wolf.
Yes, true.
Oh, season three, Bran kills wildlings.
Oh, yes, yes.
No, I'm talking about the ending.
And they ran throughout the while he's needed to die, though.
He also kills a guy using Hodor in the show.
Oh, no, which is very ethically fucked when Hodor realized what he's done.
Oh, I think we've got also let Daenerys kill.
Oh, right. That's the elephant in the room.
Let his brother get screwed over and sent back to the wall
because he saw this coming.
So that's actually wrong.
Bran does not have that kind of future.
What do you mean?
He's the king, though.
He don't.
Bran has on several occasions says that he doesn't know things
that are in the future.
What does he say to Tyrion?
Why do you think I'm here?
Why do you think I came?
I came all this way.
Yeah, but that's not.
But in on other cases, like he's asked, like, can fire kill the Night King?
He says, I don't know.
No one's ever tried.
And you could see the future.
He would be able to see that Daenerys uses fire in the field.
No, it's not inconsistent to see.
It's it's that we see how Bran sees visions and their bits and pieces.
They're not like a solid.
He doesn't know.
Well, he only saw the pieces he wasn't involved in killing people in.
John is saying that he knows all things past, present and future.
He can literally see everything.
No, he knows.
He knows a lot of things past, present and he knows some things future.
But he sees the future and I can make your argument
for you. He knows as much as he.
The plot requires him to like providing eye of the knife.
He knew to do that.
But you only ever knew that much.
Is that is that what you're going for?
Actually, yes.
Anything that he does in relation to calling the future.
That was as much as he knew.
He basically doesn't.
He calls very little about it.
He's like, I'm sorry.
I'm just saying we've just described an awful writing tool
like it's the laziest shit you can do is not really because Bran
doesn't brand future selective clairvoyance or specific reasons
why you remembered all of these individual things, but nothing else.
But come on, man, it's all just trying to that point.
No, it's.
If Bran were a different kind of character, if Bran were like,
again, you earlier called Bran like not really a character,
and that's actually kind of true by the end.
Bran is sort of like a symbol.
And so he's or like a plot device.
So they really I just thought something.
I know Bran is my favorite book here.
They do like kind of change up how to use.
Anyway, we've gone over.
But yeah, I don't know.
I like Bran at the beginning of the story.
He falls just major bummer.
And then these other kids in the books, these other kids are like, hey, you're
never he's never going to answer anything.
If I were like that, I would have killed myself.
And then I'm reading that.
And I'm like, that is the saddest thing I have ever heard.
I hope this kid becomes the king.
And he does.
You hope. All right.
So I met your expectation.
OK, you emotionally invested in that being the ending.
I was. All right.
It allowed me to.
It's one of the reasons why I'm not as like angry at the ending.
And I'm like, oh, I will.
The show has done the same justice as the books.
What was that?
The show has done brand the same justice as the books or provided.
Let me rephrase that.
Provided. I don't think the show is context.
Oh, justification. Yeah.
No, the show never provides anything as much justification as the books
because the books are books.
So I'm going to keep saying I can't be Lord of anything.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did because he can't see the future.
He doesn't know.
Come on, Brann was learning to use his powers right after that.
He says like he says,
I need to learn to see better brand is an omniscient.
He's like trying to figure out.
He sees this because he saw it.
Anything he doesn't see is because he couldn't see it yet.
And again, I love it.
Brand is great in the books.
Book brand like don't even get me started like.
Best character.
So sad.
I love both brand.
I just don't think the showrunners loved them enough to keep them in every season.
Show us more of the training, which I think they might.
I don't know what their justification was.
He was I know he was going to school or something and they just didn't feel like
they needed to see the training.
I would have loved to have seen it.
I would have some of his visions would have been great.
I I agree that the showrunners seem like they do not.
And it's tough because knowing what I know about brand's story,
I can see why it's a very.
It's a very different thing.
It's a lot of it's about his age, like a lot of it is contingent on his age.
And so it's very different to translate.
It's very it's a lot of it is really psychedelic and it's very strange.
Like, you know, D&D originally didn't want to like they want to do very much magic.
They don't want to do a whole lot of like flashbacks and visions.
So it's very difficult to translate him.
So I do see why they decide to make him more of a.
Plot element, more of a symbol like he's basically the Lord of Light,
but in human form.
Wrap it up.
Do you see why people might not buy that?
Because what was conveyed very well in the books was not in the show
and by not showing the probably the most important part of his character.
Joe and him just becoming a plot device and not a character.
It might piss some people off that he becomes king,
even though he was supposed to, according to George R.
Martin and all the intention in the world, if you don't execute it well.
Pointless at the end.
And that's what a lot of people felt like when they I see you, including myself.
Yeah, I feel I see why everyone feels everything.
Not not literally, but you know, I mean, I think people understood.
But if you weren't a book reader, there's not a lot to understand
about brand past he got downloaded.
Somebody downloaded a bunch of information and he essentially stopped being brand
and became another type of character that was just a robot throughout the whole thing.
And I know that's really simplistic, but that's basically what he was.
I think there is a plot device.
I think it's more about the memory of brand.
So the brand of the first two seasons is gone
or the first three seasons is gone.
And you sort of have to look at it as like.
At the end, that kid is who is not really there anymore
is being honored and sort of elevated by the
by a society that once said they would never or once
would never have honored or elevated or seen value in this like sad, crippled boy.
But. He's not there to enjoy it, but like.
The memory of him is sort of being honored.
It's like in mythology, there's a character brand, the blessed
who isn't it's like it's in like Welsh mythology or something like that.
And after a war with the Irish, he's they cut off his head
and he becomes like a talking figurehead.
It's like brand.
Brand the broken brand, the blessed, he becomes the figurehead.
Or like Rainbow Crow, it's an old like Native American
legend of like a crow that goes and ends the supernatural winter
by retreating fire and then comes back and it's singed.
It's not the same as it was that people honor the crow, whatever.
It's a. Super chill.
And if they would have conveyed any of that in the show,
I probably would have bought it, but they didn't.
And they lifted him up with a council of people
who were missing from the show for long periods of the time.
Sansa showed little to.
To no connection to him at all.
Her own thing, she wanted to be queen.
And yeah, it was.
I agree, I did not love that.
But, you know, if if I've done anything
that you could maybe that anyone listening can maybe use
and recontextualize any aspect of the show later,
then I've done my part.
And if I haven't, then, you know, I tried my best.
Like the great Benioff and Weiss.
I'm sorry.
I mean, that's one way to describe them, you know,
the powerful.
Yeah.
Is is everyone all right with me sort of?
Saying that's where the discussion ends.
Is that are we good?
I'm so all right with it.
Thanks for having me on, guys.
Well, sure.
Before you go, I know this sounds silly,
but tell the audience about what you do and where they can find you.
Just, you know, oh, fuck.
Yeah, do it.
I am as an IRL.
I have a YouTube channel called as an IRL.
I talk about Game of Thrones.
I haven't made a video in a while, but I have one more coming.
Maybe two, one about the ending.
And maybe I'll do something.
And after that, I think I'm probably going to move on to stories,
maybe things that not everyone is so angry about.
And also, I'm on the Wolf Punch podcast, which you can see every week
on Lipson.
And I know there's no link to that.
And I'll send you one lady later.
Yeah, yeah, I can put it in the archive one.
Just let me know.
Yeah, great.
And that is all that is who I am.
All right. There you go.
Links are in description if you want to check out more from his channel,
if you want to explore more of his content.
What I've got left for today is a video from the community
that well regards Nidrotik and myself and Wolf in an animated video.
And then after that, we're doing super chats.
So I assume you'll want to
go back to whatever you do with life before you jumped onto a podcast
all about Game of Thrones in four hours.
Oh, my God. So long. All right.
I am going to I'm going to jump off.
Thanks again for coming on, man.
I really do respect it.
A lot of people do not want to, you know,
debate in general, let alone against three at the same time.
Very courageous.
Bring me ten.
Bring me ten more.
I'm embarrassed and saw me of this.
Come on. No, I'm going to get killed by a bunch of Randy's in an alley.
Exactly.
All right. Yeah, it was nice to meet you, man.
You're out. Mm hmm.
Um, yeah, that was that.
How is everyone feeling? You're all right.
I feel I feel great.
I feel I have noticed chat has been erratic.
I have never seen chat that fast.
Fucking machine gunning machine gunning commentary out.
Everybody's got someone to say.
Yeah, can't I mean, he did come on, which is more than most do.
But I have I've been convinced of absolutely nothing.
In fact, quite the opposite.
But an attempt was made.
Yes. Yes.
But I was going to say, if you guys can join this link.
Adrotik, you remember you came on to talk about the expanse
that a certain member of our cast had something weird going on with his microphone.
Yes.
You know that we made jokes about him being the mouth of Sauron.
Yes. Have you?
Have you happened to say remember?
Have you happened to see any animations recently that may have been made
by someone in our community?
I have not.
Oh, well, hopefully you'll you'll find this rather amusing.
This is by plague creations.
And I know that I said I do memes all in one stream,
but the neurotic is here, so I wanted to see it.
But we will mean Rags pretty much already decided
we'll be doing a stream all about memes because they've backed up so many.
We're just going to have to.
There's so many at this point.
We're going to go through and watch it.
And we've actually got some bonus things that I want to do.
I'll tell Rags about it after the stream,
but we'll have a big old chunk of information.
Oh, yeah, you know, no one can know about it anyway.
You guys ready?
Oh, wait, when Rags.
It says that I should be in.
Yeah, I'm here with one other person.
Well, let me just do this.
Is the video playing for you both?
All right. Is it for you, Rags?
It's at zero, zero, zero.
All right. Well, just let me know if something's not working.
I will just reload and we'll see if that fixes it.
I think it might have.
I see two other people in here with me.
Excellent. I think that.
I think that yes, that has done it.
Great. All right. Here we go.
I'm going to have to boost that volume up.
How do they actually say what it is in universe?
It felt like I jumped in like a jump to see the time gap.
Isn't that like? Oh, I will.
You've taken it to.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't wait. Give me the quotes.
I put it in the chat. I put it in the chat.
Which was not for Sauron.
It's 64. You got to scroll down a little bit.
Gone for walkies. Walkies.
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.
Is there any in this right authority to treat with me?
The half lived in this host.
Who would afford one so small could endure so much pain?
He did.
I got to listen back to myself now.
That was brilliant.
Oh, bloody hell, that's great, actually.
The half lived in the stuff of great pain.
And who is this, Isildur's heir?
It takes more to be a king than a broken elvish blade.
He's right, you know.
Send forth all tangents.
Do not stop the Ephraim until the last super chat is taken.
I raise them all.
What awful man I will animate him.
Yay. That is brilliant.
Wolfagorn, Wolfadad's heir, Malthus Smiler,
Maldalf the Long,
Neridly the dwarf.
I need to have one of those boxes to go on tour.
You need like a kiosk.
People could just come say hi.
That is brilliant.
I like the row, honey.
The row here have Rags's face on their shields.
The wolf's crest is on the gondorians.
There's loads of little details in play creations videos.
I always want to try and find it.
Well, all of the figurines behind Nerdrotic.
Oh, yeah, I was trying to find a shot.
I think they're characters from all of the other animations.
I'm trying to find it.
There we go.
You got Rags,
Witch King, the goblin.
You have to pay money.
Yeah, one of the Jibben soldiers, I guess, the wolf.
Randy the goblin.
Randy the goblin.
We've got the Nazi soldiers from the the Tomb of Aralhavam.
Jibben, the Dick Snacks,
weekend warrior, Blessed Pipeman.
Altair, weekend warrior.
Yeah, he even he even has himself on his wall.
Oh, there's Hazeem down there.
Ma'am, you put those to use.
Yeah, ma'am. That is so cool.
The Orville button right on my microphone.
You get the detail and he's got no flame on there, too.
Oh, yeah, down there.
That's no flame. That's the cocaine powered supervillain.
So I actually really like as well.
The the movements on Al's little character, like lip syncing really well.
Wait, I put it in the chat.
I put it in the chat.
Which was Muffasaur on?
He just rolls out.
Also, do you like the rags all the way around the ball?
No rind milk.
Yeah, I don't know.
It's just really good stuff like creation was really well done.
We we love these.
And there's a shit ton of other great content.
It's like I said, we're going to shove them all into a big, big stream.
And with that, I suppose I'm going to read out some super chats.
And yeah, obviously, I can't remember how long you said you could stay, Gary,
but completely stay.
Oh, well, I definitely should stay for some super chats.
But keep reading.
I have to go jalogia.
I'll be right back.
And I know that means, but I agree.
It's a Orville reference for peeing.
It's to go bleed the little minnow.
Got a good day in the lock.
In the main vein.
There we go.
Be right back in the main vein.
Oh, that ain't it.
This is going to be awkward.
I imagine a lot of these have something to say about our guest.
Just just fucking do it.
Time for another Efap gaming.
Oh, wait, just a normal Efap.
Oh, that's the thing.
It's normal.
You guys, we there is some law from the recent Efap gaming.
You're going to want to see it if you haven't catch up on law
because there's some funny memes that you may not get.
We saw references in chat with all of your references in chat.
They were they were seen.
They did not pass us by unknown.
If an act is too good.
Honestly, it's it's just that we played a game of Party Pack Six
and it was it was a laugh riot, as they say.
Hopefully you guys would enjoy it.
Theo was there.
Dash bullshit was there.
There was like maybe two other guys, too.
There was like 10 was like eight, nine people, 10 people.
Yeah, we got 10 toward the.
We had a full game.
It's probably not even going to be possible for us to set that up easily
again with that many people that we like know in voice that easily.
That was so random.
We were just like, oh, you play this.
It was amusing.
Cover Pat Taksin's video on rags.
As we've said before, it is really, really shit.
So we are in no hurry to cover it because it is that bad.
It is it is awful.
They can wait.
We've got loads of Efaps planned like this one
was delayed by it by an Efap.
I've got another two joker Efaps.
I've already got planned for different addressing parts of the film.
So many different guests plant like Taksin can wait.
There will be a time.
I'm not going to say when maybe, maybe next year.
That's the best I can do.
I'm sorry. You have to wait.
Honestly, is there any point in responding to Taksin?
The video was out of trash.
Well, that's a good follow up, Super Chat, isn't it?
The thing about Taksin's video that I found really interesting is that
if you took everything in the video to be 100% true,
it doesn't even remotely convince you of the title.
So, like, I don't really think that it's going to do much of anything.
Like, he takes a shot at TRO's video on rags,
but that video did way more damage than Taksin's probably ever will.
And that one was dismantled as well.
So it's just going to be a matter of like.
Wait, we might get around to it at some point.
Not really heavily concerned, though.
Please save this for Shad.
Will you give homecoming leeway for being in the Disney fanatical
Marvel universe? You want me to.
He's not even a reference.
Oh, yeah, I guess.
I mean, for us, it's obvious, but I guess for other people,
I guess I can I can save that.
Then we can watch him be confused by the question.
I've got so many shad questions.
We need to do a shad podcast sooner, right?
No, no, no choice.
Um, one nerd, Rotic and Moira.
Ah, I hope you guys take a look at Legend of Galactic Heroes sometime.
I have no idea what that.
Oh, what is that?
Legend of Galactic Heroes.
Maybe it's like a video game.
That's not that weird, like when they did cartoon reimaginings
of the OT and stuff, right?
That wasn't that.
I don't know.
Or the one where, like, they they redo the scene
where they break layer out and she's like the only person who's competent.
Everyone's an idiot.
Do you remember that?
Oh, is that what that was or am I thinking?
No, it's good to think of that.
It's an anime, according to chat.
It's an anime. Yes.
It's an M&A.
So the answer would be no.
I will not.
So there you go.
I've been my requirement.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
Is the secret movie Toy Story 4 you and Rags both mentioned
watching it on a gaming stream?
What? Ridiculous.
Me and Rags watch plenty of movies.
It could be anything because we watch Toy Story 4 and said it was bad.
Does not mean we recorded it.
And it's prepped for movies.
That's a bit of a that's subjective.
Would you say that's foreshadowing?
I would say that is foreshadowing.
Not what you said.
What I said was completely different.
Black Canary can't be done in live action.
Smallville Birds of Prey TV.
Harley Quinn movie Arrow had three black canaries
and each one was worse than the last.
I wouldn't know because I don't know anything about Black Canary.
That's a true statement.
Fair enough. I don't think it is actually bad.
She's been on screen a lot.
And what they're saying is the more.
Times they bring her back, the farther away she gets from the actual character.
Yeah, yeah.
And I just picture the.
Birds of Prey is not going to be.
You are going to like it from from what from what I'm seeing so far.
But, you know, I've seen the trailer certainly wasn't good.
Apparently, like the wrong characters, like they haven't even got the right
characters for it, but also the it's clearly focused on Harley Quinn
when Birds of Prey is supposed to be about a lot of them, right?
That's what I've seen a lot of criticism.
Supposed to be Huntress and Black Canary.
And they trade people in and out,
but Harley Quinn was never really part of that in the beginning.
So, yeah, they just repurpose this.
It was supposed to be just a Harley movie and they wanted to give us just a posse.
Basically, that doesn't look anything like they do in the comics.
I I dare any.
Just casual comic book fan to try to figure out who's who.
Do do Remarkable Republican Joker.
Apparently, Remarkable Republicans don't Joker review.
Um, I don't know.
Maybe one day when we don't care.
Yeah, I mean, it's it's I don't.
I mean, we talk a lot of the times about low hanging fruit,
but he's like he's like a potato
rotting potato.
We have to dig to get that.
That's kind of that's kind of the bar that he's on, if that analogy.
Hey, Gary, did you know that Luke is a lesbian?
Oh, no, I totally, totally believable.
The revolution doesn't like it.
I'd like to also make you aware that Darth Vader, he's a ripoff of Robocop.
Really, of course he is.
It totally makes sense now.
I mean, I see that the only thing that I think obstructs that is
whether or not time is linear.
Once we get past that, I think that yes, he is a complete very true.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Anyway, hi, Rags.
And who said this? Hello.
Oh, the person who said that is a remarkable Republican. Yes.
Anyway, as the very expert of the channel,
what is your opinion on the Zootopia abortion comic I Will Survive?
Well, Nerdronik, what do you think?
It became the furry.
I fear furries.
They're one of the few things in this world I fear.
So what is the question?
The question is, what is your opinion on the Zootopia abortion comic I Will Survive?
I will survive.
I'm unfamiliar with it.
Let me Google it.
I will survive Zootopia.
I know there's some kind and I've only heard because the Internet told me
and it's true that there's some kind of.
Uh, whatever term you want to use around Zootopia,
some weird.
Yes, a weird.
If you will.
Oh, you're going to scare Gary.
Do you do you woo for Zootopia?
Right now, Chad's going to be doing it for the rest of the stream.
Thanks, right?
Chad, can I get an ooh woo for Zootopia?
Oh, you know, you don't want to.
Hello, Massives. Hello.
Very kind.
I will. I will read.
I will survive and get back to you on the next E-Fam.
All right.
Yeah.
M-m-m-m-walk and blushes.
Kaya, ooh, woo, baka, baka.
God damn it.
I was first page is a doozy.
Hello.
Hi, Mola. Hello.
I'm going to have to watch most of this tomorrow when I'm supposed to be working.
Thanks for making my days tolerable.
Uh, I hope this one is tolerable.
I don't know.
Good luck, my good friend.
Good luck. More power to you.
Mola, what programs do you use to get HD clips of movies and TV shows?
Internet.exe.
Yeah, I was going to say that the easy advice I always give people is
nine times out of ten, the clip you're looking for is going to be on YouTube.
So find a YouTube downloader.
And if it's typically MP4 will be what it downloads the format in
because that's what the format for YouTube views are, I think.
And then most, if not all video programs except MP4s.
That is your.
I use I use Y2Mate.com
because it does both audio and video in different qualities.
If you need a high quality one or low quality one, or if it doesn't matter.
But Mola is correct.
Pretty much every scene that you might need, probably on YouTube somewhere
might have a watermark, but price you pay for money.
Scan me, Mola.
I dare you see now that's a deep reference.
You guys got to go watch the gaming.
It's a very good reference.
Greetings to all my fellow comrades of the letter.
Oh, hello, fellow in in rad.
Hi, rags. Hello.
Please sing the following.
I shall post it for you.
It's I don't know what you're going to.
You don't want to.
How about you sing it to me and then I will sing it?
I don't know that that's I mean, that's breaking the rules.
The superintendent didn't ask for me to do it.
I should sing this.
That's why I didn't want to read it out.
I didn't want to spoil it.
I was young wa.
I saw a game of thrones.
That is not if that's not good.
Let me know. I can do a retake.
I don't have to use my first draft, but if you know, let me know.
I started Game of Thrones in 1997.
Twenty two years investment gone.
Well, you still have the books.
Let's don't you still listen.
If you enjoyed it along the way, then it was worth it.
Yeah, the ending might have been.
Not so great.
There are ways to describe it.
Friends that you made along the way.
That's the real of an adventure.
Yeah, we'll go with that.
That's.
Ordestia ad Astra.
I'll see you star side.
And that's just the movie that came out.
I don't know what the rest of them.
I saw at Astra.
Fire. Nerada, could you see at Astra?
It did see at Astra.
What did you think of at Astra?
Astra.
I do understand this conversation because I have not seen Astra.
I I did not like it very much because I liked parts and I didn't like parts.
I wouldn't it was I was I'm glad I saw it.
Special effects were really good.
Oh, I like those.
Yeah, very, very believable, grounded kind of setting that I liked a lot.
I like that scene where he was on the big antenna thing in the beginning.
Oh, yeah, that was really well done. Yeah.
But. Yeah, didn't it tried to be what?
Apocalypse now in space and.
Quite a bit.
Like Brad Pitt, I think he did a good job.
You guys excited for Ryan Johnson's Knives Out?
We're actually planning on doing an E-Fap movies
with critical drinker just for that movie.
I don't know.
Yeah. Work like I don't know what's going to happen.
But we'll give it a shot.
It's possible that we watch it and it's just OK.
And we don't have much commentary on it.
It's possible that it's terrible, but it is possible
that it's actually really good.
So who knows?
It goes far as saying it's possibly going to be the best thing
we ever seen in our entire lives, right, guys?
It'll be the best movie of this year.
It'll be stunning and brave and it will be stunning and brave.
The Bunning and Stave.
Bunning and Stave.
The only argument required for why season eight is bad, even dentist.
Yeah, even I'm surprised.
And actually try to argue against that.
Like, nobody argues against the dentist comment.
That's pretty much just game over.
Like, if we can't trust our dentist, then who can we trust?
Can we be honest?
When they're talking, you know, when they're working on your teeth
and you want to have this big debate about Game of Thrones
and you're just answering back, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
What did you think about that scene where the ball.
Hello, all my M words and rags.
Can't forget him. Oh, hello.
I feel also high rags, more and Gary.
Oh, hi.
Theo says hi from chat.
I'm sure of it.
Hey, did you like the bow master of King's Landing?
I hope you don't see that as toxic.
It was merely a meme for the meme gods.
Iman, no one could see you as toxic.
So your memes, they are beautiful.
They rise above any such toxicity.
Uh, five for rags because he got me into Mordhau.
Five for molar for inspiring me to start writing a review
of the garbage that is Borderlands three.
Oh, oh, hey, anyone here played that?
I have not. I have not.
I have not.
I've I haven't really had a game.
What I've heard about it actually is that like it's OK.
It's fine. It's just the all the other stuff about,
well, everything behind the scenes has made people despise it.
Like, let's let's I've heard that from a few people.
I've heard it has the weakest writing of the three.
So I've heard that from many people now.
So that is just a an observation that I'm making as to what I've been told.
Hmm.
Toxic isn't even Britney Spears best song.
It's You Drive Me Crazy.
Well, you know, that kind of
that kind of just ends the conversation right there, doesn't it?
Are you talking about toxic anymore if it's not even a best song?
Hmm. I bet you didn't think about that.
Toxic fandom involves not just obsessiveness,
but becoming a danger to others in some way to those they disagree with.
Here you go, Gary. I mean.
I mean, I would agree that a toxic fandom would be a fandom that openly
like you can always have toxic players in any movement, no matter what it is.
That's just people.
But for a fandom to be toxic,
then I would say that you would have to be something along the lines of there
would have to be a general sentiment for people to go out and do things
that are just wrong or immoral. Yeah.
I used to be wrong or immoral or moral, just to, you know, to be threatening.
Yeah. And they they love to pick those few things out.
I know I'm stating the obvious here. Sorry.
But and hang their hat on that every time.
And when it's just, hey, I didn't like the show.
Well, the one that gets cited all the time is the Kelly Marie Tran thing.
They're like, toxic fandom did this. It's like.
Did it. And then you have to wonder
with all the stuff that's come out since like so whether or not it's provable,
whether or not she even did that from her own point of view, but also
the reverse where you have Mark Hamill saying, hey, would have been great
to have had the three of us reunite, but OK.
And then the toxic, happy, positive fandom came for him.
They're like, fuck you, man.
Shut the fuck up. Just like the film.
It's just fan of just recently.
I try not to spend too much time on Twitter hour a day, something like that.
Rags, you're still off Twitter, right?
I am still off Twitter.
They kick you off or?
I got kicked off Twitter.
Yeah, I got banned for inciting hatred against minorities or something.
Promoting violence, I think is what they said.
I promoted violence against the minorities or protected groups.
So go figure that one out.
I always get such a violent vibe off you.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm not well, but yeah,
like people think I'm here on a well, I'm not.
Yeah, just recently I got my head
transposed on some Nazis because I don't like a TV show,
but that part's not toxic.
So well, that's how you find out who the real Nazis are.
It's what television shows they like.
That's how they were planning on taking over again through Stahl's analysis videos.
And we can't.
The whole theme of Watchmen, which I'm I'm probably going to eviscerate tonight,
but it could be good.
It could be. But it's the TV show for that starting tonight, isn't it?
And as you know, the comic series was based in the 80s
and the backdrop of it was nuclear war,
because that was the great threat of our time, you know, apocalypse annihilation.
What the showrunner of Watchmen thinks that is equal to that
now is police brutality and white supremacy.
Oh, yeah. All those white supremacists that we see in those
those places that I can't think of.
But they're out there.
The constant that they're about to end our entire civilization at any moment.
They're they'll get us.
Damn, I forgot the most important question.
Gary, you excited for episode three of Batwoman?
I'm I'm waiting with baited breath.
I am. It is high art in the highest degree.
Alice, what will happen with Kate Kane?
Is that her name?
Kate Kane is the protagonist and her father, Jacob.
Who is the he has a rent a cop.
Yes, who is in charge of the rent of cops, but also the cops.
But maybe not because we don't know because what is world building?
Fan stuff is the answer. Just fans.
It will be so good.
I is my favorite part.
Looking forward to a way more than I should, to be honest with me, too.
I'm so ready.
But we're all kind of excited because if it gives us something like we go on the
first two and we're almost that's a pattern right there.
That means we're getting there for like the whole show at that point.
You guys aren't super familiar with I mean, because you have taste,
you're not super familiar with CW shows.
It will go down this road and it just it gets worse as time goes on.
And once you start, it gets worse.
Oh, no, it's going to be so much fun.
You never hit the ball, do you?
With with media getting bad, it's always more.
It keeps going.
Wait, this finds new.
It finds new ways, like in the beginning of the second episode.
I know I've talked to you about this before, but those flames on the van
that look like they were just something you get with after effects for free.
Some little effect that you put on it.
It was. Yeah, so bad.
And drawn on like, you know, like in episode two,
we the cape when she was on the motorcycle with CGI as well.
Yes, it was.
Which as someone highlighted had to be because it's extremely dangerous
to ride on a motorcycle or a motorbike with a cape.
Not for Batwoman off of Batwoman.
That woman is indestructible.
Already killed one stuntman, so.
Oh, did the show, did they?
Yeah, they did. Yeah.
What they someone died for that?
Well, oh, no, that's that's actually the saddest thing I've ever heard.
This is literally sadder than Auschwitz.
Well, I mean, you know, sad, it's all relative, I suppose.
It's all subjective.
Someone died for a batwoman.
Oh, no, it's just died for about what it was like.
Yeah, that's an actual tragedy, though.
Yeah, that does suck.
God, you got to wonder what stunt it was.
I wonder what.
Yeah, what stunt was it?
Maybe they fell off one of the buildings or maybe.
I'm not mixing up shows.
I'm looking up now.
I was just I was read it on one of my live stream stuff.
And please tell me they died for like the Lord of the Rings or something.
Good.
There was a stutter actress who died for the Lost Resident Evil film.
Right. I think that happened.
Because there's like lawsuits still potentially.
No, I got to make stuff.
I'm sorry. It was Titans. My bad.
It was for I get the bad DC show.
Oh, thank God.
There you go. You've improved rags day early.
So that is that is better.
All right. Now it's back to the status thing.
Yeah, yes, it is.
Auschwitz remains number one. All right.
Fake news. I'm sorry.
I finally finished watching the backlog of EFAB and have reached a new level
of EFAB lightenment that rivals that of Biggidius.
All hail the dawn's toxic brew.
Wonderful rivaling Biggidius.
Oh, it's pretty tough, but I don't think it's impossible by the rules of our law.
Not that it can't be done.
So your subjectivity is right and ours isn't.
I'm sure that whenever he was referencing subjectivity, he was like,
we're both right. We're both wrong. It's wonderful.
The interpretations are valid.
I think matters just like at the end of Game of Thrones.
Yep. That really is depressing.
And I really do.
And as I've said, I have a limited scope of context for a lot of this stuff.
I've watched many scenes and clips and stuff,
but I never did watch it the whole way through.
I really am sorry about, you know, to all the people out there
about your show, because that must be awful.
And you can't experience it with Batwoman because it was already terrible.
So if they made it well written, that would be ruining it.
I would be disappointed if I would guys like I, I shouldn't.
I think this is a moral failing on my part that I admit.
And I'll try to work on it.
But I would be legit disappointed if Batwoman turned into a high quality show.
Yeah, you'd be like, no, I'd be like, no, this isn't what I signed up for.
It's supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be good.
I think that's I think that's I think that's a great part of your character
that you could admit that that's awesome.
I feel the same way.
I feel exactly the same way.
I crave the moments where they like shoot the van under the war.
I want more of that. Give me more.
I love it. It's so much fun to just be baffled
by any choice that they make in the show.
And like, if I could talk to the writer, I would just be like, why?
Now that we've established that I have a moral failing in some degree,
I'm going to go down a city full of men, women and children.
I don't even make sense. It's foreshadowing.
Would have thought the King's Landing should have been destroyed in season seven
with the throne empty and then the survivors head north in eight
and get slaughtered by the Night King survivor on the throne.
There's honestly so many different ways they could have gone about it.
We got what we got season eight wasn't even the worst part.
That would be the dawn plot or lack thereof.
I was so excited to see the Sand Snakes and what we got was just disgusting.
No fan can be blamed for hating them.
I mean, they were bad for sure, but you really think it was the worst thing we got.
I don't know, man, I still think that it.
But it's the worst betrayal of a character from the book.
Does the Sand Snakes be all about family?
The worst thing, no, I agree with you.
It's the Winterfell.
That's God that irritates me to this day.
Well, I would happily just say season eight.
But if I had to pick a specific scene, moment, whatever,
it would just be Daenerys burning children that for me was just like, yep.
That's Game of Thrones.
Listen, just because she admitted they were innocent doesn't mean that they were innocent
from her perspective.
Just because she said they were clearly innocent explicitly doesn't mean
they didn't deserve to not be burned alive in the street.
Running in terror world was better off with it.
OK, hippity, the logic right there, hippity, hoppity.
My buddies rags property.
Yeah, boy.
And they got a super fan over here, boys.
And the gold medal for mental gymnastics goes to I'm sure they're referring to us three.
And I apologize.
We did.
We did try, but I am limber.
Someone give this man a gold medal for his mental gymnastics defending season eight.
Those two separate people that did it at the same time.
All right.
Oh, man.
In a scene not accomplished two things at once, is Jamie not allowed to be concerned
for his reputation and his safety and the people?
I thought it was a stretch that he did it to save his own life.
I really don't think that the show has ever implied that that was his primary motivation
in that scene.
Now, didn't he lose his hand to save Brienne?
Brienne?
I mean, you can argue that he didn't knowingly sacrifice the hand.
The hand was taken from him after all of that was done.
But it was done as a direct result of him trying to push for extra benefits as a prisoner.
So I am happy to concede he didn't necessarily lose the hand for Brienne,
but he definitely put himself on the line trying to save her.
He didn't have to.
And that was why I like the scene so much.
You can clearly tell that he's like, I don't need to save her, but I want to.
I should save her.
And that's why it's like the start of all of the cracks in his personality falling apart.
Cracks falling apart.
That kind of makes sense.
I'm going to stick with it.
Howdy, y'all.
Hello, rags.
Hello.
Goodbye, Yenzen.
Bye.
Yeah, based on his logic, if I got it correctly, that Jamie didn't change.
Like he fundamentally didn't change.
He never cared about anybody.
So I should have asked him at the time.
Never any common people.
Yeah.
Would season one, Jamie, if he was presented with all the evidence that the
White Walkers exist, would he have gone up there and fought him season one, Jamie?
I mean, from my perspective, I would probably play with the fact that he would never believe it.
But then if it was like proven definitively.
And he believed fully that the world was doomed if he didn't go and fight.
I think he probably actually would be broken out of his character for that.
But that's kind of my point, is that he hasn't been in any tough situations that have to breach
this personality that was essentially laid on him.
And so once things start happening that test it, it starts falling apart.
It was such a wonderful story.
That happens.
Well, it just, you know, I think our friend, it's something I'm completely guilty of and
was in the show and I admitted it fusing the books with the show.
Like, I'll remember things as far as motivation on the books that were never presented in the show.
And that's why you ruined the end of season four.
Because when you presented it that way, I'm like, wait, wait a minute.
God damn it.
Yeah, I remember reading about it and they were like, we couldn't fit that element of
Tyrion's backstory in and we couldn't fit Stoneheart in.
And I was just like, okay, you should just say so.
Yes, that's just how that works.
All the time and all the money.
Or is that later?
The thing.
You seem like a fine person, I suppose, but damn, your arguments are rotted.
Go watch the show again.
Do some homework.
That's from Salad King.
I think he was very vocal.
He was nice, but those were not good arguments.
No, no, not very good.
I think we got truth at the end when he said, I liked Bran.
I'm like, okay.
All right.
Love you, Rags.
Hello.
And also, thank you.
Toss me off a roof and call me daddy.
Hey, execution was terrible.
Just because people don't unanimously agree doesn't mean it wasn't.
It was good executional, poor interpretation by audience.
It's not the first time, but he did do a lot of appealing to what a lot of people
liked it.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's not what we're talking about.
We had that with.
Major Lee.
Yeah.
Because Major Lee was like, you guys are aware that people like TLJ, right?
They were like, yeah.
Yeah.
Have any of you played Binding of Isaac?
Any thoughts?
I have.
I really liked it.
I've only played it very briefly.
Maybe one day I'll get more into it.
I heard they're doing another DLC soon, so I might get a bit of a read.
I really get into it.
Maybe I'll visit it.
The game I've been going through now has been because I because very sadly,
as you know, all my video footage was corrupted and I have to go get it back.
Essentially, I'm playing Gears 5 and it's actually pretty good.
So there'll be a review review on that for next week on exclusively games.
Is that right?
Mm hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A super chat from a few weeks back said Rags is Dennis Reynolds,
but I'm pretty sure he's D.
I don't know.
I don't understand what that is a reference to.
Neither do I.
Dennis Reynolds.
Dennis Reynolds.
I'm assuming I'm going to guess TV show.
But I have no idea.
Maybe.
I am not sure.
Seriously was a better Sarah Connor than Danny.
Agreed.
I only saw a couple of episodes of Sarah Connor Chronicles.
And I know just from that, because holy shit.
I like Emilia Clarke, but I don't know what they were doing with her and into a Genesis.
Don't you mean Olivia Clarke?
Of course.
Olivia Clarke.
It was strange that I said that, and I don't think anyone in the chat pointed it out.
Oh, I fucking you kidding me.
Those people did.
No, no, no, no.
I mean, in our in our conversation.
Yeah, not in the chat.
And that was weird.
And I was like, wait a second.
Yeah, I think I did.
Yeah, you're right.
And the chat was like, Oh, okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
We distracted.
Also, it's a it's an only sunny in Philadelphia reference.
Oh, I see.
This guy defends season eight.
God, Genesis three fourteen.
Well, what is just I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Genesis three.
Sometimes when you hear somebody mispronounce something.
If it's not that important and we get the gist of it.
This is for me anyway.
I just let it roll.
I don't I'm not trying.
I don't want to be especially when he's in the mid sentence.
I'll usually point out if it's like really confusing or funny.
Genesis three fifteen.
And I will put in the three fourteen.
Oh, honey, let me go.
Fourteen.
Okay, it is.
Let's see.
I got okay.
And the Lord God said to the serpent,
because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle
and above every beast of the field.
On your belly shall you go and dust shall you eat all the days of your life.
Wow.
The defending Game of Thrones, huh?
Oh, God, I don't know, man.
To be fair, the serpent, to be fair, not a good comparison,
because the serpent in the Bible story was the one telling the truth.
So done done done done.
Look what he got for it.
God's a dick.
Game of Thrones, a show I never really watched,
but leaned way learned way too much due to its crash landing of an ending.
I think you're not alone on that one.
A lot of people have learned about Game of Thrones,
thanks to how upset all of the fans are.
I am one of those people.
This are dragged me into that.
It gets creepy.
Watch this.
It's terrible.
This guy, most fans think they understand the characters, but they don't.
Also, this guy thinks he understands the character, but he doesn't.
Well, that was why I asked the question.
I was like, he's accusing people of being toxic, but, you know,
go against the writers and they're right.
So it's like, so by that logic, then someone could do the exact same thing in reverse and be toxic.
If the show affirms their interpretations until the penultimate episodes,
where does the heel turn where it does a heel turn and affirms the other?
Isn't that a writing problem?
Um, I guess that's addressing.
I mean, it, I suppose is that question about the execution
about people changing or characters developing in certain ways?
It is their interpretation until the penultimate episodes.
It wouldn't be a writing problem if it does a heel turn.
Problem is the, I guess in that scenario, it would be for that person
because you use the word interpretation and then we have to decide
how valid the interpretation is or how referential.
Very complicated question.
I would go as far as saying if the interpretation is completely grounded,
like every reference you have is just like how we were doing it with Daenerys basically.
It's like, yeah, there's definitely a problem here.
If the fans are wrong, then the writers were bad for not conveying
what they meant to the fans through the story.
If you have that significant apportion of fans upset,
then something's happened and you have to figure out what it was.
Yeah, whether or not, I mean, if we can get you on the boat
of saying something is amiss because so many people didn't like it
and they can pull many, many, many references as to why,
then if anything, even if we're being as charitable as we possibly can be,
people are clearly confused by what was presented.
And that's not great if you're trying to convey these concepts.
A large amount of people to a general populace.
Yes, totally agree.
I'm sure some movie out there exists that was way too smart for anybody
and we just didn't figure it out.
But this isn't the case here.
Well, in my opinion,
there's failed.
I don't think it's toxic to say writers failed or they did a bad job
or they were lazy with this script at all.
I mean, this is why they make gobs of money.
All we heard was how hard they worked on this.
And I'm with Rags.
I don't care.
I just don't care.
You worked hard on something that wasn't good.
Sorry.
And you got your paycheck, though.
When Mahler and I, we got together and we had a bunch of questions,
most of which went unasked, which is fine.
We're just preparation.
One of our questions was essentially is like,
would we give the same credits and the same excuse
for other difficult jobs that people don't do well?
Would you say that about the presidency?
Would you say that about engineers or even something as simple
as chefs who do cooking?
It's like, well, yeah, tasted shit.
But man, that was a hard dish that they tried to prepare.
Yeah.
And to flip it, it's toxic to say they did a bad job.
It's like, don't do that.
So saying they did a good job isn't toxic,
meaning toxic is defined by what?
Being critical?
And it's like, no, it's being critical while being an asshole about it
or being like abused of harassing and stuff.
And it's like, OK, so like I can I can get that.
But what isn't harassing and toxic at this point?
I feel like it's one of those things that's just so overused.
Everyone's a sexist and racist.
Like when I hear those words, the same thing.
I just don't really they don't have any weight to them.
Flashbacks of the not so great debate.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
And I mean, I think he did he did a better job because he seemed he was
certainly more knowledgeable.
But I think that his ability to under just rationalize was poor.
I don't think he was being disingenuous.
It would be interesting to see the fandom rank the debates from best to worst
without defining what best means, just seeing what they do.
Well, I mean, it if chat would like to.
I would be curious if chat thinks that this debate was better by whatever
metric you personally choose.
Was this debate better than the one with Major Lee?
I think it was to say that type one.
If this debate was better than the Major Lee debate,
then don't type anything.
If you think the reverse, yes.
No, that's not a very good way to do it.
Type one to if you think the reverse.
One for this debate, two for Major Lee.
One for this debate and two for Major Lee.
Or some guy.
There you go.
Ten.
A lot of ones.
A lot of ones.
And I'm not surprised.
I do think this I do think this debate was better.
He certainly seemed more knowledgeable about a lot of material.
He certainly wasn't trying to meme it up or be disingenuous.
He wasn't saying things just for the hell of him.
I definitely believe that he believed everything he said.
Yeah.
And I think that he thought everything he said was rational.
I don't think it was, but I could certainly I certainly
believe he came with total confidence and in good faith.
Yeah, I agree with that.
I don't think he was a dick.
Oh, no, he wasn't a dick.
No, I just I think he was wrong.
So this next one says this guy arguments are itty.
I'm math.
We're a challenge over far.
They I think I split that up badly.
I think I think that you read list.
Inadequately.
I think so, too.
You suck at reading list.
Speak.
It's called list.
Speak ranch.
Over faith.
There you go.
Oh, you said I'm going to squirt my ranch all over his face.
I got it.
It was like a coded message.
Squirt my ranch.
Oh, hey, and Rah has arrived.
Oh, my God.
I was just about to go to bed so I could wake up in five hours
and go to Joker again.
I marathoned a ton of Nolan films last night and realized how fucking
how fucked Interstellar and the Dark Knight Rises are.
Hey, Gary, what do you think of it?
I didn't like it very much.
And Dark Knight Rises.
I didn't like it very much.
So Interstellar was, I don't know, toxic.
No, I don't know.
I like Nolan for the most part.
But Dark Knight Rises, Batman quitting over a girlfriend dying
is the most ridiculous thing.
Then the super knee brace and all that.
Yeah, there's tons of stuff.
It's not Star Knight Rises.
It's called the Bat Brace.
The Bat Brace, yes.
The Bat Brace and Batman who on the wall next to his bat sides.
Oh, my God.
And his bat axe.
His three bat axes for his three hands.
Not only are they back cleavers, they're connected by a wire.
Do you see that shit?
As if they didn't see they were connected by a wire.
I'm almost sick of it.
Like, I cannot wait for them to implement those things.
Please tell me you use them and they're not just there for show.
Please use them.
I really want to see it.
I know. I like how Batman who is, Batman's very famous for not killing people.
Right?
Batman doesn't kill people, which explains the triple bat axes,
the two bat sides, the bat shotgun, the bat crossbow.
It's like, yeah, sure.
You could use non-lethal ammunition for it.
But still, I was like, man, it's really good at that aim with that crossbow.
Oh, yeah.
Just never kills anybody.
It's just bad kneecap people.
And ironically, it's like, oh, my God.
If you need help filling those things, go to Joel Schumacher.
He had the better ideas.
Remember the bat suit?
Remember the bat belt?
How come there's no nipples on Batwoman's suit?
Yeah, I know.
Remember the bat belt buckle that was like a heater that could melt ice?
Do you remember that?
Yes, I do.
We need to watch that.
That shit's great.
I love that movie.
I actually love that movie, though.
It's great.
Oh, I've told you before.
I love it so much.
Do you have a subjective, like, almost 10 out of 10 that you think is objectively
like, poor?
I'm like, Batman, Robin, Batman.
I'm so hilariously bad.
I love it.
What killed the dinosaurs?
The ice age.
The bat card.
The ice age.
Um, at the end of Game of Thrones, the dialogue was not well executed.
Pacing was poor.
There was no buildup to the event, so it seemed empty and out of nowhere.
Agreed.
It was empty because there was, like, no dialogue in the last episode.
Oh, God.
They do a lot of walking.
Walking around.
Mahler has an excellent supercut of that.
Yeah.
It's interesting how they could show all of that walking in the previous episode,
but they couldn't explain how Aya gets behind the Night King.
Because, like, that bit of traversal might have been cool to know instead.
They've really got their priorities straight, haven't they?
It is very interesting.
But Garrosopoknik said that wasn't important.
We didn't need to know.
I remember that.
Yeah.
You know about that, Rags?
No, I don't.
Yeah.
Director of the episode said it wasn't important.
He was not going to think about it.
Oh.
Well, he was fucking wrong.
That was a bad call.
How racist of you to say such a thing.
How horrible.
How toxic.
Oh, why?
Is he white?
I don't even know, but I just assume everything you say.
You have a lot of hidden bigotry, I've noticed.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Between each other.
You remember where I...
Well, a moment ago when we had our debate,
the fact that a man and a woman have to do the same thing,
I wasn't ready to call that misogyny.
Because you're a sexist.
I guess that's because I'm a sexist, you see.
It came out a little bit.
I got to watch it.
I appreciate chat today as well.
They've helped out with a couple of fun facts.
Yeah.
They're great.
Led astray.
Excellent job today, chat, despite being a little angry at our guest.
I don't necessarily blame you.
Paula, are you guys going to be watching
the new Wokemen series alongside Batwoman?
Oh, so Watchmen, I guess, for Wokemen.
Oh, Watchmen.
Is it Woke?
I guess the assumption is that it will be.
I haven't seen the trailers.
Yeah, that's the assumption.
That's the assumption I have.
Based on one of those trailers.
One of those trailers.
Trailers and more what Damon Lindelof, the guy who co ran lost, is in charge of this.
I don't know how you feel about lost or not, but yeah, he's the one who made the statement
about the white supremacy and police brutality being the troubles of our time.
Equal to the threat of nuclear war.
Isn't he?
No, I'm going to say for the record,
I think the biggest problem of our age is that we accidentally create a
super virus that's immune to antibiotics and it ends up killing a shit ton of people.
I think that's the problem of our age.
That or Batwoman, one of those two.
That or police brutality.
Or Batwoman.
Or Batwoman, you know, it's actually Batwoman is kind of like a super virus, right?
Yeah, Damon Lindelof.
He's in this company of writers where you just have no idea how this happened.
It's like, how did you write all this horrible stuff and keep getting work?
And it's like, well, it makes money.
It's like, you know, whenever good things that make money.
Yeah, it does make money.
That's correct.
There we go.
That school of writers where they don't feel like they need to explain things.
Oh, yeah.
All those emotional moments.
Go get them emotional moments.
Like Spock.
Yeah, they're on back to back tonight.
And someone's saying antibiotics.
So now I've always heard it called antibiotics.
I know that when I made characters in Mass Effect, I was all right.
I was I was ready to be an anti.
But if somebody wants me to, I don't know if that's right or not.
Maybe Jack can help me out.
Is it antibiotics or antibiotics?
Antibiotics don't work.
I always called it antibiotics, but antiviral.
I said antibiotic.
All viruses are immune.
You know what I fucking mean, nerd.
You know what I fucking mean?
Uh, yeah, no, I don't we don't really intend to watch the Watchmen series,
but I'll watch Gary coverage every day.
I'll see what it's all about from your your lens.
Gary, you will corrupt me into thinking it's something that it's not.
Proud of yourself.
I will.
I'm very proud of myself.
I feel honored.
Can't wait to corrupt baller.
I am.
I'm not.
No, no chat.
I'm not triggered.
I'm just being silly.
I'm glad that I learned something.
I had no idea that viruses are immune to antibiotics.
The odd.
I was using that as a catch all term for cures and things.
So from raw, he wasn't going to row to Pentos.
He was going to get an Uber.
I love the idea that he questioned that.
He was like, of course he wasn't going to row to Pentos.
Like, what else was he going to do?
He only had the dinky rowboat.
What was what was Jamie going to do?
You said dinky.
It was it was dinky.
You go look at just okay.
No, what when you were this may this might sound like a strange question,
but when you were a young man, when you're a little little little man,
what what did like when it like your parents or whatever,
what what was your word for the penis when you were really,
really small and you had to come up with a kid's name.
It was winky for me, too.
That's the kid.
I just I was just I was just curious.
It's it's something that it's it's a cultural consistency
that we have between between the pond on either side.
Excellent to go.
So there you go.
I had the dumbest name for it.
That was because I got it for my mom, though.
So I mean, I don't want to blame my mom, but I mean,
I tend to peer.
I called mine a peer forever here when I was a little kid.
I was like four.
Well, you do urinate because of peer pressure.
Yeah.
And no, there can be the objects on a peer that can be large and tall.
And so, yeah, I kind of see something there.
That's all right.
That's all right.
It's nice.
I will say that I don't normally hear peers described as tall.
Well, you haven't been like maybe it's really high up.
Like it's why your belly button is.
Yeah, I think right.
Wouldn't you agree?
It's not necessarily about the girth, if you will.
The width of the aroma.
Yes.
I know what.
Please, everyone wash your penis.
Okay.
Wash your wings, please.
Yes.
Where you get ladies.
Ladies, wash your front butt, guys.
Wash your winkies.
Rags on the case, even though I don't know that.
For you to think about antibiotics also.
Okay.
Ronald just showed up.
But in the super show, he says, okay, never mind.
Don't care about sleeping anymore.
I'm angry.
No.
This discussion is making my migraine worse.
Sad face.
Oh, no.
If you have to explain your show to your viewers after the episode,
you have failed to story tell us.
I think it's pretty funny that the only episode they don't explain
is the one that requires the most explaining episode six.
Like, I'm sorry.
I have questions about everything that happens.
It's like, well, we're out.
Rags also thinks Mortau's good.
I do think it's fucking good.
Fight me.
On Mortau?
Yeah.
I play that shit all the fucking time.
I love Mortau.
I will defend Mortau.
My interpretation was right.
Yours was invalid.
The thing about interpretation discussions,
I want to try and veer away from them
because naturally they imply a sense of like,
you're drawing things out of it that are for you
and you alone or something.
Quiet.
Even I was I was asking, could could you talk?
Could you talk to me about like a scene or anything?
Can you point to something that I could go?
Like, that's that's what I say because I don't know for certain.
I have a limited understanding of these characters and their context.
So could you point someone like me to a scene or something
that would support your position?
Don't think I got an answer.
But the question was raised.
So what it was.
It's all good in the hood.
Just so I don't Amalur.
But to support his argument, what scene would you pick out?
It's if there's anything close.
Or Daenerys going insane.
Or Daenerys going insane.
Maybe the tarlies may I mean,
I see that's completely justified.
Huge lip.
Yeah, I did too.
I saw all of her actions.
I could see where he saw there's personal motivation in there too.
It's called layers.
You know, it's called complexity.
But even personal motivation in craziness, they're not the same.
You could be totally like ideas about craziness.
Yeah.
Like, do you do you define craziness as just being or doing something that's irrational?
And if so, what if you can rationalize something to yourself?
The whole fire thing.
Like, if you believe it's true and you believe that you could justify what you think
and then you go through with it after you confirm it, it's not crazy.
That's the interesting part, isn't it?
Because if it was to do everything that she did up to that point and then burn to death,
we'd be like, well, I guess they were crazy.
Yeah, if the fire was super hot and started to burn her and she kept on going,
I would I would have probably been on his side to a much bigger degree.
Yeah.
And, you know, he's like certain of it.
And I'm assuming it's because of the fact that of those previous bands,
because even in that scene, Jorah's like, I'm going to sit here and watch you burn.
And she's like, you don't understand.
I'm not going to burn.
Look at the fuck that she's from her perspective.
It makes as much sense as stabbing somebody and they bleed.
It's just that's true.
He wasn't convinced that she was convinced that she wasn't going to burn,
but he was convinced she would go crazy at the end.
We were sort of bobbing between her being crazy and her wanting to kill them because of fear.
I go over this in my video.
I was like, a lot of people aren't typically sticking to one narrative, if you know what I mean.
And I know you can be like, well, it was all of them at once.
It's like, I don't know.
Crazy is hard to coexist with other motivations because when you have crazy,
it pretty much just means it's just doing shit.
But yeah, the discussion around Daenerys is frustrating.
I mean, with craziness is the same excuse that can be used to justify anything in the same way
that a moment of weakness could be used to justify anything.
It's like, oh, they just had a temporary failing character.
I don't want to highlight, by the way, that he was running with the whole like,
she's never killed anybody that she considers innocent.
He was going with that for a while before I pulled the quote.
Like it was clearly a part of his argument that was significant.
Yep. Oh, yeah.
The only argument he has when counted is, well, I didn't interpret it that way.
He can't approach it objectively because it was objectively bad.
He was also like, even confused on that as well.
Like he would simultaneously be like, it's all subjective.
I'll also be in like, there are objective elements for sure.
But it was really unclear what the line was.
Like definitive things actually taking place.
But then I managed to like, every single scene you have to define whether or not
there's too much to interpret and therefore it can't be said objectively.
Oh, and I would have been that person in season five making excuses for the show,
rationalizing the show, which is what I believe he was doing.
But because I liked it, I was emotionally invested in it.
Our friend Doomcock calls hypnosis.
Hypnosis is a really good word for it.
Yeah.
I think we all fell under the spell when The Force Awakens came out.
Certainly a lot of us.
I mean, I was certainly, I was down with, I was down with what I saw.
My eyes had those really black and white strips.
I was completely hypnosis, hypnosified.
That's, that's the word, right?
I had, you had smiler eyes.
Horrifying.
Then I got broken out of it.
Save.
What a worthless discussion.
Please move on.
Well, we did eventually.
Here we are.
Jamie didn't know Brienne was at Winterfell and if his motivations weren't heroic,
then he wouldn't be on the front of the North, but as far back as possible.
Did Jamie know Brienne was there or not?
Last time they spoke, I think he knew that Brienne was heading back to Winterfell.
Well, he didn't know.
I knew.
Yeah.
He didn't know that she was there 100% guaranteed absolute truth,
but I'm pretty sure that he knew.
And because I don't, I don't know myself, but if his motivation for going to Winterfell was
supposedly to save Brienne specifically, or that he had a big emotional investment in her,
then wouldn't that make it just doubly weirder that he would ditch her so quickly for Cersei again?
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, I don't, I just don't agree with the interpretation.
I think he did it for the living.
He makes that very clear even in season eight.
He said, you're right.
I mean, that's what he, so we're supposed to just, I mean, sometimes there's the unreliable narrator,
but at this time, things got so simplified at the end.
I think everything was at face value.
And that's one of the major differences from the show from early on,
because you had that unreliable narrator.
So you didn't know when people were telling the truth.
And yeah, that's the thing is like so many people did understand Game of Thrones.
I think one of the big things was how many people survived.
I think people expected more people to die if they were expecting anything.
And Jaime knew because he would know that Brienne was, she was Sansa's sworn sword.
So she, and she is loyal to a fault.
And she would never leave her side when she did that and that.
Efap 58 gallons of rationalizations, Game of Thrones season.
Yes.
The ending being crap is just what you feel, Mauler.
It couldn't possibly be because it was straight up poorly written, obviously.
I know.
You understand it, Mauler.
You just didn't understand.
Well, let's say super easily, super easy, Balian inconvenience in your epic voice.
Rags, what's my epic voice?
I'm actually not certain what they're referring to.
Maybe it's the hello, ladies and gentlemen voice.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen voice.
Super easy, Balian inconvenience.
Oh, maybe, maybe that's what they were going for.
You don't know.
Pretty good.
Hi, my wife.
Hi, my wife always ignores my YouTubing.
Sargon, Arch, Rags, and now Mauler.
Except these super chats.
So a special hi Rags just for Nicole, please.
Oh, hello.
Hello, Nicole.
Yeah, there you go.
I was just trying to, you know, make sure I understood.
I didn't want to, I didn't want to pre hello, Nicole.
The biggest letdown was the Night King.
All that buildup and he really, he was almost no real damage, no real payoff.
Every noble family did more damage to the kingdom.
Ned Stark did more and he got killed at the beginning.
I mean, I don't think anybody's going to disagree.
The Night King was a flat tire of a character.
Just like wobbled in and just fell over.
Like, all right.
When Mauler showed me that the first scene in the entire series was.
Oh, and by the way, if there's no scene that came before it,
it's the first scene.
Just to clarify.
Yeah, people wouldn't chat with me like always the prologue.
It's like, yes, the first scene.
The first scene, yes.
But I thought it was really, really weird that that was the first scene of the whole series.
And that's how it ended.
I'm like, oh, all right.
I mean, that's the I was tricked, obviously,
because that's what I was really in it for.
Hugely outside of the characters was how they're going to resolve this
impeding doom or impending do impending.
Impeeding doom would be like the doom was getting in the way.
This doom is in this doom is getting in the way.
This is this fucking troublesome doom.
Um, yeah.
And when the episode three happened, I was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I just finished rewatching the 1987 Predator movie.
Now talk about something that has held up over time.
Now I get to enjoy some eFap.
So what are we talking about?
Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Predator 1987 is fucking great.
That's a film that'll stand the test of time for a few thousand years, hopefully.
One of the movies we watched recently was The Fly.
And it was very good.
That's another movie that have you seen that, Gary?
So God, yeah.
Those special effects, though.
Man, those were impressive.
I thought I could reach out and touch them because I could.
So I think this is one you can choose to interpret.
It simply says roof time.
You can choose to interpret anything smaller.
Didn't you hear the man?
It's all subjective.
Can you interpret the word anything?
The word anything?
Well, you have to interpret it.
That's what words are.
I'm learning something every day.
Yay.
Kick.
Yes, an IRL.
I'll just kick someone like we kick Jay.
Stop lisping.
Stop lisping.
Stop lisping.
Stop lisping.
I was from raw.
I think he doesn't like this thing.
I'm getting that feeling.
Good luck interrupting.
Shlubly with my carrot down your throat, you gay whore.
Jeez.
Oh, wow.
There was that weird moment where he interrupted me
and just kept talking for fucking two minutes.
Yeah, that was odd.
Extremely rude, I guess.
The issue isn't that we disagree with Jamie as a character.
It's that his final decision of motivations
contradicts his previously established ones.
Great.
Poland is subjective.
Have we got science on this?
Is this true?
Poland is subjective.
Yeah.
Define Poland.
I mean, you mean Poland is it.
I mean, obviously, there's a country called Poland
and you can independently verify that there's a place
and people there and erode signs and other people.
You recognize it as a country.
Dabble government.
Yeah, you would have to you'd have to consider nation states
super duper conceptually to even begin to try and say
that countries aren't objective.
Oh, yeah.
Kills little finger.
Little finger.
I was clearly hacked.
Also, hi, wags.
Hello.
And it ends with I'm a woman.
A womb.
I really hope they bring that into the show.
That song.
It was so good.
They didn't have that.
Also, they have not had that one thing.
I can't let a man take credit for women's work.
They haven't had that yet.
They haven't had that.
Hoping the husband cut.
It was such a good line.
It was still time.
Still time.
Yeah, that's true.
I was going to say there was massive reshoots on it.
She was supposed to be at San Diego Comic Con
and she didn't show up because of the reshoots.
The fact that there was reshoots on that show
and those were getting the best of what they got.
This was after the reshoots.
I want to see the original.
Oh, my God.
What didn't live up to CW standards?
You were reporting all the reshoots for episode nine, right?
And it's just like it almost seems like, of course.
It's like, yeah, of course.
It's a disaster.
What if you just have a really good script
and you double, triple, quintuple check it
and then you shoot that?
That's stupid.
All right.
I'm sure they write their scripts with emojis.
It'll be great.
Hello, rags.
Hello.
My door is open for you because that is how I like to poop.
Rags, wags, rags, ragnorok.
How is infinite retro?
Where is Fritanga?
Oh, I assume they're both doing just swimmingly.
Your arguments are subject while making subject arguments.
Okay.
All right.
Well, there you go.
There you have it.
Some things are objective, like a fact.
Billboard, Bill, Gidius, Bingleman.
Actual quote from Jensen.
Ra, save us.
I have a roof located at 45 meters height.
Oh, no.
This is actually from Rob Bowler.
I was supposed to be asleep collecting my energy
for yet another joke screening, but the brood demands blood.
So I'm up on the rooftop.
Just get him here at zero HP so I can deliver the fatality.
It's the same.
Wouldn't it be one HP?
Zero HP is dead, right?
Well, in Mortal Kombat, zero.
I guess D&D rules, right?
Zero in Mortal Kombat makes them go into, you know,
fatality ready.
I see.
I see.
The only reason Ned went to King's Landing in the first place
was because Jon Arryn was murdered by Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn.
Therefore, it was Littlefinger's fault.
Yeah, like I said, it's that incident plus the attempting
the knife thingy in his sleep, which I find I'm thinking
about it now.
It's like the show never actually answers that.
That was Joffrey and the Joffrey had given the blades
to the assassin, right?
That's how it goes in the book.
Was the best director to Gary, I guess.
Yes, yes.
Well, are we supposed to believe that it was Littlefinger
then in the show?
Do you reckon that's what they're going for?
That's must.
Yeah.
Again, this is one of those things where I get the book
and the show mixed up, but they never explained or did they?
Did they explain that Joffrey?
I don't think they ever mentioned it.
That's why I was kind of I knew I knew it was in the book.
Go back and check.
Yeah, they would have to say that it was Littlefinger
and not explaining that Joffrey or not, you know,
because the knife came from Robert Baratheon's collection
because it was rare because it was Valyrian steel.
Yeah, I guess at that point, you would have to conclude
that it all comes down to Littlefinger and Lyser Arryn.
Which again, takes away from the whole fact of it
being kind of a destiny thing and, you know, ending up in Arias.
That's that's where the knife, the cat's paw ends up in the book.
I think she'll end up with it at some point.
But that's also shows that without, you know, proper lead up
and it just doesn't work.
So they were going to George's ends without using
their own means to that end.
And, you know, so many narrative things were done.
Like they stopped.
They stopped doing things the way they used to.
OK, they used to, you know, go to George.
They would have the source material.
Then they had to start making up their own stuff.
Yeah, that's hard.
But Rags made a great point.
These are professionals.
That's what they're supposed to do.
They're supposed to adapt this stuff.
We had a question about that.
One of our question was about, you know, do you think
there's any correlation between when they ran out
of cereal and the show got worse, essentially?
And there absolutely was.
Braun was brought up video on this.
He he he George R. Martin was talking about what changes
were made in the show that he didn't necessarily come out
and say they bothered him.
But you can tell they bothered him.
And it was they started using marketing research.
All right.
So Braun was a very popular character.
So they started putting him in the show more.
Liked him.
Now, I like Braun for the most part, but he like he stopped
being useful in the story a long time ago.
But I like Braun.
He was a fun character.
You know, I liked it.
And the argument was made that a lot of that that was done
with Aria and Sansa, too.
Now, they obviously had paths already, but they were, you know,
Aria killing the Night King.
I think one of the arguments I heard, I don't know if this
was from a fan or just somebody writing for the access media
was that she hadn't had any really big kills.
And John had had all the, you know, all the sexy moments
with the Battle of the Bastards and Hardhome and stuff.
But if you think about how she behaved, well, what she does
in episodes five and six, where she only almost kills,
but then doesn't imagine them writing that all out.
And then they're like, man, she's not going to kill anyone
this season of significance.
Have you killed the Night King?
There you go.
It's like, guys, you can't just do it this way.
Oh, no.
So it definitely made them change their course.
They rushed it.
They changed course.
They started, you know, smelling their own farts,
and they all smelled great.
We saw in the documentary, and I've seen it firsthand
with the Orville, like the worship that goes on
with the showrunner, like how much power they actually have.
People are always talking about them,
talking about pleasing them.
There's that one scene in the documentary
where the costume designer is all excited
because Dan and Dave are going to be there.
And it's, you know, and I get it.
That's within their work environment.
But you can see how that derails creativity.
Because, you know, what's George's biggest problem
with the prequels that everybody says
he was surrounded himself by yes men.
And he didn't have a Gary Kurtz around to tell him, you know,
no, and plus he's a billionaire.
So who's going to tell a billionaire, no.
That's what happened is they gained so much power.
You know, to this day, they're called geniuses.
I don't personally see that.
But you can see how they would...
Absolutely.
And relative is certainly in this scenario.
And I was going to say as well, yeah,
Arya did kill the phrase.
But I was talking more about it as a whole.
You look at that script, start to finish,
and they're like, okay, Arya doesn't kill anyone significant.
We can't have that.
You could trade it all around.
Everything just stopped.
Stream just stops.
Yep, and I checked the thing.
Apparently, it is still stitched together.
So this video should function still.
Oh, very good.
Rags, I bought a gas mask after you talked about
how I have always loved the way the Israeli one looks.
Like an anime eyes jackal.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah, gas masks.
I mean, Halloween is right around the corner.
That's a that's a cheap ass prop.
You get a gas mask or nothing.
Real ones.
The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
was the inciting incident of World War One.
Yes, things happened before that set the stage,
but that was still the inciting point.
Google say the inciting incident.
It's when the it's the it's what gets the protagonist
involved in the story, essentially,
which isn't what we were using.
So well, I didn't even mention it at the time
because it just it just wasn't what we were talking about.
Yeah.
Yeah, we were we were just not using it in that context.
Maybe maybe I should should be picking a different weird.
Well, we were both talking about the same thing.
Yeah, in concept.
What's the moment it all comes back to basic inciting incident
of the entire series or the series I put out the war
of the five kings, but they said the inciting incident
of the series is the death of Lord John Aaron,
which I would happily concede as well.
Because everything kicks off because of that.
But what we were talking about what insights the war.
It's like John Aaron's death didn't like the war didn't have
to come after that.
A lot of different things could have happened.
Um, in fact, everything's still at peace.
It's just that a couple of other characters do a couple
of other things.
And the most significant being, like I said,
when Bran is nearly killed for the second time.
Well, please add some Tywin chuckles to this later.
I can't do that if I'm not doing any post.
Tywin wouldn't laugh at this.
Oh, he'd be upset.
Is two plus two equals four?
Yes, I disagree.
That's actually a reference to the not so great debate.
We would try to explain the guy's arguments,
the counters he was giving to me and Wolf.
Like we would present something and he'd just be like,
I disagree.
And be like, I can't argue and stop it.
I'm standing atop a sea of toxic brooders all screaming
for blood as Susan tries to shut down our stream.
My arms wide open and a bloody smile painted upon my face.
Susan will not stop as boys rise up.
He's referencing Joker.
Stop saying subjective.
Rah, get the roof.
Get the roof.
When I see doggy daddy's chungus plumbus,
ooh woo, when I sit on doggy daddy's chungus plumbus,
ooh woo, I guess oh whoa was the first one.
Oh whoa.
Can he explain the respawning soldiers?
He said that he would that's why we really didn't talk
about much of the logistical stuff.
He said that he pretty much agrees with all of it anyway.
But I guess we could have talked a bit more about it at least.
This seems like a very long way of saying everything
is just subjective.
So accept it.
It was a bit of that.
Also, thank you for releasing re-releasing the not so great
debate in an edited down formal.
I really needed the extra dose of cancer.
Supposed to edit.
Arya Stark teleports behind Night King.
Ome Woo Ma Sin Dieru.
Is that supposed to be?
No, no.
Oh my God.
Come on, Mauler.
Work with us.
Oh, my woman.
Shin Dieru.
I've never pronounced that before.
What?
You know, you know that the anime thing, right?
Assuming it's the nothing personal kiddo.
Kinda.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've never seen that before.
I feel out of the loop now.
But I know that nothing personal kiddo.
Especially when you teleport behind somebody.
Wow, it's hard.
Then get out of the kitchen, toots.
If Peter Jackson can do mostly faithful adaptation
of Lord of the Rings, then it is possible to do justice
to Game of Thrones in adaptation at the very least.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
The one thing I'll say is that obviously Game of Thrones
isn't finished yet.
It's harder to adapt something that doesn't, well,
hasn't finished.
But that doesn't mean they fucked up well before
they ran out of both materials, so.
Yep.
George has probably changed his ending about four times
since he's talked to him.
Because I've always heard that that conversation
was years ago, like six years ago.
So a lot of stuff could change, and apparently
there was some drama between them, too.
So piloting a plane is not easy.
Engineering a rocket is hard.
You're still expected to perform those tasks properly,
not an argument you hack.
People feel differently when it comes to art,
that they would argue probably that there's a tangible
arm done when you don't perform the tasks
that we're referencing with the ones.
But I think there's a lot of exceptions
you'd be able to find with that.
But the point being that I agree.
Have you considered that Captain Marvel
is a perfect movie in the Disney fanatical Marvel universe?
Also, I'm axing you.
Is Rags a good boy?
I am a good boy.
In the Disney fanatical Marvel universe.
It wouldn't even work, because Disney have
had control since Iron Man 2.
So that film still destroys everything they made.
If only it was the first of Disney,
and I'm like, it's Disney's fanatical style.
It's hard.
Unless you're a femoid talking about my dick,
I literally don't care.
Hard, then don't do it.
A femoid.
Plenty of goyim can do it better.
Hi, Mauler, my last Super Chat.
You said R.D. was your favorite Tarantino movie.
Reservoir dogs.
To be honest, I figured it would be.
Objectively great and a joy to watch.
Was wondering why you're not fond of Hateful Eight, though.
I liked Hateful Eight at first,
and I thought about how nothing makes sense in that film.
And it soured on me quite quickly.
I kind of like the characters still,
though I think a few of them are wasted.
But if you think about the plan
and what everyone's doing there,
and what they choose to do,
it gets really stupid really fast.
But I mean, I'm still interested in Tarantino's movies,
because they usually got great dialogue.
Yeah.
Laugh my ass off.
Just be good, you loser.
I found your vids on TLJ and loved them.
Well, thank you.
I'm glad you enjoy them.
If I hear like one more time,
I'm gonna werewolf.
Okay.
I'm gonna werewolf.
Arya killing the Night King is dumber
than if Ghost Yoda snuck up behind Snoke
and tickled his nuts causing him to explode
and destroy the supremacy.
Oh, no.
That would have been better.
I would have enjoyed it more.
I don't know.
Yeah.
This George hasn't finished the books yet.
Line is tiresome.
We would have accepted an ending
that was completely divorced from the books
if it made sense.
Yeah.
I agree.
I absolutely agree.
Would Yoda tickle his nuts with a force?
He's not.
He's not very tall.
He could probably.
He's Yoda's like that height.
Right.
When you're sitting down,
if you're sitting down,
Yoda's about nut height.
You can force tickle.
Why can't you force tickle?
That's how that's how Yoda's people
measure height in nuts.
Molly, you good, man.
You sound a little off today.
I it's hard to explain,
but I was that debate.
I was not feeling it at certain points.
And I mean, I don't like to call it out
during a discussion
because it almost feels like it's whether
you're when you try and call out
that something's being derailed,
you've derailed it,
even if it wasn't derailed,
you know what I mean,
by doing that almost.
Yeah.
And I didn't want to highlight
like with Daenerys,
we were circling back again and again
and again and again and again
and again and again and again.
And like, I really felt like
the Daenerys conversation was over
like 10 times before it ended.
Yeah.
Yeah, I I had been convinced
and based on everything I've seen,
I was definitely already leaning that way.
But he I certainly was not.
Certainly was not convinced
by anything he's.
There's you know, some people
were like,
got to like control better.
You've got to give people on track better.
You got to try and like reduce
the amount of answer time
he was giving us.
I think the problem is fair.
I think that's fair.
We probably should have stepped
in a few times
because he was going on and on.
It's I think a lot of the times
we were just like,
it's he was just going on and on.
And we were like,
it's really tough to tell sometimes
because you every is
for every single moment they're speaking.
You're like, is this the end of the sentence?
No.
Oh, no.
No.
Now.
No.
But I think that's a fair criticism.
We will keep that in mind in the future.
I think the thing is,
especially because it was kind of a
basically a one V three.
We I know that I certainly felt
like I didn't want to cut them off too much.
I know I do every once in a while
because I feel I don't want people
to go down rabbit holes.
Yeah.
But I get what you're saying.
I gotcha.
Yeah, we do we do try our best
with that sort of thing.
Like you we definitely several times
would be like that's not addressing
what was said or like stop.
I think I said stop at one point
because I think down rabbit holes.
I even advised him not to head down
some moral rabbit holes
because he was saying some stuff
that anyway.
Don't act like anyone could do better.
I hate this guy now.
I bet he's going to tweet
about how we should be okay
with eating bugs someday near in future.
I can't confirm.
It could be a yes.
It could also.
I think the eating bugs is about
some reference about how we should
start eating bugs
because they're good for you.
And I guess environmentally kind and stuff.
Look at Shabito said
Yasm was dominating that debate
and then he lands and Vito for roof.
I don't know if what Vito means
was he was talking a lot
or if he means he was winning the debate.
I don't I don't know.
I was talking a lot.
He was talking a lot.
That's for certain.
But basically all of the points
that he made were either
completely irrelevant
or not the problems that we have
or extremely poor rationalization of.
And like heavy interpretation
desperately relying on very small things
blown up to big things.
Yes.
Lots of assumption going on there.
Apparently Vito thinks
Yasm was on fire.
All right.
Yeah, of course he does.
I also hate the you couldn't do it argument.
Clearly they've got the drive.
So given the time resources and support,
who says they can't?
Yeah, I agree.
It's like we're really not sure
of what any people in chat
or us are capable of
because we haven't had this opportunity.
So to assume we simply can't.
I don't know.
That's a bit unfair.
I think Mahler and I were talking
the other day about we're pretty much both.
If you put if you take any any writer
for any show and then pair them up
against the collective noggins
of the Internet,
the Internet will come up
with a better story than you.
Really guaranteed.
Yeah, that many minds working together.
Ha ha poopy pee pee tickle
your cream sack.
I will Yoda.
Yes, that is a direct quote
from that scene that didn't actually happen,
but it's probably a deleted scene.
Makes sense deleted scene.
Yeah, Danny does a 180 in one episode.
If she had butchered everybody
in the Red Keep only,
it would be fine committing genocide
as a whole other level.
Yeah, that's why my suggestion.
I was just like she can kill
a bunch of innocent people
with collateral damage.
John can be just as outraged
because she didn't have to do that.
She was that pissed at Danny.
She was so pissed.
She wanted to burn down
the whole Red Keep.
It's not too unreasonable
to assume she would do that,
especially if she was really angry,
but to systematically destroy
every portion of King's Landing
is like what are you doing, woman?
Like ridiculous.
I certainly not been convinced
that that makes any level of sense.
Doesn't that that kind of action
requires at the very least
a couple of episodes
of King's Landing populace
being showing up
showing some sort of uprising,
killing someone solid,
doing something to motivate
Daenerys to do that to the populace
to where she just doesn't give two craps.
Now, Cersei beheading Missandei.
That's Cersei still.
That's not King's Landingers.
They were locked in there.
They were used as human shields.
So and she had to know that
if we're going to go on assumptions.
She said she.
But no, I'm going to fry him anyway
because it makes sense
because she you know,
she she fed a guy to a dragon
who was a slave
or she thought was a slaver.
Tactics.
Well, you know,
if we're using the mafia argument,
the mafia doesn't commit massacres.
It brings attention to them for one
and it doesn't win over people.
And the one the one thing
the mafia does,
it wins over a lot of people.
They strategic kills.
Yeah, that whole argument was flawed.
A Theo brought up in chat.
I was going to bring it up,
but I just I guess I left it
on the floor at one point,
but it's in my video as well.
To annihilate that many people
in your populace is like,
oh yeah, this will make them fear me.
It's like they're going to fucking hate you.
They will never forget this.
You better watch.
No, absolutely.
This will be something
that's never forgotten.
Entire thousands of lineages
could have been ended.
There are several good for us.
And Westeros know and knowing
what we know,
what would what has been established
in the show,
there would be five or 10 lords
who would just be waiting
to take their chance to they
they can see the dragons
are easily killed.
You know, you took out one feels.
And there's ways to I mean,
it's just one dragon.
That's still something
that needs to be feared, obviously,
but there are ways to kill drag.
I mean, they have to be watched
all the time.
You pay the right person.
You can get access to it.
Yeah, there will be
Lords plotting immediately.
It would not be a very stable rule
at all.
So, you know, again,
the motivation in that was what
and then afterwards,
which we didn't even talk about.
She, you know,
they did that ridiculous fascist speech.
And it which was just dumb.
The only thing it was good for
was memes and a good thumbnail
where I could put the Hitler hat on her,
you know, but don't talk about.
Yeah, it just over and over again
on something that I mean,
if the argument in the chat was
it didn't deserve that much time,
I could agree with you on that.
It was just it was bad in so many ways.
And it was because of
it didn't have any depth.
It was all God superficial.
I don't know if that's the right word.
It was just all simple.
Game of Thrones became simple at the end.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Foreshadowing doesn't mean
it's set up properly.
There's a bunch of videos on YouTube
that came out soon after all this stuff
with Game of Thrones
or addressing that.
Can't just go,
Oh, it's foreshadowed in season one,
episode three.
I could find some quote
out of the gajillion quotes
that might lend itself to what I
saw or what ended up being the case.
You can do that with anything.
But this character said
this one piece of dialogue
of this one episode,
this one time,
not for everything.
It's like, oh, that justifies it.
That's fair enough.
Let me add him.
His points are so wrong.
It hurts.
You guys should invite Jay Longbun
to watch Batwoman with you.
Um, maybe.
I don't know if she's interested or not.
100%.
Like the thing is,
if she wants to do videos on it,
it might be awkward that
we've got a video of her reacting to it.
You know what I mean?
Like she might want to do her own thing.
And also, I have to admit,
the way it is right now with me,
rags, fringing in metal,
a lot of the time,
something stupid happens
and like all four of us
want to want to call it out.
And so we stumble over each other
until one person gets the mic,
if you know what I mean?
And so if you have a fifth person there,
like it would be crowded.
Yeah.
And this is like,
I think it would still be funny.
It's just that I don't know
if a fifth person can really work
with how much all of us
have to say about how dumb
everything is in that show.
Yeah.
And the stuff is always happening.
There's always stuff to comment on
pretty much.
I mean, that film is dense.
Efap, how do I get an
objectively hot girlfriend?
Objectively hot?
You mean like,
in terms of like Kelvin?
Yes.
Like if she's,
I don't know, man,
like I don't get like someone
who's a fever thing.
Or she's an alien and being hot.
But honestly,
be confident,
have a sense of humor,
and be willing to listen.
Those are the three golden rules
that I just made up instantly.
There you go.
Golden rules.
If you're fun to be around,
they will want to be around you.
If you are dull and boring,
then, hmm.
You like Game of Thrones season eight?
Listen, no.
No from a lot of women out there.
Don't risk it.
Don't risk it.
Don't risk it.
Don't risk it?
Oh yeah, don't get married.
Fuck that shit.
I really don't.
I'm just kidding.
Flavors.
The most respectable people.
This is the thing.
Why'd she kill them for no reason?
I've eaten meat before.
It doesn't mean I'd eat human.
Yeah, these are a lot of,
obviously, kind of been over the.
I found the idea that,
like it was a defense of her actions
to say she threatened to do things.
That was baffling to me.
Yeah, I think we'd all happily agree
that there's a lot of things
people threaten to do
that would never do them.
Then that's the whole point.
They use a threat.
Just watch this.
Just watch the scene.
Danny looks cold.
Not like she's enjoying
the burning of the harpy man.
Also, we're not talking about Joffrey.
I figured it out.
He's an alien.
Quick, get him to draw something.
Not appreciated memes.
Free Hong Kong.
Death is preferable to communism.
I agree.
Absolutely.
No, no, no.
We got a bad revolution of our age.
Ban them and take their money now.
Oh, it works.
Children aren't like their fathers.
Oh yeah, I wanted to bring that up.
He referenced the Mad King
and how he did similar things.
I was like,
isn't the whole fucking point of that?
What episode where he's like,
children are not their fathers.
Like, yeah, we're not responsible
for our ancestors like that.
I guess she just that coin man
that whether or not
she's insane coin
just landed on insane.
It was flinging in the air
this whole time.
Yep.
Just needed that.
I really wish they'd never
had it in the first place.
It's such a lame like 5050
chance will be insane.
And even if they seem like
they're not insane,
they might suddenly become insane.
He's like, oh, okay.
Yeah.
Danny loves collateral damage.
That's why she killed
all of the women she freed
when the witch killed
Drogo and her kid.
Oh, wait.
What the actual fact.
There were no gamers left alive
in King's Landing.
So they failed to rise up.
They lived in a society.
Demola bring us his head.
I wouldn't have such violence such
by whose metric
his sums it all up there.
Or even by his.
Well, for the innocent.
So by this guy's logic,
Hitler did nothing wrong
because his point of view
of the victims were not innocent.
I don't know if you'd agree with that.
I can't remember
what the context exactly was
what we were discussing
at that point.
But I know that did conclude
that she did consider
those people innocent.
I'm all I didn't even know.
But she burned them anyway.
Yeah.
Well, didn't you know
metrics are subjective.
Brags, didn't you do a video
on that person
who found metrics to be racist?
Oh, yeah, the tweet.
Yeah, I how units of measurement
are bad.
They should be done away with
any proper communist society
will do away with the concept
of units of measurement.
I think we can all agree
with that.
Right, Gary?
That's a measurement, man.
Like I saw them
the other day down the street
and I was like, fuck you, man.
Like, hey, and I was like,
no, don't don't give me that.
Units of measurement.
Oppression.
Well, you know how far
away things are.
Miss my super chat.
I posted in 54.
You never responded to it in 55.
You went from the one
before it to the one out.
Why did you spend
the whole super chat telling me
to read an old super chat
instead of just saying the thing
that you think I've missed.
I can't go back to
EFAB 54 super chats.
You don't you can't search
super chats because
you don't understand.
I'd have to.
Yeah, you would have to read
that would take some time
to search through
because there's a way to look
at all your super chats,
but that's a lot of scrolling.
You know how many super chats
we get.
So you guys don't mind.
We could stop right now
and look for it.
Nobody minds.
They'll wait.
It's Matthew Saint.
Sia, is he in chat right now?
If you're in chat right now,
just ask the question.
Whatever it is.
My eyes in the chat.
If you ask it on Twitter,
I should see it.
That's another quicker way to do this.
Because you don't understand
how much I'll have to load.
That's it's a lot.
Yeah, and this is not like
just loading loading.
Bloating.
Yeah, I guess lag.
You're every single time
you hit next page.
I'm in the chat.
Okay, we see you.
Ask your question.
There he is.
Ask the question.
Do it.
I don't have twitters.
That's okay.
I'll see you in the chat.
You're asked the question.
Bridge keeper.
I'm very excited.
Before it's like a super
offensive question or something.
It doesn't get past the filters
on channels.
Oh no.
We're a tree.
Everybody's all excited.
Now this is going to be.
I'm ready.
It's honestly like deliver.
Matthew, I figure you guys
would have noticed by now,
but there's not a super chat.
I won't read out.
I will not avoided reading one yet.
Oh, we'll do it.
Give you up.
Any second.
I guess I'll read the next one.
Let me know if you guys see a cue.
I'll keep an eye on it.
This guy can't differentiate
between rationale from detached
observers perspective and rationale
from the characters perspective.
That's kind of dumb.
Rational from detached observers perspective.
I think that he felt that
we were having trouble with that.
I guess you could say about both sides,
but I always felt like we had more
references than speculation.
I must burn the children
for future generations.
Dienerio Bobaglio Dienerio Bobaglio.
Burn the children for the future generations.
So wonderful.
Listen, the future generations
can't be oppressed if there
are no future generations.
Okay.
It makes sense.
War makes strange bedfellows,
i.e. Republican France and Sarist Russia.
Is that the theme of Game of Thrones?
Maybe you can see it.
War makes strange bedfellows.
Yeah.
Why not anything?
The discussion made me appreciate
Robert Baratheon so much,
you realize that the dude was 100%
right about that sadistic Kant.
Yes, I said that in my video.
Robert Baratheon was right.
If only we had trusted him.
Top 10 let downs in
Game of Thrones discussion needed.
Well, like top 10 satisfied
with some of that discussion.
Is that what you're after?
Oh, there it is.
There it is.
So if I had written the Star Wars sequel trilogy,
I would have had a civil war
between the Republic and those
not wanting to go back
to how things were in the prequels.
Duke tries to keep the Jedi out of the fight.
It wouldn't have been a bad idea.
But the question.
I guess it will hold up.
It would depend on I can believe it.
Like if it especially if both of the factions were
very morally dubious
or kind of gray areas
or there wasn't a clear right answer
that would get Luke to be like,
oh yeah, obviously these are the good guys
that we need to help them.
Oh, it would be great
if like Leia asked Luke
to like win a fight for them.
And he was like, I can't.
I don't believe in this something great.
I can't risk my pupils,
something like that.
I don't know.
It would certainly be very interesting.
And I agree that would be
that would be something
I would be willing to watch.
I would like to watch that unfold.
That little that your little pitch
right there has more background
than the two new Disney films.
I already feel like I have more context
just from his from his chat.
That I know nothing about anything
from The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi.
I don't know why the first order happened.
I know I know I'm supposed to read books
and comics and stuff,
but I'm not going to.
So done, Matthew.
Uh, Rags, if you're still here
when super chats are being read
as a doggo yourself,
what is your stance on neutering?
Uh, if what do you think?
What do you think it is?
It's probably exactly what you think.
I don't know as a human.
What's your view on castration?
Oh, my.
Away from my balls.
Away from my balls, mate.
I was born with them
and I'll die with them.
Well, you can keep them in your pace
or something like that, right?
Wasn't that from that fucking movie?
That Jack Black movie.
Which one?
The one like the 10,000 B.C. one.
Oh, year one or something.
Wait, what was it called?
The one with Jack Black?
And was it not John Cena, Michael Cera?
Oh, fuck.
Yeah, no, I don't.
Year one.
Was that what it was called?
I can't remember what the name is,
but I know he's a joke about keeping balls
in the purse.
I'm guessing in that.
Yeah, he he there was there's a unikit
and he keeps his balls in his little
and a little purse and he throws them
at one of the characters at one point.
Nacho Libre.
Nacho Libre.
Kill your enemies.
They win the idiot.
Oh, no.
Yeah, that sounds like a big idiot.
Sounds like a.
I don't think I think that's a bit.
That's big.
That's too big brain for big idiots.
History is written in blood
and even the greatest heroes
have likely done terrible things.
Odd mentality or thinking
has no bearing in the narrative.
That is what George is trying to represent.
Um, I don't I think room to say that.
Also, I believe it's about time.
Mr. Nidrotic to say goodbye to the.
Like to tell them all where they can find.
Sure, you can find me at
Nerdrotic.
You can just search it here on YouTube
and subscribe if you like it.
I talk a lot about a lot of things.
Game of Thrones, but I will be talking
about Watchmen tonight
with our good friend Doomcock.
I guess he was on the previous.
That should be fun.
Got you guys back to back.
I'm sorry we couldn't get you the same time.
You know how scheduling conflicts are.
You know how the biz is.
Yeah, it's unfortunate.
But yeah, thanks for thanks for coming on.
Did you have fun?
Absolutely.
I had a no.
I always have fun when I'm here
and it is a it is an honor
and a privilege to be on EFAP with rags
and right.
Good to talk to you again rags.
It's good to see you.
Absolutely.
I will come back whenever you want
or if you don't want again,
that's fine.
My feelings won't be hurt much,
but and I got to get you guys on
sometime too.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Nothing we can't talk about.
Sure we can come up with a couple things.
We can talk about the rain.
We'd be fine.
I could bitch about that.
I like the damn weather.
We need some to wash some of the poop away
on my the streets of my fair city,
San Francisco.
You live in.
You could guess.
You can guess.
All right.
So thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Obviously, I was going to say the link
to Nodrotic's channel is in the description.
He does cover lots of lots of media.
You've been on enough times now
that I think most of them are going to know you,
but if they still don't hit the link,
check the stuff out.
I've been on a couple of his videos here and there.
You might be able to find some of them
and then start looking at all the stuff.
It makes sense.
Have fun watching bat woman tonight.
I know that we will have fun watching bat woman
when we finally get around to doing that.
Amazing.
Look forward to it.
All right, guys.
Take care.
See you around, dude.
And there was two.
And then there were two.
I think a lot of fake F's.
No F for fakes.
Still F's here.
Oh, my goodness.
Just this offline doesn't even say buffering.
Oh, no.
Help.
People got wind of our racetisms.
No.
Oh, no.
Didn't mean it.
We're being ironic.
Is it not coming back?
Back and gay.
Oh, we're back and gay.
Thank goodness.
They were the gayest of homoloids.
Homoloids.
It's back.
Mola did a boomer.
I didn't do nothing.
I was, oh, wait.
I just did a double negative.
Oh, no.
I did all of the things.
Sorry.
But you can hear me right, Rex.
Is it right?
I can hear you.
Thank goodness.
Hey, Mola.
Hope this helps out a bit.
Also, hi, Tomatakos, if you're watching.
Art.
A Drorachihord is basically a traveling grape carnival.
That's kind of true.
Hey, that's great for some of them.
They can increase their population with ease so unethically.
That is my subjective interpretation.
There you go.
Analysis complete.
Howdy, gentlemen.
I have a deep question for you.
I used to be a sewer worker.
Best job.
I had to wear a harness before entering manholes.
This gave me the unfortunate kink of harnesses.
My question is, what kinks have y'all gotten
from weird, mundane places, and do you regret them?
Well, I normally, whenever I venture down a manhole,
I normally don't do it with a harness.
Yeah, you don't want to be safetying up for that.
You want to go straight up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The danger is the thrill, you see.
Kinks that I have developed through jobs and work.
That's a good question, but one I probably have to think about.
That's something I consider oftentimes.
I used to work in a...
I used to be a valet.
It's one of my previous jobs.
So the idea of casual sex in cars might have come from that.
Imagining just fucking railing someone in a car.
I like that idea.
Kind of kinky for me, I dig it.
But that's the only one that I could probably say comes to mind at the moment.
I'd have to think about it.
It's an odd question.
A good one, but an odd question.
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't really got any answers.
Nothing I can think of.
Like, weird, mundane, development.
You ever just want to hate...
You used to work in retail, right?
Dealing with people.
You ever used to want to just hate fuck customers?
You know what?
Maybe.
Just tie them down to the front desk and just fucking hate fuck them.
You ever want to rape them?
I wouldn't go that far.
Is that where the thrill comes in?
Knowing that they haven't.
Because some people are like that.
I'm not like that.
Just for the record, I think consent is cool.
But you know how some people are.
Um, yeah, it's it's a it's a thing to think about.
I don't know.
I haven't really considered it myself.
So that's why I don't really have any answers.
It's a mundane answer.
I like it when like when she's like in the car and her ass is hanging out the side
and some guy's just fucking her.
Drilling.
Just drilling.
Just hammering that nail.
Absolutely.
Just harnessing that manhole.
Nothing sets up madness like establishing stability.
Yeah, I think that's relevant.
Yeah, the discussion.
You know, the world is better off after Hitler when he died.
Fascism never popped up again.
There are I don't I don't think it is interesting with that.
Um, yeah, that's that's going to be a tougher one.
I understand the argument.
I don't agree.
Well, I don't think I do.
Well, there I've heard the argument that it's good that the Holocaust happened
because it shielded it.
It woke up the world about the horrors of genocides and things like that.
And I don't agree with that, but I understand the reasoning.
I mean, it's don't think it's a good one, though.
Um, especially because of the scale of it.
I got to go by you, Massifs.
Goodbye.
Um, in my opinion, a specific German ruler with a stylish face
didn't gas millions of people.
Can't put a number on things like that, right?
I mean, for the questions thing.
I mean, there was an interesting discussion there to be had about the concept of as we
know, which is more valuable, the life of someone or their freedom and things like that.
I spaced on what I've seen the it's it's interesting to think about how many people
would have Daenerys had to have freed from slavery in order to justify,
you know, X lives that were talking like at least I want to say six hundred thousand
at least I'm being generous when I say that.
Yeah, that's that's a very interesting moral question,
not one that I'm prepared to solve at the moment.
Playing devil's advocate, the world was better off with her.
She did contribute a lot against the Night King,
but I don't think he was thinking that that would have been a great argument.
If that would have been a better idea, I actually would have been like,
oh, well, maybe, yeah, because maybe she actually legit saved the world,
which I mean, if you're saving the world, I mean, if anything is the cost of saving the world,
it's the world.
So, you know, yeah, but those situations where it's like you might have had a good point if you
only had the right references, but then again, once you just use just fucking have someone
teleport in and stab the Night King, then what's the true people actually argued she
was kind of useless because her men are wiped out and her dragon doesn't really do anything other
than like. Yeah, it saves John at one point.
Yeah, like it's like, oh, yeah, just go run across the wall and go assassinate him.
We all know you can do it. Just do it. Mm hmm.
Right. Someone said no.
It's like, yeah, I agree. That's why I don't agree with the idea that,
you know, ultimately it was better that the Holocaust happened.
I mean, in my what I would say is that if it if something similar to the Holocaust happened,
but it was much, much, much smaller in scale and that began a movement that actually prevented a
worse genocide, that argument would be more solid. But still, it's a really touchy subject for a lot
of people. Lyric said, no, Kybin literally says there's a million people in King's Landing.
No, but she doesn't kill everybody. And that's why I said I was being very generous by saying
she only got six hundred thousand for sure. And that's who knows what the aftermath was.
Well, I was just like all of the all of the ash. That's fucking up people's lungs. Yeah.
There's a yeah, she killed a lot of people. There's no doubt.
Loved how it ended. Hated how it got there. My take on Game of Thrones season eight in a nutshell.
Um, I'm not sure how I feel about how it ended, regardless of how it got there.
But I think I would have been much more on board if they'd properly. Hi, raggoth.
Hello. And do surgery. No, can't do surgery. You can perform oral on your kids.
I don't know that that's true. Um, I guess as long as they're of age,
it's legal to perform oral sex on your kids. Right. Oh, maybe I guess.
I mean, I guess I don't actually know it was actually illegal to perform surgery on family
members. I didn't know that was a thing. Well, I've heard that. I don't know if it's real,
but I think there was the idea that you aren't allowed to perform surgery on your own
kin. I don't know if the logic really holds through for that. I'm not sure.
You would think that with your own kids, you would be like super duper extra careful.
I don't know though. This was originally a part of this chat. Look at them freaking out. It's
like this is brought up by super chatters and our guests. What are we supposed to do?
Ignore them. Yeah, people are talking about it. But maybe the idea is that if you perform
surgery on a loved one and fail, that will have extra emotional repercussions that could
damage their career or their ability to operate in the future. I don't know what the rulings are
behind it. I'm just speculating a little bit. I like to do some specutisms. That's just,
that's just what I think. I don't know. Um, first time super chatting,
where did find lisp per lord? Uh, he's, uh, we covered his video and he said he'd like to, uh,
have a discussion on Game of Thrones, and so we did.
Pick Yezen IRL. Well, he's not here anymore. Uh, freeing Unsullied save more babies in the long run.
Oh, you mean like, despite the many killings. Wait, that's not even possible because they've all
had their, their, their wonderful pieces removed that that between a once wonderful
in the center of the body, it's all gone. As they say in the show, the stones and the pillars,
the stones and the pillars for each of them, multiple pillars. Uh, please bring tonaled on
to debate this guy. Why would we do that? Tonal deserves like full attention from us.
We need to explore his mind asking about like new games that came out. Wouldn't that be so fun?
Like, like tonal, what have you played? What games are you looking forward to?
What are your big games? You know, the big game and what's your favorite game of all time? Tell us
why. Oh yeah, that would be something to ask. I would legit be interested. Then we'd have like
questions from the audience. Let's see what people want to say. Yeah.
I guess Jay's asking chat how it was. They're all saying it was bad.
I mean, we, we did everything we could. We're hoping it was at least enlightening
as to why someone would love Game of Thrones season eight or like.
Seeing the show is trash without bias is bad, but sucking it dry without bias is good.
Ain't no sanders like double stand. I mean, he did that. No one,
it's never a problem when people like things for bad reasons. Yeah.
It's like you get a, if you like it, you get a pass.
Uh, yes, an IRL saying mean things is bad. Also he has an IRL. I think Danny killing
a thousand is okay because Thebes. It wasn't because Thebes. It was because, uh,
the way I don't, I don't think he ever said that was a good thing or anything.
Uh, who would win a silverback gorilla or a werewolf bipedal and quadrupedal variants?
Say the two options one more time.
Silverback gorilla or a werewolf and you get the bipedal or quadrupedal.
A werewolf, a werewolf win every time. Cause it's like, absolutely. A werewolf werewolves are
like supernatural on the like, so they got like a curse, the curse of lycanthropy.
Like they can regenerate pretty quickly depending on what law we're talking about too.
And then obviously in a second it's like hits this gorilla with a bite or scratch that gorilla's
fucked. Yeah. They're supposed to be like super strong and super fast and stuff like that.
Gorillas are no joke. Sure. But mine is a werewolf. Yeah. I'd have to see the sizes, I guess.
Because again, there's a lot of law questions. It was kind of the same with, um,
with the vampire. I don't know them law details. Themes. Nodrotic will know this. The Punisher is
a far more cruel and morally gray character. He wouldn't murder women and children. What's
Daenerys' excuse? Uh. Also I noticed that I've heard it brought up that she was distraught
over the loss of her dragons. Yeah. He never mentioned that. I think he mentioned, um,
the death of Missandei at one point, but, uh, I've never liked that excuse anyway. It's like
people you love die, therefore you start killing innocent people. Like I don't follow.
Uh. But yeah, what's Daenerys' excuse? She doesn't have an excuse. So I shouldn't compare
George to Tolkien, but to Mills and Boon. That's where I have went wrong. Mills and Boon is
Mills and Boon. I don't understand. Uh. Manga, anime, recommendation, skull,
face, book, seller, Honda San. Honda San. Uh. As a retail massive mauler, might really enjoy it and
find the protagonist relatable. Oh, is there gonna be an anime about a, a, a retail person?
I could see myself enjoying it for sure. Ask D&D. Themes are for eighth grade. Oh,
shit. Yeah. Damn, I wish we'd told him about that. So, uh, one of D&D are on records saying
that, uh, themes are for eighth grade book reports. Like disparaging the shit out of themes,
which is again, not something that we would support either. We're, we're certainly not
in the camp that themes suck. Um, but like they don't seem to care or at least maybe they've
changed their position on that. I would have to get like an update, see if someone asks it in
something. But, uh, yeah, interesting comment for sure. Um, it's meant to be Sunday, a day of rest,
but not for me. Oh. Bad realizations with this one. The only good commie is a dead one.
Like we've had that a few times. Rags, have you heard about the Air Force retiring the
eight inch floppy disks they use for the nuclear launch systems? No, I have not heard that.
They, and I guess, I guess, I mean, if, I mean, there's the idea that if it's old and
but it works and it makes sense and it's reliable, I mean, yeah, it might sound silly, but I don't,
I don't know about the, I don't know about if, if there are any super duper benefits to
using floppy drives. I don't know. Maybe there, maybe there's a reason why they kept it so long.
I'm not certain. Yeah, it must be reliable, I guess. Yeah, maybe they're less prone to something
that new technology is. I'm not sure. Can't hack a floppy disk. Is that it? Yeah, it's very possible.
Please never have yes and on again. This, this is amongst the worst commentaries I've heard.
He's awful, ignorant, delusional, pitiful. I don't think it was the worst. I wasn't worst.
The Major Lee one was worse. Do you think that was the worst? I would say that it's,
are we including the not so great debate? Yeah, it's gonna be between them two, I guess.
Yeah, one of those two. This was definitely the best.
But just the best in general? Well, I mean, the best of the three. Oh, out of the three. Yeah.
Yeah, never bring him back. No notification. YouTube sucks. I hear JJ claim Yoda's last name
is la he who lay he someone said in chat, it's harder to install malware on a floppy
and their small storage space means issues are more obvious. That's interesting. Yeah,
assuming that's true. Yeah, that's kind of interesting. And I imagine that like,
because it's older technology, that the ability to like the amount of people who are
good at writing malware for that sort of thing, there's just fewer of them anyway.
Each of these layers. Oh, I said Yeah, there, there was a activity. Yeah,
certainly more of a spectacle. I can understand that argument that was more entertaining.
What the moist floppy massive is happening. That that's one way to put it.
Of course, it's always worse for the women. We didn't actually determine that lack of
satisfaction does not equal feeling bad. Lack of satisfaction is not equal feeling bad.
Not being satisfied would find as a bad feeling, would it not?
I mean, if you're not satisfied, man, it depends on how you feel about neutrality. Yeah, I suppose.
I mean, it's being neutral, good, bad in that sense, or is it its own little thing?
I'm not sure. I don't think that should have thrown me as much as it has.
The love of Christ kick them too obnoxious, kick them.
They wonder if they're referring to maybe the three of us.
From now on, you will refer to chat as the Chad as penance for making,
making us listen to yes, an IRL. You could leave at any time you want.
No one forced you to stay. We did not shackle you, not do the shackles.
We also open with the white walkers and we see how that goes. Prolog is still the first scene.
Yeah, great. It ended six months ago. How are y'all still on about it?
How are you? Why are you talking about Game of Thrones? Terminator Dark Fate is coming out.
I just like the idea that we'll talk about something like Predator.
That came out fucking four years ago. Why are you talking?
You're right. I guess I just get it all. All I feel is pain.
Why does nerd sound like smug Adam ruins kick?
Do you think it sounds anything like Adam's ruined everything?
I don't know. I haven't listened to Adam ruins everything in a long time.
I am the same on that.
Rags held chat at gunpoint. What?
Oh, hero Ragu, the fagoo and others.
Heru, Heru.
I understand raw. I feel like Rufig, this dude.
That's an interesting context. Most people would say Rufi, but it's like, no.
A woofie? A woofie?
Um, I would be terrified of King Bran. He can take control of minds and is looking for the dragon.
Sounds like the beginnings of a tyrant to me.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Let's just let's just hope it all works out, I guess.
Hope.
Sure, it'll be great. I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
Because again, all worked up over nothing.
Would have been awesome to see Bragg walk into the mountain.
Yeah, I'll go for these payoffs if we can't get anything else.
Uh, Bran can't see if Night King can be killed with fire,
because Night King was not killed with fire. He was killed with Valyrian steel.
I mean, just that we've already addressed the whole, like, ability to see it's the future thing is
weird. It would destroy the whole show if he could, like, in any consistent manner.
So of course they just write it, Altismy, and just hope you accept it.
The asshole burgers are strong with this one.
Hey buddy, get off your high horse. No one's buying it.
No, real question.
Yesen, are you in any way connected to the NKVD director Yesov?
Because your torture methods are very effective.
Oh no.
Hey Yesen, what is 30% but also half? I know that reference.
Just woke up and heard a dude say Bran is his favorite character.
Guess this will be one of the most painful debates when I go back later.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello!
How is Wolf doing?
Doing good as far as I'm aware.
Yeah.
Let's get credit to D&D for sticking to Martin's vision.
D&D didn't really want to do all the dreams and magic and stuff for the show.
Yeah, this is the thing.
There's so much complicated shit going on about how much they stuck to his vision.
I'd rather not speculate.
Even I think this guy is a lispy fig.
That came from A.R.
Supposed to be the nice Ra.
Yeah, I saw that as well, Rags.
I was thinking of saving.
I've got a couple.
Just save them all for the meme stream.
Hey Rags, mauler and nerd.
Just a quick question.
What happened when Pinocchio said his nose will grow right now?
It's a paradox.
His head explodes.
It is the only logical conclusion.
I don't know about that.
Yep.
We call it paradoxes because we don't know how they'd resolve.
That's the thing.
His head explodes.
Have you not read the in-law, dude?
Really?
I haven't read the Pinocchio lore.
I was reading up on the Loompa lore.
How much have you got left of that?
You've been reading it for years now.
I will write a paper on the lore.
Write lore about how long the lore is.
I'm trying to stay a couple episodes behind,
so I have something to listen to for my trip to Texas later this week.
I should be watching this one on my way back home from there.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello.
I hope that is going to be an entertaining way back,
Jordan.
I hope this was everything you hoped it would be.
Saw a Joker earlier this evening with my dad and younger brother.
It was as good as you said.
Genuinely masterful performance from Jaquin.
I've actually confused myself on whether or not I'm pronouncing that right anymore.
Jaquin or...
Yeah, tell me how to pronounce it.
I've thought too much about pronouncing it,
now I've forgotten the way to pronounce it.
Do you remember pronouncing it Rags?
What's the correct way?
Pronouncing what?
The Jaquin Phoenix?
Joaquin.
Joaquin.
Joaquin Phoenix.
That's always I've heard.
It's one of those names where if you've never...
Even if you've heard of the name Joaquin and you see it written,
you don't put the two together.
It's a really weird name.
Yeah, I really need to get that into my head
because I'll probably be saying his name a lot,
especially with incoming Joker podcasts.
Joaquin.
But yes, true.
Excellent stuff.
I have nothing to say, so hello Rags.
Hello?
This dude is a tard.
Expensive.
Uh, a small amount for all those hours of entertainment you pried.
I wish I could give more.
Oh, and hi Mauler.
Hi Rags.
Hello?
Get Thor Skywalker as guest.
Balanced, knowledgeable.
Against it.
I think he's actually on the list.
I think people have asked for him before.
It's a big list.
I watched Rags' Fallout 76 video three times last night
and I was never bored.
Oh, I'm glad you weren't bored by it.
I'm always happy to hear that people are squeezing every last bit of enjoyment
because playing that game was not always fun.
Gotta get that three times.
If you can watch something three times without getting bored,
that means it was good.
Four times, obviously you'll get bored.
There's no feeling.
But yeah, three times, that's when you know it's a true good.
It's a genuine good.
A real good.
Use this for some canned dog food, you absolute lads.
Worst crime against humanity.
Pineapple or broccoli?
The worst thing for what?
Worst crime against humanity.
I actually don't hate broccoli, so.
No, I love broccoli.
I have like broccoli is like a snack to me.
I got a bunch of it in my freezer.
I can heat up whenever and I love broccoli.
Broccoli is delicious.
Pineapple by itself is fine, too.
Like, I like them both.
I'm not a fan of pineapple myself.
You know, that's fair enough.
Pineapple is tart, you could say is.
But I like it for that reason.
I will say that broccoli.
I think broccoli goes with a lot more stuff than pineapple.
Broccoli is very complimentary to many delicious food stuffs.
That is the definitive objective answer, and nobody can challenge it.
And if they do, they're wrong.
Lord that out.
John Snow identity equals biggest hate rhino of all time.
The density didn't really matter in that last season, let's be honest.
Let's.
I was psyched to you for Watchmen tonight, Gary.
Kidding.
I want it to be good, though.
Like I said, I'll be interested to see his coverage of it because.
I'm very much an outsider when it comes to Watchmen,
but I saw the movie and have the graphic novel.
I'll be interested.
By the way, I have I have finished.
I will survive the Zootopia comic by Orba.
That's interesting.
How many I don't I don't dislike it.
How many carats would I rate?
I don't know.
I it's better than Game of Thrones.
All right. All right.
What?
Wait, I I'm Ross says never rags.
Never talk about food.
I'm unironically a god to your chef and saying broccoli goes with more than
pineapple is garbage to your ignorance.
No, don't don't don't agree.
I think just say you're a god to your chef back to him.
You could you could have broccoli on the side of anything.
And it works great.
And that's I'm not disparaging pineapple.
I just think that I just think that broccoli is better.
It'll be the great war of a fab broccoli versus pineapple.
I'm on team broccoli.
I'm sorry.
But I guess if you apparently I will survive is a Zootopia comic about Judy Hopps finds
that she is pregnant with Nick Wilde's baby.
And while Nick is very, very happy to hear this, that he will be a father.
He is dismayed to learn that Judy Hopps wants an abortion.
And this comic is basically just about their conversation after she breaks to him that news.
Was it compelling?
I think it's certainly interesting.
I there are deep questions to ask because of it.
Even if it is a Zootopia comic, it's not a poor comic or anything.
Um, but it, um, yeah, I can see why people both hate and like it.
Um, I asked the shad question and that's the point.
He won't get it.
But you should ask him with all seriousness.
It'll be hilarious.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hello.
You know what?
I will.
It's in there.
I hope I remember to ask it seriously.
I will do my best.
We'll see.
Because if we say to shad, will you give homecoming leeway for being in the Disney
fanatical Marvel universe?
How do you think he'd respond to that if I was trying to be serious?
Disney fanatical Star Wars universe.
No Disney fanatical Marvel universe.
So it almost sounds like I'm saying something.
Disney fanatical Marvel universe.
I want to hear that question again.
So if I said to shad, will you give homecoming leeway for being in the Disney fanatical Marvel
universe?
What would he say?
He'd probably be baffled and want clarification about what that even means.
I'm trying to think of like, I wonder what he'd say.
If he's like, how could he interpret that as an actual question?
Or would you just say like, what do you mean by fanatical?
And that's when that's when it's over.
That's when the curtain is up.
That's when I'm I'm dead to rights.
That is when I'm common phrase.
Like I'm just done.
That's where it's at.
So we'll have to see how that goes next time.
I'm referring to all the dildos with YouTube channels.
Never said customers.
Freddie Prinze Jr. on Star Wars critics.
Okay, Bayou and do your thing.
Yeah, the Freddie Prinze Jr. clip where we'll probably see him say that stuff alive at some
point.
I'm going to get the right guess and selection eclipse, if you will.
But next Joker eFap.
Look at the king of Joker driver.
It's the worst Joker take I've seen.
Also, high rags.
Hello.
Toss Yezen off a roof.
Scan me.
I dare you.
I guess we'll have to scan you first before we can trust you.
All right.
Who would you cast as James Bond?
I asked because I think me 207 will be unlikable as much as her attraction.
Henry Cavill would be my first choice.
For who?
James Bond.
Henry Cavill wouldn't make a bad James Bond.
For James Bond.
There's probably plenty.
Let me see.
Obviously, Danny DeVito goes without saying.
And I think if someone told me why so has to get a special man.
And what about Channing Tatum?
Yeah, maybe those three in a singular movie together,
playing the three elements of his personality simultaneously.
Let me see Henry.
Someone say Cavill's me.
Well, Cal was really good as the bad guy in Mission Impossible.
Yeah, I liked him a lot.
Yeah, I thought he's really good.
Kevin Space.
Peter St. Peter Dinklage.
I agree.
Oh, Nathan Fillion.
I would be absolutely down with Nathan Fillion is James Bond.
Yeah, I checked out.
Yeah, he give the super charismatic, you know, kind of side to it.
I love that the clever sort of, you know,
less less the gunfighter, more of the super subterfuge disguises kind of thing.
I would absolutely be down with that.
That'd be great.
Good idea.
Medea.
Absolutely.
Medea would be cool.
Um, hmm.
Joaquin Phoenix.
But only if he's playing the Joker of James Bond.
Joker Bond.
The British actors.
Someone brought up Richard Armitage.
That would not.
Um, maybe, maybe, hmm, maybe.
Michael Fassbender, possibly.
Potentially.
Obama, yeah, yeah.
The Don, of course.
Steve Buscemi, yeah, yeah.
Steve Buscemi, yeah.
Um.
Tom Hardy.
That's possible.
I want to see Norm Macdonald playing James.
Ian McKellen.
Oprah Bond.
Jackie Chan Bond.
Brie Larson Bond.
Okay, now we've gone too far.
That's going over the line now.
Shrek Bond.
That's fine, but Brie Larson Bond.
It was fun.
And then you just had to go in real terrible, terrible, terrible.
Uh, Gary, say baby girl is a naughty girl.
Well, I think it's important that you get that message to him.
I will save it for the next time you.
I've got so many messages.
Someone saying Mark Hamill is Jake Bond.
I mean, why not?
Remember the past.
Bring it to life if you have to.
Oh no.
Episode 9 for you.
So Rex, do you plan on replying to Patricia Taksin,
formerly Eric Taksin's video?
As I've said many times, it is a terrible video that really
isn't worth a response or hurrying to one.
We will probably get around to it, but eventually.
This is the thing.
I don't know if it's going to be possible this year.
Very, very low priority.
I've got like at least four Efaps planned and then a whole bunch of
ones that are like in theory.
And then we've got episode nine coming.
Like I don't know where it's going to fit in.
It's gonna have to wait.
Um, I think the knives out looks pretty good,
but I'm not going to get my hopes up.
Well, trailers are supposed to make things look better, you know.
Yes, we'll see.
Hi, Rags.
Tell us why masquerade is your favorite film.
I thought the actors did an excellent job conveying emotions.
I cried like a baby, but I also laughed at the parts.
I think that it appropriately shifts its tone.
The parts you're supposed to laugh and the parts where
you're supposed to feel very sad.
I think that it does an excellent job conveying,
know the themes of loyalty and staying true to what you think is right.
I think the sets are excellent.
The music really does a good job to accent what's happening in the scenes.
But man, it's just such solid acting from all of the people involved.
And I don't know their names because it's a Korean film.
I don't know the actors.
I'm not familiar with them, but man, I was,
I was super invested in all the characters and all that.
But I, but I would, I adore it.
I need to rewatch it sometime because I just remember watching that and I was sold.
I was so into it.
Hi, Gary.
Did you say hi to Rags for me?
Hi, Moeller.
Hello.
I guess he must have said hi to you at some point.
So I'm going to say the answer to that.
Oh, yes.
Well, just in case.
Hello.
Hi, Wags.
Hello.
I always keep always, always leave him wanting more.
Hi, Gowie.
You guys walk.
You're great too, Moeller.
But pronouncing your R as a W isn't clear in print.
So I left you out of the gag.
Okay.
I accept it.
Thank you very much.
Rags, if you had the money, would you get a suppressor,
short barreled rifle, short barreled shotgun,
a machine gun slash any full auto or all of the above?
Would I have either one of those or all of the above?
I guess, yeah.
Definitely all of the above.
Of course, all of the above.
But because that's obvious, if I could only pick one of those,
it would probably either be a suppressor or a short barreled rifle.
I don't really have any interest in automatic weapons myself.
I'm fine with having razor fist on.
Just don't let him poison the well on Kojima.
I don't know that Kojima's going to come up because...
I don't know if Kojima's really ever come up in our Efabs passing.
But yeah, if razor fist was to come on or if he wants to come on.
I don't know.
I don't even know what the topic would be.
Figure out what he's interested in.
Moeller, Efab Live at Wembley Stadium when?
2020.
When he got a slot.
Oh, it'll be a little the time for now.
But if you freeze yourself, we'll see it faster than most.
Relative to your perspective.
Rags, please sing two more drafts of Iwa Yongwa.
Thing I posted.
All right, let me scroll up.
It's very easy to pick out from the other messages in the Discord.
Iwa Yongwa.
I assume that's how to pronounce it.
Okay.
Iwa Yongwa.
Yeah, see, if you want something a bit more dramatic, it ends on a lower note.
Maybe you want something, I guess, more jubilant.
You could always go with like, Iwa Yongwa.
Yeah, something really, I guess.
I don't know.
I hope that was good.
That's gotta be it.
I feel like it's nailed.
Oh, yeah.
I think that does a good job.
Ganymede, I dare you.
Also, hi, Moeller.
Hello.
Oh, random question for you all.
Date, Rose, Tiko, or Captain Marvel?
Date, Rose, Tiko, or?
Captain Marvel.
Captain Marvel has more power.
You should probably get your stuff.
And Rose Tiko's living in a world where she's about to get blown up
by a huge army of Death Star things.
Well, I think this is, I think that, is this someone like,
if we're in this relationship with them, are they in our world?
Or are we in theirs?
I figured that since they use the character names,
that we'd just be attaching ourselves to them sort of thing.
In that case, Rose Tiko.
What's the rationale exactly?
I get to be in the Star Wars world.
They have all the places I could go to get away from this bullshit.
I mean, the Marvel universe ain't so bad either.
Oh, I guess that's true.
There's the Guardians.
Yeah, I suppose that's true.
Yeah, I don't have to stay on Earth.
I could go anywhere in that universe.
Okay.
Because what's interesting is that we've already have this discussion shift
away from them as people and the worlds that they're attached to.
But if it was just them as characters, who would you pick?
Like to hang out with?
I would pro-
Okay, so my interest with Captain Marvel
is I would like to actually crack it.
I want to convince her that she's actually a piece of shit
by going over everything she's done.
Did Rose Tiko, I mean, probably nice.
I don't think we'd have a lot of similar interests, me and Rose.
Who would you rather have sex with?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Who would you rather have sex with?
Is it like as they are in their respective films?
I would say as they are or in any way that you believe
that you could alter them through a relationship.
A very hard question.
That is a very difficult question.
I would rather have sex with Rose Tiko.
If you're adding the relationship part, it probably would be Rose
because you at least have a chance of having a develop
rather than dealing with a literal god.
Also, I think the actress, if we go in by ages younger,
however, Captain Marvel wouldn't age.
You know, longevity of the relationship, I guess.
Because I think that it's, and again, before Jack gets up in arms
is no doubt they have because of the delay.
This is not like definitely.
This is very much a tenuous decision that I'm making.
I am legit like kind of conflicted on this,
but I think that is what I would go with.
If I had to commit to it, not just threaten it,
but if I had to commit to it, that's what I would do.
That's who I would do.
I think you have a rush there.
It's not an easy question, Chad.
I don't think you can go to person for trying to answer it.
I also think that, these are good super chats by the way,
but I kind of think like they uglified the actress
for the part of Rose Tiko.
Right.
With the outfit and the hair and everything.
Definitely.
A piece of information that's important, Chad.
I cannot deny it.
But I think that they did their damned hardest
to make Brie Larson look as attractive as possible.
Every scene in Captain Marvel.
So I think that does weight it to some degree.
Was this like one fucking you and that's it?
Or is it like dating them fully?
Well, I hate to sound like a super gaming,
but I guess it depends on their personalities and stuff.
Well, the question from the Super Chat was dating.
Yeah, because it's dating.
So that implies over a period of time seeing them regularly.
And from what we see in most of the...
Rose has the superior character.
I think so too, but even when you're dating,
most of the time you spend with them
will not actually be balls deep in that pussy.
So you're going to have to it is a very real thing
that you have to put up with the things that they say and do.
And, you know, and I think Captain Marvel
would just be smug and insufferable.
Imagine that you can't even disagree with her.
She'll zap you.
Not that Rose Tiko doesn't zap people too,
but, you know, at least his is from a device
rather than her innate abilities as a godlike creature.
I think and I would say that Rose Tiko
at least tries to do the right thing
more than Captain Marvel does.
Yeah.
Then again, this is this is really tough.
I can I'll absolutely understand arguments on the other side.
I'm not super invested in my decision,
but I think I can I think that's what I would go with.
This guy's arguments were so mind bogglingly stupid.
She didn't think the people of King's Landing
were innocent because they didn't revolt.
And so she burned innocent children
to free them from slavery.
Yeah, I mean, that ended with I'm agreeing
that she thought they were innocent anyway.
So more.
I can't wait for the 24 hour gedel rags.
I watched that P.F. game with you and Aiden.
And I agree that Jeff was bad writing
because the DM made it to Grimdark.
I agree with Jeff.
Jeff was the unicorn.
Oh, well, they said I agree that Jeff was bad writing.
The DM made it to Grimdark.
Um, I don't.
Jeff made it to Grim.
Does he mean Bill, who was the DM?
I mean, I think I've said I've made the criticism
that when every every fight that you encounter
is some super other plain or other otherly
plain old monstrosity horror eldritch kind of abomination
when they're all like that, it's kind of.
Yeah, it loses its appeal.
It's like if it's like in a video game of every
every item you find is some crazy magical enchanted prophecy
induced enhanced ring of some crazy property.
You know, it loses its grounding, sort of.
But I mean, there was a lot of good aspects to it.
There were some bad ones, but.
Also, high rags.
But anyways, guys, also, I just want to let I finish
the sequel to I Will Survive called Born to Be Alive.
Judy, a year later, Nick Nick leaves Judy and he returns
a year later to talk with her, begging her for forgiveness
that he walked down on her and didn't support her
during her time of need and distress.
And he comes to discover that Judy has taken a lesbian lover,
a vixen, in fact, and he in a fit of moments of rage,
Nick accidentally shoves her and causes her injury.
And it ends with Judy basically dumping Nick,
shoving him out the door.
And the last page, which is the only page in color,
she says she's better now, much better.
And that's where it ends.
So I guess the person who wrote this comic
really didn't like Nick Wilde because he kind of
gets shafted in both of these.
So this is very interesting.
Moeller and rags cannot be a part of the fandom menace.
You're not fanboy enough.
And thank goodness for that.
Well, except Lord of the Rings, sadly.
Also, hi, wags.
Hello.
I think there'd be a time where we consider ourselves fanboys.
But as I've said, the most valuable love
is love that is conditional.
And Star Wars turned into something poopy.
And therefore, I lost my adoration for it.
Please don't step on Snack.
Then God step on Snack.
Sad.
Right, then.
I think it's about the mile horse.
Oh, right.
Gia Moeller, the other day I was grouchy about having to work
another several 12-hour shifts all weekend.
And this woman told me I should smile.
I never felt so threatened and unsafe in my own work environment.
What should I do?
Prior reporter to the authorities.
Yeah.
Does she have a motorbike or any kind of vehicle?
Find a way.
Think about all the other people that she said you should smile.
Yeah.
And then you have the ability to electrocute people with your bare hands.
I need to know these things before I can advise you on what's next.
But there's a way called-
Technically, yes.
With static electricity.
True.
There is this movie called Captain Marvel.
It has a how-to guide on dealing with these people.
You'll find it in these special features, deleted scenes.
Hopefully.
Just give that a gander.
And-
If Jay watches Lord of the Rings and you confirm it,
will he finally be made a host or at least a permanent recurring guest?
Jay objectively makes the best-
Watching Lord of the Rings is what you need to do to be consistent on this podcast.
Like that's-
So once he gets that-
He thinks Spaceballs is boring though.
Yeah, he's kind of-
Gonna have to make up for it a lot.
It's not just watching Lord of the Rings at this point.
It's gonna be a lot of things.
Yeah.
Can pull all those off.
Maybe he can-
Hi Rags.
Hey!
And Mauler.
Oh.
Hero High should become a guest.
I don't know who that is.
I don't either.
This guy's logic was so bad.
I volunteered for Ra to throw me off a roof.
Also, hi, Wags.
Hello.
You'll be happy to know I've been breaking down the past eFabs into individual audio clips
for meme dialogue to minimize requests for voice clips in future.
God.
Oh.
Wow.
Sounds extensive.
That is a lofty task.
All viruses are immune to antibiotics.
All right.
Okay.
Learn that.
I didn't know that.
I think Joker's third act from Dancing Down the Stairs onward
would have been better if cut down.
Felt like it dragged and really took me out of the movie.
Really?
I didn't feel that.
I kind of-
I was very much going over every bit of it because he felt like a character
who was finally able to do whatever he wanted
and the juxtaposition of how happy he was,
computer how sad I was.
I was able to revel in it for a little bit with him.
He's having fun.
It's been so horrible up to this point and then the police thing happens,
which is a nice sort of slide right back into reality hit you in the face.
Then you pretty much get to the show.
So I don't know.
It seemed to work for me.
I'd have to-
Yeah.
Rags.
I know the dictionary is bad sometimes,
but the definition of obfuscate is misleading and-
Is that one more time?
Rags.
I know the dictionary is bad sometimes,
but the definition of obfuscate is misleading and confusing.
That's fair enough.
I have a super chat.
I give it a high five.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sexual harassment.
And someone's just super chat that alone.
Buller and rags.
What do you think of Creepshow?
Never saw it.
I don't know what that is.
Dary.
Danny went dragon postal.
That's an understatement.
Thoughts on Jay getting kicked around on Facebook?
Oh, right.
Do you know about-
Yeah, there's no reason why you would know about this, Rags.
So Jay was a part of a Facebook group that was apparently created
in aid of basically being like talking about TLJ without being a dick or Star Wars.
Okay.
So like just kind of about it.
Nobody gets angry, no one throws insults, everything's fine.
And then one gradually they've been getting more and more aggressive
toward anybody who dislikes the film.
And then it was like this post that was like,
you're an asshole who thinks the film is good.
You're shit, Laura.
And then apparently they called them out for it.
Like this is really not what this place is meant for.
And then he got a response from someone saying,
if you think that, you don't really, you could really be here.
And then I think he got booted is what he said.
Yeah.
That, oh, okay.
That reverse toxic fandom.
That's kind of what we would be getting at.
Like they're, they're obviously going to be, um,
wow, geez, opposites to these scenarios.
The people who are like overly obsessed with how good a thing is.
Because you see, you see it all the time, right?
Like the straw man, all you have to be like,
oh, these people think that themes don't exist.
These people think that visuals aren't important to a visual media.
Like, who are you talking about?
Where are these quotes coming from?
Yeah.
What are you?
You're just pulling this out of some imagined version of me
that you've completely fabricated in your head.
If you search rags on YouTube rags,
the worst YouTuber by Patricia tax is the fourth result.
What are your thoughts on it?
Also.
Hi, rags.
Hello, uh, terrible video.
Not worthy of our time.
Really.
We might get around to it later.
Low priority.
Oh, look.
YouTube.
It is currently the fourth result,
but, uh, I doubt that'll last that much longer.
Nah, I don't think so.
Um, rooftops are cool, but defenestration is cooler.
Um.
Uh, the act of throwing someone out a window.
There's a word for that.
All right.
Well, I can, I can see the reasoning with the loud crash
and the linear glass everywhere.
Certainly more spectacular.
I don't know how taxing can think he's a woman
because calling rags an intellectual coward
when he won't even talk to you guys takes actual pulse.
Well, he was willing to talk as long as rags wasn't here.
That's the thing.
He wouldn't come on if I was there.
And as we saw today, I'm super unreasonable.
I wouldn't say that I'd say you hide your bigotry,
but that's it.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You have to, you have to listen in between the lines.
Very, you're a very bigoted, biggest double bag.
I'm a bike oat.
Uh, the treachery of the long knives was correct.
I'm not sure how to react.
It made me think of the night of the long night.
Oh, I don't, I guess it's a Game of Thrones thing.
And I don't, I don't know.
I have that one.
Hey, more or any computer gear you guys recommend?
Computer gear.
I've had good luck with Audio Technica headsets.
I think Logitech makes really good keyboards and mice,
especially the G600, which is the mouse that I use,
the one that I will always recommend.
Looking for gear, a G-Sync monitors are extremely nice.
What microphone do you use?
I use an AT 2020 USB plus.
That's literally the microphone like fucking everybody has now.
Like you have it.
I have it.
It's really good.
Yeah.
It's here.
Has it, Fringy has it, Wolf has it.
It's 120 bucks.
So good.
It's like the top of the line consumer grade that doesn't,
you know, go into it.
It's like the top of the line consumer grade that doesn't,
you know, go into it.
It's like the top of the line consumer grade that doesn't,
you know, go into a tier of money.
That's kind of ridiculous.
Like, oh, yeah.
The next one up is the,
I think there's a podcast, a microphone, I think, H3.
I mean, I'm, I'm not opposed to the idea of upgrading this
one to get something better, but this one is really good.
And I've been very pleased with it.
Yeah.
As for like, I guess, computer gear that's more specific than
like peripherals.
It's just going to, you know, you know how it works.
It's like good value performance for money.
It changes every year pretty much depending on what
around who's releasing what.
Yeah.
I wouldn't be the best person to ask for up to date information,
but plenty of websites probably have good recommendation.
The chat glitch slipped by last leaf app.
So asking here, what was your favorite instance of Arthur's laugh?
He's got so many.
My favorite was the laugh that picks up in the background
during the penny flashback flash back.
Mine was probably the one where he's laughing out of sync jokes
in the comedy club.
Gives me a big sense of just how much he's struggling to get it.
I liked his laugh after he got fired and he was leaving
that cuts off really quick because I thought the whole punch
out thing was actually fun.
There you go.
I was actually kind of laughing along because that was the legit
funny thing that he said.
If you could make one Star Wars movie, one Marvel movie,
and one DC movie, what would they be about and why?
Holy shit.
That's for me, add you, I guess.
That's like six different ads.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hello.
The one Star Wars movie would probably be,
assuming I can scrap the trilogy.
Give me one movie to try and crush a big story
about some of the things that happened after,
or maybe just do something distant
in another part of the world, have some fun.
The Marvel one, I kind of always wanted a movie between
Infinity War and Civil War, going over what Earth was like
for however many years, if it's one or two,
where you had a team that was government-oriented
and sent out versus a vigilante team
and how Cap and Iron Man made the dynamic of finding that.
I wanted to see what was going on with that.
That was for a DC movie.
Like, I'm really okay with anything good.
I don't really have a preference for DC.
What about you, Rags?
What about me?
What was the question again?
If you could make one Star Wars movie, Marvel movie, a DC movie,
what would they be about and why?
Do they have to be in addition to what we already have or?
You can make your own rules with this one.
I'd probably, I'd rather make a,
I think I'd make a Star Wars movie over in the other ones.
And it would be between, it would probably be about some,
it'd probably be concerning the political strife of reforming,
essentially, a galactic government after the Empire
has been substantially weakened and all the interesting stuff
that happened as a result of that,
all the conflicts that might occur.
Because when you talk about the scale of this sort of thing happening,
there's obviously going to be problems that arise from,
all right, we have, I mean,
it's a good thing that we did in this case,
but we did create a power vacuum.
We need to fill it efficiently and quickly.
And it's not going to go over well with everybody.
So, you know, it would be very Star Trekky
in terms of negotiations and things like that.
And there would be, you know,
potentially renegade groups that go against whatever,
but that's, that would be something that I would probably
the most interested in creating of those three.
What's your opinion on the Harry Potter movies?
Don't really have many strong perspectives on those.
I watched them all at least once.
I thought they were neat.
Yeah, they were fine, I guess, but they probably weren't.
Yeah, I've not really given a critical eye to them.
Yeah, I never really cared for them.
My Unsolid Sunday.
Nerd Row Big Boy 2019.
Unsolid Sunday.
Is that referencing?
My Sunday?
My Solid Sunday.
Sundays aren't solid.
They're like, they're sock wids.
There'll be some kind of reference we're missing.
Maybe.
I guess I just don't get it.
Um, Molly, you're a damn cool dude.
Thank you.
Rags as a babe.
Yeah, boy.
Uh, Gary is freaking awesome too.
Reminder that Island of Dr. Moreau from 1996
might be right up your alley.
It's an entertainingly bad movie.
I've heard about it.
Yeah, I was going to say, I think it's been suggested before.
Possibly by the same.
Oh my.
Tolkien would rape Martin and love it, Wolf.
Oh, wow.
Did mention that it was funny.
Uh, defenestration for Danny.
I don't know.
I mean, she's dead already.
So thrown out her windows.
I mean, do it funny because she'd be all limp and there.
Game of Thrones needed more foreboding with the events
leading up to the Night King and Daenerys.
Like a sense of inevitability to Night King victory
and Daenerys's fall.
Both were like proof that happened.
Oh, both were like poof that happened.
Yeah, I got it.
Um, yeah, for everything.
Honestly, just for everything.
Everything needed more time.
It was too rushed.
It's like, it's like Batwoman.
Things are so rushed.
You have no time to get investment in a lot of the events and characters.
China should be reduced to hand borders.
Don't understand.
I don't know what those are, but I like the idea of reduced.
Finally watched the Screw Steam stream on Wags' channel.
Why is Jim Sterling so fat and stupid?
I mean, well, because he probably doesn't have good diet
and he doesn't exercise is the answer to the first one.
He's not stupid.
He's just he's got blind spots.
I think he attributes things to other things that I don't think
his logic necessarily follows a lot of the time.
D&D rolled natural one when making season eight and nine out of Game of Thrones.
Re-roll, re-roll.
Have any of you considered posting on Bitchute?
It's a new creator focused video hosting platform designed to give YouTube some competition.
Yeah, I thought about it, certainly.
Yeah, it'll definitely be the backup if things go awry on YouTube.
If the choice is watching you go through every Super Chat since eFap 1
or listening to that massive you had on this eFap again,
I vote 42 hours of...
Maybe we can make the topic interesting.
I don't know.
It'll be a way to make something.
I'll do it.
That'll be fine.
That'll be great.
Sorry, not nine bad type or maybe not, but it was so bad I couldn't exist.
I think he meant resist, but yes.
Resist.
An eFap?
Excellent.
This is just what I need right now.
Been feeling down in the dumps lately.
Someone snuck onto our farm and killed Aurra Enw...
Oh, your nice corn?
Yes, all of the nice corn was ruined.
Not the nice corn.
I mean, the bad corn is still there.
They didn't do anything with the bad corn.
No, they left the bad corn and they cut down the nice corn.
Rags refuse to answer my question.
He is paid off by evils.
I ask all of the eFaps, how does owl swim through tree?
Not how owl fly.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello.
Isn't it pretty obvious?
Put one wing forward and squish past all the leaves,
pulling you forward a little bit on little twigs.
With the other arm slash wing and rinse and repeat.
Swimming through a tree, nailed it.
Crack open a cold eF with the boys for Game of Thrones.
Sans is in smash.
Love you fellas.
Have a good night.
Hope I'm not too annoying.
Free honk conk.
Free honk conk.
That pisses profile Dave is the reasonable extremist.
That's fair enough.
Just woke up, passed out.
From what chat's telling me about the guy,
it was probably good for my blood pressure.
Off my ass off at Coppola joining Scorsese
and dabbing on balding Twitter soy guzzlers like him.
Dab.
Mola, are the Welsh even white?
Yeah, mostly.
I mean, I think that would be my assumption
from what I see around these parts,
but you get all kinds of colors down here too.
Every color under the wonderful rainbow,
including purple.
People like Thanos are welcome here.
We're not going to bear.
I just wanted to have one of those gauntlets.
Mola, are you finished with game criticism?
I don't know.
I mean, if ever there's a reason for it to come up on eFap,
I'll obviously do it.
And I would like to make more game criticism videos one day.
It's just other things are sort of a priority
and it takes me a while to get any video done
because I want to go there covered to the newest standards
I'm sort of getting to.
But I have been doing redrafting for part three of TFA.
I just don't know that I'll be able to start editing that one
rather than working on a dark fate video
because I'll be seeing that very soon.
Hey Rags, you requested additional information
regarding the question I sent last eFap to clarify.
The critiques that your peen and or butthole would give you
are completely objective and unbiased.
All right.
I instantly know what you're talking about.
For those of you who are not aware,
it was asked of us, would we rather have a penis
that is constantly critiquing, offering critique
on our lovemaking, or our anus would constantly
offer us critique about us every time we critique something.
I chose the but tentatively because of lack of some clarification.
I will say, can other people hear this voice?
If so, then it will be the butthole.
If other people cannot hear the voice, then I'll go with the penis.
If it's because if I have someone giving objective information
on how to better fuck someone that I can instantly apply
into giving someone else a better time and enjoying myself more,
I'll take that.
Yeah, that's good.
Anyway, yeah, that's actually like excellent.
That'd be great.
But if I also someone offering me criticism,
it's probably definitely not going to be something
that takes me out of the moment too much.
I'm still going to be having the time of my life.
But if it is something that other people can hear,
I wouldn't want it to be the penis because I don't want
the other one other person there having my penis speak to me
while we're going at it.
So I would go with my butthole.
I would say they're saying only you can hear it.
Then in that case, I would rather have my penis offer criticism
during the lovemaking.
So when I'm doing the horizontal hokey pokey,
I want to know how to do it the best way possible.
Always looking to improve my game.
And if there's any more clarifications,
sunrise will alter his answer.
But that does seem to be pretty extensive.
There you go.
Hi.
I clean my carpets.
Hello, wags.
Also that guy.
Hello.
Oh, this last week, wags.
Did Murray deserve it?
Murray, the guy on the talk show?
No.
Glad you said.
Wait, there are people who say that Murray deserved to be killed.
I wonder what Ra would say.
Ra would say Ra would ask if he's gay or not.
But, I mean, you know that some people have some crazy tismy takes on Joker.
I bet there are people out there who are like, yeah, Murray deserved to die.
Because he was part of a class, allegedly, or something, whatever.
But no, obviously, Murray didn't deserve to be killed.
Hi, rags.
Hello.
Hi, mauler.
Hello, mauler.
If you ever have time, you should check Vinland Saga.
It's an anime such manga.
It has a character that is basically Welsh Tywin.
Can't go wrong with that combo.
Coppola and Scorsese eating these capish babies is great.
Oh, capeshit babies is great.
James Gunn crying and posting Tumblr notes lol.
Off my ass off, go film Captain Boomerang's scenes with Polka Dot Man, you loser kid diddler.
I mean, you did make Guardians 1 and 2.
Those are pretty awesome films.
And he didn't diddle any kids as far as I know.
Yeah, it was it was some weird stuff with going to, like, was it
even like really, yeah, really weirdly themed parties.
But that's completely different than the act itself.
I mean, that, yeah, not even on the same plane, the thought and the action,
there's all we've always we've always got to make sure to draw a distinction between those two.
But I would agree.
It's just like, what was there a theme?
It's just like a what?
Um, I mean, yeah, he got fired and reinstated.
And as for Coppola and Scorsese coming after capishit films, like, good for them.
They make films that are just better than everyone else's apparently.
Or at least Marvel.
Fine, authorities on film can't possibly not take their word 100% seriously.
Hey, rags.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I like I like completely actually phased out for a moment.
So can you say that one more time?
I'm sorry.
I said, Hey, rags.
Oh, hi.
Hey there.
Your quality video a plus plus.
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm glad you liked it.
Also.
Hi, mauler.
Hello.
Have you watched the videos of the XR guys getting yanked off the top of the trains the other day?
I'll offer a solid 20 minutes watching it.
The XR.
I have no idea what that's referencing.
Yeah, I don't know if that's referring to XR.
Hi, rags and mauler.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi there.
Favorite black and white films.
Um, I hate to be narrow on this one, but probably 12 angry men and citizen Kane.
And I don't I can't remember too many that I've seen off the top of my head.
I go.
I can't remember many that I've had.
I don't know.
I'm going to have to withhold judgment for the moment.
Have you seen judge dread 1995 and or dredge the dread 2012?
What do you think of them?
If so, hi rags.
I really like dread 2012.
Have you seen the Stallone dread film?
I have not.
I've heard it's Mimi.
We should that that could work for DFAT movies actually.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it's it's I remember being funny.
But yeah, the newer dread was was so much different, like night and day.
Someone saying birth of a nation.
I've totally forgot that one.
Oh, for black and white.
I I'm always I'm always a sucker for a happy ending, you know.
I've put broccoli in spaghetti bolognese.
Is this is the person we can trust right?
I mean, I that doesn't seem like it'd be bad.
I mean, I don't see why broccoli and pasta wouldn't go together.
Like seems reasonable to me.
I don't think that's unreasonable.
Yeah, I think that's that's not unreasonable.
Beating a dead horse is bad unless it is undead.
I agree.
That's fair enough.
Well, beating a dead horse isn't bad if it's just a dead horse.
You're just applying pressure to dead flesh.
True rags.
Have you read the sequel?
Oh, wait.
Yeah, so you did.
I did.
More like lame of thrones.
Am I right?
Absolutely.
Freaking aim of thrones.
Wait, did my super chat call out to Susan when the stream went down?
Not go through shame.
Oh, sorry.
We should introduce Eric Attackson to Ra's roof.
Seems like everybody's going to Ra's roof.
A lot of people have huge queue.
Who would win Bobby Hill or Bart Simpson?
Oh, Bart Simpson easily.
Have you seen Bart Simpson?
Yeah, I feel like Bart Simpson's got the bloodlust in him.
And he can tank so much.
Like he gets strangled regularly in a very vicious manner to survive it.
I'm thinking that plus all of his ingenuity, Bobby's going down.
How would you feel if Spider-Man had a crush on Captain Marvel in the MCU?
I read a rumor about that the other day and felt sick.
Hashtag praise the dawn.
Well, clearly they're doing something with him and MJ, right?
So that would be weird if he had a crush on Captain Marvel.
I have to see what they do.
I hope not.
What's there to like?
Like what's, what's there to like?
What about Captain Marvel or the MCU?
No, about Captain Marvel.
No, like actually tell me what's there to like.
That is the job of the sequel now to create something like that.
To create something likable about her.
That's the challenge.
That's why I'm kind of interested to see what they are doing.
Suppose we'll just have to find out.
Do more Efap Jackbox.
I love that we can interact.
We're not against that, yeah.
I do want to play that game again.
I want to see if it's like, I'll test out a few more things.
Maybe try reduce the players down or something.
I don't know what it is.
Yeah.
I enjoyed the game.
I thought the game was fun as well.
It's fun, but I do feel like it's really heavily weighted to the trait,
not the traitors, the aliens.
I agree with that.
Unless in the unlikely event that we got really unlucky four times in a row
with the bioscanner and its communication.
In that maybe aliens get and get screwed over really easily.
But I would assume it is just biased towards.
Your thoughts on the last samurai.
My favorite.
Hi Rags.
I really like it.
Hello.
I don't know what to say about accuracy.
I'm sure somebody probably has a breakdown somewhere on YouTube,
but I remember really enjoying it.
Yeah.
A Stonewall shad.
Keep asking him until he gives up.
Stonewalls.
Not sure what to make of that.
Stonewall shad.
Keep asking him.
Hmm.
I'm not sure.
Hey Mola.
Tom Lenka's James Bond.
Just saying it would finish Andrew's arc.
Oh man.
I'd have to see some tests.
I don't know if he could pull off being James Bond from everything I've seen of him.
Also.
Hey Rags.
Come play in my 40k show time.
Come play in my 40k show sometime.
Who's that?
No, I'm actually.
I'm actually prepping another thing to replace Tails.
So we will.
I might not have the time.
Then again with however all the times we get delayed doing Nazi vampires.
Of course Palpy was alive this whole time and building star destroyers this whole time.
Duh.
It was foreshadowed.
Final trailer tomorrow.
Get ready.
Oh my god Rags.
We got a Star Wars trailer on Batwoman.
We do.
We're so blessed with such amazing content so regularly.
Mola.
When are we getting eFap merch?
A shirt full of tismy references and general massivity is required.
Again, we want to.
It would be great.
Looking into it I swear.
More things.
Time discussion things happen.
But even I would like an eFap shirt.
I wouldn't mind that at all.
Oh same same.
Write down with it.
Everybody listen to Numa and Tempest off of Tool's new album.
You won't regret it.
Especially if you're a real long man because they're 12 plus minutes.
Rags I had no idea you love China.
A-Y-Jong-Wah.
That means.
Yeah I figured that meant something tismy.
So when is Sinatra Sayers coming on?
Don't know who that is.
He's a YouTuber.
He wouldn't be a bad guest.
Today's guest made me want to find a room full of younglings or a village of sand people.
I see through the lies of the ha ha hee hee poo poo master Yoda.
See through the lies of the ha ha hee poo poo.
Now that's a Jedi master.
Who sent the chat about Joker's last act not being perfect?
I want a name now.
Was that somebody's super chat?
I can't remember.
Joker's last act.
Oh he said he went low.
He said it wasn't paced well.
Right well I I'm gonna go ahead and not give the name Ra just because your rooftop you know.
There's enough people on it for now.
We don't need it.
We don't need more.
It's fine.
It'll be either a sad or scary day when Ra doesn't have a roof high enough to yeet someone off.
I don't know what it'll mean.
Don't know what it'll mean to the culture of Ephraim.
Why live?
Why go through this charade?
Hi Rags.
Hello.
I just looked at that taxan vid and felt the need to donate to you.
It's just so bad.
Oh thanks.
All right um it is pretty bad.
Uh I don't know how it ranks.
We still need to do that um big extreme thing.
I think I've actually got the link for it now where we can rank like
the content creators we've covered so that'll be fun but uh.
Whoa.
Yeah uh Nick I can't believe I'm gonna be a father.
Judy.
Yeetus the fetus.
Oh.
Yeetus the fetus.
Now apparently no in this I pick this up from the comic.
No rabbit has ever had an abortion before.
She's the first rabbit to have an abortion.
Yeah.
Morla tell Wolf we miss him also tell him to embrace the prequels Halo 4 and Nickelback.
Of course I will make sure he's.
By the way does the idea that Hitler is the worst human being where does
the idea that Hitler is the worst human being come from Stalin was way way worse
and all you ever hear about are Nazis and Hitler.
Um I think it's the whole Holocaust aspect of it.
Yeah.
You know how bad the camps were themselves and I mean a lot of it is optics I think.
I mean obviously they're both very terrible but I think Hitler's story it tugs on the
heartstrings a little bit more because it's attached directly to like a world
war and invading countries and Jenna you know all that all that nasty terrible stuff.
Uh these are the I was once throw this lispy queer from a root is lispy queer
the thing from um even Crowder stuff with uh Carlos Maza lispy queer things.
Yeah that was the one yeah.
Uh yeah the context is him being fucked fucking branded you asshole oh yeah talking about the um
PSA sit shit his opinion about Joker on a livestream a few months ago
a few months ago what he said the story was cliche obvious and shallow the writing.
I'll read all of that really well he's wrong very wrong we we will uh
uh maybe maybe we'll talk to him he said a few oh sorry a livestream a few moments ago not a few
months ago oh yeah he's wrong on that one oh well can't win them all you know the hate mongers of
the toxic brood are Russian assets using objective film criticism to sow disunity and division into
American society Hillary Quinton uh take these here dollar redos favorite sub genre of metal
also high wags hello favorite sub genre of mill um I'm not sure I'm I'm not like huge into metal
I like I like a lot of quick and speedy stuff
for me is symphonic metal I love what would that be like so like metal combining with like a
symphony filled with all kinds of instruments I guess yeah oh yeah yeah I'm big into that um
I really like electric light orchestra they did a lot of stuff like that
uh trying to see if I can get
um
do an efap on the ih everything job podcast also you haven't seen uh well I can't do a podcast
on a podcast that would take forever I only ever do like snippets and the last thing we want is
to watch someone for like 10 minutes as a section well we just don't say anything because nothing

rags when you walk outside and stub your toe on a box containing an mg 42 do you keep it for
yourself take to a museum or do you check the bushes to make sure there isn't an atf agent
hiding in them I'd obviously check the bushes um there the legal complexity of what happens
if you find a machine gun is raises many questions um uh that would depend I I will tell you I'm not
sure what I would do but I I will say that I would be extremely tempted to just not report it
I would be like I would be very tempted to just not report it
yeah I'd probably just walk away I'd be like oh god a god in britain we uh we get spooked by
simple spoons so imagine error um I'm sitting in my green room in youtube studios when susan and
her assistant walk in me susan patricia hey it's mrs watch kiki susan oh patty that's fine

all of it is from understand I like my women how I like my wine seven years old and locked in my
cellar all right excellent choice rags I choose the peen as well also good work hunting down that
info about morning stars that was my other chat from the efap thanks yeah it's I think it was an
interesting question I think a lot of people think they know the answer but they don't so it was good
to kind of get clarification on that uh fell asleep midstream missed your response in regards to skull
faced bookseller Honda san please repeat um just your response in regards to skull faced bookseller
Honda san does that sound familiar to you at all in any way hmm skull faced bookseller Honda san
skull faced bookseller Honda san yeah I have no idea what that's referring to
is it an anime again I always assume it's an anime I have I have no idea what does chat say
I have no idea anime about a bookseller and yes
poison anime bra on efap every roof a toss or e-rat poetry makes sense but is it about good rat
or just rat in general for the for the memeroonies mauler are you on your way rags to where to what
thank you you wonderfully and beautifully twisted souls of men
all right then and yes glad to provide such introspective um hell wolf the kingdom of heaven
is trash hi rags hello um I haven't seen kingdom of heaven in a long time I'd like to watch it
again yeah I think I think wolf is very pro-kingdom I haven't seen in ages so I can't really say oh
it's been it has been a long time I remember liking it but that was years ago years
uh spider-man dumps mj for captain marvel racism we'll have to see who bloody knows
watch killer bean forever for efap movie would you rather have sex with mj or um
um captain marvel is mj of legal age I was about to say I'm assuming she is in real life I don't
know if she's in the film though I in real life then well okay assuming the character was of age
um I mean the I don't know I just don't want to fuck captain marvel
but what if there's a bag on your head though
she still ain't got no ass yeah but you don't even you don't look look don't look keep your
eyes away looking's looking's half of the battle but look at looking is like it's a big part of it
you ain't gonna close your eyes well if there's a bag on the bag on your head there you go you
don't have to close your eyes you just can't see there's back on my head
uh example of undead horse to beat tlj is a good film arguments they never seem to die
kill it already we've still got like four huge videos about how tlj is still good to go through
we haven't managed to make it through this year of efap we have disappointed the audio
don't worry give us a few more years and we'll get there uh taxon is completely self unaware
she complains about rags not giving a fair interpretation of the resonance argument
arguments whether or not that's true that's what she's doing to rags
yeah I think that's applicable now when are you going to get pewds on
i don't know if like why would we have pewdiepie pewdie are you kidding
kind of low low low fry low fish small fish in a big pond you know i'd rather get guests that like
have an audience yeah i suppose that's fair enough like oh yeah i guess he has some interesting
opinions but it's like it's really about the viewers about what you can bring
this pewdiepie guy doesn't he just like let's play minecraft
thing you could do on youtube pewdiepie please come on efap
did you guys ever address some of the comments on that ih everything podcast video i don't think
we did i don't know if we did i didn't know if i didn't know if there was anything of interest
there really but still we we got the the main thing addressed i suppose uh you guys miss me yet
from the night king i'd say yes i missed the night king everything was better with you
uh skull face bookseller honda sun is a manga slash anime i recommend as a retail massive i think
maul would enjoy i figured because the name made no sense it was probably a i guess the book seller
part is where you go ah retail of course um rags would you rather fuck a male death claw or captain
marvel a male death claw i was gonna say that's pretty easy i'm surprised they made that so easy
you're doing like all these difficult ones and you just throw in the male death claws
all right male death claw that brings us to the end holy manulium how long was that anyway seven
hours see and to really that felt like ah nice a normal sized episode that's a little long for me
i feel like the the i feel like the uh debate dragged on a little bit a little bit yeah i'll
give you that i i i'm usually not so encouraged to want a debate to end i just didn't feel like
it was really progressing that which is a very common reason for a person to want a debate to end
um still glad we had it we got to experience what it was like to speak to somebody who
really did like season eight which i thought they were fantasy people but they exist and have
arguments um so that yeah that pretty much leaves me with saying um thank you all very much for the
kind donations uh there's loads of memes and i think next week we're going to be doing a joker
stream again played joker um plenty of fun to be had with that one um i'm not sure how we're going
to do this this meme stream thing if it's going to be like on a sunday or if we'll try and double
it up oh yeah um if i know ahead of time it'll be fine as long as i know ahead of time because
we're gonna have a lot of shit to go but so yeah i thought that's bad just a lot of stuff to go i
know there's a lot of people out there who like i've done fan art i've done meme videos i've done
these like i've got a shit ton goals is probably collected and if it isn't shown on this meme
stream then just try me on the next stream or the next episode it depends on how fast they're
compiled i'm looking at them now and she's like holy fuck like i've got this enormous list of
fucking links oh it'll be fun um this brings us to the end that's what you think uh if you want to
prove benny off as an awful person a lazy narcissistic man child with evidence the
dragon demands there's a lot of content that you can use i'm not too i wasn't too hell bent on that
because i don't think i've ever said they're bad people or anything that was actually one of the
first things he said when he came into the call he was like annoyed the people saying they're like
bad people i've never heard that and if it is we're definitely we're obviously not here to defend
the morality of their writing yeah like i don't think they're bad people the fucking up the right
end i would rather attribute it to a mistake laziness like they fucked up or they were
apathetic that sort of thing instead of being i don't assume they were malicious i don't assume
they wanted to upset everybody oh yeah i don't think so i think that they probably thought what
they were doing was good and that's part of the problem uh get mumkey jones metica as guest
yeah i don't i don't i don't i would love to have mumkey on could be interesting some i don't know
what mumkey's up to these days but um i don't know i hope he's doing well though this is a tragedy
what happened to him what really gets the neg in jargon with joker is that no one brought up all
those sport teams using rock and roll part two after gary glitter's arrest
so one more time what really gets the noggin jargon with joker is that no one brought up
all those sport teams using rock and roll part two after gary glitter's arrest
I heard something relating to that, but I mean, what's your ability to separate, I guess,
something an artist does from the quality of the song that's used?
Because, like, if someone writes an amazing song, can nobody use that song because of
what someone else did regarding it, or?
Is seen, I guess.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I know the song.
Yeah.
Um, I meant for a meme.
Could you say, are you on your way and have rags reply to where to what?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
So.
Oh, okay.
Go.
You on your way?
To where?
All right, there we go.
And finally, uh, what's wrong with me, Metika, my long man?
Why no answer?
I'm guessing they're asking what's wrong with Metika.
I don't necessarily have anything wrong with Metika going on.
I seriously don't.
Metika would want to come on Efap, but if he did, I'm up for it.
I'm pretty much up for anybody coming on, honestly.
Yeah.
Everyone gets to come on.
Winton.
Winton, please come on Efap.
Explain yourself.
Explain everything.
It could help.
Um, but yeah, all right.
So we'll see you folks next week for probably talking about Joker with who knows what guests.
I'm not actually sure of it right now, but I hope you had some fun.
And this will be up on Moolah soon enough with a possible trailer reaction for Star Wars
and an episode of Batwoman being super, super cut.
So yeah, it's plenty to come.
Thanks for watching and good night.
Layer White on Efap.
That's that's a possibility too.
Not against any guests.
And haha.
I caught it before the stream ended.
Efap done watching Joker again right now.
Life is good.
Excellent.
Raw.
There you go.
Both of them done.
Okay.
Actually.
Good night now.
Yeah, man.
I'm glad.
Watch Joker.
It's great.
Yes.
