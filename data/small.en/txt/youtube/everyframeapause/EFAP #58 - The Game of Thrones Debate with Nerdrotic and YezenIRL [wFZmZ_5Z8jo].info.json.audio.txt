no no
down
and
that you carried on watching more of a few in a row
half I have,
how far are you
about halfway through a season five I had to stop for a while so Mrs. Jordan could catch up,
Mrs. Nerotic could catch up
yes and Mrs. Nerotic is
episode you know the one
I'm not allowed to watch Buffy without her from now on it's kind of a thing so
got to do what the boss says once in a while
haven't gotten the title right I knew I was going to forget something
give me one moment don't panic chat
you're all going to panic
oh
fifty eight
the
let's come up with a good title what do you reckon everybody
should we call it was season eight of Game of Thrones
bad question mark or good or
there goes something better than that come on you're all weirdsmiths do it
the battle for season eight
no that's lame
what about the Game of Thrones debate
yeah
the season eight debate
I mean a few Game of Thrones
trial by combat
there we go
I'll take that I'll take any of these
I'm putting it in and
as long as people love it we'll keep it
trial by combat
but with
what what name would you like in the title
yes and IRL is fine
very well
Nerotic
there we go that'll update
and hopefully you know it won't say efap gaming anymore
sorry about that everybody
oh well
I'll do anything right for this
it's all a game
it's all a game that we play
all change is saved excellent now
the
yes
we should probably talk about a few things before we do any kind of intro let people
sort of
blow in a little bit
how about that
that thing that came out recently
does anything come out recently? Batwoman was bad
actually I was going to say
I couldn't imagine watching Batwoman
no are you sexist?
maybe
but I just couldn't
I couldn't imagine
like I watched a few episodes
I watched a season of The Flash years back
for funsies
and that was all I could really do
of like CW
superhero stuff
what is the best show on CW
or is it Arrow?
the 100
the 100 is amazing
oh wait wait I mean
I mean out of the Arrowverse ones
all of the hero ones
I know
The Flash and Arrow
are probably the two most likely of it
yeah the first two seasons
of both of those were pretty good
season one of Arrow is very good
TW show
yeah fair enough
I was going to say
quick update about eFap movies
again because I know that
people are still like where's the Doom video
this is simultaneously
a promotion of a thing
and information at the same time so
those who want to see the eFap
movies Doom you can actually
watch it on eFap.me
the website held by Kiba Kins
oh
if you go to
I'm going to do it right now
then
go to
episodes, minis, movies
and gaming
and you hit Doom and it links you to a player
that's embedded into the site I guess
now you can watch it there
so for people who are like we don't see it
there you go but it will be up on
Moolah as soon as it goes through
I'm trying to thing with a friend to see if we can
keep it live
on a channel on YouTube for two weeks
once it goes through two weeks then we probably assume
that we can do it by copyright and I'll try it again on Moolah
but that will be the third time
for some reason they like to strike it once you put it live
it doesn't matter whether or not it's unlisted
it's really annoying
as soon as that one goes through then Fellowship can come out
then Two Towers, then Return of the King
then God Gojira, King of the Monsters
King of the Monsters
and another one
should I keep it a secret Rags
or should we tell them
I think you've already told them enough
the secret is to always want them leaving more
there's another movie on top of the Godzilla one
that's currently being edited
and it may shock you
I think a lot of people might be shocked
but anyway
go to the website and do that
and use it and if you feel
as though this is an amazing site
which it is
I would like to give some support for maintaining it
there is a donate option
at the bottom for Kiba Kins
it basically just means that
it'll keep going
obviously
as eFap itself is
supporting the site as well
it's just do whatever you
feel that you would like to do
in terms of, because it's just a great website
and that moving it up is
something we want to do
if everything is smooth right now
there should be a link to it in the current
livestream, I'm going to make sure that's true
because
it's really very incompetent today
yes it's there
it says a fan site that's all about eFap
you can find a link right there
excellent
that's pretty much it
I haven't actually got anything else to say
oh
so somebody mentioned
when we were talking about YouTube's demonetized words
in titles that it was funny that
gallons was in there
demonetized word?
and they recommended that I put
gallons as a test into the next
eFap
I did, the one we were talking about Joker
I said we were looking at gallons of
Joker critics or something like that
and that video did get demonetized
but I don't know if it's because of gallons
but it would be funny if it was
woah, does it rhyme
with something that I'm missing?
I don't know, someone must have used gallons to say
something horrible at some point and YouTube
are like, that's it, that's gotta go
that could have been it
who knows
you never know with YouTube because they don't tell us anything
no, they don't
have they said anything about that demonetized word
list? I would have thought they'd be like
they don't want to damage control that shit
be like, ahh, not true, I swear
they do what they always do
not answer
another funny thing happened
that I suppose I should acknowledge
cause I got tweeted about it like crazy
way back when
a user made a meme for us
where I was the guy in Kingsman
shooting a bunch of people in the church scene
that were all representative of different
efap villains and
fights and stuff
there were even some references to things beyond
efap in that video, it was really well edited
it had loads of references, it was really cool
somebody made one for Trump
like, just as a meme
in general, someone made one where he was
going around like, he was doing the same thing
but he was shooting like, CNN and other
things, and like, obviously Trump fans
are really happy with it
that's the thing, non-Trump fans
were like, this is horrible
it depicts him killing people and they're
celebrating
and the people were like, isn't this the meme
that made for you as well? I was like, I don't know, you can make
for anybody I guess
it's a meme within the movie
I mean, it's a
Englishman killing a bunch of Southern
church goers
I mean, Kingsman is okay
that's kind of a meme
I liked the first one, the second one was
weird and now they're making a prequel, right?
yeah, they are
I only saw the first one
it's not my cup of tea
I think it'd be okay to kill a bunch of church goers in the first one
yeah, they were probably a bunch of right-wingers
and it's okay to kill them
yep, they ain't people
hey, people
so, that's about it for like, interest stuff
that I need to get said
now there's enough people here for me to be like,
oh, and welcome to eFap, number 58
we covered a video
about Game of Thrones
a while back, I believe it was
episode 56
no, it was with
Mr. GG
oh, that was the demonetized
weird one, actually
the author of said video was
interested in discussing
our perspective on Game of Thrones, and here he is
hello, Yezin, how do you do?
hi, I am Yezin, slash
Yezin IRL, and I'm here to
talk about some Game of Thrones, some
Season 8, it's gonna be great
we've brought
Nudrotik on, as a
representative of the side that is
let's say, unhappy
put it that way, that's the
nice way to put it, unhappy with Season 8 of Game of Thrones
and probably Game of Thrones as a whole at this point
but welcome
aren't you all on that side, though, other than me?
pretty much, yeah, but I was gonna say
me and Rags are probably gonna try and take a little
bit of a backseat
so that we're not gonna, we don't wanna be doing
the whole like, all three of us ask you
a question at the same time, and you have to answer all of them
we'll be, we'll try and
let you guys discuss the topics
if you will, but probably throw
some comments in here and there, just to have
some level of structure, so that it'll
be interesting
I was gonna say we kinda
did it with Major Lee, most of the
time, out of the three people
two would be silent for a decent amount of time
while it would be exchanged between
the two others, but
we'll play it by here
as they say, and see how
everything goes, so, yeah
Ned Roddick is, go ahead
yeah, well before you, I mean
I'm curious what everyone's like
background of the series is, like
just show, book and show
like, where is that?
Ned Roddick, do you wanna go first?
sure, so it's
I watched the show
for the first three episodes
loved it immediately
it became the greatest thing in my life
and right around that
time Dance of Dragons came out
bought that, bought all the books
read them multiple times over one summer
and continued doing so
over years and years
just had the audio book
on a constant loop in my car
on my phone
books
got into the lore deeply
went to all the Reddit
pages, I'm a big fan, or I was
a big fan of Free Folk, I heard that change recently
and I haven't been there in like a month, but
yeah
I love the Free Folk
and, yeah, just
obsessively got into the show
into the books and was
spouting ignorant
remarks like, this is gonna be
better than Game of Thrones, or better than Lord of the Rings
and, why was I
wrong, and got a bunch of people, got a bunch of my friends
in the show, I had a comic shop at the time
I don't know if anybody's heard that, I might have mentioned it a million
times that I used to own a comic shop, I had viewing
parties there of episodes
and
yes, bought all the comics
everything, everything
they had to offer, I bought, I became a
massive fan
and then Season 7 happened
I started breaking a little early
Season 7 was what really
started doing that
I was still in
but the
Westeros Express and
particularly what they did to Littlefinger
was just completely
out of character for him
and
didn't work for me
personally, narratively
within the show, he became
an idiot
got suckered by
the Stark sisters in
the space of two episodes
which normally they would
have built that thing up over time
and we got a glimpse
of what was to come for Season 8 for me
and Season 8 was just the straw that
broke the camel's back
I see
My history is all the way with
it was Season 2 it just aired
and too many of my friends at the same time said
you need to see it high rated and I watched
I think once I was done
with the finale for Season 1 I was like
I need 10 million seasons of this
and the fact there's only one remaining sucks and I remember
watching it all in the one day and was like oh there
it is it's done now and I have to wait a million years
I remember watching
the premiere for Season 3
the Red Wedding and then
that's when I read the
books after I had
finished Season 3 so I was like I can't wait it's impossible
I have to know all of the things that happened to all these
and then Season 4
rolled around and I was really
happy with who they cast for Oberyn
and how they did everything
I thought it was just like I was just a super
happy book fan and then came
the last episode of Season 4
which I despise and I kind of
want to make a video on it one day because everything
I just don't like anything that happens in that episode
that's one of my favorite
episodes of the entire show
well
maybe we can discuss that at some point but I
absolutely hate it
it ruins
Tyrion Laddister beyond
repair as well as a couple of
other things but more importantly I was like
I'm done the show's killed me I can't believe it did
this and Season 5 came around and a couple
of my friends were like we're gonna watch it you know watch it
and I was like yeah I'll watch it and I was just like
the heckler almost
I was like yeah this is
some good stuff in here but that's stupid
that's stupid
Barristan's death that
I was just like so beyond
insulted but I was like yeah okay fine
that happened that's cool
Season 6 rolled around and I was like okay
it wasn't as bad as Season 5
you know maybe there's maybe and then
more baits from the White Walkers and I was like
you know what I'm gonna see this
through probably just because I want to know how
this all goes where is it all
what was it all for? Season 7 happened
and my god
like the stupid zombie plot
like I couldn't believe that
that was the thing they did
white hunch
and then yeah I mean I've kind of skipped over them but
we have like Stannis
in Season 5 we have
Blackfish in Season 6
got Littlefinger in Season 7
there's all these endings to characters
that are just so
unbefitting of
what we've come to understand about them or at least
what I came to understand about them
and then
I was getting to a degree of
hype for Season 8
because of
just who was in it who was
who was doing what like
Supportionic was supposed to be in charge of a bunch of episodes
and I was like oh I like him he's good
and the fact that they were like oh this is the biggest thing ever
and I was like oh it's not really
to me I thought it was gonna be pretty hard for them to fuck it up
I was like this is
your options are simplistic, obvious ending
or surprise me with some stuff
but they chose
what I think is one of
let's say there's a billion ways you could have ended it
they chose like
the bottom 100
like
weird ways it was in there and I was just like
wow
and I was furious after
Season 8 Episode 3
absolutely furious and it reminded
it was the same feeling as TLJ it was like wow
I really cared about this show even though I pick
the end of Season 4 is where I dropped off
I was clearly not off the train
sometimes this stuff makes you realise that but yeah
that's me
and those two stories
are relatively long
Rags, explain your extensive history with Game of Thrones
My extensive history of Game of Thrones
begins when
Mahler contacted me one day and said
Rags I need you to look at this
I need someone else to understand
I need you to watch this
and it was Game of Thrones
Season 8 Episode 3
now up until this point
up until this point my
my understanding of Game of Thrones was purely
tangential
in the sense that I'd only heard of it
I knew really nothing of the characters
I'd seen memes here and there popping up
but I basically had no
understanding at all of Game of Thrones
I didn't care about the show at all
so we watched Season 8 Episode 3
I said Mahler this is absolutely
fucking terrible
and
then he started explaining me the context
of a lot of the characters and we went through a
lot of clips and even later I went through
a whole lot of clips to get
back stories on characters and things that happened
and I was like man
I am like I'm really
really sorry that this happened to your show
because this is awful
what I'm watching is an absolute abortion
of the cinema
and then I just kind of followed along with
the discussions he was talking about
and I'm
pretty much convinced based on all that
I've learned so far that
Season 8, especially Episode 3
going on a lot of just
completely logic
devoid decisions are made
and insanely stupid things happen
regardless of who
characters are and what their back stories
are and a lot of context you just see
stupid stuff being done
that is just to me
insane
everything from fight choreography
to
battle strategies to
just things that people do that seem so
bafflingly stupid I just couldn't
I couldn't believe it
So I guess as a
just to underlie this
I find that there's like
kind of two main different
kinds of complaints about the show
and particularly Season 8
some are logistic
and then some are
narrative
so logistic stuff is like
fight choreography
like why did the Dothraki charge
why
and you could say
that's motivation on some level but
the Dothraki aren't really characters
so it's like
logistic things like why
how was Euron able to snipe
Rhaegal out of the sky from behind
like dragon stuff like that
and then there's stuff like
why did Daenerys burn the city
why did Jaime go back to stuff
like that
I am someone who
sympathizes more with the logistic
complaints like the logistic complaints
a lot of them do make a lot of sense
to me like
they're really really really
stupid
cause I'm not a big battle strategy
guy so it's not really
it plays out like a CW show
quite frankly
the things that they do and the things that they do
ultimately impact
do people survive or not
are the walls breached
what happens to armies
stuff like that
it's important stuff that happens
sure
I'm less knowledgeable about
characters I just have
the ability to look at things that don't make
any sense whatsoever or just
outright
stupid and don't make
sense and I'm like wait a second
this doesn't make any sense at all but it's something
that's happening
so my investment in future actions
that people take is being crumbled
away by constantly stupid
decisions
I mean I'm sure we'll get into those
for me the areas that I find
complaints are and the bigger
like you know the real
vitriol towards Season 8
is about
character choices
things that characters do like
Jamie going
back to Cersei probably
one of the most unpopular decisions
Daenerys
burning King's Landing
Jon being
stuff like why
are these things happening
to my favorite characters
why are characters making these kinds of choices
those are the
places where
you really see a lot more like rage
and that's the area where I
have
friction with a lot of the rest of the fandom
because I don't agree
I do think that people
are more often than not
wrong about the characters
not
the writers made the wrong choice with the characters
and I'm sure we're going to get into that
alright yeah I think that works as a good intro
that's a good little taster for all
that's to come
I don't exactly know what
we should tackle first in any particular
order
but
I'm interested in asking a few things
just what I
got from the video sort of
so you could call them
the two conversations we're probably
going to have is stuff specifically
to do with season 8 and the stuff specifically to do with
criticism in general, meta
fans, all that stuff around it
if that makes sense? Sure, absolutely
so like I guess
opening question
what to you makes a fandom
toxic?
what is toxic to you?
well there's a lot
of different things
I think in the case of
the Game of Thrones fandom
right now
the thing that makes them
particularly toxic
is sort of an overinflated
sense of their own understanding
so like people look at the show
they're like this is
who the characters are
I've decided that
Daenerys is this
based on my interpretation of who she's been
I've decided that Jaime is this
based on my interpretation
of who he's been
people see things that contradict
what they
believed about characters
and then they decide that
they don't
there's no introspection
the writers are wrong
someone else did something wrong
I was right the whole time
so that is I think
what fuels the toxicity
the inability to look
back and say huh, maybe I need
to look at this again, maybe I need to
reconsider this
maybe I was wrong about stuff
instead we're getting a lot of
just really like oh
these writers are incompetent
they don't know George R.R. Martin's vision
I know George R.R. Martin's vision
even though they spoke to
George R.R. Martin, he told them his vision
and then people
are like no, they didn't get it, I get it
here's what's supposed to happen
here's what Jaime would do
here's what Daenerys would do
I think that's kind of a taste of how
I see toxicity
I guess Gary, what would you like
response or?
Yeah, okay, so my just real quick
toxic fandom doesn't
exist, it's just fandom, it's always been there
we can talk to each other more
so if we want to label it toxic or not
I'm not too sure, of course there's a few bad
actors in there who just want to get nasty
for the lulls and stuff but
for the large part I've done
a lot of live streams so it was mauler
talk to people in length
other YouTubers in length, other
friends in length and
I really don't buy into
like I had an ending in
mind and it didn't meet my ending and
I don't like it, I think anybody who has even the
most basic understanding of Game of Thrones
or the books and you do have to separate
these two things and I have a hard time doing
it myself and let me
preface this by saying the
exact ending for
Jon, for Daenerys, for Jaime
I can certainly see those things
happening in the book, it was
contextually, it didn't make
any sense in season 8 because it
required a lot more time to build
up to that because that's what the
foundation of that series was, this was
Lord of the Rings where they tell you
how the armor got paid for,
how they fed the troops, how to boil
leather, this was what
people bought into and then
it just abandoned that towards
the end to rush to an ending
to get it over with because they split
the final season, they
wasted a lot of time on a
lot of characters that they didn't follow through on
and they had to rush to an ending
and I think that's the general consensus
as far as Jaime acting
out of character, well he did because
they didn't build up to him returning
to Cersei, they didn't
finish his redemption arc at all
and
the same to Arya and Daenerys
and Jon's whole
relationship was forced,
and you know what, can
we blame that on the actors not having
chemistry, maybe, but it all fundamentally
falls to the writers in this
and the writers' decision
to take a two year break
in between the series but not work
on the series for the entire two years
They also
They worked on the series at the time
They were in and out, they weren't as in there
as they were before, they even
mentioned that in the documentary
That being said,
they didn't allow themselves enough time
to finish, they were
heavily reliant on George
to finish the book and I think George
Not Finishing Wins a Winner had a
large part to do with
the derailing of this series
and we have
so many people who were not
happy with this and again
I am not going to say these people didn't have
an understanding, listen I'm
no expert on anything, I
read the books a lot, I watched the
show a lot, I think I have a basic understanding
and I would think that a large
portion of the fandom does as well
and I think
it wasn't satisfying
I don't think people, I personally
don't have an ending in mind for anything
and George can pass on all the
information he wants but it's
it comes down to a matter of talent
if this is considered mean, sorry
it's a fact
Dan and Dave don't have the talent
George RR Martin do
they adapted it
great in the beginning but
I can't understand how
anybody would argue that the
adaption was good towards the end
okay so there's a lot to cover here
the first thing
so what you were talking about earlier
about people don't have an ending in mind
they don't like the way
it's done so
it's not what was done
it was the execution
that's kind of the
the phrase that's been
thrown around a lot
a lot of people present that as the
consensus but it's really
in my experience
a very false consensus
like a lot of people will say that because it
sounds good and it makes
them sound objective
but like for example
on the
the subreddit, the book
subreddit, Song of Ice and Fire, someone made a poll
about like do you want
would you like
George RR Martin to do
these things
in the books and they are like the big things
like Sansa, Queen, King, Bran
Daenerys, Burns, King's Landing
Jon kills Dany, Jamie goes back
to Cersei, yes or no
and in almost
every case except
Jon kills Daenerys
people said no
they did not want that in the books
and again it wasn't
overwhelming, it was a little bit
over, it was like 60%,
50%
in all these cases, the poll had
something over it, I mean again
it's a sample size of maybe like 2,000 people
but right there
you get the sense that okay so
people actually
so some people yeah they'll say
it's the execution but for a lot of people
they're really just not
going to be okay with
King Bran ever
and there's a lot of like
I don't think that's a fair question though because
we saw the build up to King Bran in the show
and it was awful because they skipped
they made a terrible decision
and skipped a season with Bran so
people lost connection with that character
you can say
if you tell somebody the ending
about context they might not like it
but if they say read George's
interpretation of what
no but the question was
do you want to see
George adapt this
and those people have
five books of Bran
they have five books of Jon
they have five books of Daenerys
and they don't want George to get there
again that's not everyone
but I think for me
the idea that there is a consensus
is just not true, there is no
consensus opinion, some people
don't like what happened, some people don't like
the way it's done, a lot of people don't like
both but this idea that like oh well
I like
some people say like oh you know everything
that the show did I would be fine
with it if it was done better
some people feel that way
but not everyone and
when you have such a large fandom
with like so many expectations
you're never going to get that kind
of a consensus and you do see a
lot of, a lot of people did
watch Game of Thrones like
sports fans, like
they're rooting for a team, like a lot of
people like Daenerys is my
character and I'm all for
I want Khaleesi to win, I want
Daenerys to win, a lot of people are like
Jon is my guy, I want
Jon to be the king, I want Jon
to kill the Night King
so a lot of people watch
it through that context
and there is like a
people aren't that rational
there's an emotional drive there
that colors how they interpret
everything around that, for one thing
like someone asked me like
why is it that I think
that I'm so positive
about the ending and
part of it I think is that
at the core of it, Bran
was my guy
and so I had this like
bias at the ending
where it's like yeah, I want to like this
because Bran was
my dude and he is the
king at the end and so then
I was able, I think I was able to look at things
a little bit more
I was able to look back at things and be
more open to what the ending was saying
because it gave me a thing that I wanted
whereas other people who didn't
get anything they wanted aren't
really willing to go back and rethink
their opinions or rethink
the ending because there's no
why, why would
they want to like something that
shat on their favorite character
I think it's possible for
a fan to know a character better than
a writer
If you believe
death of the author, absolutely
and I do believe it's possible
for fans to know characters better than the writers
I think in most
cases fans do not know
the characters better than the writers
I think
do we want to pick a character and talk about him?
If you'd like
do you want to pick?
Let's talk about Jaime
Everyone loves Jaime Lannister
He's a very popular character
I was talking to a friend
how would you rate
Daenerys's turn
and I gave it an 8 out of 10
How would you rate
Jaime's turn?
10 out of 10
I literally do not think a single
thing should have been done different with Jaime
and that's a very
unpopular opinion of the fandom
I'd like to hear more
about Jaime, how you guys feel about him
and give my opinion on that
Well, it's up to Gary
you and me, what do you want to do?
You go ahead first
I went first last time
So, how would you explain
the line
the innocent I never really cared for
them?
Yeah, this is the line that gets talked about the most
I would explain that line
with it's literally true
If you go back
over Jaime's story
there is not a single
instance of him
going out of his way
or expressing a lot of
concern for the common people
and the
instance that people always go straight to
is Aries
He killed the Mad King
Saved an entire
city
But if you think about it, self defense
Jaime would have
died too in that fire
Right?
You think he killed the Mad King
in self defense
I think he killed
the Mad King because
the option was
die
your father dies
you never see Cersei again
that's it
or do something that is
arguably also honorable
and within your vows and you get to live
So naturally, I would
cite season 3 where he explains
to Brienne
did it because if he hadn't
thousands would have died
That's not actually what he says
I actually knew this was going to
come up so I went back and rewatched that
scene literally right before this
What he says
is if your king had asked
you to kill your own father
and then stand by where women
and children are burned, would you have done it?
If you actually look at
the context of that scene, it's
not about Jaime's
deep concern for the common
people, it's about
honor and reputation
The last lines of that
scene are
by what right does the wolf judge
the lion, by what right
He's upset because people
see him as a bad guy
even though he
upheld his vow
to protect the innocent
Absolutely
That comes after he's made
that decision
Yeah, but the thing is
when you look at his emotion in that scene
that's what it's about
So he's so torn up when you're watching that
scene and a lot of people are like oh he's torn up
because he's thinking about all of the women and children
that would have died, no he's torn up
because of how people look
at him
but when you made that decision
wouldn't you rather live
wouldn't you rather live
then
wouldn't you rather kill the crazy king
and live than burn alive?
I don't know that that was actually
the definitive result
even, we don't know that Jaime didn't know
where the safe areas of King's Landing
would have been
There were no safe areas of King's Landing
There clearly were, and the King's Landing was
burned by Daenerys and all the deposits
went off for the wildfire and yet
there's still plenty of people who survived
Well in the show it's not
entirely sure that all of the wildfire
is still there
but
Jaime himself
says that he didn't
in another scene that the crazy part
or maybe it's in the same scene
that Aerys didn't think he would
actually didn't think that he would burn
he thought he would rise again to the dragon
So Jaime believes that
Aerys is going to die in this fire
I don't think he was like well
you know I could not kill the king
and go hide
anyway so we're taking
the scene right? You have an
interpretation of it, I have an interpretation
of it. Can you kind of see how
like both of these are valid
right? No, I don't see how
this is valid at all
Okay, well
in what way? Like what is invalid
about it? The scene is about reputation
Jaime himself
So he's outraged
the biggest moment in his life where he had to
choose between the honor to
three different, he mentions the king
the people and his father
and he chose
the people because
it's pretty clear that that would be the right choice
ultimately to save the most lives
and he's
punished for it, that's his reputation
and it's all thanks to Ned Stark
Ned Stark's the reason, Ned Stark
could have changed everything if he had actually
addressed, listened to,
understood everything about Jaime but he's too
quick to judge, he's too altruistic, he judges
Jaime immediately as a betrayer
he killed his own king, probably to save
his own skin, what a piece of shit
but ultimately- Jaime
Ned Stark doesn't know
about the wildfire, Jaime never
tells Ned Stark about the wildfire
In the books he never tells anyone
in the show he tells- No, everything I
just said is contingent upon that
Sorry, could you explain that again?
So everything I said is contingent upon
Jaime not telling Ned that
because that's Jaime's
conclusion, that Ned immediately
judges him the worst possible
scenario, and it's done
Right, um,
uh, Jaime
Ned judges him because
he's sitting on the throne, he killed
the king, his father
was taking the city, Ned
Ned assumes, because he is
presumptuous, but, I mean
for understandable reasons, he presumes that
uh, Jaime was
just acting
in the interest of his house. Which he wasn't
Which he wasn't
but at the same time, Ned
doesn't know about the wildfire
Jaime, in his mind
he's protecting him, he's defending
So we're highlighting that the selfish
point of view is the lie
is the failure to understand the scenario
is the thing that everyone understands about Jaime
that isn't true? No,
it's, the thing about A Song
of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones is that
uh, decisions are never that
clear cut, right? There's always like
two sides to every decision
um, and this is very true of Jaime
it's very true of Daenerys, it's very true of a lot of
characters, like with
um, with Ned Stark
there's this question of like, oh, is
is he all about honor? Well
no actually, when you find, when you
really get into the secrets of Ned
Stark, he's actually all about
family, so there's like
two, like yes Ned Stark is
honorable, but he also puts his family
above honor, it's like
yes, that seems honorable to me
I was gonna say that's maintaining an honor
Well, that's the whole point of Jaime's
character is that he's trying to decide
which honor outpaces the other
Ned Stark obviously
places the honor of his family's
lives above the honor to his king
Yeah, and in that
instance, so did Jaime
but the point isn't like
Ned Stark is wrong, Jaime is right
the point is that
Jaime doesn't
he sees an ill
in society, in the way
people judge other people
based on these contradictory vows
and he's torn up about it
but what he did
didn't show, it's like
he didn't risk his life
for the common people
and throughout the story he never does again
He doesn't risk his life for the common people
No
So by common people
could we boil that down to innocent person?
No
Common people is
non-nobility, people that he doesn't know
like civilians
so Brienne of Tarth
not the common people
So how many characters have satisfied that?
In the story
very few, the story doesn't really
follow the common people but the thing is
he doesn't, Jaime is in a
position to do things for the common people
all the time, he just
doesn't
He gets absorbed by the personality
that he'd accidentally created for himself
that's who he is up until season 3
that's when everything starts to crack apart
That's not, that's
part true, part not, again it's like
yeah he's absorbed by this personality
but once you're absorbed, that is
who you are, there's no like
fake self and fake self, like you are
what you do
I believe that he actually owned that persona
until he was faced with a bunch of
serious choices that he couldn't escape
and then he comes to realize this isn't me
I'm not Jaime Lannister, the king
slayer, the person who will
be with Cersei over everything else
I do care about, how do you, I'm confused
how do you justify this idea that
he doesn't do anything for the common people when he was at Winterfell?
Yeah, go back and watch those scenes
what is the thing that drives
Jaime to go to Winterfell?
It's Brienne, when they ask him
he looks at Brienne, he says
he repeats Brienne's words back to him
later he goes to Brienne and
he says the reason I'm here
and I'm not the fighter I used to be
but I would be honored
honor to
fight under your command
Doesn't he say that he made a promise to fight for the living?
Yes, he says it to Cersei
he says it to Cersei, again
it's about honor, his honor
to the people
not to the people
Well, yeah
sure, you can say it's interpretation
but what happens is, I have my interpretation
you have yours, and then
at the end, the show
contradicts your interpretation
and affirms mine
not just yours, other people's
one interpretation
is affirmed by the show at the end
one is contradicted
by the show, and people are like
bad writing, rather than
maybe this interpretation was wrong
maybe this interpretation
that Jaime- A large portion of the
fan base is wrong
Yes, because that's the way
the story functions
the story is intended to hoodwink
you into rooting for a tyrant
the story is intended to
make you think that characters
aren't going to do certain things
Jaime won't burn his daughter
Jaime won't go back to Cersei
That's not rooting for a tyrant, that's rooting for someone
who then after the fact becomes a tyrant
and then people's opinions change
people weren't rooting for Daenerys after she
became the tyrant
No, Daenerys was a tyrant the whole time
and we'll get to Daenerys
but
with Jaime, I mean
again, there's this idea, no
he really cared about the common people
well if you care about the common people, you'll do things
the common people regularly, right?
but he doesn't, like
what's he doing in- No, that's the point, is he's
absorbed by that persona
but that's part of who he is
like, it's, he does
in his breaks, it shatters
when he's brought to the brink, literally
the living versus death, he can't
do it anymore, he can't be that person
again, this is
scattered, what he does for Brienne
is crazy for Jaime Lannister
that's why everyone starts to like him at season 3
and they're like, wow
well, again, he
he- and you can't argue that
he's in love with her at that point, because that would be ridiculous
you what?
you can't argue that he's in love with Brienne
by the time he saves her from being raped
there's no way we're in love with that point
well, are you talking about the bear?
or saving her from being raped?
when I said saving her
from being raped
okay, well with that, I mean what he did is he just
he just
said, hey don't do that
when he knew full well that Jaime Lannister
that everyone understands
and knows would never have done that
you can tell, he's wrestling within that
scene, he keeps having loads of
looks towards what they're doing, where they're taking her
and he knows what the right thing is
it's not what Jaime Lannister would do
to Brienne, I think Jaime admires
Brienne a lot
because she represents ideals
that he really
wants to embody
yeah, absolutely she is him
but he's been trapped inside this
persona that was created unfairly by
Ned Stark
no, Ned Stark didn't
she isn't
him, she's a version of him that he would
like to be, he never is
he never fully finds that
that's the thing, Jaime is complicated
he's torn between these
two selves, and at the end
he sort of realizes that
who have
it's guilt at the end
he's like, look at all
the awful things I've done
that is who I am
you're saying like, oh no, that
that's not
the real Jaime, that's the persona
the dialogue is awful
oh no, it's great
he argues he's a hateful person
alright yeah, go ahead Gary
okay, we can, and I know
this is what this is about
is parsing out details, but
I'm gonna borrow something from our good friend
Robert Byer Burnett
Ferris Similitude
it's whether the audience buys
this, because the fan
is the arbiter of something
is actually
because they're buying
this product, and if this product wants
to continue, they do need to please a large
portion of the fans, not everybody
but enough to keep it going
well it does not keep going, it's over
well, they got a prequel coming
out, right? I'm sorry, I'm just
so, yeah
so
Mahler just pointed
out, Jaime going
back to Cersei, again, would make
sense if they had finished his
redemption arc
because he didn't want her
well, I mean, it could be argued, he was going down
there to save people, right, because he wanted
to go talk to her, but then he
ended up not wanting her to die alone
and he probably felt like
she didn't have anybody else in the world, there's a million ways
you can interpret, but the dialogue
was crap, him fighting
oh, I'm blanking on
his name now, Euron
at the end was just
dumb as hell, and then walking around with
a mortal wound for like an hour afterwards
I mean, people just checked
out at that point, and you have
to continue, this whole
series was based on
grounding fantasy
and making it like
digestible to normies
and it was, for the longest time
and they bought into this stuff
and normies are
the vast majority of people who
watch this show, honestly
and
they just lost it at the end
Jaime was acting out of character
because they did rush absolutely everything
some of the dialogue was just
terrible
and then a bunch of
stones falling on
when they could have walked 15 feet to the left
and they would have been fine
and then
the whole room was collapsed
they're not going to
it wasn't all collapsed
it was just parts of it that were collapsed
they're trapped in this room
there's nothing, there's no where
some of it is going to collapse
some of it is not
it was utterly ridiculous, the room they showed us
after the carnage does not
resemble the room we saw when everything
was falling apart whatsoever
alright, well that's logistic things
when you get into the logistics
well it deals with the death of important characters
it's kind of important
obviously you do agree
they aren't going to
frogger around, he's mortally wounded
she's losing it
that's it
they're trapped in this room, they can't
figure about the rocks
should they have staged
the room to look a little bit different after?
the fans aren't reading a script
they're watching a completed piece
of art that is visual
and that's all part
of it, that's all part of it
and if they don't execute that well
then that's part of his character
not being executed very well
even though it got executed
there's a big hole at the top of one of the piles of bricks
and Jamie starts pulling bricks off a different pile
it's like why don't you just climb the pile
with the gap and at the very
least they would have survived
by being at the top of that pile because as we saw
nothing actually falls down on it because Tyrion
sees it later
it's a bizarre scene
well this is still character criticism
because they apparently have no sense
of survival for some reason
but that's not like
stuff like maybe they're
exhausted and dying
or at least he is
like I said he was moving bricks for a different pile
he kept the energy to go from the beach all the way up to the top
of the castle and now he's
dying
he was moving bricks for a different pile
he had the energy he expected to row
seriously out to Pentos
I mean he wasn't going to row
to Pentos
what do you mean?
he wasn't going to row all the way to Pentos
what do you mean?
he was going to find like a boat
where?
out on the bay
what one of your own ships and just hope they let him have it
no like a
sailboat
like again and this is
stuff like it's kind of hopeless at this
point like Jaime knows either way
he's trying to get Cersei as far as he
can he's trying to get Cersei and his
unborn child as far as he can
he doesn't know that he's going to
survive he doesn't know how long he's going to survive
and I'm sure like I don't know
so he would take actions to extend his
survival time especially the survival of his
lover and child
he's trying his best but at this point
he's dying
again this is stuff that I don't really
get too much into like that's not perfect
but like whatever
I mean all I'd be after is you'd have to
consider it was pretty bad the way they did it
even if it's just from a logistical point of view
it was pretty bad
I honestly
I'd have to go watch it again
like this kind of logistics is
more than what I get into
and if people are upset
by that like I understand
I mean I guess the characters
are wanting to live as logistics
or something
is a character wanting to live
logistics
I don't think that at any time
I get the sense that
they don't want to live
I get the sense that they don't see a way
that they can live
well the big open hole
I didn't even see that
while I was watching like
I'm not even lying
but when we get into like
for me it's more about
like who is Jamie
why did he go back to stuff like that
is more of where my attention is
because that's where more of the complaints are
there's this
there's this sense with Jamie that like
he goes back to Cersei
oh it's out of nowhere
I don't think there is a redemption arc
Jamie is an exploration of
redemption but he's an exploration of
the limits of redemption
there's only
so much that this guy can
change
at a certain point he has to
think about
who he's been, what he's done
what does he deserve?
does he deserve to hang out at
Winterfell and live happily ever after with
the most honorable night in the story
no
well that's dependent on the actions that he
decides to take
in his mind
he has not
he's willing to die to protect the world
I don't really
what do you mean die to protect the world?
he's literally on the front lines on Winterfell
against the army of the undead
again it
everyone is going to die if they don't beat them there
exactly every single soldier there
is extremely brave, courageous and
what I would call the upstanding citizen
except when we get to episode 5
where they forget all of that
sure but Jamie for him it's about
his honor and his honor to Brienne
that's where it's at
it's not about innocent people
you're saying why doesn't
Jamie think of himself the same way
we think of him
or the same way you think of him and it's like well
because he doesn't feel that way
I don't really see it that way
why did they write him awful dialogue to shoehorn him
into an ending that we did not earn
as a progression
the thing
that makes it awful is that you don't
agree
with what he's saying about himself
but that's how
he feels like he was going to
kill every man, woman and child in
Riverrun to get back to Cersei
he pushed a kid
out a window
killed his cousin
he's still a guy who's done really
bad things and never
what would have happened if he hadn't pushed
Bran out the window
what would have happened?
it's
depends on how
it depends on
how well
Bran understood what he was seeing
so that's another thing where
a lot of people like to
have you guys seen Breaking Bad?
okay
Breaking Bad, people really
get into rationalizing waltz actions
some of them are
rationalized, they're
rational but they're not sure
some of them are rational
but there's this habit of
rationalizing waltz actions
oh no, he had to do that thing
he had to do that thing
but with Jaime when it comes down to it
the four of the five kings is his fault
him and Cersei
no
yes it is
it's because Joffrey is illegitimate
no it's
they created an illegitimate heir
to the throne
if that secret got out
you can't say that like oh
stop, stop, stop
the absolute
people behind the War of the Five Kings
little finger
the name
the crazy sister
and
we never get the answer in the show
but in the book it's Joffrey that tries
to get Bran assassinated
sure, those are all
true things, they're the three people
who are ultimately responsible for the biggest stones
being moved to create the War of the Five Kings
again this is like
you're just going back
with the dominoes, ultimately though
yes, little finger
is part of it, but little finger
tries to get Ned Stark to make peace with the
Lannisters
when he comes to, right after
Robert was dying
and he goes to little finger and he's trying to get
the city watch, little finger actually tries to get
Ned to make peace with the Lannisters, little finger
is weird, he's always up to
at early season little finger
his whole thing is to never be
how does he justify it?
I don't know if you remember Gary, but the whole thing
again, he's always positioning
himself trying to
it's not clear that little finger was trying
to create the War of the Five Kings
no, it's not about who's trying to create it
it's about who's trying to create it
but if it's not about who's trying to create it
then what is the root
cause of the war? It's
Joffrey's illegitimacy
no, no, no
it's like saying that Ned Stark decided to start a war
it doesn't matter if you wanted to start it
you may have started it, little finger
absolutely started it, whether or not he
intended to
along with Lysa Arryn
and Joffrey Baratheon
but what caused the War of the Five Kings?
what are people fighting about?
well, you got two significant
moments, Tyrion's kidnapping
which results in Tywin starting a war
which happened because Joffrey tried
to assassinate Bran because they believed
which happened because Jamie pushed
Graham out the window
which happened because Jamie
if you interrupt, I'm never going to be able to prove my point
which happened because
Jamie and Cersei are committing
a crime
we might say like, oh, they're in love
whatever, but they're committing
a crime, they're usurping
the throne, Robert expects
Robert, and the entire realm
expects that Robert's children
must be legitimate
right, have I finished now?
they are creating illegitimate children
that's a no
you take the throne, and that's
usurpation
that's really interesting, continue, Mauler
right, so
when Bran was pushed out the window
the most they had was suspicion on
the Lannisters, but they never had anything to act on
that was like Catelyn's big thing
so once Tywin acts on the war
after Tyrion is captured, the only
other element is what happens in King's Landing
which is directly resulting
from Tyrion's capture, Ned Stark
takes ownership of that
move which forces Jamie to attack him
partially kill his men
the results of
the Westerlands
armies starting to assault the Riverlands
which is something that Ned Stark
denights the Mountain for
and demands Tywin return
all of these extremely
complicated things start to unravel
and Ned Stark's
position as Hand never would have
occurred, neither would suspicions of the
Lannisters have happened if not for Lysa
and Littlefinger poisoning
the Hand of the King previous to Ned
whether or not, Jamie
and Cersei have an illegitimate son
under Robert Baratheon is literally irrelevant
to the War of the Five Kings at that point
it's
very relevant because it's
the reason that Stannis and Renly get involved
no, that's posts
that's after all the other shit happens
it's not the War of the Five
Kings until the Five
Kings are all at it
Stannis and Renly would be the War of the Three Kings
fine, I'm just referring to the fact that
war across the country begins
not the specifics of how many kings managed
to make it into the war
if we're going to be completely honest, Baelon Greyjoy
barely even counts, he took over Winterfell
and that was it
sure, sure, but if you
want to talk about it as just like war
then like, well yeah
the war between the Starks and
the Lannisters
isn't just because
Jamie and Cersei
have an illegitimate child
it is in a lot of ways
instigated because Jamie pushes
a kid out a window
and of course you can say just
suspicion, but he did do it
it's the follow-up, it's not that
it's the follow-up assassination attempt
it's that in a lot of ways
there's like a lot
of suspicion around that event
people like Bran doesn't follow what's happened there
Catelyn doesn't go to King's Landing without that
happening and that means she doesn't cross
Parthaterion on the road
everything changes
but again, this is just like
you're not wrong to all these
other events that are important
but ultimately you're trying to say that like
pushing a kid out a window
did not instigate these events
it's the inciting incident, even George R. R. Martin
has said the inciting incident
by this logic, everybody's great great great grandparents
are responsible because they birthed all the people that
resulted in these events
I don't think
that's the same logic
George R. R. Martin has called
Jamie pushing Bran out the window
the inciting incident
of the Lannister Starks
Catelyn to
kidnapped Tyrion
which incited
right, inciting incidents
incited more incidents
really George R. R. Martin
ultimately it's just a secret that
if Jamie and Cersei
were as smart as they thought they were
probably could have kept
but there was also an Ed
peeking around too
it's the first significant event of the TV show, that's why it's considered
the inciting incident, but we could have gone further
back, we could have started further forward
you keep saying that as if it means something
well it
I mean I guess if you don't care
that's true
authors, you're right, authors can be wrong
but again, this is all like subjective
like you say oh, well where did it start
okay, well you can say
that it started here, you can say this
the question is like, does Jamie not have any
reason to feel guilty about the things that he's done
of course he does, and he
does feel guilty, and maybe you
think, no, it was okay
he was stopping a war, well maybe
Jamie isn't the kind of guy that feels
that way, and it's okay for
us to disagree with the characters
about the things
that they do and how they feel about their own
action, but that's
who Jamie is and that's how he feels
and he's always
really been like this guy
who's like you say, trying to
buy into a
version of himself
that's the
King Slayer persona, but is also
really
pulled down by guilt
inciting incidents are subjective, someone said that
in the chat, and that's true
Hitler invading Poland
was just subjective
how do you even conclude that inciting incident
is subjective?
someone said it in the chat
okay, and you don't believe that right?
you guys are saying that the inciting, I'm saying
inciting incident, Jamie pushed his brain out the window
you guys are saying, no, George RR Martin is wrong
it's Joffrey with the
okay fine, the inciting incident
is Jamie and Cersei having sex
now the inciting incident is them deciding
going up to the tower, and just keep drawing
it back
the first significant place
where we can never go back is once
the assassination attempt on Bran
is attempted, that's when
Catelyn knows someone is actually trying to kill him
as opposed to he fell off a wall
well, the idea that
you can never go back, you can always go
back, like there's no
there's no
like Catelyn didn't have to conclude
that it was the Lannisters
she did, because her sister told her that
they are the ones that killed Jon Arryn
right, so you're
do you think that they can inspire him to take over the
throne, which makes a lot of sense that they
would kill Bran as an attempt to start
knocking out all the Starks
why would they start with Bran?
because it's an easy way to kill somebody if you knock him off a building
when he climbs them
well, why would they be in the tower?
again, it's kind of
it's kind of a silly place to take it
I
I think they actually agree with you
and that's why it's unlikely
that Catelyn would have concluded that they
had killed him, or tried to kill him in that instance
but once someone tries to kill him in his bed
it becomes very likely that someone probably
pushed him off
I mean, sure, but this isn't
trying to get this from like
I don't necessarily
not to be overly competitive in this
debate
how is that moment
not the inciting incident
it's that assassination attempt
that's what unravels everything
Catelyn tells Ned
subjectively, you could say
it is subjective
all narrative is subjective
all narrative is subjective
is it subjective that
Daisy Ridley, or that Rey is
a character in The Last Jedi?
no, that is a fact
alright, well, moving along then
so
you're trying to get to this
again, I don't
really agree, but I don't think
this needs to be the debate because you're trying to get
what is objectively the inciting incident
because Jamie is going to believe
you're not counter arguing
we're talking about Jamie's beliefs
I give you a whole bunch of references
like four different ways that moment
moves into all of the ways that create
the war, and your response is that it's your subjective
perspective
it doesn't matter, we'll move
on to that
so do you agree, that is
the inciting incident with the assassination, do you
finally agree with that, and we can move on to whether or not Jamie
thinks that the assassination is the inciting
incident, I do not agree
well then, what's the point in asking whether or not
Jamie thinks that
you can't even get past a narrative being subjective
a narrative is subjective
it's not, that makes no sense
because I don't see inciting
incident that way
did Daenerys kill hundreds of thousands
of people in episode five, or is that subjective?
no, that's
well, technically
we're never given a number
there we go, here's a bunch of tangled Christmas tree lights
you can't possibly figure your way out of this
a narrative is subjective, other than the things that aren't
sure, some things
are objective, like a fact
but what is the inciting, that's like saying
the main character, to me
inciting incident is like main character
who is the main character?
subject, right
it depends on what your definition of main is
right, it depends on your
definition of inciting incident
and once you create a groundwork for main character
then you can assess that objectively
I agree, what is your
definition of inciting incident?
I would say the inciting incident
is the
you know, I would honestly
have to look
more into it, if I'm being totally
honest, this isn't my area
that's fine, so what I would say
my definition of inciting incident
is the incident everything
comes back to, where it all
where all of the balls roll
from, where nothing can stop
them, because everything else is going to be
because this, this, because
this, this, if that's it
then I would again come back
to the pushing out the window
so you think there was only one way for that to
result, that once he's pushed out the window the war was
just set to happen?
yes
because, well
because you're saying that like, they could have just chosen
no, when Joffrey, when Joffrey,
let's follow your, you're saying that like
oh well, no, the inciting incident
is Joffrey sending
the cat spa, right?
but, and
but the fact that it
goes to war is based on people
making certain decisions
right? it's possible
that people make different decisions
yes
so you're agreeing that it was
possible for Catlin to
not
not
take Tyrion hostage, right?
there was no reason for him to take him hostage
when Brans pushed out the window, the cat's
paw leads her to Tyrion, the attempt
on Brans' life leads her to Ned
but did Catlin have to take Tyrion hostage?
how would
anything else take place, if she bumps into Tyrion
on the road, why would she not take him hostage
when she has information confirming that he was the
person who ordered the assassination on Brans?
well, she doesn't
have information confirming
yes she does, she trusts Littlefinger
why did she trust Littlefinger?
because they grew up together
shouldn't she know not to
trust him then?
if you're fucking kidding me right now
I just think that this is
again, you're not going to like it
if I subject it
but again, this isn't really
what I want to be talking about
just personally
I'm not here to
debate the inciting incident
you see it as this, I see it as this
you get to
what's in the line
Jamie's head
we should know what's in Jamie's head
we have to separate again
book
because we know what's in Jamie's head in the book
he is concerned with his honor
he is really stuck on
making sure the star girls are okay
the whole river run
negotiation goes down completely
different
in the
show
and they skip past a lot of his
redemption arc
it had to happen that way
because if we in the book
if we get to the ending that George has intended
if that indeed is it
it would have flipped that and it would have made
sense with build up because George
as you know loves to build up
big grand plans and have them go sideways
that's pretty much the only constant
in Game of Thrones or in the Song of Ice and Fire
but at the end
the audience did not buy
a large portion of the audience
I'm not going to say everybody
personally did not buy
Jamie's decision to just
turn around and go down there
it didn't feel natural to me
it didn't work for me in any way shape or form
and I think I have proof with
Dave Benioff having to explain
everything at the end of every episode
well they've been doing that
since the beginning
even when people weren't
if it was bad before that doesn't make it
okay
they didn't start
explaining at the end because it got bad
unless you think it was always bad
and they were always explaining
before they were explaining
they did not explain as much
as they did this last season
you can't tell me that that's the case
because initially Game of Thrones
has a lot of characters
so it was always
good if you have a group of people watching
Game of Thrones that have the one person who did read the book
that can explain
because there's a lot of characters in there
and there's a lot of information for people to take in
so that was good
and that's partially why they did it
but they started at the end really getting into
character intention and having to
you know Danny kind of forgot
what?
that contradicted everything
that led up to that because somebody
did mention that the Iron Fleet was still around
so as far as Jaime
is concerned, again
subjective, objective, whatever
I personally did not buy into his arc
fell apart at the end
because he stopped being the Jaime Lannister
that we had watched
through the previous seasons
as did every character
when did his arc fall apart?
when did his arc fall apart?
fell apart for me
Dorne
Dorne
Dorne?
so not when you go back to the end
he was still somewhat
on a redemption arc though
I didn't like it
but he was still
on that redemption path but then
it just stopped
everything just stopped
when did it stop?
did it stop? the exact moment
I'll have to go back and look
but it stopped for me personally
and that's all I can really
speak for but a lot of people
agreed with me in my livestreams
and
I've heard that from others as well
so and we can
see in the chat, when did it stop for you
in the chat? when did you stop buying Jaime's
redemption arc?
when did the writers stop believing
in it? because they ran out of time
damn show
looks like the stream
went down for a moment
yeah, it's happening for me too
give it just a second
hopefully it'll pop back up and we can
continue right along
you guys can hear me, it's a good
chance to see
I can hear you, yeah
I can hear everyone
let me see
looks like we've been hacked
no no
no no
yeah
everything just stopped
I refreshed and nothing
let me see
still not back up
yeah, it doesn't look like it is up
still spooling
it's weird, I can still keep the live chat
but I'm not actually seeing the stream
itself
thing
huh
give it a second
I will use the loon in the meantime
hmm
ditch them in post
one second
what did you say was back up?
I see it back up
okay
I don't know if Youtube will stitch those
hopefully they do, if they don't also
yeah, it's back up for me as well
um, Nervotic
yes
I kind of wanted to talk about something
so, I do want to get to Danny
but before I get to Danny
I want to get to Danny
I do want to get to Danny
but before that
something you talk about is like
well the audience didn't buy it
and the audience has to buy it
that's like a big part of your belief
and I do understand that
the question is like oh well
I don't know if it's a belief
it's what I've witnessed
sure, right
whatever word we use for it
I
I do understand that
like this
the premise that this show is being made
for X number of people
and if most of those people
don't buy it then that means
they fail in some way
and based on that
criteria then
yeah sure, like how good it is
can just be a poll
right, you can take a poll
and if 80%
of the people, if 70%
didn't like it then that's an obvious
fail, hell it's 50
to fail
but that's not, and by that there's
really no argument for me to make
but that's not really
the way I look at it
when I look at why people didn't buy it
I don't think it's
about them not
setting it up, again I don't think
that the reason people didn't buy
Jamie's Turn is because it wasn't set up
I think it's because people
had
people would watch the show for an hour
and then read about
it in articles and in fan
theories and talk about it with people
and then build up their own
conception of who Jamie is
and what he would do
and so their own
sort of
expectations
and presumptions about the story
started to bleed into the actual
story, which is why there isn't a lot
of people willing to go back
and think, oh was I wrong about anything?
That to me
is my main
concern is that
we're so sure that we're right
the first time around and we're not
interested in going back and being like
let me look at this again
and see if I'm just
mistaken, which for me that's a thing
that I did, I was very wrong about Daenerys
and I've
gone back since and I've checked out her
story again. Cersei, another character
I think I really didn't understand
till
kind of recently, till I really looked at her story
as a whole and thought, oh
that's what this was all about.
So I don't think that it's just
like, oh the audience didn't buy it, that means they
failed. I think there is an
element of the audience
getting
really
into it.
Well I would say if the goal of the show is to convey concepts
and most people don't understand the concepts
or agree with them, I would say that is a failure.
Do you think the goal of the show is to convey
concepts? I mean I agree, I just didn't.
Not everyone agrees
with that.
I think
that
the reason a lot of people didn't get it
or
the reason a lot of people
the concepts weren't conveyed is because
people are very
kind of
distrustful of the show
by the end. It's screwed over their favorite characters.
It's made a lot of mistakes
especially in
season 6 and 7. There's
premise that you don't have to trust the show.
It's possible that the writers are just wrong.
So it's easy to be like, oh well everything
is wrong then. Fuck it.
I don't know.
If you have a lot of people who say
that
it's wrong for
reason X and you have a lot of people who say that it's right
for the same thing. They're all watching
the same show. How do you
differentiate between the two?
How do you find out who's correct?
For instance, all the people
What's the
methodology that you would use
to tell the difference between a fan
who didn't like the show
because it didn't end the way that they
personally wanted it to end and a fan who didn't like
it because it didn't make any sense.
How would you find the difference between the two?
A lot of different ways. I think you just
have to level a discussion like we're having now.
Sometimes it's easy. If someone's like
oh I didn't like the fight choreography
it's like alright well there you go.
But if someone says like
Well we can take that example. Is that a valid reason
to say the show's bad or an invalid one?
I think almost
everything is valid because it's a
show and people are allowed to feel
how they want to feel about it.
I do think it's about I didn't
I didn't personally
enjoy
most of the
choreography
the military strategy sort of
the way the Long Night episode was done.
I personally wasn't a huge fan of that.
I also didn't
like the
Are You Killing the Night King personally?
Would you have done it different?
I would have no idea how to stage a battle.
I don't.
I'm just asking if you would have done it different.
Not how or anything. Just if you would do it different.
Yes.
Alright.
I think that
people should have died off a little bit more
unceremoniously in that battle.
And I think Theon
should have killed the Night King.
Those are my
really high level
that's what I think needs to
but that's just my opinion.
Alright.
I like Theon killing the Night King.
That would have been cool.
Yeah. I think that
for me, the reason for that
is that the Night King embodies
death. That's conceptually
what he is. And Theon
overcame death by accepting death
because death is an inevitability.
With Arya they had this whole like, oh you say not today
to the God of death. But then it's just like
that's just the line.
Everyone dies.
Like, Theon accepted death
went into it with courage
and he
I think he's about delaying death.
Not about stopping. Right. Delaying death.
But like, I think the
for me personally I think
the more compelling way
to deal with death, deal
with that character is to
embrace it
and
go into it in
a way you can be proud of.
And that's what Theon sort of does.
He overcomes just for like
a second his trauma and he
dies.
But he dies thinking he failed to
protect Bran.
I don't love that.
But
I think that's awfully
insulting to Theon as a character
to have that ending for him.
I don't, I don't
I wouldn't go so
far as to call it insulting. I think it's kind of sad.
But that's the thing.
Like Theon
it's not
there's a line in the books like
men's lives matter
not their death or something.
I'm sure I'm butchering it. But like, yeah
maybe his last
second was like oh I failed
but
he died
knowing that he did his best.
It's not my
favorite but I do
I do
I do think I would have done that
theme differently. I don't like
like Arya
but
by the end it was
not at the top of my list of things
about the season anymore. You know what I mean?
Because when I watched episode three
which was got me pulled into what got me
pulled into all of this when Arya just
shows up from the aether in
stabs him.
I know the first, one of the first thoughts
that I had when I saw that was how the hell
did you get here? How did you get past an
entire army of people?
This doesn't seem to make any sense at all
yeah this doesn't seem to make any sense at
all that you were able to just
apparently materialize right behind him.
And so
that for me
that's one of those things that is a
I don't know if you would call that logistics
however you're using it. But to me
that seems like just something that's
impossible for anyone to do but it just happens
so that a thing can occur.
Those are the kinds of things that for people like me
really take us out of a show.
Something happens
just because it needs to happen regardless of how
much sense it really makes. Those are
the kinds of things that make a story crumble.
Those are the things that make
writing just fall apart.
It's the execution
of these things that happen.
I couldn't agree more with that
and that's what
caused Game of Thrones Season 8 to collapse overall
was they had that ending.
They had a meeting with George R. Martin, Dan and Dave.
It was years previous where he sat down at a dinner
and I'm not remembering this perfectly
but he basically
and he gave him the ending.
It's some context for what led up to it but not a ton.
And they had to fill in a lot of blanks.
That's not, sorry to interrupt, that's not quite right.
He gave them the ending at the beginning.
They knew the
basic ending from the beginning.
He gave them the broad strokes.
Alright, here's everyone's character arc.
Here's all my outline
is what he gave them.
Broad strokes but they
had already made decisions that
wouldn't connect with those broad strokes
because of the
sample chapters we've seen with Winds of Winter.
We were talking about this prior to the show.
Arya's chapter
that they used.
Just completely out of context and it didn't fit at all
within the show and it was executed poorly.
I'll say just to be nice.
So just to be clear,
so D&D knew what the
endings would be from the beginning?
They knew the
very basic, they knew King Bran.
I think they knew
the
I don't know the detail, but they knew the end.
So they had all that time to set it up properly.
Between season three and season four
they got
kind of George R.R. Martin's big info dump.
Here's what I have.
Here's what I have.
Here's the broad strokes. I haven't written it yet.
I hear a lot of people saying they didn't know at all.
Couldn't have. If they knew King Bran.
If they knew King Bran, why would they?
No, they definitely knew King Bran.
There's foreshadowing for King Bran in the
Oh, I don't. You know
when you go back and watch season one, King Bran is very believable.
At least for me.
No, I believe King Bran, but leaving him out for a complete season
is dumb. It's a bad decision.
It disconnects the viewer with the character.
So
and then his just his being robot Bran towards the end
with no build up.
And yeah, it's not really a character once he comes back.
Bran is, you know, Bran is my favorite character in the books.
I love Bran in the books.
Bran is complicated because I actually like
understand why they made the decisions that they did with Bran.
I don't know if I agree with them.
But one thing is like Bran's story is a story written about a child.
And it's hard to take that
and make that a story about a teenager slash adult.
So that's where the talent comes in.
I mean, well, I guess now that we're talking about talent,
this is like a slightly different, you know,
we said at the beginning, like how bad our D&D versus how good is the ending
are very kind of different discussions.
But I do think people are underestimating just how
complicated this story is.
Like for one, like when I talk to most people,
like where did it really go off the rails, right?
They'll say season five.
Is most book fans, most most so not everyone,
like most most people will just say season eight.
But when I kind of like, you know, people are really into it,
they'll start to say season five.
And that makes sense because seasons one through four
are covering the first three books.
In season five, they have to do like feast and dance.
I think people don't quite realize just how impossible
those books are to adapt on to television.
What do you think,
do you think the fact that those stories were spread across two books
is why they had to end up killing Barristan the way they did?
I can't give an answer on that.
My question is,
until we know how Barristan story actually ends,
I can't say that for sure.
Okay, the question wasn't necessarily important.
What I was trying to prove with my point was the biggest issues
fans have with season five don't, to me, tell me,
you see, they had to do that because of the story being all
messed up between two books that they were adapting.
Fans have issues with just straight up singular decisions.
I guess you'd have to specify a little more like who is fans,
what are the issues.
Gary, just remind me if I'm missing some,
but like Barristan's death was a big issue people have with season five.
The death of Stannis, basically Stannis' whole story in season five,
people are very upset with that.
What else is there?
Because I'd have to rewatch season five.
Well, season five has hard home.
It's got Arya's first season in Braavos.
It's got Sansa being given over to Ramsay.
That's a big sticking point for people.
Ooh, yeah, that didn't work out well.
Well, yeah, Littlefinger not knowing about the Boltons was very hard
for anybody to buy.
That was a weird choice from D&D.
Yeah.
So what I'm getting at is that I don't actually consider it the source
of these issues is, well, it's tough to adapt these two books to a season
of TV.
I'm just like, oh, no, it's just very singular specific decisions
they're making that were pissing everybody off.
I'm assuming you know that the act of a Barristan like pleaded with them
not to kill him that way because that's just not.
Yeah, I do know about that.
Yeah.
You know, for one, I like I don't know.
Like I'm thinking it's like Barristan, especially also Sansa's storyline.
We actually don't know where that's going in the books.
There's a lot of really conflicting ideas in the fandom
about where she's going to go.
Barristan also, like some people swear that he's going to turn over
to a young Griff.
Other people, myself, I think he's going to be killed by the brazen beast.
It's going to get killed.
But by the like the shave paint is going to send the have the brazen beast
just kill him because he want he will have killed the child hostages.
We're getting into really book heavy stuff.
For me, like I don't you see, like, I don't know if the thing that you're
saying about singular decisions and what I'm saying are necessarily
mutually exclusive.
I don't personally love season five.
I will say I actually like season five better than season six and seven.
For me, six and seven are my real sticking point.
I think that the difficulty with adapting feast and dance is that you have
you split the books over like half the characters are in one book,
characters or another.
Some of them are in both for some reason.
That's very hard to adapt.
Like some people say, oh, no, just use the boiled leather reading list.
You just do them in chronological order.
But like, well, if you do that, then you're you're dividing up the
character arcs, right?
Like season like book five.
The reason he did it that way is that a dance with dragons would cover
John's like an arc for John Snow.
Like he would start here who start as Lord Commander and assassinated.
But if you split them up, then like then where do you like end it?
Again, this that's where the talent part comes in.
I think the idea that something is difficult to do.
You're paid to do that difficult job that that's your job is to do
something that is difficult.
You know, I agree.
You're saying that something is difficult, that it's hard to do is not an
excuse for failure.
It might be an explanation to some degree.
But again, that's where the talent and the capability come in.
Well, I agree.
Excuse implies like to me, it's an explanation, not an excuse.
But again, the idea of excuse implies that like justice needs to be
done or like if you don't if you hear that and still don't forgive them,
then that's up to you.
If you hear that and you don't like still don't like it, then that's fine.
For me, though, the place where I just kind of interject is that so a lot
of people see this and they're like, see, it's because they're idiots.
They don't know how to write.
They don't know the characters.
They don't know anything.
It's like, well, you know, George R.
Martin has spent eight years like on the last on the winds of winter.
The idea that like all D&D should have just like in a in a year done
this thing that George R.
Martin himself couldn't figure out how to do, which was keep his
characters together in one book.
But we don't have any context for exactly why that happens beyond maybe
lines from him.
What if he's busy with something else?
He's lost the passion for Game of Thrones.
What if he's right?
We only have to write.
Sure.
We have to assume.
But is it not possible that the reason is that this story is so expansive
and so complex that it's actually just very hard to adapt?
And that's not saying we have to excuse them.
But that is why I do it at all.
Yeah, it's almost like why even bring it right.
I mean, they do did do it and they did try a lot.
The thing about season five is like, yeah, I didn't love season five.
You guys seem like you didn't love season five.
Most people loved season five, like if you look at the way it's received
like, yeah, there's like, you know, there's that episode with Sansa
that really stuck in people's crop.
But for the most part, people like season five.
And, you know, I don't like season six, personally.
That's my I don't know what's my least favorite, but that's the season
that I really harp on the most.
People love season six.
The last two episodes of season six are.
Does it mean it's good or not?
Well, good is subjective to me anyway.
Does it adhere to good?
The qualities of good right consistency?
It's not in not in my opinion.
I don't know.
So it's different.
People have different qualities of good writing.
So we have a state as well.
They were offered way more time and way more season.
But they didn't take it.
They were offered that.
But they had a plan that they thought this is going to again,
I don't know.
It's also the idea that like, oh, well, they wanted Star Wars money.
So they left.
I don't buy that because they came up with the outline before they were
offered Star Wars money.
They were offered the stars money very like a couple of few years ago.
They had this plotted out.
And if they really wanted to hurt, like they spent the last two years.
I mean, you can say that they should have done it faster,
but they spent two years on those last six episodes.
And I think that's a good question.
Sure.
You can say that it's shocking.
I think it's more to do with just house.
Again, we don't like the long night maybe, but like that,
that required a lot of work.
There was a lot of shooting there.
Like the bells in the long night are even if you don't like them,
let's say they're shit, right?
They're still cinematic shit, right?
Like they, so obviously you know why that would take a long time.
And if anyone's denying that work wasn't done,
it's that the final product was low quality.
Well, yeah, that's, that's the argument.
I'm just like kind of.
Cause you might be talking to three people who don't care about if it's hard
or not. Cause I certainly don't care if it's difficult or not.
I care about the finished product.
Sure. I mean, that's when we'll,
I'm sure we're going to get back to the finished product.
I mean, you know that,
you know, they filmed the Lord of the rings trilogy in 274 days.
So it's very impressive.
Yeah. I don't know what else to say about that.
And they skipped a different animal though, uh, in terms of, uh,
I mean, they, they,
they skipped some narrative stuff that was pretty important, uh,
contextually about the ring.
But they had the, the source material.
But they, yes, they did,
but they skipped it and they still executed it well.
I, you know, after I was,
it didn't bother me at all that they didn't bring that stuff up,
uh, because it was executed properly to me anyway.
It was, it's, I love Lord of the rings.
And I thought they did a good enough job showing some of the stuff that
the ring does that they probably could have explained a little better.
And it didn't take the audience out of it.
Just because something is hard,
doesn't mean somebody shouldn't do anything.
And, uh, yeah,
I think it should be talked about that they made this decision.
Not my position at all. Right.
That, that because it's hard,
they should, they should, but like, I am saying that like, so like,
I don't know what, where are you guys are like,
a lot of these communities like free folk and like all the red,
it's like D and D are like,
just talked about like they're the worst, dumbest people on the planet.
And I think it's like,
how many people could adapt this story?
Like how many people have that talent?
How many people do you think?
How many people, yeah, I'm actually curious.
How many people do you think?
Like a percent?
No.
Oh, percent.
Yeah.
Less than one.
You're okay.
Less than one for sure.
Uh, but like everyone on every subreddit is like, I could do it.
I know.
Just do this.
Easy.
It's like, so I'm not saying that like,
complaints are invalid because it's hard.
I'm saying that like,
it's hard.
So don't act like anyone could do it.
Don't act like you have to be an idiot not to do it.
That's my stance anyway.
I think I use this analogy with Major Lee about TLJ
defending like Ryan Johnson's effort.
Just like we've got this target.
And what I think your picturing is like they've shot and they've,
they've hit just off the bullseye.
Let's just say halfway to the target.
They just missed.
And this other guy's like,
I could hit that bullseye.
And you're like, could you really though?
While I'm arguing like, oh,
they didn't just miss the bullseye D&D like shot themselves in their head
when they were supposed to hit the bullseye.
Like this is an insane degree of a miss that I would literally reroll
anybody making it again.
Like Tommy Wiseau,
I would take as long as he took the time to watch the whole show in advance.
I would, I would watch Tommy Wiseau.
I know.
But I'm unironically arguing that I think he would have had more respect
for the characters than D&D seemed to.
Okay.
If you actually mean that.
Well, I mean, just just a small sidebar,
like what would you say is the most disrespectful writing you've ever seen to
a character in just anything in your entire life from an author in anything?
You know, I did not come prepared with that.
Oh, I'm not saying if you don't have an answer, that's fine.
But I was thinking off the top of your head, you have anything.
What do you think of the last Jedi, for example?
I don't care about the last Jedi.
Okay.
I really don't.
Like it's, it's, it's something where like I,
a lot of the complaints people have, I don't agree with.
I think it's kind of a dumb movie.
I think more Star Wars again, we're not going to get it.
I think more Star Wars is just dumb.
I don't think that in your video,
you say that there are characters that you don't think were handled well.
Maybe one of those, maybe you could, are you?
All right.
Are you?
Would you ever describe this disrespectful to Arya or do you just wouldn't
use that word at all?
I would not use that word personally.
I mean, I'm not offended if people use it.
I'm not saying you're wrong.
100% of you use it, but I think that Arya, because like,
I think Arya is a character who,
and then it's like, I mean,
I probably everything I'm saying is controversial to most of the
audience, but I'll say that I think putting Sansa in the Jane
Poole storyline is less offensive than putting
Arya in the Lady Stoneheart.
Because Arya is sort of turned into this game breaking character,
right?
Like we're talking earlier, like, oh,
how does she get past all the soldiers?
Well, for a couple of seasons now, Arya is like,
I can kill anyone at any time because I'm just that good.
Just that good from a few months of training.
And I'm like, that's not interesting to me.
I think with Arya, the showrunners sort of traded out empowerment.
Like they sort of tried to depict empowerment through just strength.
Like she's tough at killing people.
So she's empowered rather than like really exploring what,
like what her spending more time with what her trauma is.
I wrote, like I had a Reddit post about Cersei the other day.
And I think that one of the biggest misses is that at the end of
season six, Arya feeds Walder Frey to his,
or these Walder Frey's kids to him and then slices his throat.
And then opening season seven, she'd killed the rest of his family.
And then D&D are like, well, this is a really dark path.
You got to wonder for Arya.
And then they sort of never have any real consequences come from that.
And for me, that's something that I think was not handled well.
It's an area where like the theme of Arya's,
of a lot of the stories, how war and how violence harms the human soul,
is sort of lost in our, like we see it a little bit in season seven,
which is season seven.
Winterfell is one of the worst stories,
probably the worst storyline they've ever done.
We see a little bit of it there.
So what was that?
I'm just happy that you'd think that's bad.
Yeah.
No, I think that's the worst thing.
Like a lot of people hate Dorne, but it's like,
at least Dorne wasn't like ended.
You know what I mean?
I will give it to you that Dorne was crap,
but I was way more upset at Sansa and Arya outsmarting little finger.
Yeah.
And not only that, but the part where Arya like,
Poe tries to kill Sansa or threatens her.
I don't even understand what those things are anymore.
Yeah.
I think that was, well, to me that was dumb.
Not because she did it, or not because she threatened it,
but because it didn't do anything, right?
If like that had had some kind of consequences,
like, oh, Arya threat, Arya leads like a,
Arya gets so against Sansa that she leads a rebellion or something or
like, I got that stupid.
But if she had done something that had some kind of consequences,
then I would maybe be interested in that.
But instead it's just, oh,
they argue a bit and it gets weirdly violent,
like in words and then nothing bad happens because they figure out that
it's little finger because of course they do.
And then it's over.
I mean, so Ryan refocus, then we talk about Daenerys.
Sure.
That's the big one.
So, uh, opening statements.
So, okay.
Someone else.
Go for it.
You go.
Me?
Okay.
Daenerys' story is sort of about how we can rationalize and support
tyrannical methods when they're being leveled against systems that we deem
abhorrent.
And then when we change our perspective and we see those,
we see those same methods being leveled against the system,
which we have more empathy for.
They start to actually look like tyranny.
So I think in that regards,
the area that people are wrong about is that, oh, Daenerys turns.
She changes completely in the last.
It's like, no, Daenerys just was who she always was.
It's just that the system is different.
I think that's what they wanted.
Um, but they didn't get there because Daenerys, it doesn't like, this is,
this, you might call this a logistical argument.
What the hell is she doing?
Killing a bunch of screaming civilians when her only issue is Cersei.
I would not call that logistical.
No, but are you asking?
So what I'm referring to is like the mapping out King's landing.
You're like, Lord mowers her way to Cersei.
Why?
Well, her issue wasn't just Cersei.
Um, I think you have to look at Daenerys and think, well,
what, what is her experience been, uh,
conquering people and then, uh, ruling.
Uh, when she takes Marine, uh,
the people rise up because they agree with her cause and they're like,
all right, we're with you.
We also want to be free.
So let's make Daenerys our queen.
And so then they, they take the city.
Daenerys is made queen.
And then despite all that, all these people come in and they're like,
well, she's not our queen and she's not from here.
And they start a movement against her.
So eventually you have to deal with that.
Um, in Westeros,
she has this issue where she's being rejected by everyone, right?
Like in the North, they're rejecting her in King's landing.
They're rejecting it.
Like the common people don't want Queen Daenerys because there's no class
consciousness.
There's no sense that, but Daenerys is selling.
We want to buy, uh,
she just doesn't have her ear to the ground on what this society wants.
Like she did in Slaver's Bay.
So what she's doing when she's, uh, she's basically, uh,
uh, bypass trying to bypass that issue.
Like, no, I'm going to rule through fear.
Uh, and in, uh,
when you rule through fear oftentimes in like medieval,
like feudal societies, like, yeah,
it means showing that you can kill civilians with impunity because if you
can do that, you are the top dog.
You're the Lord.
You're the king.
You're the queen.
I mean, feudalism is just a mafia protection racket.
I don't know.
I think living in a castle with a dragon at your beck and call would do that
just fine instead of killing tens of thousands of innocent people.
You're wrong.
Literally just under like a million.
Oh, well, we don't ever get the number, but an insane amount.
I think it would be a safe to say.
I mean, you saw the wreckage, right?
So the population of King's Landing is one million zigzagging as if the
purpose was to try and kill as many innocent people as possible.
Like as if she was doing it as if that was the goal while ignoring the
castle, which was interesting.
Right there.
She didn't totally know.
She, she fucked up that castle.
Um, but I think, but that wasn't, I think that was eventually.
Yeah.
The goal was to, uh, instill fear and, uh, essentially show herself as, uh,
someone that you do not want to cross.
Like don't try and, don't try and rebel against me.
Don't try and replace me with Jon Snow.
Uh, that was her goal.
And she was immediately assassinated by the person she thought would not
assassinate her.
Yes.
Interesting.
Interesting how that works.
That all worked for you.
You know, it didn't work the first time around, uh, it was an issue where like
when I first saw it, I'm like, no, this isn't, this doesn't, this isn't.
And then I went back and I sort of rewatched the show, uh, not the whole
show, but I rewatched certain episodes and like certain parts of it.
And my perception of who Daenerys was really changed on a second watch.
Like I really saw things that I hadn't really noticed before.
Um, and saw that like, actually, yeah, this, this person is first of all,
kind of crazy.
Um, like people say she went, I know she's, she walked into a funeral tire.
Uh, that's crazy.
Um, she had confirmation.
The fire doesn't burn here up to that point.
So she's never been in, she's never been in fire.
She's been in hot things.
She's never touched fire.
Um, well, the second she walks into it and doesn't burn, I think that's
confirmation, isn't it?
Yeah.
Well, at that point, she would actually started to burn her.
She wouldn't have just stayed there.
I mean, she set up an entire like ritual with the dragon.
She was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go in.
If she had started walking into the fire and it burned her, do you think
she would say nothing and continue walking?
I think it's, I'm not a doctor.
It's like, you're not going to hear me scream.
You don't have to be a doctor, mate.
Right.
No, I'm, I'm, I'm, it's a joke.
I'm not a doctor, but I tend to think that if people are burning, they
will naturally move away from the thing.
Like immediately.
You're just naturally aware.
So like, so like, yeah, of course I think that if started burning her,
she'd move away.
But I think a crazy person would do that too, uh, because you would,
your physical impulses would take over.
Anything that anyone could do that couldn't be justified by,
justified by saying they were crazy.
Yes.
Um, but it's, it's not just crazy, right?
Uh, or I don't, sorry.
We've that question.
Could you give me an example?
I, I don't, I don't know what something you, something that,
let me explain this and maybe I think this will answer your question.
Um, it's not just crazy, right?
It's not just like, it's the,
the basic question that, um,
The person that this person is willing to go to certain extremes to,
uh, to pursue what they believe is right.
Um, like people are like, oh, well,
Daenerys never punches down. It's like, ah, actually she has.
Uh, and people are like, Oh, Daenerys, uh, never, um,
Never tortures people.
Yes, she does.
actually like all of those things like she has done before like everything we
feel like she's landing huh focus on that third one oh which is the third one
so let's just go through the innocence she's killed oh let's say okay did she
murdered any innocence well when I said innocent I mean someone who is not
guilty oh yes in season 5 she feeds a man to her dragon to send a message but
she's under the impression that he is a man that's a part of a group that's
destroying the city she's not under she she thinks that well let me she's like
I don't know who's part of it I'm gonna gather up all the the leaders of marine
bring them here and I don't know which one of you is guilty and which one of
you is innocent it turns out all of the financiers of the Sons of the Harpy
were from other slave cities but anyway she's like well it's probably one of you
guys I'm gonna pick a random one feed him to a dragon yeah I mean when they
slavers as well so that doesn't work they have been slavers yeah there's
there's a rationale there and it's all in favor of dominating with it with a
peaceful society for the people who live there like that's your end goal
she's trying to prevent Sons of the Harpy from causing insane chaos in her
city so let's talk about rationale because remember earlier I mentioned
Walter White here it's actually way more applicable yes there is a rationale
there and when I saw it I was like you know even though that guy might not have
been guilty I'm okay with this because like fuck him he was a slaver right I'm
not going that far I'm not saying she was morally right I'm saying that from
her perspective all she's doing is for the greater good but like we feel that
impulse right but when you look at her maybe like the audience I think is meant
to like kind of understand it's a grisly scene but it is grisly but when you
think about it like did she do it just to send a message or did she just do it
because she was fed up this was right after barris and salmi died you see when
she's doing it she actually enjoys like it's kind of like a cruel and unusual
thing to enjoy that kind of suffering on other people but in a lot of cases
Daenerys does like if you look at her face when she burns people there's like
a weird satisfaction yes like as I was saying before like they didn't
explore that like Sansa when she kills yes yes I like like again that was also
in my reddit post from the other day like they didn't really explore those
well enough although I will say there is there's a bit of a difference between
like oh Sansa's like this is a person who was specifically okay wait hurt me
like this is like a person who was tortured me and I know they're good with
Daenerys it's often and it's with people who have not you just expressed
that you actually felt like a sort of fuck yeah for her to kill that guy does
that make you crazy I'm exaggerating I would never I would never actually do
anything like that I would never like support but you know like here's the
thing there's a good question actually maybe you don't know who knows no I'm
asking you I hope not but so you can't definitively say you aren't crazy you
can't say that with confidence it's subjective maybe I don't know like
really you do you believe you're not crazy right I do believe I'm not crazy
but all right people think it's good it's good to get a confirmation that's
what you think all right anyway so with Daenerys okay let's take another example
Joffrey executes Sansa's father and then forces her to be engaged to him for
political reasons right because it's like I need this to sustain my political
dominance over this country well really Cersei tells him to do that well Mary
her you'll get Winterfell if the Stark men are killed yes Daenerys executes his
Dar's father and forces him to be engaged to her that is a tyrannical
thing to do but she does it because she sees it as for the greater good yeah but
so you remember Daenerys kills the father without understanding the context
of who father is while Joffrey kills Ned Stark who's possibly one of the most
respected militaristic characters in Westeros Joffrey well first of all I'm
not saying that Daenerys and Joffrey absolutely not Joffrey is far more
statistic has no more morals or like sense of justice or whatever but from
Joffrey's perspective Ned Stark is saying that he is illegitimate and he
does not know himself oh yeah Joffrey's got a rationale yeah he's got a
rationale like Ramsey's rationale is I like causing pain Joffrey yeah yeah those
are clear so Daenerys the thing is that Daenerys might like causing pain more
than we realize is part of what I'm getting at so when this when Daenerys
takes marine Berris can sell me tells her hey look give them a trial like show
them a better way trial is important we need to establish a system of rules and
justice and she's like and he's like you know be merciful and Daenerys is like no
I'm gonna be just and so she just decides that like well these are slavers
and I am going to crucify all of the slavers because they crucified children
I for an eye so you could say that yeah she didn't know that Hizdar's father was
was innocent of the crucifixions maybe Hizdar was lying maybe things we never
know because we never know maybe she shows like instant remorse when she
realizes that when he says it whether or not he's lying she does show up I mean
she just has to believe it's debatable there's a sense that maybe she
questions her actions but she that's what remorse remember her face when one
collateral damage little person is killed yeah she locks up her dragons I
do remember that I mean I'm enjoying pain there huh she enjoys pain sometimes
she doesn't enjoy pain other time she sees the these people as her people
because they have chosen her right as people are her like these people are not
her enemies which by the time she's in King of Landing she sort of sees the
common people as her enemies because they are not rising up like the people
of marine did they have not accepted her it's it was the same in the north like
remember in like the opening shots to season eight like well may I ask how the
North King's Landing rose up against her oh no I'm saying that they didn't wrote
maybe I misspoke they didn't rise up for her you know you're absolutely right
there is a piece of dialogue where she says the people of marine basically did
it for her she didn't really have to do a lot and then Tyrion is like they
can't do it in King's Landing because they see will kill their families if
they were to do something like that and the conversation doesn't really develop
into a conclusion of a rationale it's an you can desperately see D&D trying to
shoehorn in these sorts of like hey they're not being that great the people
of King's Landing you know maybe maybe they deserve to be massacred I don't
know they're not doing great they're not doing great right now here's the thing
though is like we say it's done but this has been set up for a long time the
nearest has threatened to burn cities and multiple times in the story
threatening to and doing is yeah but that's the thing that's that's how like
tyranny sort of works like you get the threats and people on the side of the
tyrant like they're never gonna do that and then they start doing it like because
most people can draw a clear distinctions between a threat to do
something oftentimes threats are empty they're just meant to you know further a
goal in the actual execution of a threat and the execution of that threat
to a ridiculous point but who else is making those kinds of threats
Cersei? Cersei good example is Cersei the kind of person we want to say Daenerys
there will lead to the rule is John making those kinds of threats?
why would they not they're trying to rule
what is your point that the threats of that I think those threats are
meaningful and they say things about how her rationale works and I would never
defend Daenerys as a person like I wouldn't want to be friends with her like
she kind of annoys me I said this in my video I'm not a fan of her but she is
well-written as far as I'm concerned up to season eight she's very consistent
he will obliterate people she will feed them to a dragon she'll burn them to
death will never do it to somebody she considers innocent all of the people in
King's Landing have done nothing didn't consider those people innocent anymore
which is ridiculous the rationale is not there. They're literal children that's the one
thing she says she will never hurt children and she never wants to see a
child at her feet ever again so she again she threatens to burn cities did
you think that she doesn't have innocent but why is she threatening to do it
because threats are powerful without you having to do things that's the point of a
threat which actually doubles up no not just to like not just outside of
Karth where she's like again you can make the it's it's like again it's like
rationalizing like with outside of Karth do you not get what a threat is like the
point of a threat right let me let me finish outside of Karth yeah you can say
oh well she's starving her people are starving she's threatening to like try
and get these people to let her in right later she's making the threats to
Tirion like she's not saying them to anyone she's not saying them to the
flavors that she's gonna burn there she's like I'm gonna listen up turn I'm
gonna burn their cities to the like Tirion's not he's on her side like
again there's an escalation to this like it's if the idea of threats is that this
is what to get things to change like she's not bluffing to Tirion is what
Gary was saying about how like we can actually all see how we get there in the
end but they've skipped so many chapters they've skipped over loads of developing
points we've jumped way too fast you know I the idea isn't isn't foreshadowing
for holy shit she actually did it right but what I'm saying is that when she
says that to Tirion it's not a threat to avoid so when which conversation are
you talking about specifically well I'm talking about with Tirion specifically
I'm talking about season 6 episode 9 she shows shows back up to Marine and then
he's like what are we gonna do whatever and she's like I'm I'm gonna return the
slavers cities to the dirt something along those lines yeah like burn their
fleets and return their cities to the dirt so and then Tirion's like no here's
this thing about your dad let's try a different way and then then also like if
you want to keep going with it and again this was the Tirion this wasn't to avoid
violence this was she was workshopping a plan with Tirion again with Tirion in
season 7 and that's not a threat that's a promise it was I don't know if I would
call it a promise like she's saying she is going to do something threats involved
if you do something I will do this that's a threat if you're threatening to
do something threat a threat is not a committal sure I'm okay with this in
fact threats are often virtuous things to do sure I don't know threats are
virtuous things to do of course we will invade you you are using the threat to
avoid the open conflict right if that's the intent but with Tirion she's not
doing it for that reason she's actually considering it and again in season 7 she
says like well what war was won without deceit and mass murder like she is she
is buying into that system and that's the thing is referencing a lot of pieces
of dialogue about potentials while we've been referencing like actual
actions and reactions as I've referenced actual actions like we know when she
forces the dude to be engaged to her when she feeds the guy who is motivated
entirely for greater good all the people what they didn't have a great a good but
that's that's what I'm saying about rationale like we say oh it's for the
greater good like probably the greater we want an example of when she's done
something maliciously slash insane what could you be more specific has she ever
murdered someone who is innocent answer is no innocent by whose metric is she
has never done that even in season 8 she does not see those people as innocent
she sees what she did for the greater good there's a conversation between
Daenerys and Hizdar in season 5 right before the Sons of the Harpy thing show
up they show up to the dragon pit and she's talking about how one day she
might return his great city to the dirt as well and and she's like by your
command and she's like yeah and these people are because she's saying like the
fighting pit tradition is a point which I agree with but she's saying like this
form of like violence is wrong he's like well they're choosing to do this
and again Hizdar is a piece of shit but he's saying well they're choosing to do
this why are their reasons wrong and correct and to do this to you I'm gonna
cite you the episode necessary have you been down there have you seen children
little children burned I tried to make peace with Cersei she used their
innocence as a weapon against me yeah he killed innocent people in those she
murdered innocent people in that episode where she has never done it before
again by whose metric who's hers again in in her like rationale like she
literally I guess that might be she does kind of say that yeah one of the
using is she has a conversation with Hizdar abhorrent the the slave fighting
is in marine so I'm supposed to that within a season of time that she just
turns like this sorry so there's conversation are you having are you
talking about when you were talking about her conversation with Hizdar it
was around it's like during the very god damn it sorry during the slave
fights okay so she's she doesn't like all all the fighting that they have
which has been how they kept peace and marine for years and you know the
gladiators and they they enjoy it and she finds that it warrant but she okay
and we how many seasons did we spend in marine was it four five well we spent
yeah season four or half a four five young guys goes to marine so we're two
and a half seasons yeah in marine story up which is basically her learning how
to be Queen and learning on the job making huge mistakes we're buying into
this a lot of it was believable believable I agree with mauler she was
like one of the most consistently written characters even in the bad
seasons but then she just makes this turn on a dime because they didn't set it
up properly that's all I've ever been saying again the conclusion I can see
them getting to that conclusion it required two more seasons it required her
being in Westeros much longer dealing with more lords there wasn't any of that
it felt empty season eight she had and I know that the writers will say it was
supposed to be this way but I didn't buy it I personally didn't buy it she felt
like she you know we killed Varys too early and it just felt like a smaller
show because they were rushing towards the end they they were just trying to
play connect the dots towards the end and none of this stuff sold to a lot of
people including myself and we can go back and said well she smirked when this
person died so see psycho of course she's gonna burn you know a million
people in King's Landing no it doesn't make sense at all when she could have
just taken a straight shot to the castle killed Cersei and been Queen and she
could she had a doth rock there they multiplied somehow and she could she
did it you know that's the whole thing is no not a lot of people bought her
just mass executing a bunch of people so on the on on this subject one thing
you talk about like smirking and this is actually like a really important it's
actually a really important part of the story is that when we see Daenerys
which like oh everything she's doing is for the greater good we're rationalizing
that this is actually what drives a person is logic is rational acknowledging
rationale is objective factual reality when really like a person's like dry
there's all sorts of other drives that actually like drive a person so for
example like when she when she burnt feeds the guy to a dragon going the
rationale is that she's sending a message but it was it was very good in
the beginning at doing that and it stopped being good later at doing that
you know I I think it was still good at doing that like like at the end the
rationale is that she is you that Cersei is like she needs to free future
generations from Cersei right that's the rationale but future generations yeah I
mean King of Landing is a sure 90% of the future generations oh yeah we see we
see the pier later there is still people there is still people you're
right but that's the rationale but is that the
reality like is that really Daenerys really is that really what's driving her
like she seems to also have this there's this entire like personal like
emotional component to what she's doing as is with anyone like for her a lot of
it is about taking back this thing that's supposed to belong to her and her
family a lot of it is revenge for the people close to her that have been
killed by Cersei and that have been killed in this war and a lot of it is
just like again the enjoyment she gets from burning people from destroying her
enemies did she enjoy doing that at King's Landing I get the sense that on
some level there was catharsis there's a lot of assumption here yeah well we
don't see we know I'm trying to be like try not to make too many jumps so I'm
saying like what I presume because we don't see her she never says but what I
assume is that there's like a catharsis there may I ask why that is your
assumption why do I assume that because I think she gets catharsis from killing
her enemies in a lot of cases everyone from Mirri Mazdour to the tarlies and
also like when Barristan Salmy talks about the Mad King he talked about the
feeling of like like sort of the self-righteous feeling that he got from
burning people alive so you would say that Daenerys considers the innocent
people by her own words the innocent people of King's Landing to be her enemy
that deserved death yes in some respects I think something that a lot of people
maybe don't fully like accept about the story is that a lot of these characters
are not morally or ethically or logically consistent for example when you
look at who Daenerys is working with when she invades Westeros Ellaria Sand
is a child murderer yep that's right so you recommend it's still in the city and
then Tyrion says we don't murder little girls here us in the board meeting with
Daenerys at the head of it and she says that they're all they're all gonna have
to respect Tyrion yes what I'm trying to suggest here is she doesn't take the
word of the child murderer but she allies with the child murderer like
reinforcements are reinforcements there is a pragmatic reality to the situation
sure but like again like look at how she punishes the slavers and what how she
sort of like or the former slavers like after she she abolishes slavery again
the lot the rationale of like oh well she fed that guy dragon he used to be a
slaver like well Jorah used to sell slaves yeah well he's obviously redeemed
himself before she can essentially how how he would be how is he redeemed
himself for he's done by you do I have to answer that question really what is
Jorah done for Danny no I don't mean by the end I mean like right when she needs
him oh we don't know if she what she thinks of him at that point that
specific point but once he's saved her life which is what she's under the
impression of in the with the wine merchant he's pretty much right I guess
position what I'm saying is that like there's this premise that any slaver
that Daenerys or any former slaver is it's okay for Daenerys to execute them
because they used to be a slave potentially it depends on the law of the
land and the context of situation Ned Stark wanted him executed for treason he
did Ned is Ned is one of the more ethically consistent character not
totally but he's one of the more but with Daenerys like rationale though like
you were saying like we shouldn't be feeling as though it's justified with
Daenerys so even though the characters essentially looked at as the paragon in
the show would have done the same thing no I'm not saying that it's wrong to
execute people for slavery if that's the law of the land with Jorah it's like
that was the law well you do remember they're a part of a caravan or Calisar
sorry that is essentially runs on slavery at that point she can't exactly
say Daenerys herself used to own slaves yeah but she fought she fights against
it in the smallest way as possible that she can in season one I don't agree that
it's the smallest okay so the biggest way she can yeah we will ask the guy who has
not seen it I'll just and you can object the second you think I'm
representing the context incorrectly the racks you are a woman who is 100%
against slavery but you've been captured just real you you've been captured and
given to this king to essentially be impregnated and provide a son for while
he essentially rapes and pillages throughout the land and you decide that
when several women are captured to essentially be raped and enslaved that
you'll take that's not a whole context remember Daenerys starts the campaign
she tells Drogo we need to take the Iron Throne and Drogo says no and then
there's an assassination attempt and then Drogo is like I am going to murder
everybody and I'm gonna rape their women and I'm gonna tear down their houses and
she's like fuck yeah yeah yeah you're right she does agree and then when it
happens the difference between threats and actual action what does she do she
turns back on it absolutely exactly that's very morally upstanding I it's
more it's comparatively morally upstanding no that no that's a good
thing to do it is a good thing to go back on a bad action it's a good thing
other than the story it really look I agree with all that but you guys are
saying it's a good thing to go back in a bad action but there's a bad action you
agree right it's a good no I do I wouldn't agree with right it wasn't an
action in the first place it was only the thought it Brett no I think if you
like if I started like a campaign and they're like hey we're gonna and murder
a bunch of people and I'm like cool do it and then later I see it and I'm like
oh no stop I think anyone who was offended or not
offend anyone who was victimized by that campaign has the right to take
retribution against me because I started it I set it in motion she's the only
person tries to stop it she is and that's again that's good it's better than
not trying to stop it but you cannot say that she is not also of getting it
started season one is her most naive as well I agree I'm not like I like I mean
like in here I feel like there's a sense and grows from that then that seems like
good it is I buy I think there's a sense that people have is that characters gonna
have to be good or bad and there's no like again something that George Martin
says that he doesn't write like clear-cut heroes and villains all the
time he likes to write characters that do a great thing on a Monday and then a
horrible thing on a Thursday and that's really how the story functions is that
yes Daenerys saves Miriam Asdore and the other women when she sees how they're
being treated but she also got it started and she is in some ways like she
should consider it that part of what she's done when judging other people well
it is very easy for people when they say something should be done to imagine in
their head the way that it will play out and then upon seeing the reality of
what they've done immediately come to regret it and then as is a key component
of redemption and apology to take action in order to make right things that you
had a hand in making wrong and for anything these people rape and pillage
whether or not she said go to Westeros yeah but they really up to the ante
when she said go to Westeros because they that's a big campaign according to
Jorah that's not even the case they just move through town to town and if they
don't provide them slaves and women and resources then they'll destroy them yes
but that specific campaign like Jorah says that this is like this is the cost
of war this is what we're doing so this specific campaign like the destruction of
an entire like Lazarus like that and she's immediately against it yeah again
I'm not I'm not saying that what Daenerys does there isn't redemptive I'm
saying that she should have that I'm saying that if you're gonna have that
sort of like acceptance for Daenerys because you empathize with her and you
give her the chance to be redeemed you should apply that to other people like
people who this isn't so much empathy especially from my position it's just
recognizing moral actions of characters gonna establish a character yeah cuz I've
I don't I've like never watched the show pretty much pieces so I'm just assessing
this these are actions that are taken and I'm within the context that I
understand evaluating whether they're moral and I'm well morality again
subjective but like I I agree that like yeah this is really not really an
encounter to anything that I've said though but what we're talking or what
I'm talking about is if we all agree on the morality of it it doesn't matter if
it's objective oh sure yeah we can all agree on the morality all right but what
I'm saying is that Daenerys also should look at the morality of it look at where
she has been and what she has done and how she has changed and allow other
people to make those changes but she doesn't always do that so I guess the
question here is how does she go from the scenario that's been described to be
from that to what happened at King's Landing like what happened to
completely flip her around what do you mean what happened like she's people
change for reasons people don't randomly change there's always a reason
a lot of people close to her died she got the sense that she was rejected by
the Westerosi Society as seen as not the rightful Queen not valid but don't the
people hate Cersei there's hardly any work done in that regard Gary what do
you think about that in terms of showing the Kingsland the people of King's
Landing rejects Daenerys how much work did they do for that not much a few
minutes maybe if that we had Varys we a lot of that was done through Varys who
was backing her and then you know what was it third or fourth episode just like
oh I don't like her anymore I like John they did a lot of work on that in the
north yeah not really they get they had them give her a lot of stairs but then
they showed that they were actually being won over to a degree when she'd
won the war for them and we're talking about King's Landing I mean even like
John you know who he is no more stuff I didn't buy it either a couple of dirty
looks and that justifies killing a million people in a lady that's the
degree but like there's so much work that needs to be done to establish these
things instead of just a couple of looks in this particular case not really no
there's a sense like in the north first of all I don't think it was just cuz
that's me it wasn't just a couple of looks it was the looks and then Sansa
and then just then the looks given to there just like a sense that like
Daenerys was unwelcome and then and then like moving on from that like the way
Cersei basically turns people against Daenerys we see some of that in season
seven some of that in season eight like yeah people should really hate Cersei but
the if there's anything that could make people like just be distracted from
their hatred of Cersei it's saying that Oh Dragon Lady with a bunch of Dothraki
and a bunch of slave soldiers that look really they're super foreign are gonna
come in and they're gonna slaughter everyone like saying that Cersei right
didn't she she did I'm saying that that's gonna turn
people those warnings an utterly ridiculous decision that sacrifices
every last piece of dignity that character had which character and their
Daenerys they were trying to sell that what in Winterfell so people were
rejecting her in Winterfell well Winterfell is completely different from
King's Landing Winterfell people from Winterfell don't generally like people
from the south at all and maybe Daenerys doesn't understand that but
again that is an assumption we go a lot of this is rationale rationalizing an
assumption it was not portrayed well within the story and we're talking what
six episodes in season eight that's what we're discussing is these six episodes
and Daenerys turn happened in the last episode and a half generally we can say
oh she smirked here she smirked there nobody bought it again the closest thing
to a general consensus I've seen is and Olivia Clark didn't buy it yeah
then the writers well if we're taking actors than like Jamie Lannister but
we're not no no we're not saying she's an authority it's an interesting piece
of information isn't it right well I mean Jamie Lannister buying his ending
is all interesting piece of information I don't buy that he bought it so as for
people buying it I would say that a lot of people actually did see Daenerys
his turn coming yeah my wife actually said when we first start watching the
season we hope this ends with Daenerys becoming the villain it would make a lot
of sense yeah they executed it was horrifically bad I used to feel that way
then I sort of changed my mind I didn't want and then sort of at the end like I
I didn't buy it and then I went back and I watched things over and I re-contextualized it
I said I would buy it Amelia go back in time fix that and and said Amelia 100%
we'll fix that in the final edit right go Olivia Olivia Clark you have to know
that they are contractually obligated not to talk puss in your show about
their own show and they still did so again not that they're authorities but I
think that says a lot as well I don't know if I don't know if anyone's really
talking smack but that that aside because like you know actors they are
allowed to feel how they feel we don't necessarily always agree with them
whether they like it or they didn't when it comes to generous again nerd
Roddick we've sort of I think we sort of talked about this a little bit earlier I
disagree that whether people buy it is just based on like rational objective
evidence I think there is this sense that people want to say oh no I was just
being rational I like looked at all the facts and the facts don't add up to that
it's like no most people watch shows with sort of a the rooting for someone
they want to believe a certain seems to be relevant to what we've been talking
about what they're doing the talking about what certain fans out there think
about certain things isn't really what we're talking about well I mean nerd
Roddick brought up whether people bought it and I think that this is relevant to
that whether people bought it to me is a lot more based on what people want to
believe than what is objectively being shown like do you think that's the case
do I think that's the case yeah and how many people if so would you say like
more or less than half 90% or more 90% absolutely like you want you watch it
you watch Daenerys and like again like less than that like we've all we've all
acknowledged that like Daenerys has done some like messed up things right
but a lot of people like you I swear I can show you guys subreddit that do not
accept that Daenerys did anything wrong ever like they are 100% maybe I'm
exaggerating a little bit they were like so behind everything Daenerys does they
will make every single possible rationalization for every morally gray
thing she did yeah I can find someone on reddit who thinks Hitler did nothing
wrong so right I'm saying that like like is this are they right no it's like
they're do they're making those rationalize here I think that your
attempt to show that they aren't right has been very lacking the way that we
that is whether that is your opinion of course but what I know my opinion but it
seems to be backed up by everything I've heard like like which things this
whole discussion that we've been having so Daenerys forcing a guy whose father
she killed to marry her is not tyrannical I never said that well okay so
yeah killing a billion people after that's totally fine let me do the same
thing consistent with the character John snows morally reprehensible he killed a
child
is that a fair statement without context so John can you know but like that's the
thing like context is rationale right like like John first of all John
killing a child probably wasn't a good thing but like yes of course I would
agree with you that context matters but but what you've been telling Rags is
she's forcing someone to marry her and it's like why was she doing that Ellen
that too why was not before I was not doing it no no tell me why Daenerys had
someone marry her because she was trying to establish stability okay this is my
job your art why did Joffrey do why did Cersei for Sansa to marry Joffrey I
don't know why did she do that to retain power so are these things
comparable to Daenerys committing essentially a massive massacre I think
that yes or no well suffice these things these things alone no okay but when you
add up the resume add up keep going then add up the resume I'd like to hear it
all right there's a difference between by the way trying to maintain peace and
trying to consolidate power yeah I agree maintaining peace can yeah it can
absolutely didn't want to marry him she made that clear she did it for to try
and get things rolling in terms of why why did she open the fighting pits
that's a horrible thing to do well I agree with all this it's gonna try and
help seal the wounds that are between the two warring classes right now I
agree with all of this but with Daenerys there's always like sort of a dual
motivation she wants to consolidate peace she cares about again all of a
dance with dragons is about this her conflict between the Misa the mother
persona where she is the mother of all of these slave children and the mother
of dragons persona where she is the conqueror destroyer she's torn between
these two impulses like kind of a Shakespearean character and so there's
always the element of maintaining peace but also consolidating power what before
there was any slave freeing for anything what did Daenerys want the iron her was
her conquering not just a means to an end was her conquering a means to an
end yeah which conquering all of it oh we can pick and choose I guess I mean
did she ever conquer for the sake of conquering or was it to service some
other goal of hers that was the only way that she felt she could what is what
would you say is her goal oh no I'm asking it doesn't matter what the goal
is in this context in this question it doesn't matter what her goal is her goal
can be anything it's about whether or not her conquering was just a means to
carry out that goal it was the only way that she saw to make it happen I you
know I think it's a bit of both I think there is a part of her that actually
enjoys conquest I think it start it is in a lot of ways a means to an end but
that end is conquest it's like at the end what is over so conquest is her goal
here she wants conquest for its own sake her goal is to claim the iron throne
no so is she just wants to be on the iron throne or she sees being on the
iron throne as a way to do something originally it was the iron throne
itself then break the wheel came in right and break the wheel what's
interesting about it is it's like kind of a vague mantra that has some some
details we get some inclinations of what it's about but it really like reflects a
lot of like like a lot of historical like ideas that oh once we conquer this
the people will be liberated things will be better once I am in power like
it's sort of vague it's the the vague sense of like I can make the world a
better place things will be better when I am in charge but how much it's about
actually making the world a better place and how much it's about asserting
herself as a conqueror is really up to the viewers interpretation like we have
to wonder why are there any scenes that support it then are there any scenes or
anything that support the idea that she just wants to rule for powers own sake
what is what what would that I think I need more elaborate I would answer
nothing explicit and it's part of my issue that they missed that in season
eight when John addressed the fact that he's the rightful heir that was their
opportunity to explore her character and expose the fact that she wanted to rule
regardless of her rightfulness or how suitable she is to rule regardless but
they don't well I guess the first thing I'd point out is what was she doing for
the first two seasons like when when the series dies and she's like trying to
convince take the Iron Throne yeah why does she why why why does she want the
Iron Throne because her family were backstabbed and betrayed and she wants
to avenge them take back their seat of power that they created sure but isn't
that power for power's sake or is it vengeance are you saying it's vengeance
no vengeance is a motivation power is a means to obtain vengeance if you don't
have any power you can't exercise vengeance she considers it right to be
on the throne consider it she considers it right yeah I mean that's what I've
been saying I guess she considers initially what she was doing was for
survival and none of us disagree with the fact she wants to be on the throne
right well you're saying it was originally for survival was it before she
tries to get Drogo to invade before there's an assassination attempt so it
was season one survival yes one she the first time she talks to Drogo about
taking the Iron Throne is right after the series this is true of the show and the
books it's about you could say vengeance you could say an assertion of
self you could say yeah I think those are like two ways to look at it but this
is before the survival can you well I maybe this would this would be cleared
up a little bit more for me if I could be if you were going to say that you
know we're writing a documentary there's this guy named Adolf he goes from
mild-mannered painter to genocidal leader of Germany and it was you were
going to tell this story right and it's all about him and his childhood until
the very last you know 10 minutes where it's you know him becoming fewer and all
that stuff you know Holocaust things happen then I would be you know I'd be
curious to know are there any scenes that have been established previous to
that and I can point back at and say all right this is in this case Daenerys
clearly doing something that is violent for its own sake that is for power for
its own sake where she is acting either irrational from her up from her
perspective or anything that she does and you know its own context that would
lend to the idea of these the power and the iron throne and the massacre at
King's Landing these aren't the end goals or sorry that these aren't means to
an end that these are indeed the end goals of what she wants are there any
scenes that I could be directed to I'm sorry I got lost with Hitler and all
that I think Daenerys is powerful pullian than a Hitler and he did
destroy some really the point that wasn't whenever you bring up Hitler like
you know there's a lot of associations people I'm sorry if you're incapable of
seeing past that but the question I can I'm gonna I'm gonna say the last thing
that's okay you're asking are there scenes that would indicate that her goal
is the iron throne and not some kind of other means to an end yeah it's like
other scenes that pointing to scenes that would make me think that before
prior to this Derek Daenerys is clearly trying to have power for its own sake
she's not working towards a goal she is not working towards some other well
that's not actually these is all right so there's so there's so there are none of
those scenes I well I mean there is there is the again like I said there's
the scene where she tries to get Khal Drogo to invade before she's been
attacked before there's been anything what's that about you could say that
that's about vengeance and I would accept that as well you could say that's
about power I would accept that I think those are both valid rationales for
things that she wants at that time but if you're trying to say like is Daenerys
does the nearest not care about breaking the wheel no like I said before Daenerys
is like a Shakespearean tragic hero she's torn between two desires like the
one on the one hand she wants to break the wheel on the other hand she wants to
be the one that breaks like she wants it to be her she wants the iron throne now
on the books it's it's more between iron throne and the desire to have a
home so the show does change it in that regard they make her a little bit more
politically minded than like personally okay do you think it's interesting that
your reference comes from what is that like season one episode three I mean I
can would you like like like more references or something I was gonna move
on to a point to basically say that um would you not agree that a lot of him
motivation to strictly take the throne because take the throne because take
the throne comes directly from the series like she was inspired by the
series like it's heard that's what she was born to do and then as the seasons
progress she molds into exactly what emotions are which is to free the
innocent people of the world from horrible tyrants even reestablishes that
in season eight which was so stupid of them to try I like I do agree but I
think like the molding you're saying like again it's a thing where like a lot
of people expect like these linear character arcs and it's not really what
what this does it's like just go ahead and reference the scenes and stuff
instead of talking about what other people expect and things sure which
scenes and anyone that but like that one you used in season one let's go with
anything beyond like a season three I would say the scene in a based off rack
where she goes back or not it's like outside of based off rack sorry they're
on the Dothraki Sea she makes this huge speech for Kalisar referencing Khal
Drogo's speak big like rape pillage speech about how she wants to go to
Westeros tear down her enemies and their stone houses I think that's a reference
to it well I think I think everything in for the sake of like a power not
fear-threatening but to destroy houses to me that is about power right like like
she's referenced she's going back no so okay so her motivation in that scene is
exactly the same as it's been for the past few seasons of that point which is
she wants to free the innocent people of the world and she's got a tyrant in
King's Landing right now called Cersei Lannister well Cersei Lannister is not
the tyrant at that point oh well whatever the Baratheons whoever's in
current well I mean it's it's another it's another piece of evidence that
Daenerys's motivations aren't really about tyranny is that like she she has
the same motivations regardless of who's on the throne whether it's Tommen
whether it's Cersei whether it's Robert
so yeah like there is that that speech there's also the entirety of season two
right like that's before she has any free the slaves motivation at all it's
just about conquest it's just about taking what she believes is hers when
did you say that was established sorry he's in three season when was the break
the wheel stuff established when her interest in protecting innocent people
um well I don't think it was never existed I don't think she had any
impulses to protect innocent people for season three right she she had no
impulse we talked about before season three no I'm saying that's not the case
okay okay she did like she saw Mary Mazdors she had like and the the women
being raped she had empathy for that in season two you know she does feel
responsible for her her little caravan of people but I think season three is
where the liberation theology starts to develop yeah I'd agree with you she
starts seeing what's happening to people who were enslaved like the unsullied
absolutely she's disgusted with the rulers yeah yeah I mean that's
absolutely true look Daenerys is not always a bad like she's good in some
cases she's bad in others I think the world is better off for Daenerys I think
that's the question you would ask yourself at the end of the story you
think the world is better off with Daenerys for Daenerys yeah because all those
people are free in flavor we've taken post the whole show I'm talking about
the world of Westeros right yeah I do I mean like yeah all those that's bad but
like also she freed all of those dude slaves she freed millions of people of
their lives to free this King's Landing read their souls that's interesting and
that's that's the best the slave cities are actually all bigger than King's
Landing actually you know but I'm not I don't believe holy shit dude being
freed and being killed not not quite on the same level a living slave is hundreds
of thousands of people burned alive but it's okay because she freed hundreds of
thousands more right again this is like the kind of like simple I'm not saying
it's okay I'm saying that if you they just said that the world's better off
with it yes better off than not I think again this is when we look at it
pragmatically I'm saying like if let's say let's have a room full of string and
cards with these rationalizations for Daenerys I'm just imagining that in my
head again I had to tell you up like if so let's say that for every person she
burned alive at King's Landing there was a person she freed from slavery would
that come out neutral again we don't know the numbers I know you don't have
to know the numbers for this hypothetical so you're saying that it's
equal no I know I'm asking you if you think it's equal I haven't made a
judgment I'm confused are you asking I'll just say it again it's quick I'll
say it again it's quick so let's say in King's Landing she burns alive 10,000
people let's say before that she freed 10,000 slaves is that does she come out
neutral I don't I don't think I think that's like a we yes I don't know like
that's that's like a weird like it's a strange scenario question but it's a
strange scenario one that you've already evaluated in my mind she did not kill a
million people in King's Lane that's not many how I interpret those things
did she free probably a lot more than a million think so all right yeah I do
part of this might be the the book seeping in and my expectations for the
books but no I do think that she like again I'm saying it's like a net positive
I'm not saying that anything she did in King's Landing was right but also like
you know like she was it we can we could just change it let's say that she
burns 10,000 people alive but she saves 20,000 slaves she converts them from
living slaves to living free people I don't think I don't think come any human
being can do math with human lives in that way all right is it better like
when innocent people what is it better to save one innocent person's life or
ten innocent people's lives I would say ten yeah I thought you couldn't do math
again that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about like like come on like
like I'm not gonna say like oh would you kill five innocent people to free 20
innocent people like that's like a weird like when it's that specific math then
it's weird and dehumanized because we're dealing with two ambiguous
populations so for the sake of finding out whether or not Daenerys was
ultimately better if we just say all right since we don't really know the
actual numbers let's say the numbers are the they're both equal then what
happens like is the value of a person's life more valuable than a person's
freedom I again I don't I don't know like that's not something that I think
any one human being should decide for other people it's not deciding for the
people it's it I'm just asking for your right my opinion I don't know okay
depends on the conditions of the flavor you know just now and you said that the
world was better off because again this is based on my interpretation of the
narrative and what I see I think there is a huge long-term net positive in
King's Landing or not in Slaver's Bay across multiple cities and then there
is an atrocity in King's Landing that's so it's like again morally gray character
good bad thing here good thing here overall I think probably she did more
good than bad but I don't know
I think this is the kind of question like individual people are supposed to
wonder for themselves was Daenerys like was the world better off for Daenerys
what was it not well I think I think I know Gary what do you know I know I think
the only people are the only question people were asking themselves after this
were worded by eight years ago how can I mention that all the carnage that took
place after she freed the slaves not necessarily by her fault but those
people didn't stay freed in every case or healthy people which people this
slave is cities that were taken back while she was gone they that resulted
well didn't it right well but we presume that by the end death took place thanks
to her both the liberation and the retaking by the end they've they've been
liberated like the Bay is renamed on this topic I'm sorry so the point was
about Daenerys like she's sure not committing murder to anyone who's
innocent was the main point I was making he only ever does it to an insane degree
it's way too off the map for her character and it's why I would attribute
the majority of fans in terms of character betrayals were upset I've
referenced this before it's undeniable 100% objective evidence that cannot be
defeated my dentist didn't like it I mean your dentist didn't like it my mom
liked whatever like that's not a dentist outranks a mom everyone knows that's
objective truth God said oh yeah it's practically a doctor how do you know my
mom isn't also a dentist because you said my mom you didn't say my dentist mom
maybe she's not my dentist it's unethical you wouldn't trust your what
you wouldn't trust your own mother with your teeth you can't have a you can't
operate on your own children it's not like a thing no it's like a law like I'm
asking you they're saying about the law this ain't about the laws about you my
mom is a legally upstanding citizen so if Daenerys came in and killed all the
dentists in your town I wouldn't trust most legally upstanding citizens my
teeth that I don't want to see your teeth then what you think I can find a
random person on the street and say all right give me a give me a get rid of my
cavities or replace my tooth and they'll do a good job all right but yeah so like
with Daenerys I think to me it seems that people whether people buy into her
action or not is directly proportional to who they thought she was before and
who they thought she was before varied a varied a bit but there had sort of been
in the last couple years sort of like a a mass appeal sort of like accepting
that Daenerys is just a good guy there's just does good things and she isn't
capable of tearing I've not spoken to anybody I don't know there somewhere I'm
sure in any if you take any audience for any show you'll find some percentage of
people who think anything about anything but I've in all the stuff that I've seen
I've never found people who say that Daenerys is incapable of tyranny and
she's incapable of bad stuff they exist they're out there somewhere I just think
that you would be surprised how because again one of the like probably central
questions to this debate is how much are people's opinions based on like rad
rational objective proof and how much are they based on feelings like how we
feel about this character how we want whether we want to believe in this from
one of these things they develop those feelings what well from what do you
think they develop those feelings you natural human psychology you want to
root someone you want to believe in something I think why don't people why
don't people people today root for Hitler because he was shitty all the
time all right no time he's nice to his dog the point is that there are things
that he does his dog like he know his dog was innocent don't fuck his dog his
Hitler didn't free slaves like fuck no here he was trying to make is that
there are reasons why we generally think of people the way that we do the actions
and this show the scenes that they're in the things that they do the stuff that
they say the reaction to events so even if people have an emotional opinion of
this character that's generally informed by something that they see of course
like I said there there are reasons for pretty much everything they're not
necessarily rational but they're always for everything that the point of the
story the point of the story is to get people to like be it to root like
sympathize with and root for Daenerys is like tyrannical behaviors until they're
turned against the audience so this idea that like oh what people rooted for
her so she that must mean they were right to root for people's feelings are
always right no was there anything that she had done before this that was
comparable to what she did at King's Landing in terms of scale or in terms of
morality and both they go hand in hand no I think I think it's well yes and no
I think that scale she's no right cuz she's never so do you think that if she
had let's say that the show had played out in a different way and Daenerys had
done this let's say in the last season do you think that people would still be
rooting for her now she had done this a season ago if this is something that she
didn't need to be more specific I don't really understand that if Daenerys had
committed the massacre at King's Landing last season do you think they
would have turned against her or kept rooting for her I think they would have
turned against her absolutely all right so people's rooting for someone is very
much reflected or sorry influenced by the things that the character does so
people say they wouldn't dream of disagreeing with her yeah so the things
so apparently if people are rooting for her up to this point then she's
tearing down evil system all right what evil system was she tearing down with a
mass slavery slavery is an evil system and she was tearing it down where's the
slavery in King's Landing I'm not sure this legit question because I don't
understand well people have debated this right like there are some people who
believe that Daenerys is Daenerys his campaign in Westeros actually like a
liberation campaign in which she sees the evil of feudalism and is trying to
undermine it or undo it that's not agreed upon by everyone but that's a
sentiment I've seen from a lot of people definitely in the books like Tyrion
likens the the state of like he sees like slavery is just like slightly worse
than feudalism or something like that like not necessarily like with the
unsullied or whatever so let's say in King's Landing this so I guess there is
a feudalist system there yes Game of Thrones does have feudalism all right so
in in King's Landing specifically I suppose how does excuse me how does the
accents that how does the actions that she take against the people here about
system that she finds tyrannical or oppressive it cements her rule
you couldn't have done that in any other way how does that fix it though well she
tried to do that a different way in marine can I ask you an honest question
right now if episode 5 have played out that she flew over directly to the Red
Keep and we had a cheesy shot where she even looks through the balcony right at
Cersei in the eye and then sends fire into the room it like cycles through all
the room blows up all the top buildings and she flies up and spits fire down
until the entirety of the Red Keep is exploded bits of rock and fire hit some
innocent people is screaming and then the next episode plays out exactly the
same would you have accepted that as believable yes as would I there you go
that that I think I would have again like to different establishes power
pretty well burning down a different dragon well I mean yes but like
different things can be believable I agree with that I was watching that I
think I should be pretty convinced I mean I should remind you guys that like I
didn't believe it the first time around I like rewatched it reconsidered my
perspective and then came to believe
like it's not so we've established there are other ways that she could have done
this that would be more in line with previous things she's done I instead of
total massacre well I don't know about yeah I mean I guess I don't know about
more or less in line but again the place where I disagree there is I don't know
that if she had never committed massacres before then not committing a
massacre here would be in line with previous actions sure but by that logic
I'm sorry you broke up could you repeat that sorry by that logic no one would
ever do anything new right no no no you can do new things that are not
necessarily contradictory to your own nature essentially well first of all
again like I said a lot of these characters are hip single it is in her
nature because we see every aspect of this play out in some way is that has
Daenerys done crazy well the issue isn't necessarily us torturing people we
have not established anything crazy we've not established that I've heard
rationales for why she's done I think the funeral pyre was crazy no we
established that it wasn't crazy I did not establish that no I cannot kill her
so she doesn't as a ritual doesn't determine she is okay so in the books
you know there's the guy Arianne bright flame no books we don't have to talk
about the books but I'm just as like an example I might as well use something
that's not even in a song of ice and fire but I'm using this because I know I
tend to think about a song of ice and fire so in the books there's a guy Arianne
he drinks wildfire because he thinks like it won't kill him that's actually
the show oh yeah they do mention it but it right it's in the show it's in the
books whatever he drinks wild crazy right not necessarily does he believe
that he has a rationale yeah if he believes he's immune to it that's not a
crazy thing to do I would say believing that you're immune to fire is crazy not
at all no but she doesn't know until she tries it and then when she confirms it
she carries on she confirmed that it happened she's like I am reparation for
something you asked you the same question when you presented this like an
hour ago if she was burned hideously by the fire do you think she would have
continued to walk into the pyre she would been physically unable to continue
to walk in congratulations you agree no but I'm saying that is crazy building a
funeral pyre with the intent to walk into it is crazy no it isn't if you
believe that you're immune to the fire but you're crazy no it isn't but she
is immune to fire how is it crazy if she literally confirms it to be true but
she didn't know she doesn't have dreams that is crazy whoa whoa whoa whoa it's
more than just dreams she doesn't get burned by the hot water and she doesn't
get burned by scolding hot rock he believes you cannot burn the dragon
that's again that's just again that's also you arguing that every religious
person is insane then I believe any religious person that does I like and
I'm trying to come up with an insane example like I don't like the road you're
heading down here you can't do this what road I'm I'm fine with this like I think
but I don't know like if you what's a crazy thing of never mind I don't want
I don't want to insult anyone's religion no go for it man I'm an amortan no I I
really don't I don't know what like a like any I guess I'll just use this as
an example anyone who like decides like you know what I think I'm immune to fire
I'm gonna like walk into fire and I'm gonna be fine I think that's crazy all
right what is person been immune to being burned previously not from fire
but from extremely hot things from extremely hot things yeah sure
interesting so is this a world where magic exists it is interesting but again
no no targeting established no Targaryens have been immune to fire in
this world right and in the books Daenerys isn't immune to fire she's never
in the mantra that you guys did fire cannot burn a dragon and Targaryen is a
dragon sure but it's like a metaphor there are Targaryen literally that is a
part of which is crazy that's not crazy taking that shit literally is crazy she
hears something no accepting it at its word arguably crazy but there's more to
it than that from what I hear I'm skilling water doesn't burn her hot
rocks don't burn her again like she has dragon blood or something she's but
like there's no Targaryen that's ever I don't know dragon blood is like a weird
fan so there's no Targaryen that is in the history of this story that has ever
just walked into fire and not burned right and in the books she none of us
set up stuff even happens she's just crazy enough to walk in she has dreams
and the dreams convince her that she won't burn if she goes into the fire
like this is a character that is like established as like being on the line
like online like is that crazy is that not crazy so to see her do something
that's like also on the line do you have any other examples of her being crazy
and I'm not saying you don't but if you didn't all you have is something that
you're desperately trying to interpret as crazy to justify her insane actions
I think that feeding someone to your dragon is crazy you already established
exactly why she did that and it worked just the act of the dragon but what why
did she do that trying to threaten and squash out the actual leader of the
sons of the harpy is that the only reason why do I have to so as rag said
earlier what action can a crazy person not do I'm that it's contextual depends
on the context what yes I'm what I'm trying to get across there is that she
answer trying to intimidate the son of the harpy is the rationale the real
reason she does it is because she's angry at about Barristan Sami's death
and wants to lash out someone I want to ask you a question that's a bit more
meta for a second we can go both but love to yeah I think we talked a lot
about Daenerys we can go through you said that um a fandom could be
identified as toxic potentially when they like conclude poor writing without
like further inspection or introspection sorry they and they're assuming that the
writers are at fault when it may very well be that they're not so by that
logic could we say that a fandom is being toxic when they conclude strong
writing without further introspection that may be required and they assume the
writers have succeeded where they didn't only if that leads to you being
rude or negative or like like abrasive towards other people so that that
actually does like there are fandoms negative right like being negative like
calling people like you're an idiot you're like fuck you like you know that
kind of stuff right like chasing people out of like fan communities like like
there's a difference between like a lively debate of the facts and like fuck
you you're an idiot you don't get understand anything blah blah blah but I
agree actually that can happen because there are fandoms that are so they stand
so hard for their what it's a video game it's a movie or whatever that they are
extremely negative to anyone that they're extremely negative and rude and
abrasive to anyone that criticizes it so I agree that yeah that can happen
okay then yeah yeah I again I just think that's fandom and we're broad
generalizations aside when it comes to Daenerys Game of Thrones season 8 which
what we're talking about here and why I believe it wasn't a sick well it was a
successful season as far as ratings but there's success can mean a lot of things
a large portion of the fan base was not happy with this because they didn't buy
into that story and while you have gone back and found some things that convince
you I'm not going to assume that other people and I've watched each episode
multiple times I feel like I know maybe I'm just a big dummy now I always
consider that now you sound smart but but I don't buy what Daenerys did because I
think it's a huge leap to kill there's 500,000 people in King's Landing I don't
know how many people she killed but it didn't seem to make sense at all within
the context of the story because they didn't take the time needed which they
have done before to go back to my point earlier they spent two and a half
seasons in and marine that made sense they needed at least that in her in her
in King's Landing meeting other lords trying to politic a little more failing
a little more and you know it does and then we have to have other characters
being destroyed really played into her destruction as well like Tyrion being
written like a complete idiot in the last three seasons taking away some of
his best work in my opinion in the books when he basically you know when he
frees himself from being a slave because he's just a pure survivor he
plays the game there they could have adapted some of that put it in there and
that would have helped Daenerys storyline instead of him just being a
moron throughout the whole thing and just didn't sell with me and we can go
back and and establish there's nothing that establishes her children in the
streets of a city mowing people down as molar said she did switchbacks she was
going back and doing switchbacks and this was all but as I think we've
established here is she's always had motivation she's always had she's always
felt she's had this divine right and she could have felt like she had the divine
right to the Iron Throne and I could have bought it if they would have sold it a
little better a lot better and it needed a lot more time and I think we
already have people admitting who within the show and more will admit it over
time that they rushed it and who admitted that we had a director
Sapoknik just recently said that it might have been rushed or was it was
Sapoknik or the maybe was the guy who a particular absoater here I'll pull up
the article right now but and Game of Thrones director emits finale was a bit
rushed what's the actual quote there's often like those headlines often like
you know sensationalize what they actually said the game so no no no
Marshall while director the key episodes of Blackwater the watchers on
the wall he admitted it would have been difficult to question showrunners Benny
off of David Weiss when it came down to the a few installments it's very
difficult to second-guess those guys because they are geniuses and they have
done such an amazing job he told the Metro UK inevitably I would have taken a
different approach to directing on the greatest experience I've had blah blah
I would have definitely added my strategy and knowledge to that
particularly about battles and scenes I agree with a lot of the criticism that
it was really rushed this was Neil Marshall so that's a director from a
previous he's not he wasn't on you know I agree like I don't love a lot of the
what happens in the long night episode on totally disagree with Neil Marshall
but yeah he was absolutely rushed they needed to spend more than one episode on
the Night King he wasn't involved in the final season so no he wasn't but he
was a director for Game of Thrones okay that so does that make season 8 not
rushed again do you think season 8 would you think season 8 was rushed or not no
I think they spent two years on season 8 I would have preferred I don't care how
much time they spent on it within the story do you think this story oh you
mean like I don't I think I would have added an hour to season 8 and two hours
in season 7 yeah or not an episode I would have added one episode season 8
and two episodes season 7 thought about the plot I don't think it needed but
then again if you talk like how far back I can do it give me season 5 and season
6 I would change a lot but again that's just me I'm just a guy on the internet
like I'm not so am I I don't necessarily like what I think would be
better might like might not be feasible in a screenwriting sense that just I'm
just saying like that's my opinion I would add everything I think a lot of
stuff played into it I think you know HBO offered them more time and money yeah
but HBO had their own reasons for that they want to make money that's the sole
purpose of doing this show yeah I like I'm personally not you know I don't
agree with some things people say about extending I do want to ask you guys I
assuming this is something you guys and I cannot you know not everyone cares a
whole lot about this kind of thing what do you believe that was like the message
or what did the ending mean what do you think or what do you think was trying to
mean like what were they going for end of Game of Thrones yeah what was the
theme and I mean you could say it with a word but I think like like what was the
conclusion like what was the thesis of the ending with King Bran and if you
yeah with King Bran with Daenerys's downfall with like all of it
well and again if this isn't a discussion I know some people don't
discussion they think it's I think you can draw several different sort of you
can run with a lot of things right but what is it to you like what what do you
drop most full like I haven't when you think they were going nihilism nihilism
out of it yeah well it was also very anti-war George R. Martin's been pretty
open about how anti-war he is and it was basically and for me for one the
message was conveyed poorly in my opinion that's what's making me stutter
I'm like it's so blurry whatever the message wanted to be in the first place
right yeah but you can you can or maybe you don't have one but like what do you
think this modernism nihilism war is bad and you know yeah like that's it with
Daenerys I would assume they were gunning for like look how good people
can lose their way with with John they're like look how the righteous have
to make decisions that even they don't want to in order to maintain to their
principles with Tyrion they were like look how a smart person can be stupid
like there's a lot of stuff around there you could probably draw I just don't
think that a lot of it was executed very well it's your expectations being
subverted that was it it lost its message in my opinion probably much
earlier around five or six I do think it's interesting that people say
nihilism because George RR Martin is so not a nihilist he's been like really
open about that he's a romantic matter with it right I just I just think that
it's interesting that that's Martin might not think he's a nihilist but I
think I think reading a song of ice and fire and like everything I know of it's
like very romanticist well it's in there too also he's a bit of a maybe an
absurdist but mostly I think he's a romantic I think that's something that's
projected pretty well by the end was a song of ice and fire Rome you've read
it mauler was that a romantic tale as I see it as a tale of war I don't see how
there are individual stories of romance in their degree are you talking about a
more metaphorical like romance with life or life with itself or be like
narratively romanticism like th white I think it like it like upholds like
romantic value I still don't catch what you're really saying for example like
nature versus society it leans on the side of like the idea that society has
made us sick and it kind of glorifies nature of it like the idea that like
children have like inherent like wisdom it's very it kind of published that a
lot especially with Bran also kind of a blanking right now but definitely like
most of all like the way it's oh yeah individual freedom like authentic
authenticity is more existentialist idea but like the idea of individual freedom
versus like following tradition the idea that traditions and society and
these things are what make people sick not human nature I'm not I'm not I don't
think that's what sickens these things some of these things overlap but I do
think that when you add it all a lot of romantic he's very for believe it or not
for like emotionality instead of and like the soup daddy of the supernatural
the ending conveys that actually pretty well how Westeros sort of turns to a
supernatural ideal how the maesters and the Iron Bank are these like really like
rationalist civilized institutions actually fail what about that ending
would be inspiring I mean if we're talking about specifically like if we're
talking about like yeah inspiration individualism a lot of feely stuff very
yeah a heightened importance on subjectivity I mean if that's what we're
using for romanticism then it's post-modernism well it could but the whole
story I'm sorry like I'm being really brass tacks I suppose right now but like
I would go as far as saying it's the opposite of inspiring the ending to that
show it is downright downtrodden like nihilist is what I would actually call
it before inspiring sure the idea the hundreds of thousands of people going
through all these kinds of wars and disputes in King's Landing ended up
getting burnt to a crisp Jon Snow got sent back to where he started
Santa just wins Winterfell okay Arya's like this heroic adventurer when she
was surely set to be cut like maybe that that parts inspiring pretty arbitrarily
though well you know in spot inspiring isn't this is necessary romanticism but
like you know inspiring it's like romanticism obviously you hated the
ending you're not gonna be inspired by I just it's impossible but no I think the
ending is inspiring I love it I think there are like things about the ending
I really love especially with regards to Bran and Tyrion and I guess so I guess
I'm just I was curious about that cuz like for me one thing that I think you
should do when you criticize something is like it's to understand it is to
understand what it was and what it was going and to me I don't see a lot of
people like it didn't have a message D&D are stupid there is no message they
don't care about message there's no message there I hate it but I think that
there is a message there to understand and I think that if you see what that is
you still might not like it but you should try to see what that is if you
want to you know you poured I think a lot of people try it they just can't pull it
from what's actually in there would you say that whatever message you are
seeing there whatever it may be does it trump any of the execution because of
the message alone for me personally sure or for everyone cuz I can't speak for
everyone I happily believe that a message a lesson or theme or an idea
that's being drawn from the content that's you can get a lot that are
completely subjective that are based on very minute details that might not even
corroborate but well I guess what I'm asking is for you personally these this
message you've drawn from it it just it trumps any element of it could it could
trump any reference we could possibly have I imagine or an inconsistency
the word Trump is odd here not not because of the president someone pointed
out in the chat just because I don't read that if you'd like like so it
whatever you've you've seen as the theme it can't be broken by any element of the
scripts being inconsistent necessarily because it's such a powerful message it
it hasn't yet from my for me from my we're asking can it hypothetically like
can can media fail to support its own theme yes yes I do think media can fail
to support its own theme in this case for me I don't think it did I don't think
that people have any idea and not because I don't think people are smart
enough to get it I think everyone is I think like most people are smart enough
to get it I just think that people don't want to get it and aren't trying
because they for one reason or another like there are things that let them down
and they don't want to like it I mean I don't know that many people are gonna be
concerned about potential message or theme when they feel their characters
have been betrayed like the it's not even gonna be coming into the back of
the head of that point yeah but that's the thing like for me the characters
weren't like but it sounds like a combination from you that they're not
doing it it's like why should they do it I don't know if condemnation is the
right word I think that if you want to have like a scholarly academic I know
that sounds kind of pretentious but that kind of a debate about a story or like
something like substantial it's good to understand it like you wouldn't like
talk about Animal Farm without knowing that it was trying to be about like
communism and sort of like the rise like Stalinism and all of that I think it's
it's good it might be a quality of if we're taking a story like Animal Farm it
would be a quality of its writing that you could reach similar conclusions
about the message even if it's completely removed from you know
communism in the USSR and stuff like that that seems to me like it would it
would just it would just be a quality of the book and the right I mean I mean like
I don't I don't I agree I don't think that like Game of Thrones is directly
allegorical to anyone of course there's some War of the Roses there's some
bubonic plague there he Martin draws from a lot of different historical
events but yeah I do think that people should try to figure out the message or
try to come up with something like I think I found that like a lot of people
that's why people like this show I think they because it was released weekly it
was a water cooler show you saw all the sites that were involved with the show
get huge numbers YouTube channels get you know Preston Jacobs gets huge
numbers people wanted to know they wanted to know the lore they were into
it they bought into it all I'm saying is the writers did not that well they don't
because the writers weren't consistent the people behind the show creatively I
don't care what their intention was they might have tried their best and I don't
think it's a very good tactic to come out and say well people didn't try to
understand it that sounds a lot like a the episode was too dark well you didn't
adjust your television yeah it's like whoa wait a minute I bought in your show
I read I read your lore I you know how much work am I supposed to do to watch a
TV show and when I when I do all the work then I'm told I don't understand it
no I understood it I understood it just didn't work you know I I don't think it
is a lot of work I think that it's just work that people are you're having to go
back and rationalize I mean you even yourself then you went back and no but
the thing is it's hard to get a singular message because I don't think there was
supposed to be a grand singular message for Game of Thrones and if there was
they lost the plot I think there was to the ending so brands coronation
Tyrion gives his whole speech about stories right and a lot of people saw
them like that's dumb stories don't like like people don't care about stories
whatever but what it is with that scene is there's a scene in season three in
which Varys and little it's one of the better seen this where chaos is a ladder
comes from Tyrion and Varys are debating what is the realm what holds people
together what is what is it all about and both Littlefinger and Varys sort of
agree that the Iron Throne is a story like it's an object but it's also a
story that carries a certain like weight that has certain implications and it
defines the realm and it's a story and when you look at what that story is like
it's a story of conquest of domination of might makes right and this is like a
pretty important scene and they you know chaos the ladder comes from it blah blah
blah so in this way like to me like the Iron Throne is George RR Martin's one
ring it's like the central object of power that defines the series like it
doesn't have any magical power but it does psychologically affect people like
it's lure the idea that it represents and more than anyone it affects Daenerys
and it affects the way she looks at power and the way she looks at choice
and the way she looks at making the world a better place and it's her goal I
mean she says it so at the end the Iron Throne is destroyed it's melted kind of
like the one ring it's in an accident it's like Martin's reverse you
catastrophe and the realm is left without the realm is left without any
anything holding it together and so there is this great council and Tyrion
decides to redefine the values of his society by interjecting a new story and
he uses the story of Bran because it's a story that preaches the exact opposite
values it's a nonviolent story it's a story about vulnerability and resilience
and yeah I understand that I fully believe I don't know this for a fact
that that whole speech could have come from George RR Martin and because it's
called a song of ice and fire a song is a story it just stuck out like a sore
thumb because it didn't fit it wasn't executed well at all
Tyrion how is he even alive I mean this again this is something that's been
grounded they explain things but we're not gonna explain why we're gonna let
this prisoner just all of a sudden decide who's king and talk well Tyrion
I mean the unsullied John is the big question the question is why is John or
I mean I guess with John you could say he's alive because the Northman was
gonna say there's more reason for John to be alive than Tyrion either of them
should be alive though well Tyrion like what did he really do he threw Jamie
Lannister it was the trait of the Daenerys well that's not really like
freeing Jamie Lannister isn't really a cap capital offense we don't know who
knows that he did that what do you mean you don't know well who knows who knows
that he freed that it was Tyrion that free Daenerys says that Daenerys says
it but Daenerys is dead I wait you think they didn't tell anybody despite the
fact that she put him in jail who knows if she told it's it's her hand to the
king maybe she was like oh shit no we really do and like Tyrion at the end he's
sort of just like a pariah but I don't necessarily like for me the big question
is like why do the unsullied leave John there like yeah they're Northman there
and maybe it's like a standoff situation and maybe they decided I could then I
said I would add one episode that's the kind of stuff that I wanted more
elaboration on is the lead-up to this counselor someone said in chat or
mentioned this in chat would you say that the room is good because it
successfully conveys the theme of the consequences of betrayal the what the
room the room oh the room yeah no all right all right I just don't think I
don't think those are comfortable I think that's hi mark silly don't think
so it's it's successfully portraying a theme I think the room is good cuz it's
hilarious like like I don't I don't yeah I just don't think those are
comparable for me like it's not successful portrays the theme the
characters are all well executed with maybe the exception of Arya and buck
brawn I think brawn is annoying and just I don't like brawn I like I like
everything that happens with John I like that he
I like that he gets sent back to the wall I think all of that is exactly right
story I think it actually to me it does make sense that they would choose Bran
everyone says that like oh it doesn't make brand yes it does
Bran is the opposite of Daenerys like they are terrified by Daenerys they're
terrified by this tyrannical overly powerful foreign authoritarian here is
like Bran Stark he looks harmless as fuck and he represents all of the
opposite values of course they're gonna pick brand also the deck is heavily
stacked in brands favor like half the people in that council no
Bran and either like or agree with Bran as a person
which like makes sense that would be George R Martin's ending you have this
like anti-war narrative and he ends it with like a kid all make sense if they
would have I mean because it doesn't make sense within the context of the
show all why you why would you let a stark being I just want to go into all
of the reasons why that council scene okay so there's one thing in the entire
show I I do agree that Sansa becoming Queen doesn't nothing makes I think the
whole North secedes after Bran becomes King that's my real sticking point and I
know why they did it I don't agree with it I don't think it works I think it
fucks the scene up but I will agree that with that the North leaving and then
making a northerner the king does not make
yeah I've like I said I'm just I don't really want to go through every element
of the of the council scene because I'm a little bit worn of debating for this
long let's that's that's oh yeah there's been a while yes I a more important
question I think that trumps every question we've had here tonight is why
did you have Christmas music at the end of your video you know I I wanted to try
monetizing suit that would be like and I was like I don't what what can I use I
was like fuck it I'll use this you tried you added music to try and monetize no
I wanted to monetize and I didn't want to use any music that had copyright okay
I was like what is their fuck it here we go well enjoy the world well we
enjoyed it I did not see that coming in August as well yeah well I don't really
celebrate Christmas fuck it and it's whatever fair enough rags Gary's or
anything else you'd like to say um I guess one last thing yeah when we
watched your video there was a quote you said it is fan entitlement that
causes literally 100% of misunderstandings being blamed on the
writers at no point are most people accepting that they might have been
wrong about anything is that something that you you stand are you down with
that is that something that you would still say you accept literally 100% is
probably too far I think there are some people who do accept some you mean
literally figuratively I did it's the thing that happens it's okay how you
doing there rags loading I'm fine I'm I'm tired that's all good well obviously
yes and is there anything else you'd like to talk about or press you know I
could I could go on for another 10 hours I'm very very practiced at talking
about too much so but yeah no I you know everyone at the end of the day is
gonna feel how they feel and maybe five years from now you watch it you hate it
even more maybe I hate it hate it more maybe five years from now watch it it's
not so bad and the day it's like I appreciate you guys having on to talk
about it so it's fun I think it is an underrated piece of fiction and I think
there is a really vocal group that is against it and I think there's a lot of
people who like the ending who are probably not as vocal and probably not as
visible that a lot of people don't realize well I mean I appreciate you you
coming on and it was it was brave and I respect the effort I've got nothing to
lose it's fine it's it's whatever it's YouTube well I hope you haven't felt
that we were too hard or anything I think that it was a it was a good
discussion if anything you guys should have been much harder come on like this
is compared to get on reddit free folk like see what that is well we had a whole
we have a whole what our intention was we started out there but our plans
quickly turned into something more freeform but we have this whole list
here of questions regarding not even necessarily things that are specific to
Game of Thrones but about writing and thematics and execution and fans and all
sorts of stuff but it did go into a lot specific stuff about the show but that's
that is fine things just go where they end up going yeah I mean if you're ever
like you ever feel like another like exhaustive discuss bring me back to talk
about those things if you're like fuck this guy you're also free to not do
that but yeah no I had fun there's characters that Cersei is another one
real good character we didn't get to talk about oh I mean she looked out
windows really well it's drink wine okay there's plenty more we could probably
talk about I was just gonna say I'm trying to I mean that's that's the point
of Cersei story is to make us feel bad like make us think we want someone to be
brought down in like a violent terrible way and then when it happens you feel
bad no that's that's good though she was that's all of it person from what I
understand she was a very terrible person but then I'm glad the sparrows
make her walk naked and it's super misogynistic and and creepy and and is
it misogynistic cruel yeah the walk of shame is misogynist would they do it
would they do men not have to do the walk of shame no oh they don't
I don't know if it's established I don't think that's established in well
then it will say this then we'll say this then if only women do it sure sure
if women only women are made to do it sure but if both men and women have to
do it not misogynist so depends on whether or not men have to do it in the
show there is another man who is guilty of something and they punish him
differently so there's a man who's guilty of like homeless having sex with
another man so they like they brand him they brand him with a with a star oh
shit that's that's that's worse worse than you think
right that's that's fucking worse that's not misogynist that's the opposite well
I don't know like I would much rather walk through the street
snake it gives people something to fucking ogle then I'd be branded man she
got off easy that's the opposite of misogyny well it's you have to look at
the context of it like Cersei's punishment is very gendered it's not
being branded well there it's also that he is committing himself to become a
sparrow and all of the sparrows actually brand them
so he commits to become which is his avenue as punishment and reprieve he has
to denounce everything he's about his lands his titles and also being gay
yeah that's way worse than just taking a walk naked yeah but that's because
that's how he chose to deal again it's just chose or was coerced a coerced I'm
sure yeah well I mean really not really a choice in that Cersei is also coerced
and we also have to bear in oh no actually we have to bear in mind
Cersei doesn't actually suffer her punishment because she blows everyone
out so what Cersei's walk of punishment was actually yeah I know we've been
wrong no Cersei the branding is Loris's punishment after his trial Cersei never
goes to her trial she yeah but Lancelot also never gets to be free well Lancelot
sorry Loris oh yeah it's like conscripted the idea is that she can
leave the sept Cersei as long as she does the walk of shame first he never gets to
leave he's enslaved there until he's branded yeah but in the books there's
no there's no walk of shame for men the walk of shame actually in the books I
know this is the books but it's actually Kevin Kevin Lannister who is the real
like mastermind behind it like he kind of brick makes the deal with the sparrow
because it's one he brokers a deal he brokers it yeah but no Cersei society
too so yeah very yeah it's going to be very patriarchal because that's the
historical context of it very true but yeah I think Cersei story has done
really well sorry I'm extending this because I want chocolate no it's fine
and that's the thing that I think a lot of people I didn't really I first I was
like oh that was like a wet fart like Cersei just gets crushed by rubble then
I went back and I'm like yeah the point of Cersei story is that every time she
gets punished every time she suffers we're supposed to feel bad about it it's
like the Black Mirror episode white do you do you did you feel bad every time
she was punished yes mauler a walk of punishment I felt bad when Tywin is
forcing her to is trying to force her to marry Loris I felt bad even though she
forced tried to force Sansa to marry job but say wasn't even close to me cuz she
not only did that sense of it she also lied through her teeth and forced all
the different people to address period's essentially execution no
chat is begging me to acknowledge that the heist the the previous high Septon
does do a walk of shame they're begging me to acknowledge that is that it is
that a guy the guy and they they whip his hands to make sure he cannot cover
his manhood good call Chad settles on but yeah I don't know I guess maybe you
don't feel I do well I can definitely agree I would be surprised if there
wasn't misogyny in the show in fact I'm almost certain there is because of the
setting there but that thing in particular not convinced yet well if you
make a man and a woman do the same thing yeah it's not just like the things that
happen the way people dress while she's walking is pretty misogynistic like the
the whole charade of it is pretty pretty misogynistic how so if they call her
horror and harlot and they still not like
is she a prostitute no is she a horror harlot is she sleep brown is she
promiscuous he definitely sleeps around all right well that in the that's not so
much an insult as it is a description I mean well it depends on what degree I
guess because sleeps with her cousin brother yeah I think I'd probably be in
the crowd saying the same thing about point yikes would not be like she sleeps
with her own family members he seems to be rather promiscuous well they've had
kings and queens that have slept with their own family members in the they're
still okay they're the same thing they there's a the Targaryens used to do it
all nothing it's right because it's but uh
yeah anyway but the point is like for me like yeah even though Cersei is a
horrible person I sympathize with her when bad things happen to her because
that's really the point it's to question retributivism like and torture and like
the public appetite for punishment like we shouldn't enjoy people suffering even
if they deserve it we should justice should be more restorative and less
retributive and that's really the arc of the entire story we open on an act of
retributive justice at the end Bran introduces a more restorative type of
justice I'm curious how that would play out
doesn't know the first scene Ned is executing a guy for being a deserter no
first scene we see the White Wolf that's the that's the prologue tongue the first
scene of the action of the story after the part of the story it's huge in the
story in fact it informs that second scene doesn't exist without that first
sure if those white walkers did they to get off their front porch and got killed
by a blade of an assassin who came out of nowhere if we're gonna argue
semantics you're like yeah the first scene after the prologue then is what I
mean no scene comes before it's about Ned showing Bran retributive justice in
the books actually he says Bran one day this will be your responsibility and I'm
like he is going to be king or something and then at the end brand
said she was gonna be king but she wasn't who didn't Daenerys say that she
was gonna sit on the Iron Throne and be oh no Ned isn't saying that brands gonna
be king he says that one day brain is gonna be in somewhere and he's gonna have
to be in charge of justice and I saw that I'm like foreshadowing well yeah if
you take a thousand lines and you can find the ones that vaguely match up
that's great pretty post it's in it's like in the first couple of pages but
you realize that if he hadn't you'd be like well that's just a line oh well
yeah in the first quarter they say Harry Potter isn't leaving for Hogwarts but
no I was always very I mean it's a book only line be clear be clear but no I
always thought that line was super important it's like the opening promise
of the story George RR Martin himself said that like originally he just
started writing that chapter and the whole story expanded out from that so
yeah brand Kings checks out for me and then at the end brand and he doesn't
execute anyone he's like gonna send people to do things to make the like
reconciles like no motivation to kill anybody why cuz he I mean he doesn't
kill people because he doesn't sees that it's not necessary that's what I
say yeah I mean that's it's that's a good thing he so I think it's
necessary necessary to kill some people some people but not anyone that okay the
brain doesn't kill he hasn't begun says major justice dude this chat is wild oh
they're yeah don't worry about that no I love it brand failed his training
someone said brand kills people using his wolf yes true oh season three brand
kills wildlings oh yes yes you know I'm talking about the ending and they ran
throughout the while he's needed to die though he also kills a guy using Hodor
in the show which is very ethically fucked when Hodor realized what he's
done oh also let's Daenerys kill oh right that's the element of the room
let another get screwed over and sent back to the wall because he saw this
coming that's actually wrong he brand does not have that kind of future what
do you mean he's the king though that was a little bit less brand on several
occasions says that he doesn't know things that are in the future what does
he say to Tarion why do you think I'm here why do you think I came yeah but
in on other cases like he's asked like can fire kill the night king he says I
don't know no one's ever tried and you could see the future he would be able to
see that Daenerys uses fire in the field no it's not inconsistent to see it's it's that we see how
brand sees visions and they're bits and pieces they're not like a solid he
doesn't know well he only saw the pieces he wasn't involved in killing
people in I think he knows all things past present and future he can
literally see everything no he knows he knows a lot of things past present and
he knows some things future but he sees the future and I can make your argument
for you he knows as much as he the plot requires him to like providing eye of
the knife he knew to do that but you only ever knew that much is that is that
where you're going for actually yes anything that he does in relation to
calling the future that was as much as he knew he basically doesn't he calls
very little about he's like I'm sorry I'm just saying we've just described it
an awful writing tool like that's the laziest shit you can do is not really
because brand doesn't brand I'm sorry there's elective clairvoyance there's
specific reasons why you remembered all of these individual things but nothing
else come on man it's all just try no it's if brain were a different kind of
character if brain were like again you earlier called brand like not really a
character and that's actually kind of true by the end brand is sort of like a
symbol and so he's our like a plot device so they really I just found
something I know brands my favorite book here they do like kind of change up how
to use anyway we've gone over but yeah I don't know I like brand at the beginning
of the story he falls just major bummer and then these other kid in the books
these other kids are like hey you're never he's never gonna go to anything if
I were like that I would have killed myself and then I'm reading that and I'm
like that is the saddest thing I have ever heard I hope this kid becomes the
king and he does you hoped it all right so I met your expectation okay you
emotionally invested in that being the ending I was all right it allowed me to
it's one of the reasons why I'm not as like angry at the ending and I'm like oh
I will the show has done the same justice as the books what was that the
show has done brand the same justice as the books or provided let me rephrase
that provided I don't think the show is context Oh justification yeah no the show
that never provides anything as much justification as the books because the
books are books um so I'm gonna check keep saying I can't be Lord of anything
uh Brandon say that yeah he did because he can't see the future he doesn't know
come on brand was learning to use his powers right if that he says like he
says I need to learn to see better brand isn't omniscient he's like trying to
figure out he sees just cuz he saw it anything he doesn't see is cuz he
couldn't see it yet and I love it brand is great in the books book brand like
don't even get me started like best character so sad I'd love both brand I
just don't think the showrunners loved him enough to keep him in every season
show us more of the training which I think there might I don't know what
their justification was he was I know he was going to school or something and
they just didn't feel like they needed to see the training I would have loved
to have seen it I would some of his visions would have been great I I agree
that the showrunners seem like they do not and it's tough because knowing what
I know about brands story I can see why it's a very it's a very different thing
it's a lot of it's about his age like a lot of it is contingent on his age and
so it's very different to translate it's very it's a lot of it's really
psychedelic and it's very strange like you know D&D originally didn't want it
like they want to do very much magic they don't want to do a whole lot of
like flashbacks and visions so it's very difficult to translate him so I do see
why they decided to make him more of a plot element more of a symbol like he's
basically the Lord of light but in human form
wrap it up you see why people might not buy that because what was conveyed very
well in the books was not in the show and by not showing the probably the most
important part of his character Joe and him just becoming a plot device and not
a character it might piss some people off that he becomes king even though he
was supposed to according to George R. Martin and all the intention in the
world if you don't execute it well pointless at the end and that's what a
lot of people felt like when they I see you including myself on yeah I feel I
see why everyone feels everything they not not literally be annoying I mean oh
I think people understood but if you weren't a book reader there's not a lot
to understand about Bran past he got downloaded somebody downloaded a bunch
of information and he essentially stopped being Bran and became another
type of character that was just a robot throughout the whole thing and I know
that's really simplistic but that's basically what he was I think there is a
plot device I think it's more about the memory of Bran so the brand of the first
two seasons is gone or the first three seasons is gone and you sort of have to
look at it as like at the end that kid is who is not really there anymore is
being honored and sort of elevated by the by a society that once said they
would never or once would never have honored or elevated or seen value in
this like sad crippled boy but he's not there to enjoy it but like the memory of
him is sort of being honored it's like in mythology there's a character Bran
the Blessed who isn't it's like it's in like Welsh mythology or something like
that and after a war with the Irish he's they cut off his head and he becomes
like a talking figurehead it's like Bran the broken Bran the Blessed he
becomes the figurehead or like Rainbow Crow it's an old like Native American
legend about like a crow that goes and ends the supernatural winter by
retreating fire and then comes back and it's singed it's not the same as it was
that people honor the crow whatever it's a super chill and if they were to
convey any of that in the show I probably would have bought it but they
didn't and they lifted him up with a council of people who were missing from
the show for long periods of the time Sansa showed little to to no connection
to him at all her own thing she wanted to be Queen and yeah it was I agree I
did not love that but you know if if I've done anything that you could maybe
that anyone listening can maybe use and recontextualize any aspect of the show
later then I've done my part and if I haven't then you know I tried my best
like the great Benioff and Weiss I'm sorry I mean that's one way to describe
them you know the powerful yeah is is everyone all right with me sort of
saying that's where the discussion ends are we good I'm so all right with it
thanks for having me on guys well sure before you go I know this sounds silly
but tell the audience about what you do and where they can find you just you
know oh fuck yeah I'm yes an IRL I have a YouTube channel called yes an IRL I
talk about Game of Thrones I haven't made a video in a while but I have one
more coming maybe two one about the ending and maybe I'll do something and
after that I think I'm probably gonna move on to stories maybe things that not
everyone is so angry about and also I'm on the wolf punch podcast which you can
see every week on Lipson and I know there's no link to that and I'll send you
one lady later yeah yeah I can put it in the archive one just let me know yeah

description if you want to check out more from his channel if you want to
explore more of his content what I've got left for today is a video from the
community that well regards Nidrotik and myself and wolf can animate video and
then after that we're doing super chats so I assume you you'll want to go back
to whatever you do with life before you jumped onto a podcast all about Game of
Thrones in four hours if you know oh my god so long all right I'm gonna I'm
gonna jump off thanks again for coming on man I really do respect it a lot of
people I don't know three of you want to you know debate in general let alone

commentary out everybody's got someone to say yeah can't I mean he did come on
which is more than most do but I have I've been convinced of absolutely
nothing in fact quite the opposite but an attempt was made yes yes but um I'm
gonna say if you guys can join this link neurotic you remember you came on to
talk about the expanse that a certain member of our cast had something weird
going on with his microphone yes you know that we made jokes about him being
the Mathis Aron yes have you have you happened to say remember have you
haven't to see any animations recently that may have been made by someone in our
community I have not oh well hopefully you'll you'll find this rather than you
um this is by plague creations and I know that I said I do memes all in one
stream but the neurotic is here so I wanted to see it but we will mean rags
pretty much already decided we'll be doing a stream all about memes because
they've backed up so many we're just gonna have to there's so many at this
point we're gonna watch it and we've actually got some bonus things that I
want to do I'll tell rags about it after the stream but we'll have a big old
privileged information oh yeah you know no one can know anyway you guys ready
oh wait when Rags it says that I should be in yeah I'm here with one other

row here have rags his face on their shields then a wolf's crest is on the
gondorians there's loads of little details and play creations videos I
always want to try and find all of the figurines behind nerd Roddick oh yeah
I was trying to find our characters I think they're characters from all of the
other animations I'm trying to find it there we go
you got rags which King the Goblin you have to pay money yeah well the jib and
soldiers I guess Randy the Goblin we've got with it the Nazi soldiers from the
the we can warrior blessed pipe but all to your weekend warrior yeah even he
even has himself on his wall oh there's a zine down there man you put those to
use yeah man yeah that is so cool the Orville button right on my microphone
to get them to you and always got no flame on there too
I down there that's no flame that's the cocaine-powered super villain actually
really like as well the uh the movements on owls little character like lip-syncing
really well I put it in the chat I put it in the chat
he just rolls out also do you like that rags all the way around the ball no
rind milk yeah I don't know it's just really good stuff like creation is
really well done we we love these and and there's a shit ton of other great
content it's like I said we're gonna shove them all into a bigger big stream
um and with that I suppose I'm going to read out some super chats and yeah
obviously I can't remember how long you said you could stay Gary but completely
stay all I definitely should stay for some super chats but uh keep reading I
have to go geloja I'll be right back and I mean but I agree it's a Orville
reference for peeing has to go bleed the liz momento got a good day in the
lock in the main vein there we go be right back
this is gonna be awkward I imagine a lot of these have something to say about our
guests just fucking do it time for another efap gaming oh wait just a
normal efap oh that's the thing it's normal you guys we there is some law
from the recent efap gaming you're gonna want to see it if you haven't catch up
on law because there's some funny memes that you may not get we saw references
in chat with all of your references in chat we go they were they were seen they
did not pass us by unknown it's too good honestly it's just the we played a game
of party pack six and it was it was a riot a laugh riot as they say hopefully
you guys would enjoy it Theo was there desk bullshit was there there was like
maybe two other guys too there was like 10 was like eight nine people 10 people
yeah we got 10 at the toward the we had a full game it's probably gonna be
possible for us to set that up easily again with that many people that we like
know in voice that easily that was so random was like oh you play this it was
amusing cover pat taxon's video on rags a as we've said before it is really
really shit so we are in no hurry to cover it because it is that bad it is it
is awful they can wait we've got loads of efaps
planned like this one was delayed by it by an efap I've got another two joke
refabs I've already got plan for different addressing parts of the film
so many different guests plant like tax and can wait there will be a time not
gonna say when maybe maybe next year that's the best I could do I'm sorry
you'd have to wait honestly is there any point in responding to tax and the video
was utter trash well that's a good follow-up super chat isn't it the thing
about taxes video that I found really interesting is that if you took
everything in the video to be 100% true it doesn't even remotely convince you
of the title so like I don't really think that it's gonna do much of
anything like he takes a shot at TROs video on rags but that video did way
more damage than taxes probably ever will and that one was dismantled as well
so it's just gonna be a matter of like wait we might get around to it at some
point not really heavily concerned though please save this for shad will
you give homecoming leeway for being in the Disney fanatical Marvel Universe you
want to he's only gonna reference oh yeah I guess I mean for us it's obvious
but I guess for other people I guess I can I can save that then we can watch
him be confused by the question I've got so many shad questions we need to do a
shad podcast sooner right no no no choice nude Rotic and mauler I hope you
guys take a look at Legend of Galactic Heroes sometime I have no idea what that
what is that Legend of Galactic Heroes maybe it's like a video game that's not
that weird like when they did cartoon reimaginings of the OT and stuff right
that wasn't that the one we're like they they redo the scene where they break
layer out and she's like the only person who's competent everyone's an idiot
oh it's good to think of that it's an anime according to chat it's an anime
yes it's an M&A so the answer would be no there you go I've been my
requirement also hi Rags hello is the secret movie Toy Story 4 you and Rags
both mentioned watching it on a gaming stream what ridiculous in Rags watch
plenty of movies it could be anything because we know Toy Story 4 and said it
was bad does not mean we recorded it and it's prepped movies that's a bit of a
that's subjective say that's foreshadowing I would say that is
foreshadowing not what you said what I said was completely different black
canary can't be done in live-action smallville birds of prey TV Harley Quinn
movie arrow had three black canaries and each one was worse than the last I
wouldn't know so don't know anything about black canary that's a true
statement fair enough I don't think area is actually she's been on screen a lot
and the what they're saying is the more times they bring her back the farther
away she gets from the actual character yeah yeah and I just picture the birds
of prey is not going to be you are gonna like it from from what I'm seeing so
far but I you know I've seen a lot of comparison I think it apparently like
the wrong characters look they haven't even got the right characters for but
also the it's clearly focused on Harley Quinn when birds of prey is supposed to
be about a lot of them right that's what I've seen a lot of criticism
supposed to be Huntress and black canary and they trade people in and out but
Harley Quinn was never really part of that in the beginning so that yeah they
just repurpose this it was supposed to be just a Harley movie and they wanted
to give her just a posse basically that doesn't look anything like they do in
the comics I I dare any just casual comic book fan to try to figure out
who's who mm-hmm do do remarkable Republican Joker apparently
remarkable Republicans don't Joker review maybe one day when we don't care
yeah it's it's I don't I mean we talk a lot of the times about low-hanging
fruit but he's like he's like a potato rotting potato to get that's kind of
that's kind of the bar that he's on if that analogy
hey Gary did you know that Luke is a lesbian
oh no I told totally believable the revolution I'd like to also make you
aware that Darth Vader he's a rip-off of Robocop
really of course he is it totally makes sense now I mean I see that the only
thing that I think obstructs that is whether or not time is linear once we
get past that I think that yes he is a complete very true oh yeah anyway hi
rags and who said this hello oh the person who said that is remarkable
Republican yes anyway as the fairy expert of the channel what is your
opinion on the Zootopia abortion comic I will survive well nerd Roddick well
what do you think it became the furry I fear furries they're one of the few
things in this world I fear so what is the question the question is what is
your opinion on the Zootopia abortion comic I will survive I will survive I'm
unfamiliar with it let me Google it I will survive Zootopia no there's some
kind and I've only heard because the internet told me and it's true that
there's some kind of whatever term you want to use around Zootopia some weird
yes a weird who you're gonna scare Gary do do you do you woo for Zootopia great
no chats gonna be doing it for the rest dream thanks right chat can I get an ooh
woo for Zootopia oh you know you don't want to hello
massives hello very kind I will I will read I will survive and get back to you
on the next e fan all right yeah momo walk and blushes kaya ooh ooh baka baka
god damn it I was pages and doozy hello hi maula hello don't have to watch most
of this tomorrow when I'm supposed to be working thanks for making my days
tolerable I hope this one is tolerable good luck my good friend good luck more
power to you maula what programs you used to get HD clips of movies and TV
shows yeah I was gonna say that the easy advice I always give people is more
nine times out of ten the clip you're looking for is gonna be on YouTube so
find a YouTube downloader and if it's typically mp4 will be what it downloads
the format in because that's what the format for you to use are I think and
then most if not all video programs except mp4s that is your I use I use
why to mate calm because it does both audio and video in different qualities
if you need a high-quality one or low-quality one or if it doesn't matter
but mauler is correct pretty much every scene that you might need probably on
YouTube somewhere might have a watermark but price you paid around three scan me
maula idea you see now that's a deep reference you guys gotta go watch the
fab gaming it's a very good reference greetings to all my fellow comrades of
the letter n oh hello fellow in in rad hi rags hello please sing the following
I shall post it for you it's I don't know what you know you don't want to how
about you sing it to me and then I will sing it I don't know that that's I mean
that's breaking the rules the super chat didn't ask for me to do it I should
sing this that's why I didn't want to read it out I didn't want to spoil it I
why young why I know game of thrones that is not if that's not good let me
know I can do a retake I don't have to use my first draft but if you know let
me know I started game of thrones in 1997 22 years investment gone well you
still have the books let's don't you still listen yeah if you enjoyed it
along the way then it was worth it yeah the ending might have been not so great
there are words to describe friends that you made along the way that's the real
of an adventure yeah we'll go with that that's
yeah or desir ad Astra I'll see you star side at Astra is the movie that came out
I don't know the rest I saw at Astra fire neurotic could you see at Astra it
did see at Astra what did you think of ad Astra the Astra I understand this
conversation because I have not seen Astra hey I did not like it very much
because I liked parts and I didn't like parts I wouldn't it was I was I'm glad I
saw it special effects were really good oh I like those yeah very very
believable grounded kind of setting that I liked a lot I like that scene where he
was on the big antenna thing in the beginning oh yeah that was really well
done yeah but yeah didn't it tried to be what apocalypse now in space and quite
a bit like Brad Pitt I think he did a good job
you guys excited for Ryan Johnson's knives out we're only planning alone
doing an efap movies with critical drinker just for that movie I don't know
like I don't know what's gonna happen but we'll give it a shot it's possible
that we watch it and it's just okay and we don't have much commentary on it is
possible that it's terrible but it is possible that it's actually really good
so who knows it goes far saying it's possibly gonna be the best thing we ever
seen our entire lives right guys it'll be the best movie of this year will be
stunning and brave and it will be stunning and brave the bunny and stave
bunny and stave the only argument required for why season 8 is bad even
dentist yep even I'm surprised like nobody argues against the dentist comment
that's pretty much just game over like if we can't trust our dentist then who
can we trust can we be honest when they're talking you know when they're
working on your teeth and he wants to have this big debate about game of
thrones and you're just answering back
hello all my M words and rags can't forget him oh hello
hi Theo also hi rags mauler and Gary hello hi Theo says hi from chat
I'm sure of it hello did you like the bow master of King's Landing I hope you
don't see that as toxic it was merely a meme for the meme gods a man no one could
see you as toxic say your memes they are beautiful they rise above any such
toxicity five for rags because he got me into
Mordhau five for mauler for inspiring me to start writing a review of the
garbage that is borderlands 3 oh hey anyone here played that I have not I
have not have not I've I haven't really had a game what I've heard about it
actually is that like it's okay it's fine it's just the all the other stuff
about well everything behind the scenes has made people despise it like that's
that's I've heard that from a few people I've heard it has the weakest writing of
the three so I've heard that from many people now so that is just a an
observation that I'm making as to what I've been told toxic isn't even
Britney Spears best song it's you drive me crazy well you know that kind of that
kind of just ends the conversation right there doesn't it already talk about
toxic anymore if it's not even a best song hmm I bet you didn't think about
that toxic fandom involves not just obsessiveness but becoming a danger to
others in some way to those they disagree with you go Gary I mean I mean
I would agree that a toxic fandom would be a fandom that openly like you can
always have toxic players in any movement no matter what it is that's
just people but for a fandom to be toxic then I would say that you would have to
be something along the lines of there would have to be a general sentiment for
people to go out and do things that are just wrong or immoral yeah it's to be
wrong or immoral or moral just to you know to be threatening yeah and they
love to pick those few things out I know I'm stating the obvious here sorry but
and and hang their hat on that every time and when it's just hey I didn't like
the show well the one that gets cited all the
time is the Kelly Marie Tran thing they're like toxic fandom did this it's
like did it and then you have to wonder with all the stuff that's come out since
like so whether or not it's provable whether or not she even did that from
her own point of view but also the reverse where you have Mark Hamill
saying hey would have been great we've had the three of us reunite but okay and
then the the toxic happy positive fandom came for him they're like fuck you man
fuck up just like the film just fan about just recently I try not to spend
too much time on Twitter hour a day something like that you're still off
Twitter right I am still off Twitter they kick you off or I got kicked off
Twitter yeah I got banned for inciting hatred against minorities or something
promoting violence I think is what they said I promoted violence against
minorities or protected groups so go figure that one out I always get such a
violent vibe off you yeah oh yeah I'm not well that out yeah like people think
I'm here on a well I'm not oh yeah just recently I got my head transposed on
some Nazis because I don't like a TV show but that part's not toxic so well
if that's how you find out who the real Nazis are what television shows they
like that's how they were taking over again through stalls analysis videos we
can the whole theme of watchmen which I'm probably gonna eviscerate tonight
but it could be good it could be but it's the show for that song tonight is
it and as you know the comic series was based in the 80s and the backdrop of it
was nuclear war because that was the the great threat of our time you know
apocalypse annihilation what the showrunner of watchman thinks that is
equal to that now is police brutality and white supremacy oh yeah all those
white supremacists that we see in those those places that I can't think of but
they're out there the constant that they're about to end our entire
civilization that yeah there they'll get us damn I forgot the most important
question Gary you excited for episode three of that one I'm waiting with
baited breath yes it is high art in the what will happen with Alice what will
happen with Kate Kane is that him name Kate Kane is the protagonist and her
father Jacob that's who is the rent a cops yes who is in charge of the rent a
cops but also the cops but maybe not because we don't know because what is
world-building fan stuff is the answer just fans stuff it will be so good I
is my favorite part looking forward to a way more than I should to be honest
with me to we're all kind of excited cuz if it gives us something like we go on
the first two oh and we're it almost that's a pattern right there that means
we're getting there for like the whole show at that point you guys aren't super
familiar with I mean because you have taste you're not super familiar with CW
shows it will go down this road and it just it gets worse as time goes on and
once you start it gets worse oh no it's gonna be so much fun you never hit the
bottom do you with with media getting bad it's always more it keeps going it
finds new ways like in the beginning of the second episode I know I've talked
to you about this before but those flames on the van that look like they
were just something you get with after effects for free some little effect that
you put on it it was yes no bad you know that in episode 2 we the Cape when
she was on the motorcycle with CGI as well yes it was which has someone
highlighted had to be because it's extremely dangerous to ride on a
motorcycle like with a cape not for batwoman off of batwoman that woman is
indestructible already killed one stuntman so oh did they yeah they did
yeah what someone died for that well oh no that's that's actually the saddest
thing I've ever heard this is literally sadder than Auschwitz well I mean you
know that it's all relative I suppose it's all subjective someone died for a
batwoman oh no died without what was like yeah that's an actual tragedy though
yeah that does suck you gotta wonder what stunt it was I wonder what yeah
what stunt was it maybe they fell off one of the buildings or maybe yeah I'm
not mixing up shows I'm looking up now I was just I was read it on one of my
live-stream stuff yeah and please tell me they died for like the Lord of the
Rings or something good there was a stellar actress who died for the lost
resident evil film right I think that happened there's like lawsuits still
but oh no I got a mixed up I'm sorry it was Titans my bad it was for I get the
bad DC show thank god there you go you've improved rags day early so that is
that is better all right now goes back to the saddest thing yeah yes it is
Auschwitz remains number one all right fake news I'm sorry I finally finished
watching the backlog of efab and have reached a new level of efab
lightning that rivals that of big idiots all hail the dawn's toxic brew one
different rivaling big idiots oh it's pretty tough but I don't think it's
impossible by the rules it can't be done so your subjectivity is right and ours
isn't I'm sure that whenever he was referencing subjectivity he was like
we're both right we're both wrong it's wonderful interpretations are valid I
think matters just like at the end of Game of Thrones yep that really is
depressing and I really do and as I've said I have a limited scope of context
for a lot of this stuff I've watched many scenes and clips and stuff but I
never did watch it the whole way through I really am sorry about you know to all
the people out there about your show because that must be awful and you can't
experience it with that woman because it was already terrible so if they made it
well-written that would be ruining it I would be disappointed if I would guys
like I I shouldn't that mate I think this is a moral failing on my part that
I admit and I try I'll try to work on it but I would be legit disappointed if
batwoman turned into a high-quality show yeah you'd be like no I'd be like no
this isn't what I signed up for it's supposed to be good it's supposed to be
good I think that's I think that's a great part of your character that you
could admit that that's awesome I feel the same way I crave the moments where
they like shoot the van under the war I want more of that give me more I love it
it's so much fun to just be baffled by any choice that they make in the show
and like if I could talk to the writer I would just be like why now that we've
established that I have a moral failing in some degree I'm gonna go down a city
full of men women and children I don't even exist it's foreshadowing I would
have thought the King's Landing should have been destroyed in season 7 with the
throne empty and then the survivors head north in 8 and get slaughtered by the
Night King survivor on the throne we do is honestly so many different ways they
could have gone about it got what we got season 8 wasn't even the worst part
that would be the dawn plot or lack thereof I was so excited to see the sand
snakes and what we got was just disgusting no fam can be blamed for
hating them I mean they were bad for sure but you really think it was the
worst thing we got I don't know man I still think it's the worst betrayal of a
character from the book does the sand snakes be all about yeah yeah that
family actually worst thing no I agree with you it's the Winterfell
that's God that irritates me to this day well I would happily just say season 8
but if I had to pick a specific scene moment whatever it would just be
Daenerys burning children that for me was just like yep that's Game of Thrones
listen just because she admitted they were innocent doesn't mean in being
from his perspective oh that's because she said they were clearly innocent
explicitly doesn't mean they didn't deserve to not be burned alive in the
street running in terror world was better off with it okay
hippity the logic right there hippity-hoppity my buddies rags property
oh yeah boy and the gold a super fan over here boys and the gold medal for
mental gymnastics goes to I'm sure they were referring to us three and I
apologize we did we did try but I am limber mm-hmm someone give this man a
gold medal for his mental gymnastics defending season 8 there was those two
separate people that did at the same time all right oh man gonna see not
accomplish two things at once is Jamie not allowed to be concerned for his
reputation and his safety and the people I thought it was a stretch that he did
it to save his own life I really don't think that the show has ever implied
that that was his primary motivation in that scene now didn't he lose his hand
to save Brienne Brienne I mean you can argue that he didn't knowingly sacrifice
the hand the hand was taken from him after all of that was done but it was
done to as a direct result of him trying to push for extra benefits as a
prisoner so I would I am happy to concede he didn't necessarily lose the
handful Brienne but he definitely put himself on the line trying to save it
he didn't have to and that was why I like the scene so much you can clearly
tell that he's like I don't need to save her but I want to I should save it and
that's why is like the start of all of the cracks in his personality falling
apart cracks falling apart that kind of makes sense I'm gonna stick with it how
do y'all hello hello rags hmm yeah hello hmm oh goodbye
Jensen bye yeah based on his logic if I got it correctly that Jamie didn't
change like he fundamentally didn't change he never cared about anybody so
and I should ask them at the time never any common people yeah would season 1
Jamie it if he was presented with all the evidence that the White Walkers
exist would he have gone up there and fought him season 1 Jamie I mean from my
perspective I would probably play with the fact that he would never believe it
but then if it was like proven definitively and he believed fully that
the world was doomed if he didn't go and fight I think he probably actually would
be broken out of his character for that but that's kind of my point is that he
hasn't been in any tough situations that have to breach this personality was
essentially laid on him and so once things start happening that test it it
,
and such a wonderful story
that happens
that
fifth
the money or is that later the thing you seem like a fine person I suppose but
damn your arguments are rotted go watch the show again do some homework right
that's from salad King I think he was very nice but those were not good
arguments no no not very good I think we got truth at the end when he said I
liked bran okay all right love your rags hello and also thank you
toss me off a roof and call me daddy mmm hey execution was terrible just
because people don't unanimously agree doesn't mean it wasn't it was good
executional poor interpretation by audience it's not the first time but he
did do a lot of appealing to what a lot of people liked it okay yeah
we had that with Major Lee yeah because Major Lee was like you guys are aware
that people like TLJ right like yeah yeah have any of you played binding of
Isaac any thoughts I have I really liked it I've only played it very briefly
maybe one day I'll get more into it I have another DLC soon so I get a bit of
a really get into it maybe I'll visit it the game I've been going through now
has been cuz I cuz I'm very sadly as you know Mahler all my video footage was
corrupted and I have to go get it back essentially yeah I'm playing Gears 5 and
it's actually pretty good so nobody review review on that for next week on
exclusively games is all right mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah a super chat from a few
weeks back said rags is Dennis Reynolds but I'm pretty sure he's D I don't know
I don't understand what that is a reference to neither do I hmm Dennis
Reynolds and as well yeah I'm assuming I'm gonna guess TV show but I have no
idea I am not sure so yes he was so he was a better Sarah Connor than Danny
agreed I only saw a couple of episodes of Sarah Connor Chronicles and I know
just from that because holy shit I like Emilia Clarke but I don't know what they
were doing with her and into an edge Genesis don't you mean Olivia Clarke of
course Olivia Clarke it was strange that I said that and I don't think anyone in
the chat pointed it out oh I fucking you kidding me
those people did well no no no I mean in our in our conversation yeah not in the
chat and I was weird no wait a second yeah I think yeah you're right okay
sorry sorry we're distracted also it's a it's an always sunny in Philadelphia
reference of oh I see this guy defends season 8 God Genesis 3 14 well what is
just I'll do it I'll do it Genesis 3 sometimes when you hear somebody
mispronounce something if it's not that important and we get the gist of it this
is for me anyway I just let it roll I don't I'm not trying I don't want to
especially when he's in the mid-sentence it's like really confusing or funny
Genesis 3 15 and I will put em 3 14 oh honey let me go 14 okay it is let's see
okay and the Lord God said to the serpent because you have done this you
are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field on your belly
shall you go and dust shall you eat all the days of your life Wow the defending
Game of Thrones huh I don't know man to be fair the serpent to be fair that not
a good comparison because the serpent in the Bible story was the one telling
the truth so done done done done look what he got for it God's a dick Game of
Thrones a show I never really watched but leaned way learned way too much due
to its crash landing of an ending I think you're not alone on that one a lot
of people have learned about Game of Thrones thanks to how upset all of the
fans are I am one of those people this is all her dragged me into that a gig
and screaming watch this it's terrible this guy most fans think they understand
the characters but they don't also this guy thinks he understands the character
but he doesn't well that was why I asked the question I was like yes accusing
people of being toxic you know go against the writers and they're right so
just like so by that logic then someone could do the exact same thing in
reverse and be toxic if the show affirms their interpretations until the
penultimate episodes where does the heel turn where it does a heel turn and
affirms the other isn't that a writing problem
I guess that's addressing I mean it I suppose is that question about the
execution about people changing or characters developing in certain ways
their interpretation until the penultimate episodes
wouldn't it be a writing problem if it does a heel turn problem is the I guess
in that scenario would be for that person because you use the word
interpretation and then we have to decide valid the interpretation is or
how referential very complicated question I would go as far as saying if
the interpretation is completely grounded like every reference you have
it's just like how we were doing it with Daenerys basically it's like yeah
who's definitely a problem here if the fans are wrong then the writers were
bad for not conveying what they meant to the fans through the story if you have
that significant apportion of fans upset then some things happened and you have
to figure out what it was yeah whether or not I mean if we can get you on the
boat of saying something is amiss because so many people didn't like it
and they can pull many many many references as to why then if anything
even if we're being as charitable as we possibly can be people are clearly
confused by what was presented and that's not great if you're trying to
convey these concepts a large amount of people to a general populace yes totally
agree there I'm sure some movie out there exists that was way too smart for
anybody and we just didn't figure it out but this isn't the case here it well in
my opinion there's failed I don't think it's toxic to say writers failed or they
did a bad job or they were lazy with this script at all I mean this is why
they make gobs of money all we heard was how hard they worked on this and I'm
with rags I don't care I I just don't care you worked hard on something that
wasn't good sorry and you got your paycheck though when Mahler and I we got
together and we had a bunch of questions most of which went unasked which is fine
we're just preparation we had one of our questions was essentially is like would
we give the same credits and the same excuse for other difficult jobs that
don't that people don't do well like would would you say that about the
presidency would you say that about engineers or even something as simple as
like chefs who do cooking is like well yeah tasted shit but man that was a hard
dish that they tried to prepare yeah and like to flip it so it's like it's
toxic to say they did a bad job so don't do that it's like so saying they did a
good job isn't toxic meaning toxic is defined by what being critical and it's
like no it's being critical while being an asshole about it or being like
abusive harassing and stuff and it's like okay so like I can I can get that
but what isn't harassing and toxic at this point I feel like it's one of those
things that's just so overused everyone's a sexist and racist like when I
hear those words the same thing I just don't really they don't have any weight
to them flashbacks of the not so great debate also hi Rags hello and I mean I
think he did he did a better job because he seemed he was certainly more
knowledgeable but I think that his ability to under just rationalize was
poor I don't think he was being disingenuous though I see the fab fandom
rank the debates from best to worst without defining what best means just
seeing what they do well I mean it if chat would like to I would be curious if
chat thinks that this debate was better by whatever metric you personally choose
was this debate better than the one with Major Lee I think it was say that
type one if this debate was better than the Major Lee debate and don't type
anything if you think the reverse yes no that's not a very good way to do it type
yeah I want to if you think the reverse yes one for this debate two for Major
Lee one for this debate and two for Major Lee or some guy there you go ten
a lot of ones and I'm not surprised I do think this I do think this debate was
better he certainly seemed more knowledgeable about a lot of material he
certainly wasn't trying to meme it up or be disingenuous he wasn't saying things
just for the hell of him I definitely believe that he believed everything he
said yeah and I he thought everything he said was rational I don't think it was
but I could certainly I certainly believe he came with total confidence and
in good faith yeah I agree with that I don't think he was a dick oh no he
wasn't a dick no I just I think he was wrong so this next one says this guy
arguments are itty I'm math we're mirror challenge over far say I think I
split that up badly I think I think that you read list inevitably I think so too
you suck at reading lists speak it's called list speak ranch all over if
faith they go oh he said I'm gonna squirt my ranch all over his face I got
it it was like a quoted message oh hey and raw has arrived oh my god I was just
about to go to bed so I could wake up in five hours and go joker again I
marathoned a ton of Nolan films last night and realized how fucking how fucked
interstellar and the Dark Knight Rises are hey Gary what do you think of it
I didn't like it very much and Dark Knight Rises I didn't like it very much
so interstellar was I don't know toxic no I don't know I did I like Nolan for
the most part but Dark Knight Rises Batman quitting over a girlfriend dying
is the most ridiculous thing then the super knee brace and all that yeah
there's tons of stuff it's done this time right it's called this race the
bat brace yes the bat brace and Batman who on the wall next to his bat sides oh
my god and his bat axe is three bad axes for his three hands not only are
they're back cleavers they're connected by a wire do you see that shit as if
they're connected by a wire I'm almost yeah like I cannot wait for them to
implement those things please tell me you use them but they're not just there
for show please use I really wanna know I like how Batman who is Batman's very
famous for not killing people right Batman doesn't kill people which
explains the triple bat axes the two bat sides the bat shot yeah sure you
could use non-lethal ammunition for it but still I was like man really good at
that aim with that crossbow oh yeah just never kills anybody it's just that knee
cap people and ironically it's like oh my god that helped filling those
little white hole Schumacher he had the better ideas remember the bat suit
remember the back of the nipples on bat woman sir but yeah I know remember the
bat belt buckle that was like a heater that could melt ice remember that yes I
do we need to watch that that shit's great I love that movie I actually I
love that movie though it's great I've told me before you much do you have a
subjective like almost 10 out of 10 that you hit think is objectively like poor
I'm like Batman Robin man fucking Robin so hilariously bad I love it
what killed behind the sores the highest age the bat card at the end of
Game of Thrones the dialogue was not well executed pacing was poor there was
no buildup to the event so it seemed empty and out of nowhere agreed empty
because there was like no dialogue in the last episode oh god no they do a lot
of walking walking around Mahler has an excellent supercut of that yeah it's
interesting how they could show all of that walking in the previous episode but
they couldn't explain how Aya gets behind the Night King it's like that bit
of traversal might have been cool to know instead they've really got their
priorities straight of the is very iconic said that wasn't important we
didn't need to know I remember that yeah no I don't yeah director of the
episode said it wasn't important he was not gonna think about it oh well he was
fucking wrong
that was you to say such a thing how horrible how toxic oh why he's he's he
white I don't even know but I just assume everything you say you have a lot
of hidden bigotry I've noticed oh yeah that's right yeah between you remember
where I well a moment ago when we had our debate the fact that a man and a
woman have to do the same thing I wasn't ready to call that misogyny so I guess I
guess that's cuz I'm a sexist you see it came out a little bit I gotta watch it
I appreciate chat said as well they've helped out with a couple of fun facts
yeah every letter straight excellent job today chat despite oh no being a little
angry at our guest I don't necessarily blame you all are you guys gonna be
watching the new Wokeman series alongside Batwoman oh so watchman I guess
oh watchman is a look I guess the assumption is that it will be I haven't
seen the trailers yeah that's the assumption that's the assumption I have
based on what was trailers one of those trailers trailers and and what more what
Damon Lindelof the guy who co-ran lost is in charge of this I don't know how
you feel about lost or not but yeah he's he's the one who made the statement
about the the you know the white supremacy and and police brutality being
the troubles of our time equal to the threat of nuclear war isn't he so I'm
gonna I'm gonna say for the record I think the I think the biggest problem of
our age is the accidentally create a a super virus that's immune to antibiotics
and it ends up killing a shit ton of people I think that's the problem of our
age that woman one of those two that or police brutality or Batwoman or Batwoman
probably you know it's actually about Batwoman's kind of like a super virus
right yeah yeah Damon Lindelof he's in this company of writers where you just
have no idea how this happened like how did you write all this horrible stuff
and keep getting work and it's like well it makes money it's like you know
whatever good things that make money yeah it does make money that's great
area that school of writers where they don't feel like they need to explain
things oh yeah all those emotional moments
gotta get them emotional like Spock yeah that wing nuts they're on back to
back tonight anti someone's saying antibiotics so now I've always heard it
called antibiotics I know that when I made characters in Mass Effect I was
already I was I was ready to be an answer but if somebody wants me to I
don't know if that's right or not maybe chat can help me out is it
antibiotics or antibiotics and so antibiotics don't work I always called
it antibiotics but antiviral it I thought antibiotic all viruses are
mean you know what I fucking mean nerd you know what I fucking mean yeah no I
don't we don't really intend to watch the watchman series but I'll watch
Gary coverage of every day I'll see what it's all about from your your lens
Gary you will corrupt me into thinking it's something that it's not proud of
yourself I would I'm very proud of myself I feel honored can't wait to
corrupt baller I am not no chat no chat I'm not triggered I'm just being silly
I'm glad that I learned something I had no idea that viruses are immune to
antibiotic I was using that as a catch-all term for cures and things
so from raw he wasn't gonna row to Pentos he was gonna get an uber I love
the idea that he questioned that he was like of course he wasn't gonna row to
Pentos like what else was he gonna do he only had the dinky rowboat what was it
was Jamie gonna do you said dinky it was it was dinky he go looking just okay
no what when you were this mate this might sound like a strange question but
when you were a young man when you're a little little little man what what did
like when it like your parents or whatever what what was your word for the
penis when you were really really small and you had to come up it was winky for
me too I was just I was just curious it's it's something that it's it's a
cultural consistency that we have between between the pond on either side
excellent you go so there you go Lee I had the dumbest name for it that was
cuz I got it for my mom though so I mean I don't want to blame my mom but I mean
I tend to peer I I called mine a peer forever here when I was a little kid I
was like yeah well you do urinate because of peer pressure yeah no there
can be the objects on a pier that can be large and tall and so yeah I kind of see
something there that's all right that's all right it's nice I will say that I don't
normally hear peers described as tall well you haven't been like maybe it's
really high up like it's why your belly button is you haven't you think right
wouldn't you agree it's not necessarily about good if you will the width the
aroma yes what please everyone watch your penis okay watch your wings please
yes ladies ladies wash your front butt guys wash your winkies mm-hmm
rags on the case even though I don't know that birth to your affected by
antibiotics also okay probably just showed up but in the super show he says
okay nevermind don't care about sleeping anymore I'm angry this discussion is
making my migraine with sad face if you have to accomplish you have to explain
your show to your viewers after the episode you have failed as storytellers I
think it's pretty funny that the only episode they don't explain is maybe the
one that requires the most explaining episode six like I'm sorry I have
questions about everything that happens it's like well we're out all right so
it's more how's good I do think it's fucking good fight me a mortal yeah I
play that shit all the fucking time I love more how I will defend more how my
interpretation was right yours was invalid the thing about interpretation
discussions I want to try and veer away from them because naturally they imply a
sense of like you're drawing things out of it that are for you and you alone or
something why even I was I was asking could could you talk could you talk to
me about like a scene or anything can you point to something that I could go
like that so that's what I said because I don't know for certain I have a
limited understanding of these characters in their context so could you
point someone like me to a scene or something that would support your
position I don't think I got an answer but the question was raised so what it
was it's all good in the hood just so I don't a mauler but to support his
argument what scene would you pick out it's if there's anything close or
Daenerys going insane or Daenerys going insane
maybe the tarlies mate I mean I see that's completely just a huge lip yeah I
did too I I saw all of her actions I could see where he saw there's personal
motivation in there too it's called layers you know it's called quality the
character but no motivation in craziness they don't they're not the same you can
be totally you had ideas about craziness yeah like do you do you define craziness
as just being doing something that's irrational and if so what if you can
rationalize something to yourself the whole fire thing like if you believe it's
true and you believe that you could justify what you think and then you go
through with it after you confirm it it's not crazy that's the interesting
part isn't it because if someone was to do everything that she did up to that
point and then burn to death we'd be like wow I guess they were crazy yeah
yeah if the fire was super hot and started to burn her and she kept on
going I would I would have probably been on his side to a much bigger degree
yeah and you know he's like certain of it and I'm assuming it's because of the
fact that of those previous bins because even in that scene Jorah's like I'm gonna
sit here and watch you burn and she's like you don't understand I'm not gonna
burn like fuck that she's from her perspective it makes as much sense as
stabbing somebody and they bleed it's just he wasn't convinced that she was
convinced that she wasn't gonna burn but he was convinced she would go crazy at
the end we were sort of bobbing between her being crazy and her wanting to kill
them because of fear I go over this in my video I was like a lot of people aren't
typically sticking to one narrative if you know what I mean mm-hmm and I know
you can be like oh it was all of them at once it's like I don't know crazy is
hard to coexist with other motivations because when you have crazy it pretty
much just means it's just doing shit
but yeah the discussion around Daenerys is frustrating and I mean with craziness
is the same excuse that can be used to justify anything in the same way that a
moment of weakness could be used to justify anything it's like oh they just
had a temporary failure yeah I don't want to highlight by the way that he was
running with the whole like she's never killed anybody that she considers
innocent he was going with that for a while before I pulled the quote like it
was clearly a part of his argument was significant yep oh yeah the only
argument he has when counted is well I didn't interpret it that way you can't
approach it objectively because it is it was objectively bad he was also like
even confused on that as well like he would simultaneously be like it's all
subjective also being like there are objective elements for sure but it was
really unclear what the line was like definitive things actually taking place
but then
I mean it's like every single scene you have to define whether or not there's
too much to interpret and therefore it can't be said objectively oh I would
have been that person in season 5 making excuses for the show rationalizing the
show which is what I believe he was doing but because I liked it I was
motionally invested in it with our friend doom cock calls hypnosis really
good word for it yeah I think we all fell under the spell when the force
awakens came out certainly a lot of us I mean I was certainly I was down with I
was down with what I saw I said those really black and white strips I was
completely hypnosis hypnosis that's that's the word right I had you had
smiler eyes mmm horrifying then I got broken out of it say what a worthless
discussion please move on well we did eventually here we are Jamie didn't know
Brianne was at Winterfell and if his motivations weren't heroic then he
wouldn't be on the front of the north but as far back as possible did Jamie
know Brianne was there or not last time they spoke I think he knew that Brianne
was heading back to Winterfell he didn't know he knew yeah he didn't know that
she was there 100% guaranteed absolute truth but I'm pretty sure that he knew
and because I don't I don't know myself but if his motivation for going to
Winterfell was supposedly to save Brianne specifically or that he had a big
emotional investment in her then wouldn't that make it just doubly weirder
that he would ditch her so quickly for Cersei again absolutely yeah I think so
I mean I don't I just don't agree with the interpretation I think he did it for
the living he makes that very clear even in season eight he said you're right I
mean that's what he so we're supposed to just I mean sometimes there's the
unreliable narrator but at this time things got so simplified at the end I
think everything was at face value and that's one of the major differences from
the show from early on because you had that unreliable narrator so you didn't
know when people were telling the truth and yeah that's the thing is like so
many people did understand Game of Thrones I think one of the big things
was how many people survived I think people expected more people to die if
they were expecting anything yeah and and Jamie knew because he would know
that Brianne was told she was Sansa's sworn sword so she and she is loyal to a
fault and she would never leave her side once she did that and that
if at 58 gallons of rationalizations Game of Thrones season yes the ending
being crap is just what you feel mauler it couldn't possibly be because it was
straight-up poorly written obviously I know and understand it mauler you just
didn't understand well let's say super easily super easy
barely an inconvenience in your epic voice rags what's my epic voice
I'm actually not certain what they're referring to maybe it's the hello ladies
and gentlemen voice hello ladies and gentlemen super easy barely an
inconvenience maybe maybe that's what they were going for you know pretty good
yeah hi my what oh hi my wife always ignores my youtubing sargon arch rags
and now mauler except these superchats so a special high rags just for Nicole
please no hello hello Nicole yeah there you go I was just trying to you know
make sure I understood I didn't want to I didn't want to pre hello Nicole
biggest letdown was the Night King all that build-up and he really he was
almost no real damage no real payoff every noble family did more damage to
the kingdom Ned Stark did more and he got killed at the beginning I mean I
don't think anybody's gonna disagree that my king was a flat tire of a
character just like wobbled in that just fell over like all right when mauler
showed me that the first scene in the entire series was oh and by the way if
there's no scene that came before it it's the first scene just to clarify yeah
people wouldn't chat would be like mauler it's the prologue it's like yes
the first scene the first scene yes but I thought it was really really weird
that that was the first scene of the whole series and that's how it ended I
like oh all right I mean that's the I was tricked obviously because that's
what I was really in it for hugely outside of the characters was how are
they gonna resolve this impeding doom or impending doom impending impeding doom
would be like the doom was getting in the way this doom is in trouble some
doom yeah and when the episode three happened I was like oh I just finished
rewatching the 1987 predator movie now talk about something that has held up
over time now I get to enjoy some efap so what are we talking about oh yeah
yeah yeah predator 1987 is fucking great that's a film that'll stand the test of
time for a few thousand years hopefully you know one of the movies we watched
recently was the fly and it was very good yeah that's another movie that have
you seen that Gary oh god yeah those special effects though man those were
impressive I thought I'd read out and touch them good cuz I cuz I could so uh
I I think this is one you can choose to interpret it simply says roof time you
can choose to interpret anything mauler didn't you hear the man it's also check
you and can you interpret the word anything the word anything well you have
to interpret it that's what words are I'm learning something every day yay kick
yes an irl I'll just kick someone like we kick Jay that's it stop lisping stop
lisping stop lisping stop lisping I was from raw I think he doesn't like this
thing I'm getting that feeling good luck interrupting no shlubly with my carrot
down you throat you gay whore jeez there was a weird moment we're like he
interrupted me just kept talking for like fucking two minutes I was odd
extremely rude yes
the issue that isn't that we disagree with Jamie's a character it's that his
final decision of motivations contradict his previously established ones read
Poland is subjective so we got science on this is this true Poland is
subjective yeah define Poland I mean you mean Poland is it I mean obviously
there's a country called Poland and you can independently verify that there's a
place and people there and road signs and other people you recognize it as a
country dabbles government yeah you would have to you'd have to consider
nation-state super duper conceptually to even begin to try and say that
countries aren't objective oh yeah kills little finger little finger I was
clearly hacked also hi wags hello and it ends with I'm a woman a warm I really
hope they bring that into the show that song it was so good they didn't have
that also they have not had that one thing I can't let a man take credit for
women's work oh they haven't had that yet they haven't had that hoping the
husband cut it was such a good line still time still time yeah that's true
I was gonna say there was massive reshoots on it she was supposed to be at
San Diego Comic Con and she didn't show up because of the reshoots the fact that
there was reshoots on that show and those were getting the best of what they
got after the reshoots I would see the original oh my god what didn't live up
to CW standards you've been reporting all the reshoots for a episode 9 right
and it's just like it almost seems like of course it's like yeah of course it's
a disaster what if you just have a really good script and you double triple
quintuple check it and then you shoot that that's stupid okay all right well
I'm sure there's grip so the emojis it'll be great hello rags hello my door
is open for you because that is how I like to poop rags wags rags rag no rock
how is infinite retro where is for tango oh I assume they're both doing just
swimmingly your arguments a subject while making subject arguments okay all
right well there you go there you have it some things are objective like a fact
billboard bill giddius bingleman actual quote
Ross save us I have a roof located at 45 meters height this is actually from
Rob bowler I was supposed to be asleep collecting my energy for yet another
joke screening but the brood demands blood so I'm up on the rooftop just get
him here at zero HP so I can deliver the fatality it's the same wouldn't it be
wouldn't it be one HP zero HP is dead right well in mall combo the rules right
zero in mall combat makes them going to you know I see I see the only reason
Ned went to King's Landing in the first place is because John Aaron was murdered
by little finger and lisa and therefore it was little finger fault yeah like I
said it's though that incident plus the attempting the knife thingy in his sleep
which I find him thinking about it now it's like the show never actually
answers that that was Joffrey and the Joffrey had given the blades to the
assassin right that's how it goes in the book was he that's directed at Gary I
guess yes yes it well are we supposed to believe that it was little finger then in
the show do you reckon that's what they're going for that's must yeah again
this is one of those things where I get the book and the show mixed up but they
never explained or did they did they explain that Joffrey I don't think they
ever mentioned it that's why I was kind of I knew I knew it was in the book go
back and check now they would have to say that it was little finger and not
explaining that Joffrey or not you know because the knife came from Robert
Baratheon's collection because it was rare because it was Valyrian steel yeah
I guess at that point you would have to conclude that it all comes down to little
finger and lisa iron which again takes away from the whole fact of it being
kind of a destiny thing and you know ending up in Arias that's that's where
the knife the cat spa ends up in the book I think she'll end up with it at
some point but that's also shows that without you know proper lead-up and it
just doesn't work and so they were going to George's ends without using their own
means to that end and you know so many narrative things were done like they
stopped they stopped doing things the way they used to okay they used to you
know go to George they would have the source material then they had to start
making up their own stuff yeah that's hard but rags made a great point these
are professionals that's what they're supposed to do they're supposed to adapt
this stuff we had a question about that one of our question was about you know
do you think there's a any correlation between when they ran out of source
material when the show got worse essentially and there absolutely was
Braun was brought up video on this he he George R Martin was talking about what
changes were made in the show that he didn't necessarily come out and say they
bothered him but you can tell they bothered him and it was they started
using marketing research all right so Braun was a very popular character so
they started putting him in the show more liked him now I like Braun for the
most part but he like he stopped being useful in the story a long time ago but
I like Braun he was a fun character you know I liked it and the argument was
made that a lot of that that was done with Aria and Sansa too now they
obviously had paths already but they were you know Aria killing the Night
King I think one of the arguments I heard I don't know if this was from a
fan or just somebody writing for the access media was that she hadn't had any
really big kills and John had had all the you know all the sexy moments with
the Battle of the Bastards and hard home and stuff but if you think about how she
behaved well what she does in episodes five and six where she only almost kills
but then doesn't imagine them writing that all out and then they're like man
she's not gonna kill anyone this season of significance have you killed the
Night King you go it's like Walter Fray yes you can't just like do it this way oh no so
it definitely made them change their course they they they rushed it they
changed course they started boot you know smelling their own farts and they
all start smell great use that we saw in the documentary and I've seen it
firsthand with the with the Orville like the worship that goes on with the show
runner like how much power they actually have people are always talking
about them talking about pleasing them there's that one scene in the
documentary where the costume designers all excited cuz Dan and Dave are gonna
be there and it's you know and I get it that's that's within their work
environment but you can see how that derails creativity because you know what
what's George's biggest problem with the prequels that everybody says he was
surrounded himself by yes men and he didn't have a Gary Kurtz around to tell
him you know no and and plus he's a billionaire so who's gonna tell a
billionaire no that's what happened is they gained so much power there you know
they're called to this day they're called geniuses I I don't personally see
that but you can see how they would absolutely and and and relative is
certainly in this scenario I was gonna say as well yeah I did kill the phrase
but I was talking more about me as a whole you look at that script about to
finish and they're like okay I it doesn't kill anyone significant we can't
have that um you could trade it all around yeah everything just stopped
stream just stops yep and I checked the thing apparently it is still stitched
together so this video should function still oh very good rags I bought a gas
mask after you talked about how I have always loved the way the Israeli one
looks like an anime eyes jackal hmm oh yeah gas masks I mean Halloween is
right around the corner that's a that's a cheap ass prop you get a gas mask or
nothing real ones the assassination of Archduke France Ferdinand was the
inciting incident of World War one yes things happen before that set the stage
but that was still the inciting point um Google say the inciting incident it's
when the protect it's the it's what gets the protagonist involved in the story
essentially which isn't what we were using so well I didn't even mention it
at the time because it just it just wasn't what we were talking about yeah
yeah we were we're just not using it yeah maybe maybe I should be picking a
different word well we were both talking about the same thing what's the
moment it all comes back to basic inciting incident of the entire series
oh the series output of the War of the Five Kings but they said the inciting
incident of the series is the death of Lord John Aaron which I would happily
concede as well because everything kicks off because of that but what instead we
were talking about what insights the war it's like John Aaron's death didn't
look the war didn't have to come after that a lot of different things could
have happened
in fact everything's still at peace it's just that a couple of other
characters do a couple of other things and the most significant being like I
said when Bran is nearly killed for the second time
more please add some Tywin chuckles to this later I can't do that if I'm not
doing any post Tywin wouldn't laugh at this oh he'd be upset is two plus two
equals four yes I disagree that's actually a reference to the not so
great debate we would try to explain the guy's arguments the counters he was
giving to me and wolf like we would present something and you just be like I
disagree and be like don't argue stop it
I'm standing atop a sea of toxic Brutus all screaming for blood as Susan tries
to shut down our stream my arms wide open and a bloody smile painted upon my
face Susan will not stop his boys rise up he's referenced up Joker up saying
subjective rah get the roof when I see doggy daddy's chungus plumbus ooh ooh
when I sit on doggy daddy's chungus plumbus ooh ooh I guess oh whoa was the
first one oh whoa can he explain the respawning soldiers he said that uh he
would that's why we really didn't talk about much of the logistical stuff he
said that he pretty much agrees with all of it anyway
but I guess we could have talked a bit more about it at least this seems like a
very long way of saying everything is just subjective so accept it it was a
bit of that but also thank you for releasing re-releasing the not-so-great
debate in an edited down formal I really needed the extra dose of cancer was to
add help Arya Stark teleports behind Night King oh may we mass India Roo is
that supposed to know oh my god come on mauler work with us oh my woman Shindi
Roo I've never announced that before what you know you know that the anime
thing right the assuming it's the nothing personal kiddo kinda yeah yeah
I've never seen that before I feel out of the loop now
but I know that nothing personal kiddo especially not helpful behind somebody
why it's hard then get out of the kitchen toots Wow if Peter Jackson can
do mostly faithful adaptation of Lord the Rings and it is possible to do
justice the Game of Thrones an adaptation of the very least also hi Rags
hello the one thing I'll say is that obviously Game of Thrones isn't finished
yet it's harder to adapt something that doesn't well hasn't finished but that
doesn't mean they fucked up well before they ran out of false material so yeah
George has probably changed his ending about four times since he's talked to
him cuz I Reese I I've always heard that that conversation was years ago like six
years ago so a lot of stuff could change and apparently there was some drama
between them too so piloting a plane is not easy engineering a rocket is hard
you're still expected to perform those tasks properly not an argument you hack
and people feel differently when it comes to art that like they would argue
probably that there's tangible arm done when you don't perform the tasks that
we're referencing with the ones but I think there's a lot of exceptions you'd
be able to find with that but it is the point being that I agree have you
considered the Captain Marvel is a perfect movie in the Disney fanatical
Marvel Universe also I'm axing you is rags a good boy I am a good boy in the
Disney fanatical Marvel Universe it wouldn't even work cuz Disney you've had
control since I meant to so that's the film still destroys everything I made if
only it was the first of Disney and I'm like it's Disney's fanatical style
um it's hard unless you're a femoid talking about my dick I literally don't
care well rah ah then don't do it no plenty of gallium can do it better
I'm all in my last super chat you said RD was your favorite Tarantino movie
reservoir dogs to be honest I figured it would be actively great and a joy to
watch was wondering why you're not fond of hateful 8 though I liked hateful 8 at
first and I thought about how nothing makes sense in that film and it soured
on me quite quickly I kind of like the characters still though I think a few
of them are wasted but if you think about the plan and what everyone's doing
there and what they choose to do it gets really stupid really fast but I mean I
still interested in Tarantino's movies because they usually got great dialogue
yeah laugh my ass off just be good you loser I found your vids on TLJ and loved
them well thank you I'm glad you enjoyed them they're good if I hear like one
more time I'm gonna werewolf okay no we're here wolf I are killing the
Night King is dumber than if ghost Yoda snuck up behind Snoke and tickled his
nuts causing him to explode and destroy the supremacy I would have been better
I would have enjoyed it more yeah this George hasn't finished the books yet
line is tiresome we would have accepted an ending that was completely divorced
from the books if it made sense yeah I agree I absolutely agree would Yoda
tickle his nuts with the force he's not he's not very tall he can probably he's
Yoda's like that height right if you're sitting down Yoda's about nut height you
can full stickle why can't you full stickle that's how that's how Yoda's
people measure height in nuts oh Molly you good man you sound a little off
today I it's hard to explain but I was that debate I was not feeling it at
certain points and I I mean I don't like to call it out during a discussion
because it almost feels like it's whether you're when you try and call out
that something's being derailed you've derailed it even if it wasn't derailed
you know I mean by doing that almost yeah and I didn't want to highlight like
with Daenerys we were circling back again and again and again and again and
again and again again and like I really felt like the Daenerys conversation was
over like ten times before it ended yeah I I had been convinced and based on
everything I've seen I was definitely already leaning that way but he I
certainly was not certainly was not convinced by anything he's there's you
know some people like gotta like control better you've got a people on
track better you got to try and like reduce the amount of answer time he was
giving us like I think that's fair I think that's fair we probably should
have stepped in a few times because he was going on and on it's I think a lot
of the times we were just like it's he was just going on and on and we're just
like it's really tough to tell sometimes because you every is for every single
moment they're speaking you're like is this the end of the sentence no oh no no
no no but I I think that's a fair criticism we will keep that in mind in
the future I think the thing is especially because it was kind of a
basically a 1v3 we I know that I certainly felt like I didn't want to cut
them off too much I know I do every once in a while because I feel I don't want
people to go down rabbit holes yeah but I get what you're saying I got you
yeah we do we do try our best with that sort of thing like you we definitely
several times would be like that's not addressing what was said or like stop I
think I said stop at one point cuz I think down rabbit holes I even advised
him not to head down some moral rabbit holes because he was playing some stuff
that anyway don't act like anyone could do better I hate this guy now I bet he's
gonna tweet about how we should be okay with eating bugs someday near in future
I don't confirm it could be a yes it also I think the eating bugs is about
some reference about how we should start eating bugs cuz they're good for you and
I guess environmentally kind and stuff look at chef Vito said yes and was
dominating that debate and then he lads said Vito for roof I don't know if what
Vito means was he was talking a lot or if he means he was winning the debate I
don't I don't know he was talking a lot I he was talking a lot that's for
certain but basically all of the points that he made were either completely
irrelevant or not the problems that we have or extremely poor rationalization of
some and like heavy interpretation desperately relying on very small things
blown up to big things there's lots of assumption going on there
apparently Vito thinks he has was on fire all right yeah of course he does I
also hate the you couldn't do it argument clearly they've got the drive
so given the time resources and support who says they can't yeah I agree it's
like we're really not sure of what any people in chat or us are capable of
because we haven't had this opportunity so to assume we simply can't I don't
know that's a bit unfair I think mauler and I were talking the other day about
we're pretty much both if you put if you take any any writer for any show and
then pair them up against the collective noggins of the internet the internet
will come up with a better story than you very guaranteed yeah that many minds
working together ha ha poopy pee pee tickle your cream sack I will Yoda guess
that is a direct quote from that scene that didn't actually happen but it's
probably a deleted scene makes sense deleted scene yeah Danny does a 180 in
one episode if she had butchered everybody in the red keep only it would
be fine committing genocide as a whole other level yeah that's why my
suggestion I was just like she can kill a bunch of innocent people with collateral
damage John can be just as outraged because she didn't have to do that but
she was that pissed at Danny she was so pissed she wanted to burn down the whole
red keep it's not too unreasonable to assume she would do that especially if
she was really angry but to systematically destroy every portion of
King's Landing is like what are you doing woman like ridiculous I certainly not
been convinced that that makes any level of sense doesn't that that kind of
action requires at the very least a couple of episodes of King's Landing
populace being showing up showing some sort of uprising killing someone solid
doing something to motivate Daenerys to do that to the populace to where she
just doesn't give two craps and now Cersei beheading Missandei that's Cersei
still that's not King's Landingers they were locked in there they were used as
human shields so and she had to know that if we're gonna go on assumptions
she said but no we're gonna fry him anyway cuz it makes sense cuz she you
know she she fed a guy to a dragon who was a slave or she thought was a slaver
tactics well you know if we're using the mafia argument the mafia doesn't commit
massacres it brings attention to them for one and it doesn't win over people
and the one the one thing the mafia does it wins over a lot of people they
strategic kills yeah that whole argument was flawed a Theo brought up in chat I
was gonna bring up but I just I guess I left it on the floor at one point but
it's in my video as well to annihilate that many people in your populace it's
like oh yeah this will make them fear me it's like they're gonna fucking hate you
they will never forget this you better watch this will be something that's never
forgotten entire thousands of lineages could have been ended and she's there
are several good for Westeros and Westeros no and knowing what we know what
would what has been established in the show there would be five or ten Lords
who would just be waiting to take their chance to they can see that dragons are
easily killed you know you're on took out one feels and there's ways to care
I mean it's just one dragon that's still something that needs to be feared
obviously but there are ways to kill drag I mean they have to be watched all
the time you pay the right person you can get access to it that yeah there
will be Lords plotting immediately it would not be a very stable rule at all
so you know again the motivation in that was what and then afterwards which
we didn't even talk about she you know they did that ridiculous fascist speech
and it which was just dumb the only thing it was good for was memes and a
good thumbnail where I could put the Hitler hat on her you know but yeah it
just over and over again on something that I mean if the argument in the chat
was it didn't deserve that much time I could agree with you on that it was just
it was bad in so many ways and it was because of it didn't have any depth it
was all god superficial I don't know if that's the right word it was just all
simple Game of Thrones became simple at the end yeah I agree with that
foreshadowing doesn't mean it's set up properly there's a bunch of videos on
YouTube that came out soon after all this stuff the Game of Thrones or
addressing that can't just go oh it's foreshadowed in season one episode three
I could I could find some quote out of the gajillion quotes that might lend
itself to what I saw or what ended up being the case you can do that with
anything but this character said this one piece of dialogue of this one episode
this one time not for everything it's like oh that justifies it that's fair
enough let me add him his points are so wrong it hurts you guys should invite
Jay Longbone to watch Batwoman with you um maybe I don't know if she's
interested or not 100% like the thing is if she wants to do videos on it it might
be awkward that we've got a video of her reacting to it you know I mean like she
might want to do her own thing and also I have to admit the way it is right now
with me rags fringing in metal a lot of the time something stupid happens and
like all four of us want to want to call it out and so we stumble over each other
until one person gets the mic if you know I mean and so if you have a fifth
person there like it would be crowded yeah and this is like I think it would
still be funny it's just that I don't know if a fifth person can really work
with how much all of us have to say about how dumb everything is in that
show yeah and the stuff is always happening there's always stuff to
comment on pretty much I mean that film is dense
efap how do I get an objectively hot girlfriend objectively hot you mean like
in terms of like Kelvin yes like if she's I don't know man like I don't get
like someone who's a fever thing or she's an alien and being hot is but
honestly be confident have a sense of humor and be willing to listen those are
those are the three golden rules that I just made up instantly there you go
golden rule fun if you're fun to be around they will want to be around you
if you are dull and boring then you like Game of Thrones season 8 no no from a
lot of women out there it's don't risk it don't risk it risk it don't risk it oh
yeah don't get married fuck that shit I really don't flavors the most
respectable people this is the thing I actually killed him for no reason I've
eaten meat before it doesn't mean I'd eat human yeah these are these are a lot
of obviously kind of been over the I found easy extrapolations the idea that
like it was a defense of her actions to say she threatened to do things that was
baffling to me yes right I think we'd all happily agree that there's a lot of
things people threatened to do that would never do them then that's the
whole point they use a threat
just watch this just watch the scene Danny looks cold not like she's enjoying
the burning of the harpy man also we're not talking about Joffrey I figured it
out he's an alien quick get him to draw something but appreciated memes free
Hong Kong death is preferable to communism I agree absolutely no no we
got a bad evolution of our age and them and take their money now oh it works
children aren't like their fathers oh yeah I wanted to bring that up he
referenced the Mad King and how he did similar things I was like isn't the whole
fucking point of that what episode where he's like children about their fathers
like yeah we're not responsible for our ancestors like that I guess she just
that coin man that whether or not she's insane coin it just landed on insane it
was flinging in the air this whole time yep just needed that I really wish they'd
never had it in the first place it's such a lame like 50-50 chance will be
insane and even if they seem like they're not insane they might suddenly
become insane yeah Danny loves collateral damage that's why she killed
all of the women she freed when the witch killed Drogo and her kid oh wait
what the actual fact there were no gamers left alive in King's Landing so
they failed to rise up they lived in a now a society them all up bring us his
head I would net such violence such by whose metric his sums it all up there
oh even by his well before the innocent so by this guy's logic Hitler did
nothing wrong because his point of view of the victims were not innocent I don't
know if you'd agree with that I can't remember what the context exactly was
what we were discussing at that point but I know that it conclude that she did
consider those people innocent I'm all it didn't you know you burn them anyway
yeah well it didn't you know metrics are subjective
Bryce didn't you do a video on that person who found metrics to be racist oh
yeah the tweet yeah I how yeah units of measurement are bad they should be done
away with any proper communist society will do away with the concept of units
of measurement I think we can all agree with that right Gary units of
measurement man like I saw them the other day down the street and I was like
fuck you man like hey and I was like no don't don't give me that units of
measurement shit oppression well even knowing how far away things are miss my
super chat I posted in efap 54 you never responded to it in efap 55 you went from
the one before it's the one out why did you spend the whole super chat telling
me to read an old super chat instead of just saying the thing that you think I've
missed I can't go back to efap 54 super chats you don't you can't search super
chats cuz you don't understand I'd have to yeah you would have to read that
would take some time to search through because there's a way to look at all
your super chats but that's a lot of scrolling you know how many super chats
we get so you guys don't mind we could stop right now and look for it nobody
minds they'll wait it's Matthew sin saint sigh is he in chat right now if
you're in chat right now just ask the question whatever it is
my eyes in the chat if you ask it on Twitter I should see it that's another
quicker way to do this is you don't understand how much I'll have to load
that's it's a lot yeah and this is not like just loading loading this is
loading I guess laggy every single time you hit next page I'm in the chat okay
we see ya ask your question there is ask the question do it do we I don't have
twitters that's okay asking in the chat you're asked the question bridge keeper
I'm very excited
really and before it's like a super offensive question or something let it
it doesn't get past the filters on channels over there no we're a tree
everybody's all excited now this is gonna be I'm I'm ready it's honestly like
deliver Matthew I figure you guys would have noticed by now but there's not a
super chat I won't read out I will I've not avoided reading one yet oh oh we'll
do it give you up any second I guess I'll read the next one let me know if
you guys see a cue I'll keep an eye on it this guy can't differentiate between
rationale from detached observers perspective and rationale from the
characters perspective that's kind of dumb
rational from detached observers perspective I think I think that he felt
that we were having trouble with that I guess you could say about both sides but
I always felt like we had more references than speculation I must burn
the children for future generations De Nario Bobaglio De Nario Bobaglio
burn the children for the future generations so wonderful listen the
future generations can't be oppressed if there are no future generations okay it
makes sense out war makes strange bedfellows ie Republican France and
Tsarist Russia is that the theme of Game of Thrones maybe you can see it
maybe or make strange bedfellows oh yeah why not anything ah the discussion may
be appreciate Robert Baratheon so much you realize that the dude was 100% right
about that sadistic Kant yes I said that my video Robert Baratheon was right
if only we had trusted him
top 10 letdowns in Game of Thrones discussion needed well like top 10
saddest moments of that discussion is all you're after oh there it is it is so if
I had written the Star Wars sequel trilogy I would have had a civil war
between the Republic and those not wanting to go back to how things were in
the prequels Luke tries to keep the Jedi out of the fight it wouldn't have
been a bad idea but the question I guess it will hold up it would depend on I can
believe it like if it was especially if both of the factions were very morally
dubious or kind of gray areas or there wasn't a clear right answer that would
get Luke to be like oh yeah obviously these are the good guys that we need to
help them oh it would be great if like Leia asked Luke to like win a fight for
them and he was like I can't I can't I don't believe in this something great I
can't risk my pupils something like that I don't know it would certainly be very
interesting and I I agree that would be that would be something I would be
willing to watch yeah I would like to watch that unfold that little that your
little pitch right there has more background than the two new Disney films
I already feel like I have more context just from his from his chat that I know
nothing about anything from The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi I don't know why
the First Order happened I know I know I'm supposed to read books and comics
and stuff but I'm not going to so done Matthew Rags if you're still here when
super chats are being read as a doggo yourself what is your stance on neutering
if what do you think what do you think it is it's probably exactly what you
think it does I don't know as it as a human and what's your view on castration
oh my boy from my balls away from my balls mate I was born with him and I'll
die with him well you got a look at this or something like that right
I'm also a curse wasn't that from that fucking movie that Jack Black movie which
one the one like the 10,000 BC one Oh year one or something wait what was it
called the one with Jack Black and was it not John Cena Michael Sarah oh fuck
yeah no I know you're one was that what it was called I can't remember what the
name is but I know he's a joke about keeping bulls in the purse I'm guessing
enough yeah he there was there's a unikit and he keeps balls in his little
and a little purse and he throws them at one of the characters at one natural
Libre not your Libre kill your enemies they win the idiot oh no yeah that
sounds like a big idiot sounds like a out of a guy I think that's a bit that's
big that's too big brain for big idiot history is written in blood and even
the greatest heroes have likely done terrible things odd mentality or
thinking has no bearing in the narrative that is what George is trying to
represent I don't I think room to say that also I believe it's about time mr.
Nodrotic to say goodbye to the like to tell them all where they can find sure
you can find me at Nodrotic you can just search it here on YouTube and
subscribe if you like it I talk a lot about a lot of things Game of Thrones but
I will be talking about watchmen tonight with our good friend doom cock I guess
who's on the previously that should be fun got you guys back to back I'm sorry
we couldn't get at the same time you know how scheduling conflicts are you

wash some of the poop away on my the streets of my fair city San Francisco
you live in you could guess you can guess all right so thanks guys yeah
obviously I was gonna say the link to Ned Roddick's channel is in the
description he does cover lots of lots of media you've been on enough times now
that I think most of them are gonna know you but if they still don't hit the link
check the stuff out I've been on a couple of his videos here and there you
might be able to find some of them and then start looking at all the stuff it
makes sense right have fun watching bat woman tonight I know that we will have
fun watching bat woman when we finally get around to doing that amazing look
forward to it all right guys take care see you around dude
then there was two and then there were two I think a lot of the fake F's no F

being ironic is it not come back and gay oh thank goodness
they were the gayest of homeloids home alloys it's back more did a boomer I
didn't do nothing I was oh wait I just did a double negative oh no I did all of
the things sorry you can hear me right Rex is it right I can't hear you thank
goodness hey more I hope this helps out a bit also high torma tacos if you're
watching art a draw her rocky hoard or Dothraki hoard is basically a traveling
grape carnival that's kind of true hey that's great for some of them they can
they can increase their population with ease so unethically that is my
subjective interpretation there you go analysis complete howdy gentlemen I have
a deep question for you I used to be a sewer worker best job I had to wear a
harness before entering manholes this gave me the unfortunate kink of
harnesses my question is what kinks of y'all gotten from weird mundane places
and do you regret them well I normally whenever I'd venture down a manhole I
normally don't do it with a heart I'll be safety enough for that you want to go
straight yeah yeah the danger is the thrill you see kinks that I have
developed through like jobs and work that's a good question but one I'm I
probably have to think about not something I consider oftentimes I used
to work in a I used to be a I used to be a valet one of my previous jobs so the
idea of like casual sex and cars might have come from that imagining just
fucking railing someone in a car I like that idea kind of kind of kinky for me I
dig it but that's the only one that I could probably say comes to mind at the
moment I'd have to think about it it's an odd question a good one but an odd
question yeah I was gonna say I don't really go any answers nothing I can
think of like weird mundane development you ever just want to hate you used to
work people you used to work in retail right dealing with people you ever used
to want to just hate fuck customers you know what maybe just on a time down to
the desk and maybe fucking fuck them you ever want to rape them I wouldn't go
that where the thrill comes in knowing that they haven't can because some
people are like that I'm not like that just for the record I think consent is
cool but you know you know how some people are yeah it's it's a it's a thing
to think about I don't know I haven't really considered it myself so that's
why I don't really have any answers it's a mundane answer I like it when like
when she's like in the car and her ass is hanging out the side and some guys
just fucking her drilling just drilling just hammering that nail absolutely
just harness in that manhole nothing sets up madness like establishing
stability yeah I think that's relevant yeah the discussion you know the world
is better off after Hitler when he died fascism never popped up again there are
I don't I don't disagree with that yeah that's that's gonna be a tougher one I
understand the argument I don't agree well I don't think I do well there it
I've heard the argument that it's good that the Holocaust happened because it
shielded it it woke up the world about the horrors of genocides and things like
that and I don't agree with that but I understand the reasoning I mean it's
don't think it's a good one though the session especially because of the scale
of it I gotta go by you massive goodbye in my opinion a specific German ruler
with a stylish face didn't gas millions of people can't put a number on things
like that right I mean for the questions thing I mean there there was an
interesting discussion there to be had about the concept of is we know which is
more valuable the life of someone or their freedom and things like that I
spaced on what I've seen the it's it's interesting to think about how many
people would have Daenerys had to have freed from slavery in order to justify
you know ex-lives that were excellent we're talking like at least I want to
say six hundred thousand at least I'm being generous when I say that yeah
that's that's a very interesting moral question not one that I'm prepared to
solve at the moment playing devil's advocate the world was better off with
her she did contribute a lot against the Night King but I don't think he was
thinking that that would have been a great argument if you'd that would have
been a better idea I actually would have been like oh well baby yeah maybe she
actually legit saved the world which I mean if you're saving the world I mean
it if anything is the cost of saving the world it's the world so you know but
those situations where it's like you might have had a good point if you only
had the right references once you just use just fucking have someone
teleport in and stab the Night King then what's the true actually argued she was
kind of useless because her men are wiped out and a dragon doesn't really do
anything other than like yeah saves John at one point yeah like it's like oh yeah
just go run across the wall and go assassinate him we all know you can do
it just do it mm-hmm someone said noted is like yeah I agree that that's why I
don't agree with the idea that you know ultimately it was better that the
Holocaust happened I mean in my what I would say is that if it if something
similar to the Holocaust happened but it was much much much smaller in scale and
that began a movement that actually prevented a worse genocide that
argument would be more solid but still it's a really touchy subject for a lot
Lyric said no Kybin literally says there's a million people in King's Landing
no but she doesn't kill everybody and that's why I said I was being very
generous by saying she only got 600,000 for sure
yeah that's who knows what the aftermath was like all of the all of the ash that's
fucking up people's lungs yeah there's a yeah she killed a lot of people there's
no doubt loved how it ended hated how it got there my take on Game of Thrones
season 8 in a nutshell I'm not sure how I feel about how it ended regardless of
how it got there but I think I would have been much more on board if they'd
properly hi ragged hello and do surgery no can't do surgery you can perform oral
on your kids I don't know that that's true um I guess as long as they're of
age it's legal to perform oral sex on your kids right oh maybe I guess I mean
I guess I don't actually know it was actually illegal to perform surgery on
family members I didn't know that was a thing well I've heard that I don't know
if it's real but I think there was the idea that you aren't allowed to from
surgery on your own kin I don't know if the logic really holds through for that
I'm not sure you would think that with your own kids you would be like super
duper extra careful I don't know though this was originally a part of this chat
look at them freaking out it's like this is brought by super chatters and our
guest what are we supposed to do ignore yeah they were talking about it but
maybe the idea is that if you perform surgery on a loved one and fail that
will have extra emotional repercussions that could damage their career or their
ability to operate in the future I don't know what the rulings are behind it I'm
just speculating a little bit I like to do some specutisms that's that's just
what I think I don't know first time super chatting where did find lists per
Lord he's we covered his video and he said he'd like to have a discussion on
Game of Thrones and so we did hmm pick yes an IRL well he's not here any
freeing unsullied save more babies in the long run
oh you mean like despite the many killings wait that's not impossible
because they've all had this they're they're wonderful pieces removed that
that between a once wonderful in the center of the body it's all gone as they
say in the show the stones and the pillars the stones and the pillars right
for each of them multiple pillars please bring tonaled on to debate this guy why
would we do that tonal deserves like full attention from us we need to explore his
mind asking about like new games that came out wouldn't that be so fun like
tonal what are you playing games are you looking forward to what are your big
games you know the big game and what's your favorite game of all time tell us
why oh yeah that would be something to ask I would legit be interested then
we'd have like questions from the audience what's your people want to say
yeah I guess Jay's asking chat how it was they're all saying it was bad I mean
we did everything we could we're hoping it was at least enlightening as to why
someone would love Game of Thrones season 8 or like
seeing the show is trash without bias is bad but sucking it dry without bias is
good ain't no Sanders like double step I mean he did that no one that's never a
problem when people like things for bad reasons yeah it's like you get a if you
like it you get a pass yes an IRL saying mean things is bad also yes an
IRL I think Danny killing a thousand is okay because Thebes it wasn't because
Thebes this was because the way I don't think he ever said that was a good thing
or anything who would win a silverback gorilla or a werewolf bipedal and
quadrupedal variants say the two options one more time silverback gorilla or a
werewolf and you get the bipedal or quadrupedal a werewolf a werewolf win
every time because it's yeah absolutely a werewolf werewolves are like
supernatural only like so they got like a curse the curse of lycanthropy like
they can regenerate pretty quickly depending on what law we're talking
about too and then obviously a second it's like hits this gorilla with a bite
or a scratch that gorillas fucked yeah they're supposed to be like super
strong and super fast and stuff like that the gorillas are no joke sure but
mine is a werewolf yeah I'd have to see the sizes I guess because again it is a
lot of law questions it was kind of the same with with the vampire I don't know
them law details themes no dratic will know this the punisher is a far more
cruel and morally gray character he wouldn't murder women and children
what's Daenerys's excuse I noticed that I've heard it brought up that she was
distraught over the loss of her dragons yeah he never mentioned that I think he
mentioned the death of Missandei at one point but I've never liked that excuse
anyway it's like people you love die therefore you start killing innocent
people like I don't follow
but yeah what's Daenerys's excuse she doesn't have an excuse so I shouldn't
compare George to Tolkien but to Mills and Boone that's where I have went wrong
Mills and Boone is bills and don't understand
manga anime recommendation skull face bookseller Honda sand on the Sun as a
retail massive mauler might really enjoy and find the protagonist relatable oh is
it gonna be an anime about a retail person I could see myself enjoying it
for sure ask D&D themes of the eighth grade oh shit yeah damn I wish we'd
told him about that so one of D&D are on record saying that themes for eighth
grade book reports like disparaging the shit out of themes which is again not
something that we would support either we're certainly not in the camp the
themes suck but like they don't seem to care or at least maybe they've changed
their position on that I would have to get like an update see if someone else
something but yeah interesting comment for sure it's meant to be Sunday a day
of rest but not for me bad realizations with this one the only good commie is a
dead one like we've had that a few times rags have you heard about the Air Force
retiring the 8-inch floppy disks they use for the nuclear launch systems no I
have not heard that
then I guess I guess I mean if I mean there's the idea that if it's old but it
works and it makes sense and it's reliable I mean yeah might sound silly
but I don't I don't know about them I don't know about if there are any super
duper benefits to using floppy drives I don't know maybe there maybe there's a
reason why they kept it so long I'm not certain yeah must be reliable I guess
yeah maybe they're less prone to something that new technology is not
sure on hacker floppy disk of it yeah it's very possible please never have
yes and on again this this is amongst the worst commentaries I've heard he's
awful ignorant delusional pitiful I don't think it was the worst I wasn't
worst the majorly one was worse did you think that was the worst I I would say
that it's are we including the not so great debate oh yeah it's gonna be
between them too I guess yeah one of those two this was definitely the best
what just the best in general well I mean the best of the three yeah never
bring him back no notification YouTube sucks I hear JJ claim Yoda's lost name
is la he who lay he someone said in chat it's harder to install malware on a
floppy disk and their small storage space means issues are more obvious
that's interesting yeah assuming that's true yeah that's kind of interesting what
I imagine that like because it's older technology that the ability to like the
amount of people who are good at writing malware for that sort of thing
there's just fewer of them anyway mm-hmm each of these hilarious oh I said yeah
there there was a activity yeah certainly more of a spectacle I can
understand that argument that was more entertain what the moist floppy massive
is happening that that's one way to put it of course it's always worse for the
women we didn't actually determine that lack of satisfaction does not equal
feeling bad
lack of satisfaction is not equal feeling bad well not being satisfied
would find as a bad feeling would it not I mean if you're not satisfied man it
depends on how you feel about neutrality yeah I suppose I mean it's
being neutral good bad in that sense or is it its own little thing
I'm not sure I don't think that should have thrown me as much as it has the love
of Christ kicked them too obnoxious kick them they under if they're referring to
maybe the three of us from now on you will refer to chat as the Chad as
penance for making making us listen to yes and IRL you could leave it any time
you want no one forced you to stay through we did not shackle you not do
the shackles we also open with the white walkers and we see how that goes prologue
is still the first scene yeah great it ended six months ago how y'all still on
about it sure how are you guys why are you talking about Game of Thrones
Terminator Dark Fate is coming out I just I just like the idea that it's like
we'll talk about something like predators like like that came out fucking
four years ago why you talk you're right I guess it is killed all I feel is pain
oh why does nerd sound like smug Adam ruins
kick do you think in erotic sounds anything like Adams ruined everything I
don't know I haven't listened to Adam ruins everything in a long time I am the
same on that rags held chat at gunpoint what oh hero Ragu the fagu and others
Haru Haru I understand raw I feel like a roofing this dude that's an interesting
context most people would sue like roofie but it's like no I would be
terrified of King Bran he can take control of minds and is looking for the
dragon sounds like the beginnings of a tyrant to me yeah that's right let's
just let's just hope it all works out I guess oh sure it'll be gray I'm sure
everything will work out just fine there's again all worked up over
nothing would have been awesome to see Bragg walk into the mountain yeah I'll
go for these payoffs if we can't get anything else
Bran can't see if Night King can be killed with fire because Night King was
not killed with fire he was killed with Valyrian steel I mean just that we've
already addressed the whole like ability to see it's the future thing is weird it
would destroy the whole show if he could like in any consistent manner so of
course they just write it autism and just hope you skeptics the asshole
burgers is strong with this one hey buddy get off your high horse no one's
buying it real question yes and are you in any way connected to the NKVD
director yes of because your torture methods are very effective oh no hey
yes and what is 30% but also half I know that just woke up and who did you'd say
brand is his favorite character guess this will be one of the most painful
debates when I go back later also hi rags hello how is wolf doing doing good
as far as I'm aware yeah let's get credit to D&D for sticking to Martin's
vision D&D didn't really want to do all the dreams and magic and stuff for the
show yeah this is the thing there's so much complicated shit going on about how
much they stuck to his vision I'd rather not speculate even I think this guy is a
lispy fig I came from AR was to be the nice raw yeah I saw that as well rags I
was thinking of saving I've got a couple just save them all for the meme stream
hey rags molar and nerd just a quick question what happened when Pinocchio
said his nose will grow right now it's the paradox his head explodes it is the
only logical conclusion I don't know about that yep paradox is because we
don't know how they'd resolve that's the thing his head explodes have you not
read the in law dude really I haven't read the Pinocchio lower out reading up
on the loompa lower how much have you got left of that you've been reading it
for like years now I will I'll write a paper on the right law about how long
the law is I'm trying to stay a couple episodes behind so I have something to
listen to for my trip to Texas lost later this week I should be watching
this one on my way back home from there also hi rags hello I hope that is gonna
be an entertaining way back Gordon I hope this was everything you hoped it
would be it's all Joker earlier this evening with my dad and younger brother
it was as good as you said genuinely masterful performance from Jacqueline
I've actually confused myself on whether or not I'm pronouncing that right anymore
yeah Quinn or that tell me how to pronounce it I've thought too much about
pronouncing it now I've forgotten the way to pronounce it
I do you remember pronouncing it rags what's the correct way
announcing what the yakuin Phoenix Joaquin Joaquin walking fiend that's all
that's always I've heard here is whatever it's one of those names where if
you've never like even if you've heard of the name Joaquin and you see it
written you don't put the two together it's a really weird it's a really weird
name yeah I really need to get that in my head cuz I'll probably be saying his
name a lot especially with incoming Joker podcasts Joaquin but yes true
excellent stuff I have nothing to say so hello rags hello this dude is a Todd
that's a small amount for all those hours of entertainment you pride I wish
I could give more oh and hi mauler hi rags oh hello what do you get Thor
Skywalker as guest balanced knowledgeable not against it I think he's
actually on the list I think people have asked for him before it's a big list
Gary I watch rags fall out 76 video three times last night and I was never
bored yes I'm glad you weren't bored by it use this I'm always happy to hear
that people are squeezing every last bit of enjoyment because playing that game
was not always fun gonna get that three times if you can watch something three
times about getting bored that means it was good four times obviously you'll get
bored there's no feeling but uh yeah three times that's when you know it's a
true good genuine good a real good use this for some canned dog food you
absolute lads worst crime against humanity pineapple or broccoli the
worst thing for what with crime against humanity I actually don't don't hate
broccoli so no I love broccoli I have like broccoli is like a snack to me I
got a bunch of it in my freezer I can heat up whenever and I love broccoli
broccoli is delicious pineapple by itself is fine too like I like them both
I'm not a fan of pineapple myself you don't yeah that's fair enough pineapple
is tart you could say is but I like it for that reason I will say that broccoli
I think broccoli goes with a lot more stuff than pineapple because broccoli is
very complementary to many delicious food stuffs that is the definitive
objective answer and nobody can challenge it and if they do they're wrong
with that out John Snow identity equals biggest hate rhino of all time
the density didn't really matter in that last season let's be honest let's I was
psyched to you for Watchmen tonight Gary kidding I want it to be good though like
I said I'll be interested to see his coverage of it cuz I'm very much an
outsider when it comes to Watchmen but I saw the movie I have the graphic novel
I'll be interested by the way I have I have finished I will survive the Zootopia
comic by Orba that's interesting you how many I don't dislike it how many
characters I rate I don't know I it's better than Game of Thrones all right
all right what wait I'm I'm Ross says never rags never talk about food I'm
I'm unironically a god-tier chef in saying broccoli goes with more than
pineapple is garbage-tier ignorant no don't don't don't agree I think just say
you're a god-tier chef back to him you could you could have broccoli on the side
of anything and it works great and that's I'm not disparaging pineapple I
just think that I just think that broccoli is better it'll be the great
war of efab broccoli versus pineapple I'm on team broccoli I'm sorry but I
guess if you apparently I will survive is a Zootopia comic about Judy Hopps
finds that she is pregnant with Nick Wilde's baby and while Nick is very very
happy to hear this that he will be a father he is dismayed to learn that Judy
Hopps wants an abortion and this comic is basically just about their
conversation after she breaks to him that news was it compelling I think it's
certainly interesting I there are deep questions to ask because of it even if
it is a Zootopia comic it's not a poor comic or anything but it yeah I can see
why people both hate and like it mm-hmm I asked the shad question and that's the
point you won't get it but you should ask him with all seriousness it'll be
hilarious also hi Rags hello you know I will it's in there I hope I remember to
ask it seriously I will do my best we'll see because if we say to shad will
you give homecoming leeway for being in the Disney fanatical Marvel Universe how
do you think he'd respond to that if I was trying to be serious Disney
fanatical Star Wars universe no Disney fanatical Marvel Universe so it almost
sounds like I'm saying something Disney fanatical Marvel universe I want to hear
that question again so if I said to shad will you give homecoming leeway for
being in the Disney fanatical Marvel Universe what would he say he'd probably
probably baffled and went clarification about what that even means I'm trying to
think of like I wonder what he'd say if he's like how could he interpret that as
an actual question or would you just say like what do you mean by fanatical and
that's when I that's when it's over that's when the curtain is up that's
when I'm I'm dead to rights that is when I am common phrase like I'm just
done that's where it's at so we'll have to see how that goes next time I'm
referring to all the dildos with YouTube channels never said customers
Freddie Prince jr. on Star Wars critics okay Bayou and do your thing yeah the
Freddie Prince jr. clip where we'll probably see him say that stuff alive at
some point gonna get the the right yes and selection eclipse if you will but
oof next joker efap look at the king of Joker driver it's the worst Joker take
I've seen also high rags hello boss yes and off a roof scan me I dare you I
guess we'll have to scan you first before you can trust you all right who
would you cast as James Bond I asked because I think me 207 will be unlike
a bull as much as her attraction Henry Cavill would be my first choice um for
who James Bond Henry Cavill wouldn't make a bad James Bond
Fred James Bond
that's there's probably plenty let me see obviously Danny DeVito goes without
saying and I think if someone told me why so has to get a special mention what
about Channing Tatum yeah maybe those three in a singular movie together
playing the three elements of his personality simultaneously hmm let me
see Henry someone say Cavill's me well Cal was really good as the bad guy in
Mission Impossible yeah I liked him in that a lot yeah I thought he's really
good um Kevin Space Peter st. Peter Dinklage I agree oh Nathan Fillion I
would be absolutely down with Nathan Fillion is James Bond yeah I checked
out yeah he give the super charismatic you know kind of side to it I love that
the the clever sort of you know less less the gunfighter more the super
subterfuge disguises kind of thing I would absolutely be down with that that'd
be great good idea um Medea absolutely Medea on the ham that could be cool um
hmm Joaquin Phoenix but only if he's playing the Joker of James Bond Joker
Bond your British actors someone brought up Richard Armitage that would not um
maybe maybe hmm maybe Michael Fassbender possibly potentially Obama yeah yeah the
dawn of course you've been Sammy yeah yeah I'm hardy I want to see Norm
McDonald playing McKellen Oprah Bond Jackie Chan bond Brie Larson bond okay
now we've gone too far that's going over the line now shrek bond that's fine but
Brie Larson bond it was fun and then you just had to go in a room terrible
terrible terrible Gary say baby girl is a naughty girl well I think it's
important that you get that message to him I will save it for the next time you
I've got so many messages someone's saying Mark Hamill is Jake Bond I mean
why not I did remember the past bring it to life if you have to no no episode 9
for you the regs do you plan on replying to Patricia taxon formerly Eric
taxon video as I've said many times it is a terrible video that really isn't
worth a response or hurrying to one we will probably get around to it but
eventually this is the thing I don't know if it's gonna be possible this year
very low priority I've got like at least for you fabs planned and then a whole
bunch of ones that are like in theory and then we've got episode 9 coming like
I don't know where it's gonna fit and it's gonna have to wait I think the
knives out looks pretty good but I'm not going to get my hopes up well trailers
are supposed to make things look better you know yes we'll see high rags tell us
why masquerade is your favorite film I thought the actors did an excellent job
conveying emotions I cried like a baby but I also laughed at the parts I think
that it appropriately shifts its tone the parts you're supposed to laugh in
the parts where you're supposed to feel very sad I think that it does an
excellent job conveying know the themes of loyalty and staying true to what you
think is right I think the sets are excellent the music really does a good
job to accent what's happening in the scenes but man it's just such solid
acting from all of the people involved and I don't know their names because
it's a Korean film I just don't know the actors I'm not familiar with them but
man I was I was super invested in all the characters and all that's but I but
I would really adore it I need to rewatch it sometime because I just
remember watching that and I was sold I was so into it
hi Gary did you say hi to rags for me hi mola oh I guess he must have said hi
to you at some point so I'm gonna say the answer that probably yes well just
in case hello hi wags
hello yeah always keep always always leave him wanting more hi gowie guys
walk you're great too mola but pronouncing your R as a W isn't clear
imprint so I left you out of the gag mm-hmm okay I accepted thank you very
much rags if you had the money would you get a suppressor short-barreled rifle
short-barreled shotgun a machine gun slash any full-auto or all of the above
would I have either one of those or all of the above I guess yeah definitely all
of the above of course all of the above but because that's obvious if I could
only pick one of those it would probably either be a suppressor or a short I
don't really have any interest in automatic weapons myself
I'm fine with having razor fist on just don't let him poison the well on Kojima
I don't know that Kojima is gonna come up because I don't know if Kojima's
really ever come up in our he fabs passing but yeah if raises was to come
on or if he wants to come on don't know you don't even know what the topic would
be okay figure out what he's interested in
mola if ab live at Wembley Stadium when 20 2020 when you got a slot oh it'll be
a little the time for now but if you freeze yourself we'll see it faster than
most relative to your perspective rags please sing two more drafts of Iowa
young war thing I posted all right let me scroll up it's very easy to pick out
from the other messages in the discord I was young wa I assume that's how to
pronounce it okay I was young wa yeah see if you want something a bit more
dramatic ends on a lower note maybe want something I guess more jubilant you
could always go like I was young wa yeah something really I guess I don't know I
hope that I hope that was good that's gotta be it I feel like it's nailed oh
yeah I think it's I think that does a good job
can me I dare you also hi mola hello random question for you all date rose
Tico or Captain Marvel date Rose Tico or Captain Marvel Captain Marvel has more
power you should probably get your stuff um Rose Tico living in a world where
she's about to get blown up by a huge army of death story things well I think
this is I think that is this someone like if we're in this relationship with
them are they in our work or are we in there's I figured that since they use
the character names that we'd just be attaching ourselves to them sort of
thing in that case Rose Tico
um what's the rationale exactly I get to be in the Star Wars world they give all
the places I could go to get away from this bullshit I mean the Marvel universe
ain't so bad either oh I guess that's true there's the Guardians it yeah I
suppose that's true hmm yeah I don't have to stay on earth I could go anywhere in
that universe who okay because what's interesting is that we've already have
this discussion shift away from them as people and the worlds that they're
attached to but if it was just them as characters who would you pick like to
hang out with I would probably so my interest with Captain Marvel's I would
like to actually crack it when I convinced her that she's actually a
piece of shit by going over everything she's done did Rose Tico I mean probably
nice
I don't think we'd have a lot of similar interests me and Rose who would you
rather have sex with
I don't know who would you rather have sex with
do I have is it like as they are in there in their respective films I would
say as they are or in any way that you believe that you could alter them through
a relationship
a very hard question that is a very difficult question I would I would I
think I would rather have sex with Rose Tico if you're adding the relationship
part it probably would be Rose because you at least have a chance of like
having a develop what rather than dealing with a literal God also I think
the actress if we go on by ages younger however after Marvel wouldn't age so
because I longevity of the relationship I guess because I think that it's in and
again before a check it's up in arms is no doubt they have because of the lay
this is not like definitely this is very much this is very much a tenuous
decision that I'm making I am I am legit like kind of conflicted on this but I
think that is what I would go with if I had to commit to it not just threaten it
but if I had to commit to it that's what I would do that's who I would do I think
you have a right yeah it's it's not an easy question chat I don't think you can
go to person for trying to answer it I also think that these are good super
chest by the way but I kind of think like they uglified the actress for the
part of Rose Tico right with the outfit in the hair and everything definitely if
a piece of information that's important check but I think but I think that they
did their damned hardest to make Brie Larson look as attractive as possible
every scene in Captain Marvel so I think that does wait it to some degree
and was this like one fucking you and that's it or is it like dating them
fully well I hate to sound I hate to sound like so like a superhuman but I
guess it depends on like their personalities and stuff well a question
from the super chat was because it's dating yeah cuz it's dating so that
implies over a period of time seeing them regularly and from what we see most
of the Rose has the superior character I think so too but even when you're
dating most of the time you spend with them will not actually be balls deep in
that pussy so you're gonna have to it is a very real thing that you have to put
up with the things that they say and do and you know again I think Captain Marvel
would just be smug and insufferable imagine that you kind of disagree with
her she'll zap you not that not that Rose Tico doesn't zap people too but you
know at least his is from a device rather than her innate abilities as a
godlike creature I think and I would say that Rose Tico at least tries to do the
right thing more than Captain Marvel does yeah
then again this is and this is really tough I can I'll absolutely understand
arguments on the other side I'm not super invested in my decision but I
think I can I think that's what I would go with this guy's arguments was so
mind-bogglingly stupid she didn't think the people of King's Landing were
innocent because they didn't revolt and so she burned innocent children to free
them from slavery yeah I mean that ended with I'm agreeing that she thought
they were innocent anyway so more I can't wait for the 24-hour gedel
rags I watched that PF game with you and Aiden and I agree that Jeff was bad
writing because the DM made it to grim dark I agree with Jeff Jeff was the
unicorn oh well they said I agreed that Jeff was bad writing the DM made it to
grim dark I I don't Jeff made it to grim does he mean Bill who was the DM
I mean I think I've said I've made the criticism that when every every fight
that you encounter is some super other planar or other otherly planal
monstrosity horror eldritch kind of abomination when they're all like that
it's kind of yeah mm-hmm it loses its appeal it's like if it's like in a video
game of every every item you find is some crazy magical enchanted prophecy
induced enhanced ring of some crazy property you know that it loses its
grounding sort of but I mean there there was a lot of good aspects to it there
were some bad ones but hmm also high rags but anyways guys also I just would
like I finished the sequel to I will survive called born to be alive Judy a
year later Nick Nick leaves Judy and he returns a year later to talk with her
begging her for forgiveness that he walked down on her and didn't support
her during her time of need and distress and he comes to discover that Judy has
taken a lesbian lover a vixen in fact and he in a fit of two moments of rage
Nick accidentally shoves her and causes her injury and it ends with Judy
basically dumping Nick shoving him out the door and the last page which is the
only page in color she says she's better now much better and that's where it ends
so I guess the person who wrote this comic really didn't like Nick Wilde
because he kind of gets shafted in both of these so this is very interesting
mauler and rags cannot be a part of the fandom menace you're not fanboy enough
and thank goodness for that well except Lord the Rings sadly also hi wags hello
I think there'd be a time where we consider ourselves fanboys but yeah I
said the best the most valuable love is love that is conditional and Star Wars
turned into something poopy and therefore I lost my adoration for it
mm-hmm please don't step on snack then God step on snack dad right then I think
it's about the Bible horse oh right yeah mauler the other day I was grouchy about
having to work another several 12-hour shifts all weekend and this woman told
me I should smile I never felt so threatened and unsafe in my own work
environment what should I do and pry reporter to the authorities yeah does
she have a motorbike or any kind of vehicle find a way about all the other
people that she said you should smile yeah and then you have the ability to
electrocute people with your bare hands I need to know these things before I can
advise you on what's next but there's technically yes with static electricity
through there is a story called Captain Marvel it has a how-to guide on dealing
with these people you'll find it in these special features deleted scenes
hopefully just give that a gander and
if Jay watches Lord the Rings and you confirm it will he finally be made a
host or at least a permanent recurring guest Jay objectively makes the best
even watching Lord the Rings is what you need to do to be consistent on this
podcast like that's the ones he gets that all's is boring though yeah he's
kind of gonna have to make up for it a lot it's not just watching Lord the Rings
at this point it's gonna be a lot of things yeah and all those off
maybe he can high rags hey and mauler Oh hero high should become a guest I
don't know who that is I don't either this guy's logic was so bad I volunteered
for raw to throw me off a roof also high wags hello you'll be happy to know I've
been breaking down the past efaps into individual audio clips for meme
dialogue to minimize requests voice clips in God oh wow
sounds extensive that is a lofty task all viruses are immune to antibiotics
all right okay I don't learn that I didn't know that I think jokers did act
from dancing down the stairs onward would have been better if cut down felt
like it dragged and really took me out of the movie really I didn't feel that I
kind of I was very much going every bit of it because he felt like a character
who was finally able to do whatever he wanted and that the juxtaposition of how
happy he was computer how sad I was I was able to revel in it for a little bit
with him like he's having fun it's been so horrible up to this point and then
the police thing happens which is a nice sort of lied right back into reality hit
in the face and you pretty much get to the show so I don't know it seemed to
work for me I'd have to yeah rags I know the dictionary is bad sometimes but the
definition of obfuscate is misleading and so one more time yeah rags I know
the dictionary is bad sometimes but the definition of obfuscate is misleading
and confusing
that's fair enough
I have a super I give it a high five yeah yeah actual harassment and someone's
just super tired that alone I'm all around rags what do you think of creep
show never saw it I don't know what that is
Gary Danny went dragon postal that's an understatement thoughts on Jay getting
kicked around on Facebook oh right you know but yeah no reason why you know
about this rags so Jay was a part of a Facebook group that was apparently
created in aid of basically being like talking about TLJ without being a dick
or Star Wars okay so like just just kind of about it nobody gets angry no
those insults everything like one gradually they've been getting more and
more like aggressive toward anybody who dislikes the film and then it was like
this post like your asshole who thinks the film is good you get more and then
apparently they called them out for it like this is really not what this place
is meant for and then like he got a response from someone saying like if you
think that you don't really you can really be and then I think he got booted
is what he says yeah that oh okay then reverse toxic fandom
that's kind of what we would be getting that like there they're obviously gonna
be Wow geez opposites to these scenarios the people who are like overly obsessed
with how good a thing is because you see you see it all the time right like the
straw man all these people think that themes don't exist these people think
that visuals aren't important to a visual media like who are you talking
about where these quotes coming from yeah what you're just pulling this out
of some imagined version of me that you've completely fabricated in your
head if you search rags on YouTube rags the worst youtuber by Patricia taxon is
the fourth results what are your thoughts on it also hi rags hello
terrible video not worthy of our time really we might get around to it later
low priority oh look it's you bug me toe for
it is currently the fourth result but uh oh that'll last that much longer no I
don't think so um rooftops are cool but defenestration is cooler
the act of throwing someone out a window there's a word for that all right
well I can I can see the reasoning with the loud crash and the linear glass
everywhere certainly more spectacular I don't know how taxing can think he's a
woman because calling rags an intellectual coward when he won't even
talk to you guys takes actual pulse well he was willing to talk as long as rags
wasn't here yeah that's the thing he wouldn't come on if I was there
and as we saw today I'm super unreasonable I wouldn't say that I'd
see you hide your bigotry but answer oh yeah that's right you have to you have
to listen in between the lines very you're a very bigoted biggest double
by goot the treachery of the long knives was correct
not sure how to react made me think of the night of the long knives oh I don't
I guess it's a Game of Thrones thing and I don't I don't know I have that one
hey maula any computer gear you guys recommend computer gear I've had good
luck with audio technica headsets I think logitech makes really good
keyboards and mice especially the g600 which is the mouse that I use the one
that I will always recommend probably looking for gear a g-sync monitors are
extremely nice I use an 80 2020 USB plus that's literally the microphone
like fucking everybody has now like you have it it's really good yeah it has it
springy has it wolf has it it's 120 bucks so good it's like look it in and
top-of-the-line consumer grade that doesn't you know go into a tier of money
that's kind of ridiculous like oh yeah the next one up is the
or it's called gush or luscious fingers a podcast a microphone I think h3 and
but I mean I'm I'm not opposed to the idea of upgrading this one to get
something better but this one is really good and I've been very pleased with it
yeah as for like I guess computer gear that's more specific than like
peripherals it's just gonna you know you know how it works it's like good value
performance for money has it changes every year pretty much depending on what
around who's releasing what yeah I wouldn't be the best person to ask for
up-to-date information but plenty of websites probably have good
recommendation the chat glitch slipped by last leaf app so asking here what was
your favorite instance of Arthur's laugh he's got so many my favorite was the
laugh that picks up in the background during the penny flashback flash flash
back uh my one's probably the one where he's laughing out of sync jokes in the
comedy club
huh gives me a big sense of just how much he's struggling to get it I liked
his laugh after he got fired and he was leaving that cuts off really quick
because I thought the whole punch out thing was actually fun
yeah I was actually kind of laughing along because I was the legit funny
thing that he said if you could make one Star Wars movie one Marvel movie and one
DC movie what would they be about and why holy shit that's that's for me add
to you I guess that's like six different answers
I'm also high rags hero the one Star Wars movie would probably be assuming I can
scrap full trilogy give me one movie to try and crush a big story about the
things that happened after or maybe just do something distant in a other part of
the world have some fun the Marvel one I kind of always wanted a movie between
Infinity War and Civil War going over what earth was like however many years
if it's not to where you had a team that was government-oriented and sent out
versus a vigilante team and how cap and Iron Man the dynamic in that I wanted to
see what was going on with that that was for DC movie like I really okay with
anything good I don't really have a preference with what about you rags
what about me what was the question again if you could make one Star Wars
movie Marvel movie DC what would they do they have to be in addition to what we
already have or you can make your own rules with this one I'd probably I'd
rather make it I think I'd put us make a Star Wars movie over in the other ones
and it would be between it would probably be about some it probably be
concerning the political strife of reforming essentially a galactic
government after the Empire has been substantially weakened and all the
interesting stuff that happened as a result of that all the conflicts that
might occur because you know when you talk about the scale of this sort of
thing happening there's obviously going to be problems that arise from all right
we have I mean it's a good thing that we did in this case but we did create a
power vacuum we need to fill it efficiently and quickly and it's not
gonna go over well with everybody so you know it would be very Star Trek II in
terms of negotiations and things like that and there would be you know
potentially renegade groups that go against whatever but that's that would
be something that I would probably the most interested in creating of those
three what's your opinion on the Harry Potter movies don't really have many
strong perspectives on those I watched them all at least once I thought they
were neat yeah they were fine I guess but they probably weren't mostly yeah
I've not really given a critical eye to them yeah I never really cared for him I
unsolid Sunday nerd row big boy in 2019 and solid son that referencing my Sunday
my solid Sunday Sundays aren't solid they're like they're sock wids there'll
be some kind of reference we're missing maybe I guess I just don't get it
Molly you're a damn cool dude you rags is a babe yeah boy Gary is freaking
awesome to reminder that Island of dr. Moreau from 1996 might be right up your
alley it's an entertainingly bad movie I've heard about it I was gonna say I
think it's been suggested before also be by the same super oh my
Tolkien would rape Martin and love it wolf oh it mentioned that it was funny
defenestration for Danny I don't know I mean she's dead already so throwing out
her windows I mean do it funny cuz she'd be all limp in there a game of thrones
needed more foreboding with the events leading up to the Night King and Daenerys
like a sense of inevitability to the Night King victory and Daenerys's fall
both were like proof that happened
oh both were like poof that happened yeah I got it um yeah for everything
honestly just for everything everything needed more time it was too rushed it's
like it's like batwoman things are so rushed you have no time to get
investment in a lot of the events characters China should be reduced to
hand borders don't understand what I don't know what those are but I like the
idea of reduce finally watch the screw steam stream on wags his channel why is
Jim stealing so fat and stupid I mean cuz well probably doesn't have good diet
and he done the exercise is the answer the first one he's not stupid he's just
he's got blind spots I think he attributes things to other the things
that I don't think it's logic necessarily follows a lot of the time
D&D rolled natural one when making season eight and nine out of Game of
Thrones reroll reroll have any of you considered posting on bit shoot it's a
new creator focused her video hosting platform designed to give YouTube some
competition yeah I thought about it certainly yeah it'll definitely be the
the backup if things go awry on you if the choice is watching you go through
every super chat since if ever one or listening to that massive you had on
this efap again I vote 42 hours of
hmm if we could make the topic interesting I don't feel a way to make
you something I'll do it I'll be fine be great
sorry not nine bad type or maybe not but it was so bad I couldn't exist I think
he meant resist but yes resist an efap excellent this is just what I need right
now been feeling down in the dumps lately someone snuck onto our farm and
killed aura and with all your nice corn yes all of the nice corn was ruined not
the nice core I mean the bad corn is still there they didn't do anything with
the bad corn and they cut down the nice corn rags refused to answer my question
he is paid off by evils I asked all the efaps how does owl swim through tree not
how owl fly also high rags hello isn't it pretty obvious he's you know put one
one wing forward and wish past all the leaves pulling you forward a little bit
on the little twigs with the other arm slash wing and rinse and repeat swimming
through a tree nailed it
crack open a cold f with the boys for Game of Thrones sans is in smash love you
fellas have a good night hope I'm not too annoying free honk conk
free on Kong pisses profile Dave is the reasonable extremist just woke up passed
out and from what chats telling me about the guy it was probably good for my
blood pressure off my ass off a cop a couple of joining score says Ian dabbing
on balding Twitter soy guzzlers like him
her dad mauler of the Welsh even white yeah mostly in think I'll be my my
assumption from from what I see around these parts but you get all kinds of
colors down here to every color under under under the wonderful rainbow
including purple people like Thanos are welcome here we're not gonna bear I just
mauler are you finished with game criticism I know yeah I mean if ever
there's a reason for it to come up on efap I'll obviously do it and I would
like to make more game criticism videos one day it's just other things that sort
of priority and makes me a while to get any video done because I want to go
they're covered to the newest standards I'm sort of getting to but I have been
doing redrafting for part three of TFA I just I don't know that I'll be able to
start editing that one rather than working on a dark fate video because
I'll be seeing that very soon
hey rags you requested additional information regarding the question I
sent last efap to clarify the critiques that your peen and or butthole would
give you are completely objective and unbiased all right I instantly know what
you're talking about mm-hmm for those of you who are not aware his or for he that
it was asked of us would we rather have a penis that is constantly critiquing
offering critique on our love making or our anus would constantly offer us
critique about every but about us every time we critique something I chose the
but tentatively because of because of lack of some clarification I will say if
can other people hear this voice if so then it will be the butthole if other
people cannot hear the voice then I'll go with the penis if it's because if I
have someone giving me objective information on how to better fuck
someone that I can instantly apply into giving someone else a better time and
enjoying myself more I'll take that yeah that's what good yeah that's actually
like excellent that that'd be great but if I also someone offering offering me
criticism it's probably definitely not going to be something that takes me out
of the moment too much I'm still gonna be having time of my life but if it is
something that it other people can hear I wouldn't want it to be the penis
because I don't want the other one other person there having my penis speak to me
while we're you know going at it so I would go with my butthole I would say
they're saying only you can hear it then in that case I would rather have my
penis offer criticism during the lovemaking so when I'm doing the
horizontal hokey-pokey I don't know how to do it the best way possible always
looking to improve my game and if there's any more clarifications
sunrise will alter his answer but that does seem to be pretty extensive there
you go hi I clean my carpets hello wags also that guy well this last week wags
did Murray deserve it Murray the guy on the talk show no glad you said
wait there are people who say that Murray deserved to be killed I wonder
what raw would say raw would say raw would ask if he's gay or not but I mean
we you you know that some people have some crazy tismy takes on Joker I bet
there are people out there who were like yeah Murray deserves to die because he
was part of a class allegedly or something whatever but no obviously
Murray didn't deserve to be killed hi rags hello hi mauler hello mauler if you
ever have time you should check Vinland saga it's an anime such manga it has a
character that is basically Welsh Tywin can't go wrong with that combo
couple and Scorsese eating these capish babies is great okay shit babies is
great James Gunn crying and posting tumblr notes lol off my ass off go film
captain boomerang scenes with polka dot man you lose a kid diddler I mean you
didn't make guardians one and two that was pretty awesome films and he didn't
diddle any kids as far as I know yeah it was it was some weird stuff with going
to like was it even like really yeah really weirdly themed parties but that's
completely different than the act itself I mean that yeah not even on the same
plane the thought in the action there's all we've always we've always got to
make sure to draw distinction between those two but I'll agree it's just like
what oh is there a theme oh no it's just like a what
I mean yeah he he got fired and reinstated and as for popular and
Scorsese coming after deep shit films like good for them they make films that
are just better than everyone else's apparent or at least Marvel fine
authorities on film we can't possibly not take their word 100% seriously hey
rags
say what I'm sorry I'm sorry I like I like completely actually phased out for
a moment sir can you say one more time I'm sorry I said hey rags oh hi hey
there your equality video a plus plus yeah thank you very much I'm glad you
liked it also hi mauler hello have you watched the videos of the XR guys getting
yanked off the top of the trains the other day I'll offer a solid 20 minutes
watching it the XR I have no idea what that's referencing yeah I don't know if
that's referring to XR hi rags and mauler hello hello hi there favorite
black-and-white films
hmm I hate to be Eric on this one but probably 12 angry men and Citizen Kane
and this hmm I don't I can't remember too many that I've seen off the top of
my head like oh
I I can't remember many that I've had
I don't know I'm gonna have to withhold judgment for the moment have you seen
judge dread 1995 and or dredge the dread 2012 what do you think of them if so hi
rags I really like dread 2012 have you seen the Stallone dread film I have not
I've heard it's Mimi we should that that could work for DFAT movies actually
yeah yeah that's it's it's I remember being funny but yeah the newer dread was
was so much different like night and day someone saying birth of a nation I've
totally forgot that one oh for black I I'm always a I'm always a sucker for a
happy ending you know I've put broccoli in spaghetti bolognese is this is the
person we can trust right I mean I that doesn't seem like it'd be bad I mean I
don't see why broccoli and pasta wouldn't go together like seems
reasonable to me I don't think that's unreal yeah I think that's beating a
dead horse is bad unless it is undead I agree that's fair enough well beating a
dead horse isn't bad if it's just a dead horse you're just applying pressure to
dead flesh rags have you read the sequel oh wait yeah see it I did more
like the lame of thrones on my right absolutely freaking aim of throw wait do
my super chat call out to Susan when the stream went down not go through shame
sorry we should introduce Eric attacks and to Roz roof everybody's going to
Roz roof a lot of people are huge Q who would win Bobby Hill or Bart Simpson Oh
Bart Simpson easily we've seen yeah I feel like Bart Simpson's got the blood
lust in him and he can tank so much like he gets strangled regularly in a very
vicious man the vivates I'm thinking that plus all of his ingenuity Bobby's
going down how would you feel if spider-man had a crush on Captain Marvel
in the MCU I read a rumor about that the other day and felt sick hashtag praise
the dawn oh clearly they're doing something with him and MJ right so that
would be weird if he had a crush on Captain Marvel mm-hmm I have to see what
they do what's there to like like what's what's there to like what about Captain
Marvel the MCU know about Captain Marvel no like actually tell me what's
there to like that is the job of the sequel now to create something likable
about her that's the challenge that's why I'm kind of interested to see what
they had
suppose we'll just have to find out do more efap Jackbox I love that we can
interact we're not against that yeah I do want to play that game again I want
to see if it's like I'll test out a few more things maybe try reduce the
players down or something I don't know what it is yeah I enjoyed the game I
thought the game was fun as well it's it's fun but I do feel like it's really
heavily weighted to the trait not the traders the aliens I agree with that
unless in the unlikely event that we got really unlucky four types of a row with
the bioscanner and its communication in the maybe aliens get and get screwed
over really easily but I would assume it is just by its bias towards your
thoughts on the last samurai my favorite hi rags I really like it hello well I
don't know what to say about accuracy I'm sure somebody probably has a
breakdown somewhere on YouTube but I remember really enjoying it yeah a
stone wall shad keep asking him until he gives up
stonewalls not sure to make of that the wall shad keep asking him
hmm I'm not sure
him all a Tom Lenka's James Bond just saying it would finish Andrews arc oh

Bond from everything I've seen of him and also hey rags come play in my show

it'll be either a sad or scary day when rod doesn't have a roof high enough to
eat someone off I don't know what it'll mean don't know what it'll mean the
culture of if why live why go through this charade hi rags hello I just
looked at that taxan vid and felt the need to donate to you it's just so bad
thanks all right it is pretty bad I don't know how it ranks we still need to do
that big extreme thing I think I've actually got the link for it now where
we can rank like the content creators we covered so that'll be fun but uh whoa

ever had an abortion before she's the first rabbit to have an abortion yeah
maula tell wolf we miss him also tell him to embrace the prequels halo for and
Nickelback of course I will make sure he's a by the way does the idea that
Hitler is the worst human being where does the idea that Hitler's the worst
human being come from Stalin was a way way worse and all you ever hear about a
Nazis and Hitler I think it's the whole Holocaust aspect of it yeah yeah how bad
the camps were themselves and I mean a lot of it is optics I think I mean
obviously they're both very terrible but I think Hitler story it it tugs on the
heartstrings a little bit more because it's attached directly to like a world
war and invading countries and Jenna you know all that all that nasty terrible
stuff these are the I was once throw this lispy queer from a root is lispy
queer the thing from even Crowder stuff with Carlos Maza let's be queer things
yeah that was the one yeah yeah the context is him being fucked fucking
branded you asshole oh yeah talking about the PSA sit shit his opinion about
Joker on a livestream a few months ago few months ago but he said the story was
cliche obvious and shallow the writing I'll read all of that really well he's
wrong very wrong we will maybe maybe we'll be able to talk to him he said a
few oh sorry a live scene a few moments ago not a few months ago oh yeah well
don't win them all you know the hate mongers of the toxic brood are Russian
assets using objective film criticism to so disunity and division into American
society Hillary Clinton

of stuff like that

do a podcast on a podcast that would take forever I only ever do like if it's
on the last thing we want is to watch someone for like 10 minutes as a section

stub your toe on a box containing an mg 42 do you keep it for yourself take to a
museum or do you check the bushes to make sure there isn't an ATF agent
hiding in them I'd always see check the bushes there the legal complexity of
what happens if you find a machine gun is raises many questions that would
depend I will tell you I'm not sure what I would do but I I will say that I would
be extremely tempted to just not report it I would be like I would be very
tempted to just not report it yeah I probably just walk away like oh god a
gun in Britain we we get spooked by simple spoons oh imagine era I'm sitting
in my green room in YouTube Studios when Susan and her assistant walk in me
Susan Patricia hey it's mrs. watch Kiki Susan oh Patty that's fine now rah

Hollywood stuff that there is some freaky bad stuff that happens that is no
good very bad yes sad how fucked up all of it is from instant
I like my women how I like my wine seven years old and locked in my cellar
alright excellent choice rags I choose the peen as well also good work hunting
down that info about morning stars that was my other chat from the efap thanks
yeah it's I think it was an interesting question I think a lot of people think
they know the answer but they don't so it's good to kind of get clarification
on that fell asleep midstream missed your response in regards to skull
faced bookseller Honda son please repeat
just your response in regards to skull faced bookseller Honda son you does that
sound familiar to you at all in any way hmm skull faced bookseller Honda son
skull faced bookseller Honda son yeah I have no idea what that's referring to
an anime again I always assume it's an anime I have no idea what does chalice
I have no idea anime about a bookseller and use was an anime bra on efap every
roof a toss or e rat poetry make sense but is it about good rat or just rat in
general for the mom for the me maroonies mauler are you on your way rags to wear
to what thank you you wonderfully and beautifully twisted souls of men
all right then and yes glad to provide such introspect hell wolf the kingdom of
heaven is trash I rags hello I haven't seen kingdom of heaven in a long time
I'd like to watch it again yeah I think I think wolf is very pro kingdom I haven't
seen in ages so I can't really oh it's been it has been a long time I remember
liking it but that was years ago years
spider-man dumps MJ for Captain Marvel racism we'll have to see who bloody knows
watch killer bean forever for efap movie would you rather have sex with MJ or
Captain Marvel is MJ of legal age I'm assuming she's in real life I don't know
if she's in the film though is in real life then well okay and assuming the
character was of age I mean I just don't want to fuck Captain Marvel what if
there's a bag on your head though she's still ain't got no ass yeah but you
don't have to you don't look look don't look keep your eyes away looking
looking's half of the battle but look at looking is like it's a big part of it
you ain't gonna close your eyes well if there's a bag on the bag on your head
there you go you don't have to close your eyes you just can't see there's
back on my head
of example of undead horse to beat TLJ is a good film arguments they never
seemed to die kill it already we've still got like four huge videos about
how TLJ is still good to go through we haven't managed to make it through this
year of efap we have disappointed the audio don't worry give us a few more
years and we'll get there Taksin is completely self unaware she
complains about rags not giving a fair interpretation of the resonance argument
arguments whether or not that's true that's what she's doing to rags yeah I
think that's applicable now when you're gonna get pewds on I don't know if like
why would we have pewdiepie are you kidding kind of low low low fry low fish
small fish in a big pond you know I'd rather get guests that like have an
audience yeah I suppose that's fair enough like oh yeah I guess he has some
interesting opinions but it's like it's really about the viewers about what you
can bring
this PewDiePie guy doesn't he just like let's play Minecraft was generic thing
you could do on YouTube PewDiePie please come on you fat did you guys ever
address some of the comments on that IH everything podcast video I don't think
we did I don't know if we did I didn't know if I didn't know if there was
anything of interest there really but
always we got the the main thing addressed I suppose you guys miss me yet
from the Night King I'd say yes I missed the Night King everything was better
with you skull Facebook seller Honda Sun is a manga slash anime I recommend as a
retail massive I think more would enjoy I figured because the name made no sense
it was probably a I guess the bookseller part is where you go ah
retail of course rags would you rather fuck a male deathclaw or Captain Marvel
a male deathclaw I was gonna say that's pretty easy I'm supposed to make that so
easy we're doing like all these difficult ones and you just throw in the
male deathclaws male deathclaw that brings us to the end holy manulium how
long was that anyway seven hours see and to really that felt like ah nice a
normal sized episode a little long for me I feel like the the I feel like the
debate dragged on a little bit a little bit yeah I'll give you that I'm usually
not so encouraged to want a debate to end I just didn't feel like it was
really progressing that which is a very common reason for a person to want a
debate to end still glad we had it we got to experience what it was like to
speak to somebody who really did like season 8 which I thought they were
fantasy people but they exist and have arguments so that yeah that pretty much
leaves me with saying thank you all very much for the kind donations there's
loads of memes and I think next week we're gonna be doing a Joker stream
again played the Joker plenty of fun to be had with that one I'm not sure how
we're gonna do this this meme stream thing if it's gonna be like on a Sunday
or if we'll try and double it up oh yeah if I know ahead of time it'll be
fine as long as I know ahead of time cuz we're gonna have a lot of shit but so
yeah that's bad just a lot of stuff to go I know there's a lot of people out
there who like I've done fan art I've done in videos I've done means like I've
got a shit ton goals is probably collected and if it isn't shown on this
meme stream then just try me on the next stream or the next episode it depends on
how fast they're compiled looking at them now it's like holy got this
enormous list of fucking links this brings us to the end that's what you
think if you want to prove Benioff is an awful person a lazy narcissistic man
child with evidence the dragon demands there's a lot of content that you can
use I'm not too I wasn't too hell-bent on that cuz I don't think I've ever said
they're bad people or anything that was actually one of the first things he said
when he came into the call he was like annoyed the people thing they're like bad
people I've never heard that and if it is we're definitely we're obviously not
here to defend the morality of their writing yeah I don't think they're bad
people the fucking up the right and I would rather attribute it to a mistake
laziness like they fucked up or they were apathetic that sort of thing instead
of being I don't assume they were malicious I don't assume they wanted to
upset everybody oh yeah I don't think so I think that they probably thought what
they were doing was good and that's part of the problem get monkey Jones
Metaka as guest yeah I don't I don't I don't I would love to have monkey on
would be interesting um I don't know what monkeys up to these days but um I
don't know I hope he's doing well though this is a tragedy what happened to him
what really gets the noggin jargon with Joker is that no one brought up all
those sport teams using rock and roll part two after Gary Glitter's arrest
so one more time what really gets the noggin jargon with Joker is that no one
bought up all those sport teams using rock and roll part two after Gary
Glitter's arrest
Gary says is there a song in the film the Gary Glitter sang and they used and
it's awkward cuz like convicted of something I need more information cuz I
can't remember and I don't want to say something too drastic without getting
information I heard something relating to that but I mean what's your ability to
separate I guess something an artist does from the quality of the song that's
used it's like if someone writes an amazing song can nobody use that song
because of what someone else did regarding it or is seen I guess oh yeah
yeah I know the song yeah
I meant for a meme could you say are you on your way and have rags reply to wear
to what is okay so okay you go you on your way to wear to what all right there
we go and finally what's wrong with me metica my long man why no answer I'm
guessing they're asking what's wrong with metica I don't necessarily have
anything wrong I seriously don't matter would want to come on efap but if you
did I'm up for it I'm pretty much up for anybody coming on honestly yeah
everyone gets to come on Wynton Wynton please explain yourself explain
everything quits it could help but yeah all right so we'll see you folks next
week or probably talking about Joker with who knows what guests I'm not
actually sure of it right now but I hope you had some fun and this will be up on
moolah soon enough with a possible trailer reaction for Star Wars and an
episode of Batwoman being super super cut so yes plenty time a woman thanks
for watching and good night
layer white on efap that's that's the possibility too I'm not against any
guess and haha I caught it before the stream ended efap done watching Joker
again right now life is good excellent raw there you go both of them done okay
actually good night now yeah man I'm I'm glad watch Joker it's great yes you
prove that do it again seven times
