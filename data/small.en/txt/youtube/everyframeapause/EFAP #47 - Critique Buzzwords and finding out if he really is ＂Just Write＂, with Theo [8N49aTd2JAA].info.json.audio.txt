and away we go
but what
is ready and what is go if we look at monopoly
go is you know a specific thing
go is a form of salary
no go is a video no not a video game
board game like the original board game right sure there's a video game of the
board game though
but actually I played it yeah on x4 360 who's right
guys know that go is the shortest sentence in the English language
no it's the shortest sentence not the shortest sentence yeah the sort of
that's what I said the shortest sentence
yeah when Americans say sentence fast they start saying sentence
well yeah when you speed everything up you're gonna have to make budget cuts
god you guys get the discomfort of everything
the tea didn't make the uh it just couldn't make the grade
people are already saying wolf he's he will be here he's not currently here
it'll it'll happen eventually unlike the rest of us here
and the efap family wolf likes to prioritize other things
life and stuff is just disgusting doesn't you know that efap comes above
literally every single thing we've spoken to him about this at length
um but he seems pretty steadfast that there are things that are more important
than all of you guys now the rest of us disagree and we disavow his position
but he's definitely a work in progress and that's why you should elect us as
your 2020 candidate for the presidential electorate electionizer
yeah I think that we're going to bring the country into a new golden age
we'll bring balance to the force look wolf is just out for some cigarettes he'll be back soon
any day now or have you seen the podcast between alt shift x and just right that's a thing
alt shift x never heard of him i like the guy that does a bunch of uh
game of thrones episode recaps and uh analyses and such he does pretty good work
accidentally found it already what is this episode 15 game of thrones featuring alt
shift x and just right oh so it's like someone else's podcast with them two on it i guess
okay well i like alt shift x's wick i'm not a fan of just right's wick
but i don't know what alt shift x thinks about uh being objective about the wick or whatever
because he uh i've seen a lot of his takes and he usually says that his channel isn't about having a
a personal take on what happens so for example with how bad game of thrones was he was like
yeah you know this happens this happens this happens and that doesn't really make a lot of
sense because this and i'm not going to get into it that's not all this channel is for it's like
oh yeah but that's not i'm kidding because there's so many artifacts said 200 years ago in a book
that he wrote that no one read except well that's the true rags that is the true i used to read
books but then um i gave up reading for lint one year and i forgot how did that go it turns out
reading isn't like swimming or something you can just forget how to do it that's what happens so
now i only read through pictures and uh very generous interpretations hmm how do you read a
picture how do you read a picture well i say that in more colloquial sense it's like to scan it with
your eyeballs yeah to excess the aesthetics um lesson southpaw said he's been watching sakario
have you guys seen sakario i have not seen all rags can we watch that maybe even today yeah
fucking love that movie i've heard good things about sakario then they made a sequel and i almost
made a video like uh is he like an italian guy yep he's an italian he makes pizzas but someone
my name is a sakario he gets get some bad luck his pizza place is attacked by spider-man and he
has to fight him sakario is like uh in the spider-man universe great pretty good yeah it's
the sam ramy spider-man most people didn't know that that was actually in that universe it's only
recently been uncovered i had no idea yep because you never actually see toby mcguire you can only
hear his tears or his in different scenes it's really really good they everything storytelling
yes um so so how is everybody it's been like 10 years since the last year
it has been a while um i couldn't read last time either oh
i mean that's good because it means that you'll never necessarily reach you know an end
it'll all be middle and i've heard mixed things about the middle i've always liked the middle
namely being in the middle i've heard that everybody prefers it the right place to be
yeah everything's all about the middle or something
that was such a bad video i was gonna i was gonna say also that now that we established that i
cannot read um i just wanted to let you know that all the all like all the messages that we exchange
you know to set up these efaps and everything i don't actually know what the fuck you're saying
i just have to go by your expression yeah like sort of like the the volume
alone you just guess things from that yeah kind of uh and i just sort of just clap the keyboard
the keyboard and what happens happens mauler invite i hope that you've been getting legible
you know messages back invite be high cheek set me high to efap if you would like to be on efap we
would we would love to have you would appreciate such a catastrophe yeah there was someone posted
on our discord a screenshot of somebody in chat i must have missed it who said something likely
you know the reason you're ripping this video apart is because you're breaking it up into pieces
you keep pausing let the guy make an argument that's like i don't i don't think it's i don't
think i don't know about that i'm i'm not certain that's why we ripped into it i think that the video
was how we ripped into it yeah you know some videos can stand up i mean this is the thing
we've covered videos on efap that we've actually concluded aren't too bad even with our format so
some videos can apparently survive it videos are like that or why it's no longer fashionable to be
like an academic or anything because people people just go on the internet with some reference to
some book of some kind and start spouting utter nonsense in a video essay with like tangential
reference to some kind of theory by someone or something what are you saying that's probably
not even remotely relevant you think it was bad outside of the fact that it lacked more middle
yeah i think that theory just nailed it i don't see how anything else could possibly explain
anything i was so beyond impressed with it i don't know i have to feel like there's some
other issues going on maybe that's just me it was once said that a sandwich um without a middle is
only bread elthea we're mad at him for dnd have you ditched dnd for today d d d theo yeah
well this is the thing this was the thing that theo was supposed to be doing last time but then we
got sidetracked with being nazis you know it happened that takes my uh that takes our attention
away you can't blame us for it but this is the this is the final time you'll ever be taken away
from dnd unless he wants to come on fusion you have to know where you're in my last ever appearance
goodbye everyone we have to know who you're loyal to your friends or us i mean efap comes above all
like we said other than maybe oxygen but let you have oxygen okay that's our gift because i need
i need oxygen in order to partake in the efap so yeah i guess i don't need dnd in order to partake
it's either us or me high cheeks sent me high i can't get over that name
i like how before we checked it it was funny that after we checked we were like no it's still
funny the fact that it exists is still funny like it sounds like such a meme name
like you that's not a real name i like how we instantly paused the video when he said that
and again i want to clarify you can have a funny name no matter where you're from
that one's just hilarious that one's just funny me high cheeks sent me high it's just a funny name
i'm glad it's so funny it's memorable too
and i wonder if you like learned english you know after having that name and then
sort of look back on his name like oh man that sounds really dumb but in a good way it'll be
a good icebreaker be like hey i'm me trying to check semi-high people like what my name is
me high cheeks sent me high and you know i'm i'm sorry i got the first word but what me high
me high do you like okay hello hi no no no no me hi he's like oh i got you dude that plays it
i feel like that must have happened it's like oh you like to take it up the ass it's like no no
me high cheeks sent like oh you sent your high cheeks and he like writes all of it down and
shows you and you're like nope still not following me high cheeks sent me hi hello
see we've already written like a whole fucking comedy sent me hi like hello me high cheeks sent me
i wonder if his parents hated him and shouldn't it be my high cheeks sent me like no no no no listen
me hi cheeks how long's this scene gonna keep going oh the whole episode um so yeah we the
plan today is to talk about finally just right which a lot of people have wanted to talk about
phrases just writes video on objectivity and then if we can we'll get through another video on top
of that after that one um but before that but since it's thematically relevant there's another
video that i was sent and i i want to cover it first only 10 minutes this one um is is everybody
in the watch together ready to start up this disaster no let me let me click on the watch
together link and we'll explore this one is called modern critique bingo and it is a criticism of i
guess video essays using words that uh they don't necessarily understand and so that's something we
kind of do sometimes um or if we use words we don't understand but we we criticize people for
maybe that but also maybe just not being clear on say for example use one word and it can mean
several things it's like maybe tell us what you're trying to say instead of just using it and
assuming we know what your chosen definition is us kind of yeah yeah usually get confused with that
i feel that people misuse the word facetious often you're being facetious yeah i feel like
it's worth saying that asking for clarification is a good thing no it's bad if you don't understand
what people are saying immediately the first time they say it you're a fucking retard it sucks we're
in a society where that's actually the case if someone says you're being facetious someone else
might be like fine yeah i know and then they quickly when i was talking to somebody about
like game of thrones and i was like well could you could you define a nitpick and they're like
what do you mean everyone knows what a nitpick is except everyone disagrees that and then eventually
when i got him to give his definition it was completely different than mine on a very
fundamental level so like this is why we do this it's almost as if definitions are a lot more
fluid than they're made out to be there was an argument on twitter ages ago that was like um
he doesn't even know what nitpick means about me and then they were like what does it mean they
were like it means an invalid criticism i was like that's not what it means at all isn't like
i've always known nitpick to mean a valid but tiny criticism very small one that doesn't really
matter but it's still there in the way that's like your perfectly white suit has a small black
piece of like i don't know fluff on it i'm gonna pick that right off and like all right jeez it
didn't really matter you couldn't even see it it's like yep yeah it was still there um the
carousel connotations of like overreaching to try and find problems yeah and then and then you can
have people say because of that black piece of fluff your entire suit doesn't work and it's like
um no that doesn't really follow like how do you i don't know about that uh and that's what
people are typically complaining about people nitpicking for they're like don't all he does
is nitpick to try and say the thing is bad and it's like oh well i think that we should talk
about nitpicks because the reason why they're there and why and how we can get rid of them but
yeah i wouldn't say that uh everyone has a different definition of what qualifies that's
the problem i mean wouldn't things be better without those things that we could nitpick
yeah that's a simple piece of logic it's like why don't not have those things and how do we do
that well we need to identify them so we can learn how to not have them there in the first place
that'll be good why not have a consistent writing why not have no nitpickable things in it yes um
which leads us to this video who's going to bring up a lot of topics and this man's perspective on
all of them and we're going to have some fun on the burn um you guys ready oh who's fun
ready when you are oh yeah again this is called modern critique bingo if you guys
want to uh check it out yourselves all right do we need to do we need like a bingo board
in order to he didn't supply one with the video i was quite upset about that i thought that he
would in the description give me a link to a bingo board but nope apparently not he's gonna
do the bingo in for us
dx here's dx following video is in the 21
nine aspect ratio select 1440p for intended viewing well hold on all right all of like all
of my videos are 1440p 60 fps or at least they are now thank you that's bullshit for helping
um but i don't think i ever have to change i i think if you don't have it in 1440p if you have
it like 480 or 360 or whatever i don't think he i guess this youtube screen right i mean no it
doesn't really matter i've seen the first few minutes of this and his footage doesn't really
if you go to his his video click on the link to the video it's like in this ultra wide yeah
but like his footage doesn't necessarily um matter in a sense it's just a series of clips
in the background that not necessarily connected to what he says might be wrong only still the
first few minutes but doesn't seem that important but yeah yeah i've never i don't think i can
remember another video that had this aspect ratio on youtube criticism is everywhere it's
inescapable nature like the this fucking intro god i hate it i agree criticism is everywhere
right criticism is everywhere it's inescapable nature made possible by the accessibility of
the internet has made at the forefront of many discussions about entertainment and for good
reason the discussions we have about works of fiction promote critical thinking especially
when there's a back and forth dialogue about things we disagree on we learn a lot from the
things we don't like and as of late i've seen a lot of terms and terrible rhetoric thrown around
that don't really describe the issues at hand with a work as much as they act as a doorstop to
any real discussion or critique all right i guess is it setup the following seems fine
or critique today we're going to take a look at a collection of these terms and explain their true
meaning while sharply contrasting that meaning with the way they're popularly used today oh god
i it can all right so here's what i haven't seen this yet um my prediction is that his complaint
will be that philosophically object he's gonna apply some ultra anal philosophical
definition to objectively here that nobody uses um possibly well philosophers use it well i mean
people people hey come on man philosophers aren't people um yeah when i saw this i was just like oh
god here we go because uh i don't know i i feel like it's a very to be objective about anything
make a statement or a claim and it can typically be put into objective or subjective and then it
could be valid um or invalid as an objective statement like if i said uh there are seven
bricks in that wall and you look at it and you're like but there are eight so what i said wasn't
necessarily subjective it could have just been objective with poor information um but if i was
like there are eight bricks in that wall i'm i'm curious how someone would argue that you're not
being objective you you were clearly influenced by your bias if there was actually a brick such
be like oh well you were using your eyes to make that calculation and so you're just using the
interpretation of the light bouncing off of the objects right written is of your eyes and scanned
by your brains which means that truly you can't be passively you know which again i hope it's not
going to be one of those videos i mean i i don't technically bother with people if they go that
route because i'm just like okay so you think that nothing can be objective whatsoever it's like okay
that was a great conversation by most people i know are happy to agree on like facts
like there's eight bricks in that wall well typically people don't like to go against
sides being objective that's that's a boundary line they don't want to cross so if they if that
can be objective and we start to work from there and how can we how can it be approached with art
i will objectively is the most egregiously misused term in modern criticism it's also the
most obvious because it's popular use in the phrases objectively good and i think that
the most egregiously over you or misuse thing is like theme yeah i think i agree with that
um people abuse the shit out of the word theme and they don't tend to actually talk about what
makes uh a theme let's say well planned out or at least consistent with the actual narrative is
it just going it's a great theme they don't like to go for themes with strong like textual reference
which is how you make a strong interpretation right they just tend to you know bring something
and i don't think people have prepared to the work i'd say only people have prepared for the
whole like you know tlj's theme was blah blah blah then you go but this thing that happens in
the film is in direct opposition to that theme and then they'll be like no it's not i disagree
you know like yeah there was no we didn't need to go to the like oh it's my opinion
things it's like no no no these are the did did do you remember we had this with major lee or it
was like the whole idea of poe didn't make any mistakes and his his argument at one point was
the post that leah slapped him and i remember being like so by virtue of leah slapping him he
did something wrong it's not that she could have been incorrect about the scenario at all and he
was like oh no no no like you know it was the kylo kylo and ren were clearly kylo and ren
ah um no maybe second i'll remember i'll remember her now let's do it ray is her name
not kylo and ren kylo and ray who are the characters featured in the last jedi
in that discussion that we had we he brought up how kylo and ray had some romantic thing
going on between them he's not the only one who thinks that i've found well he that is sad isn't
it well he's just like okay okay fine what are your references they touched figures okay
i've touched fingers i've had my penis inside of people that i didn't feel romance romance for
well so this whole touch and fingers thing ain't gonna fly son guys i always find it really awkward
in that film because she goes from like absolutely despising him to like sort of liking him in just
one scene yeah he really poorly developed that's how charismatic uh adam driver is and how the
script just enhanced his charisma uh but yeah he so he said his problem is with objectively
good and bad so i'm gonna let him go on a little bit before i guess kylo ren i can add one thing
to that first order really quickly uh from uh like i guess the philosophical gap is that
that is one of the main digs with objectivity is the idea of objective value yeah we agree on facts
how do you the jump that people have issues with is going from
holdo as an inconsistent character in tlj to holdo's inconsistency in tlj is objectively bad
yeah which and then turning back into a general rule you start you have to dig deeper into all
the definitions so again i was gonna let him go first and then i'll develop in modern criticism
it's also the most obvious because it's popular use in the phrases objectively good
and objectively bad is the most evident in its contradiction good and bad are subjective terms
so good and bad are subjective terms the issue is that good and bad as i've said on this podcast a
million times and people really don't want to grasp this is if i told you to define good
your answer to me should be um well kind of depends on how you're using it in the sentence
yeah because it's two different uses of good if we go with google you got one two three
four five six seven seven seven main definitions so like the idea that someone uses it to mean
having the required qualities of a high standard which is the second most used definition
people ignore that they're like no that's not what good means i got 10 here so to be definitions
as a noun and an adverb yeah that's the thing it gets even worse when you start to look into all
the definitions as well because they can all vary to a different degree so if good if i'm using good
to mean of a high standard and i'm using objective to mean irrelevant of my feelings then objectively
good means of a high standard with no influence of how i feel does it not yep in that and you'd be
like well not necessarily it could mean and i'm like yeah yeah yeah but that's how i'm using it
that's what i'm using it to mean that's why i always say uh objectively good storytelling
typically my videos i'm trying to grow out of just saying good because i know people for some
reason will be like wow he's saying that objectively everybody should like it and i'm like that's
obviously no that's not what i'm saying at all but okay so of a high standard and then you you can
go on to say but a standard is subjective that would be the next step but like we couldn't even
get that far with this guy as far as he's concerned good and bad are subjective things
um just decreed their subjective terms and you know i'd like to see some backing for that
exactly why that's the case maybe i'll go into that yeah and i don't know that seems and there
were people out there who'll be like wow use google definitions that i'm like i mean we can you
you can use whichever one you like let's google if anything is the simple ones which means that
if you want to keep going in we're just going to get more and more and more exact and that only
helps us well and this is the thing google's just trying to represent what people are typically
using it for that's what a dictionary is for it's like hey this is what this word is typically used
for and so i appreciate the fact that the primary definition is to be desired something that people
like or want it's like yeah but that's not what i'm talking about the definitions that google gave
us you disagree with and yeah that's the thing if you're very specific about it and then i was
going to say and that's why we use sometimes words like solid or um strong we say like writing is
strong you're like what do you mean by that and it's like usually mean tight what do you mean by
that and it's like well with heavy objects that's kind of that's the primary definition of strong
right probably i don't know i just this is the thing it's like he's already assumed that
everybody's using the definitions that he uses because i told you i already understand uh people
there's some people out there who think objective means everybody feels that way we do see that
quite a bit and that's something a lot of people have said just right said it's like one person
disagrees it can't be objective and that's that thing isn't nothing objective at that point
because there's no there's always going to be one guy who thinks the earth is a bread velvet cake
or that the world wasn't birthed by the cosmic chicken like there are people out there who
don't believe in that it's a travesty but they'll learn they'll learn in the end
hmm and when it comes to settling on whether or not good and bad can even be objective
one way to bridge the gap of a non-believer is to ask if one thing can be objectively
more good or more bad than another thing if there are degrees to good and bad
anyway kicking on here if we can get some arguments add our subjective terms objectivity
is the opposite of subjectivity no that's not true the opposite the opposite of objectivity
is not objectivity and the opposite of subjectivity is not subjectivity so i mean is he trying to
argue that they like fill two halves of a whole that's probably what he's trying to get at but
that's not actually if he's going to be anal then well we've had i've had a lot i've had a lot of
practice okay so activity is the opposite of subjectivity to use the term objectively in
relation to the word good or bad shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what the word means
so by saying what the word means implies to me that he thinks that there's only one way to use
any word pretty much which is this word the word means this there's no other way the word is used
which yeah he's wrong and if i was to he introduce someone to the idea that a word can mean more than
one thing the word i would use first is good or bad there would be the ones i'd choose i'd be
like yeah these ones they're some of the worst for this shit they can mean a lot of things like
what were the other ones we went over two of them we got um skilled at doing or dealing with
no wait possessing or displaying moral virtue yeah we haven't even gone over the fact that
there's a moral element to it um i guess that comes into the whole deserved thing giving pleasure
enjoyable or satisfying about the about the herpes question i was on for that one okay i
was just i was making sure who had and hadn't because i just trying to keep my brain straight
here what was your answer to that theo uh it's probably expected i don't know if they deserve
it see theosis perhaps he said i don't know if they deserve it rags he's in the middle
the bled the blessed middle he's in the place to be blessed the blessed middle he's an enlightened
centrist i'm going in the middle uh yeah so another definition is valid which takes you into
a whole other fucking and then seven is used in conjunction with the name of god or a related
expression as an exclamation of extreme surprise or anger such as good heavens yeah good golly gosh
batman and so if someone said good heavens that he goes you've used that word wrong there is no so
you can't have something that is a good heaven also that you've been like okay thank you in my
opinion heaven is good yeah i don't know i feel like this is already just having a good time
also yeah just whoever made this video if you have a catch wind that we've covered it you're
welcome to come on and talk about these points because i don't know i feel like he would fold
on this immediately he'd be like yeah okay there are more than one ways to use it i wonder if he'd
say like only and you can't use it more than one way in film criticism or something yeah
you don't get to just say that x and y terms are subjective or are objective are something
because that's not that's not quite how language works especially words like good and bad
because of the huge variety of uses they have meaning yeah i don't even do they just have shared
understandings pretty much because words evolve completely look at look at uh look at massive
okay we are so large word good or bad shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what the word
means further the use of this term kills any discussion about the subject because it simplifies
the subject by making it an undebatable truth thus killing no the opposite so we have so we've had
so many discussions prompted around just the idea of objectivity as a concept in criticism
i think this is like the discussion i don't it's it's almost you could just discuss this for ages
i don't know if anyone who's making an objective claim with regards to a film is saying this is
absolutely the case rather they're saying as the facts arrayed before me are presented
this appears to be the case um x film is bad because uh because of x y and z that has appeared
from the film if anything objectivity as we see it in media allows us to formulate those discussions
and leads us to believe that we can come up with a what we believe to be the the correct um answer
on something yeah i mean there's object we we use objectivity as essentially the basis of
the scientific method as we understand it and lord knows there will be never ending discussion
as that topic's explored what you think we're gonna figure science out well i was gonna say
there is to this day discussion on whether or not the earth is flat i don't think it killed
discussion unfortunately so cosmic chickens don't lay flags a lot of people that's true
it's i i've asked chat a few times but everyone's keeps saying rewind and i was asking why i can't
seem to find apparently rags objectively misheard something what did i miss here i don't know i don't
know either also yeah as as as justin's just highlighted the fact that i've been trying to
use objectivity in videos has caused massive amounts of discussion oh yes that it um all right
well we'll go back no more like a good half a minute to make sure we've not missed whatever
people are thinking about it's also the most obvious because it's popular use in the phrases
objectively good and objectively bad is the most evident in its contradiction good and bad
are subjective terms objectivity is the opposite of subjectivity to use the term objectively in
relation to the word good or bad shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what the word means further the
use of this term kills any discussion did he ever actually explain how it's a contradiction
because uh the words are inherently subjective and you're trying to it's like i guess he thinks
it's like you're saying that is objectively subjective even though you could say that actually
let's just say it yeah he's because he said the the use of the phrase is objectively good and
objectively bad objectively bad are inherently contradictory and i'm like can you tell us how
yeah that claim its substantiation rags so he uh yeah apparently he said objectivity
he didn't say objectivity is the opposite of objectivity he said objectivity is the opposite
of subjectivity i thought you knew that i thought rags that doesn't actually change the rags his
response was that um the opposite of objectivity would be not objectivity right that's what you said
yeah yeah i mean if you even if you swapped them around it would be the exact same thing
yeah so yeah rags wasn't rags didn't miss here that that was it would be the same response either way
but hey look i do try and i do kind of try and keep track of chat in case we do um
make a mistake of some kind it's all good um you know who can't track chat wolf we can't if he's
not even here it was a fundamental misunderstanding of what the word means further the use of this term
kills any discussion about the subject because it simplifies the subject by making it an undebatable
killing any elaboration on what is actually meant with the use of this term so the implication being
that once i tell you that holdo uh was wrong not to tell her the plan it kills discussion on the
idea that she may or may not have been wrong to tell her the plan yeah we've never had any
discussions uh around the last jedi especially also i don't think that it's a bad thing to reach a
conclusion um yeah so it was like it's a cop before the horse almost for example is it contrived
the star lord punches thanos in infinity war and it's a discussion that goes on for a while and a
thanks to endgame i think we've concluded that it's a yes now because dr strange would have
seen it coming and he chose not to do anything about it when if he had it may have stopped
everything like if he just ported star lord out and the fact that iron man saw it coming and he
could have probably blasted him away and he did nothing the fact that the gauntlet doesn't come
off for ages even though thanos is asleep it's like what's put some butter in there guys come on
get it out butter him up and yeah you talk about it for a while and a lot of people who uh probably
included myself who comes straight off the movie are like no no no no it makes sense because then
you support with all of the star lord's history but it doesn't when you get to the wider context
and you're able to separate yourself you can reach a conclusion and then it's not like there's
an ongoing discussion about whether or not the room is a masterpiece of filmmaking
for like writing and direction and audio editing and stuff it's like no it's pretty much been
concluded however if you would like to make an argument and have a discussion that would be great
and that's what happens on youtube super fun you get those videos that are like turns out spider
man 3 from the rainy films is actually good you'll find a video like that and you're like okay
give it to me what do we got yeah let's hear it
it's like the discussion happens then the consensus is is reached and that's what's
considered quote unquote objective until i suppose a better argument comes along and changes the
consensus a consensus doesn't necessarily start from one person just going hey this is my this
is what i saw from the film and i think this is a problem therefore it is and the conversation
stops there no it's hashed out until the conclusion is reached and if someone says uh for
example vitamin homecoming is a terrible movie we don't have to accept that we can be like all
right give us your arguments we'll we'll argue against it because and there's not a limit on how
many discussions you can have about a particular topic you can just keep having discussions until
the cows come home literally and the idea that someone uses object like you know so we conclude
that this is objectively poorly written and he's sitting there watching the video like whoa well
now i can't say anything back it's like no you can they might have fucked something up you can be
objectively wrong uh because you got a faulty piece of information i don't know objectively
is basically the n-word of criticism so who do we get the past on all discussion who do we get the
pass from um me oh you have the objective pass i am um i mean if you that's how you
want how far back you want to go but i am uh i'm some part inward i'm sure
that's hello all my inwards that's us wolf gave us the pass a long time ago and he gave us a lot
of the passes massive pass was he made a pass at me he did yeah
yeah let's let's let's keep going i guess see what else he's got thus killing any elaboration
on what is actually meant with the use of this term by saying something is objectively anything
it robs that subject of its true meaning oh tell me what sorry but what does true mean holy shit true
meaning not one of them they're false meanings how is how is uh how can i not just reflect the
same criticism on him i'd be like true meaning does anything have a true meaning yeah what do you
mean you mean objectively the true meaning or just what you feel is i'm not even sure i agree
that anything has true meaning what does that mean what does that sentence mean robbing it's
weird fakie it's a whole lot of buzzwords i can tell you that much i was gonna say this is kind
of an erotic video but uh what so what do you think is saying something is objectively anything
robs it of its true meaning yeah that's that's something to just stare at for a while i'm trying
to oh how what if you're right though is what if you're right about your assessment of its meaning
then it doesn't rob it of its true meaning it just means you've described its true meaning
if he believes that because he he says things by saying that he robs by him saying that the true
meaning has been robbed it implies there is a true meaning to be robbed hmm i'd love just for
him to develop that because it sounds like he's just a hypocrite right now i don't know
is no it looks no no it robs that subject of its true meaning water for example is not
objectively good for us water is essential to what it depends what standard you use it
yeah it depends on what you mean by good if you mean it is good to survive then yeah it's got
nutritional value i suppose you know you could easily have a scientific but then you could be
like water is objectively bad for us in massive quantities where we're stuck in it if you don't
know me like you can drown us water is objectively good in moderation yeah if the if the end point
like if our goal here which is an inch which is generally a good thing to have in these discussions
is what is what are you trying to accomplish what's the end goal we we we human beings
objectively want to survive like i don't even what do you mean generally they do yeah some are
sewers some are suicidal right right well yeah i was just gonna say like is there can you can't
like whatever the compound is at the base level like humanity humans need it to to go on right
we die of dehydration before starvation because water is more important fundamentally quicker yeah
i don't i mean it's it's an oddly formed thing here that he would say i mean that's
you want to frame all right if the goal is x and water has these properties and we know this about
humans then you can say barring freaks of nature right and flukes of evolution and such
then we can conclude this about water's effect on human bodies that helps us to reach that goal
that we've determined i think he's trying to use a different definition of objectivity he's just
not elaborating on really well because objectivity is used in philosophy and other places
is essentially independent of human thought uh ideas or perception of the matter like the thing
as it is kind of essentially and there's a whole argument around objective value in that case like
that kind of objective value that's where again one of the big problems arises in that how does
a thing get value without people to ascribe that value to where is the value located within that
thing kind of deal if that makes any sense yeah sort of i think i think i know what you're trying
to get to i think i'm i think i'm picking up what you're laying down the idea that uh like
for something to be valuable it requires like a physical requires sort of like yeah things around
it to communicate that value with one another almost yeah point to me point to me where on the
human body the value is yeah exactly it's valuable because of it's valuable intersubjectively rather
than objectively or subjectively necessarily like with our input or not water will uh subsist a
human being like it's not that's not debatable yeah water can be in the case but then it can
also drown a human to facilitate survival in a human being these things are all true so it's
like so is it objectively good it's like well it depends on what you mean by good and if you mean
it satisfies a standard then you have to tell us what standard and if that standard is to prolong
existence for human in moderation then absolutely it is objectively good and if you want to just
look at water itself and say is water good or what is good water is like well that's another thing
water you know hydrogen and oxygen molecules in this arrangement so if it is arranged like that
that is good water and if it isn't like oil oil is bad water and yeah so this is the point his
statement could be correct it depends on what the context is what is he actually saying unless
in these videos it's part of why my videos are so long it's like it all reaches one statement at
the end like right at the end i'm like so this is a piss poor piece of writing thanks for watching
this past two hours why is piss objectively poor though piss poor it refers to um
it's refers to the objective true meaning of writing okay this objective yes what is the
true meaning of uh substance that uh yeah we're gonna go into this you know there's some water
and piss so it's objectively good for humans the water and piss is good water this keeps
shitty company i get it our survival with water we tend to conflate our survival with the concept
we understand is good and we further conflate that with a truth that is self-evident and therefore
objective similarly interesting sentence yeah i need to hear that one again is not objectively
good for us water is essential to our survival with water we tend to conflate our survival with
we conflate our survival with an objective good it's like um you can do that it's the whole point
of the word my once we once we all i mean once everybody in the discussion if you don't want to
set up an objective standard to work towards then i mean that's on you man
i guess is existence inherently good or bad probably not it isn't i wouldn't say i think
it's completely outside of good or bad because existence is just a state of something i think i
think you've stuck all the way back a objective can only be a statement of what is it can't be a
statement of what's good or bad or what's high or low or what's nothing anything further than that
would be relative to something else and so it's invalid i'm i'm stuck right now because he seems
to have shot himself in the foot because he said water is not objectively good for us
like again i think you can quite happily say objectively it is factual that if it water
enables our survival then that would follow that it's good for us question mark it's good
in a utilitarian survival equals good like yeah i don't know i guess that comes down to
it sure it depends on how inherent to the universe you want to define it it's like i i'm perfectly
happy going along with the idea that existence is neither good or bad it's just a state of
something's reality or not right if you'd said water is object water isn't objectively good
that's something i can get behind but you said water isn't objectively good for us
i was like well but it is this is an implication of standard notice to be like so what do you mean
when you say that and once he explains it i can be like oh right yeah so what you were saying was
true which is this happens all the time like this is why you always develop statements and stuff
by saying something is objectively anything it robs that subject of its true meaning water for
example is not objectively good for us water is essential to our survival with water we tend to
conflate our survival with the concept we understand is good and we further conflate that with the
truth that is self-determined so what is good to him what is good well yeah i was about to say
when you say good for survival which def which of the 10 definitions of good are we going for here
okay because at this point does he is he referring to the moral element
good i mean existence i would say is a moral it's just yeah that's because that's the thing
he would actually be right it wouldn't be a moral good that we exist yeah but is that what he's
saying i don't know this is the problem with good and bad you have to be a little bit more specific
sometimes i have no idea where he's going in these past 10 15 seconds i don't i don't know
what he's trying to say anymore i had like vague ideas but it's gone now just again buzzwords i
that's his point theo we further conflate that with a truth that is self-evident
and therefore objective similarly some critics tend to conflate well-written examples of character
development or foreshadowing as good and turn it into a standard when it was them who decided
these examples were well written to begin with and also them who decided to work a fiction by
we do not decide the truth the truth exists and our acknowledgement of that truth is irrelevant
to it being a truth by labeling a work of fiction as objectively good or bad you're saying that what
you're describing as good or bad is a matter of fact despite you basing this off your interpretation
and your standards for what makes a work good yeah we we acknowledge we base this in this or
is that we explore this critique essentially in the same way that we do science yeah we
cross-reference it with other people what he just said is we try independent verification that's how
we do everything what he just he just criticized how literally humans have approached analysis
of anything yeah we set parameters i guess by the definition of objective he seems to be going with
then sure uh and media analysis at that point would be normative or intersubjective rather than
objective necessarily i guess i mean if we go if we go with objectivity as he's using it in this
context yeah well because this is the thing it's like why is it that um rays that weapon that was
going to kill ray disappearing is an objective bad and my argument always stem from the idea of
progression of story is completely interrupted so by the standard of the very piece of work you're
trying to create you've damaged it in the same way that a pile of fucking bricks is a bad house and
if someone was like that's not necessarily a bad house like by the standard of what a fucking house
is it is and it's like oh that's just subjective it's like yeah but that's what we're talking about
that's specifically what we're talking about in this instance and it's like what if someone wanted
to create a story that was bad it's like that's fine they can it's still what it is and you know
it's the word bad that gets stuck in everybody's teeth i guess you get upset by it because i think
it's just too closely associated with a an emotional reaction and so they immediately
when you say that they immediately think like why are you telling me my emotional reaction that's
not what it was like oh that's not actually what what i was doing but you know that's how people
feel but i don't know pile of bricks is with shady lattice to live yeah very true for a fact
despite you basing this off your interpretation and your standards for what makes work good my
real issue with this is how people just leave something at objectively bad never mind the
misuse of objectively there's often no elaboration on what is objectively bad about the work which
why can you say that we're objectively misusing it that's what it gets super complicated if
everything's subjective that what if it's my subjective take that i'm being objective it's
like oh jesus at what point do you say you know what we're just being so loose with this word
what's the fucking point i'll throw my bone here i have seen this people just calling a thing
oh definitely bad and leaving yeah but then then it goes the other way too
but that's the the interesting part is when you explore the actual because like for example um
uh we on efap and shadow visti agree that tlj is objectively poorly written but we'll actually
reach different fundamentals for why we'll have different sort of like base standards of storytelling
they usually uh are akin to storytelling or relevant storytelling but they're uh slightly
different and um the idea of like logical consistency is absolutely something that
shad takes seriously but he also has a couple of other additional ideas about how characters are
meant to be written or what makes strong characters that i don't necessarily agree with i think they're
good guidelines sort of thing so that's the really interesting part but the idea that nobody ever like
explains themselves whatever some people out there i mean we will do it yeah i do want to
raise something really quickly off the back of that just a question to i guess pick your
brain a little bit if you all have different fundamental standards is that still objective
um i mean i guess once you agree on the standards
then it's not really our opinion whether or not it holds to that standard and there's two different
things being objective to a standard and then having an objective standard in the first place
like what is a standard that is objective and to me i think progression is inherently tied to
the definition of what a story is so it's like intrinsically tied to it you can't it's not a
standard that was brought in from my personal preference like all characters should have long
hair like what's that got to do with storytelling so it's not really connected yeah you could set
that as the standard yeah and you could be objective too long like we are going to set
the standard for this discussion that long hair is good and long hair is measured by it being
this long let me give a measurement you know 10 inches five inches whatever you want to set it at
and then boom we could now talk about this in a purely objective way hmm i've talked about that
before like uh someone says a film's only good if there's more than 10 people in it and then
they watch a film that has nine and they go well that film was bad and they're actually being
objective in that case to a standard that they need to let people know about this the idea that
you go was a subjective take because you just didn't like it yourself it's like no actually
funnily enough you explore what they're saying they've remained objective to a rule set but
then you can talk about how valuable the rule set is and i think logical progression really a
description it's not necessarily a quality assessment because something could be
objective but kind of awful i mean quality usually adheres to the degree to which a standard's
achieved right so the standard in which progression is most coherent would actually have a limit like
if everything in a storyline follows then it is as coherent as it can be therefore the maximum
standard of objective progression and if it was half and half or if it was zero you've
almost you've generated a scale there that's uh technically a quality scale even though it's
based entirely on what are essentially ones and zeros right isn't that in in like referred to
qualia versus something else in um like basic philosophy i remember glib talking to me about it
because this is this is not something that we've come up with by any stretch of the imagination
this has been around for a long time uh that's not one i've heard or read about i'm afraid it
gets very interesting when you start to poke really really far but no oh yeah not all people
do some people just say blah blah blah blah objectively bad moving on it's like hey hey
wait wait wait yeah and yeah and the unfortunate thing is the author of all of those statements
may not know they need to explain themselves sometimes like we say a lot on efap we're like
hey what does that mean but you know you do have to give them a bit of room to assume themselves
like oh shit i guess people don't see it the way i do fuck uh yeah so what i mean by that and
that's the thing my videos can always be longer every word i use i could be like oh i could
explain that one like i'm not going to go on a nitpick rant ever again hopefully it was in my
tfa part one and i'm never going to do it again but maybe i will depending on more and more people
talking about it we shall see to our second term oh god good and bad writing are terms less offensive
than objectively as the people using them don't think their opinion is fact but um what would be
the point in saying good slash bad writing instead of saying i don't like this writing or i like this
writing you by starting off with the examples that he did he's almost kind of poisoned the
rest of the entire video because he can't be objective about any of this i need to stop how
is this like significantly different from yeah because i've already assumed i've jumped the gun
on this i assume he's going to be saying that when they say that they mean the primary definition
of good meaning they were satisfied by it therefore this is what bothers me about videos
when they say this is good writing i'm like when you say that do you mean this is writing you enjoy
and then they go well what else could i possibly mean and i'm like oh right yeah because they
think there's no other definition so i'm just saying like why don't you say that and it's like
because it doesn't sound as good if you just end every sentence with and i like this it's like meh
but if you say this is actually well written oh um but yeah i think that's what he's going to
be running with and that's why he doesn't find it egregious i guess writing are terms less offensive
than objectively as the people using them also again have you noticed how this just clips
yeah they're just they're just in one thing in the beginning like this needs to be viewed in
this and i'm like why do you even need to see what's on screen yeah one little neat editing
thing was when he said the words good and bad uh when he said good batman was on screen when he
said bad bane was on screen but other than that hmm that was like whatever they all right that's
not even objectively true anyway so it was another point right maybe he was just referencing what
people typically say don't think their opinion is fact but they have the same effect on a discussion
because they generalize and quantify matters that should be discussed or at the very least examined
before judgment is made if i argue for a certain plot point and someone just tells me to stop
defending bad writing they haven't made an argument counterpoints are an argument does anyone ever
use the phrase stop defending bad writing as the entire crux that sounds like the end of the
argument who is this video directed at yeah who are these people modern critiquers modern critics i
guess because we all say stop defending bad writing but yeah that's at the end of a long
four hour even yeah i was gonna say that's after the consensus has been reached i would end up
saying it if i was pretty much at the point of being like giving up you know i'd be like oh my
god stop defending bad writing i wouldn't start with that because i agree with him that's not
an argument it's just a conclusion statement hopefully you have an argument supporting it
they haven't made an argument counterpoints are an argument condensing elements that you
believe to be bad or good without being able to explain why doesn't help prove your point
unfortunately if you put most people on the spot they wouldn't be able to tell you what good writing
is or how you achieve it i thought you just said that doesn't exist anyway anything though yeah
first off it doesn't matter whether on the spot people could tell you that that's actually
not an argument sorry bud so good but why would he care because they'd be wrong either way according
to his previous section yeah if good and bad are inherently subjective terms then that sentence is
it falls into the same trappings as the previous section on objectivity why is this a different
section for one what good writing is differs from person to person that's why we set a standard we
can all agree on right so it's always the point of this section that this is the subjective angle
but they don't explain themselves is that his criticism the first one is you can't be objective
this one is you can be subjective but you have to explain yourself you can't just say it
is that a simplified vision i think so anyway that'll be my best faith analysis of this how
you achieve it for one what good writing is differs from person to person but more importantly
it's far easier to point out the bad things in entertainment than it is to explain the good things
why i would i would agree that's true um i i think that i mean i i think i i imagine the three of us
would probably agree i'm not sure i do it's because theoretically it shouldn't necessarily
be that way with how we've broken things down why why would it be easier to break things down
in a negative way than a positive way well no i don't think that's necessarily like the the whole
idea of what he's saying i think that people do kind of even if they don't even if they're not
conscious of it immediately or even if they can't put it into words people sort of know or at least
feel negative things um you know it's like you know when something bad happens you pick it up
the whole you might not have noticed it but your brain did thing about bad stuff it just stands out
more like we know something's wrong or we feel something's wrong even if we can't kind of explain
it i uh i don't want to put words in your house but i think you guys would agree with me when i
said you tend to judge like elements and aspects of media as sort of functional sense like in terms
of the role that is playing within the work and how adequately it performs that role yeah
functional yeah would be a good way to yeah yeah so past that point i'd probably say it's a lot
easier to tell when something is broken or not performing that function like it is non-functional
than it is to tell when something is three good functional or four it's harder to quantify
positively than negatively you've still haven't seen a file from home yet right rex uh i haven't
but let's like let's use a fork as an example like if you if you put a fork you show someone
a fork right and you show someone just a fork that's just in in dust right and you show the
two of them say which which one of these is i don't i don't know i get it's it's hard trying to
find a way to really phrase the concept in my head um i think people recognize things are bad
more clearly than they recognize things being good i mean i would tacitly agree i just uh
on a fundamental level if we identify what's bad by being two degree inconsistent then surely good
is just identified by being consistent which is pretty simple to spot as well as the opposite
but yeah i mean i i think i probably just agree that we typically see
that people are much find it much simpler to point out flaws than uh phrase worthy elements
i guess i think what's the word you'd use in opposition to floor what's the antonym of floor
what's uh flaw um
that's interesting uh the opposite of the law well in the colloquial sense opposite um i would say
yeah see what chat says hey yeah um merit virtue yeah yeah i'm with i'm with merit yeah
i'm with merit more than virtue um virtue has moral implications yeah like deserve yeah
yeah big a pro law and pro benefit a strength or something uh
because uh we're defining good relative to a standard as the degree to which a standard
is met right i said so i guess my point would be the degree the degree to which a standard is met
it's a lot harder to measure like i suppose excelling at that standard or exceeding the
standard than it is to see something non-functional or below the standard and how many degrees below
standard it is the severity of the like issue um someone in chat said as well that sometimes it
seems to be that the the good is almost the lack of bad and so when you're watching something
that's coherent you'll be like on the prowl for any deviation of that like we consider good the
default almost yeah and that's maybe why we're not wired as much to then engage in why something is
good because you'll find with a lot of critics and again this isn't this is something i've always
been working on as well but if you go say for example oh i just came out of fucking homecoming
it's terrible all these reasons you name all these things then you watch far from home you're like
oh that was amazing you go why oh i just i really liked it yeah but why i i don't know i had a lot
of fun with it and you're like yeah but when you said the other one was bad you named all these
like mechanical things what's what's good about this one mechanically and you're like i don't know
everything worked like a lot of people do have trouble with it but you know i uh i actually do
think that there is like an equal and opposite so every time we highlight any kind of flaw in
writing there will be the reverse of it like luke being out of character what is the good vision of
that it's like well him being in character but we don't necessarily praise that because it's
supposed to be default you're not supposed to be deviating from him being in character because
that's like what the fuck i guess yeah that's my point because then i ideally in this case we
would want something above that for uh for a scale we have insufficient sufficient more
of insufficient is it praiseworthy not to fuck up it's like yeah you know and then how do we
quantifying those positive elements in a praiseworthy manner there you go i think we've
cracked and now agree with what he said pretty much i'll have i got a there's a friend of mine
here uh runs the youtube channel steve mccray he's really big into philosophy that's his
bread and butter essentially so we need to get him on one of these days to
talk about the nature of objectivity is he free right now um i don't know um
but with uh i think we'll be good for now but we should probably like we should probably pick a
video specific to him being a guest oh i mean because this is probably the only video a week
ever covered a video wisecracked did technically what they call philosophy right in the last dfap
a philosophy of the middle but we'll definitely do a philosophy with just right soon enough it's
gonna be great thing is differs from person to person but more importantly it's far easier to
point out the bad things in entertainment than it is to explain the good things to help with this
i'd like to quickly i will i would say pointing out and explaining aren't dichotomous so and i don't
necessarily find it that way for myself but i guess it's probably because i've been trying to work on
that i like to want to start uh figuring out if if there's a bad then what is the equal and opposite
and how do we start uh talking about them as well i need to do more praise videos i understand that
i've only done literally the one other than seeing positive things in the long-form videos but
i want to do more positive ones as well i just i'm still pissed about game of thrones so
to help with this i'd like to quickly explain what good writing is to me
as it's important for the next term we'll talk about to me a story any story at its core is about
us our perception of fictional characters is based entirely from what we understand of our own
species a wealthy of humans within its constructed world and convince us that the events the
characters are going through no matter the story's concept are actually happening to them and that
the decisions these characters make are consistent with our own rationalization patterns
what do you mean they're consistent with our rationalization patterns
they're them not us there's you're referring to us in it like does he mean the yeah does he mean
the as long as they behave in a way that we can understand would be a human way you're only judging
this from the perspective of how a human would act and behave like hell yeah i am you can have
stories that create a whole new being like a vulcan you know like they well even though we can
still objectively analyze the thing that they're doing we just say all right this is how they
behave and this is what their goals are and motivations are i'm saying that we can't we
don't empathize with the falcons necessarily uh because of what we know about us is oftentimes
it'll be we understand how they work who they are what they do and then when they make decisions
we'll be judging it entirely from what we know about them we'll be like Vulcans are blah blah blah
created the concept of Vulcans anyway so yeah clearly they can be understood with the human
mind in a way so i i don't this is silly point i was gonna say if that's all it is then yeah i
don't necessarily disagree with the idea that we judge everything based on how we understand
everything's like yeah fair enough are actually happening to them and that the decisions these
characters make are consistent with our own rationalization patterns bad stories are the
ones where the characters stop resembling people and you begin to see the strings on their bodies
as the author or writer marionette them through the world with no one maybe depends on what we're
analyzing here yeah i was just saying what about a character that's built that way like a robot or
controlled can still behave in objective ways or have objectively analyzable traits
that was really limiting on what a story can be and i think that if you were here you'd be like
no of course i'm referring to characters that aren't robots that that in context have robotic
decisions that don't make sense toward their own values or something like that and i'd be like well
okay i doubt he would say that you know a robotic character is bad because they're robotic you know
what about human characters like explicitly human characters are made to explore a concept rather
than to be as close to being a human or like as humanoid and normal as possible like they're made
like they're made in exaggerated abstracted ways to try and explore an idea like and surely this
guy hasn't forgotten that characters aren't human anyway well sure but you refer like have
you got an example of that theo just so i know you're talking about like are you saying like a
character that represents more of an idea rather than a person i suppose yeah um i'm trying to
think of a good example so like a character will the female kid the female in uh Chernobyl um uh
i forget the name it's a weird Russian name but she was an amalgamation of people in the real
world she wasn't actually a character in that sense sure but she's still seeing she was still
pretty consistent in in who she was right she like i believe so yeah um i was i was thinking
more like you know like full male alchemist you have like uh envy is a character but it's more of
a representation of an idea yeah um but again i if so if he was to say envy uh is unrealistic
because nobody's that envious i'd be like well that's the idea it's that it's envy in the purest
form i don't know yeah but we did say envy just has to be that envious that's the only person who
has to be that envious is that character yeah again you know what's funny about this is this
whole video is just too short for me i feel like i'd love to delve into every one of these topics
with this guy assuming he's um you know not willing to shut it down after every statement or anything
author or writer marionette them through the world with no attempt to mirror reality there's
a very jarring feeling when a story starts doing this and one of the complaints that manifests
itself because of this plot armor um i guess you can have that manifest through a character
i don't know not necessarily their behavior it's usually how they an action either survival don't
survive arbitrarily it's it's it's if anything it's a lack of an event happening the lack of
an event being that characters demise i don't i'm being completely honest here i don't know many
people who misuse plot armor most people seem to know what it is yeah and plot armor is i mean just
like real armor it's not all the same so there are some things where someone could like
explosions are great because they generally have a randomness to them which means some people can
seemingly miraculously survive explosions and other people can tragically die when you wouldn't
expect it so when an explosion happens on screen and a character doesn't die from it oh that's not
quite as plot armor e as someone say being crushed by a extremely large ridiculous object
and surviving as a result not all plot armor is the same essentially because of this is
what no one tells you about plot armor is that every character has it fictional stories are not
okay does that need to be told to you okay depending on what you mean by it though like
technically me and rags have plot armor in the we are human beings that have basic defenses and an
immune system um we have armor against certain things from happening but like
armor usually refers to like armor that they shouldn't have or generally only only surviving
because the plot wants them to survive quote unquote someone gets hit on the head and then
the next scene is like they died from that you're like what they would just hit on the head with
like a fucking shoe like why did they die it's like a lack of plot armor almost or anti-plot
i guess you could try and overextend it and say say that like any given narrative has a requirement
that certain characters make it to a certain point such that the narrative is able to proceed
and thus like they have to survive to that point thus they apply even if it never i would agree
but even then it's i think people have like a tolerance for plot armor levels
you're like people don't complain about like Frodo and Sam surviving often but they'll really
complain about uh Jon Snow surviving massive arrow bodies and cavalry charges and you're like
what a lucky guy you know congrats you beat cats so you must have great plot armor and excessive
luck can sometimes probably be interchangeable as well i think i think it's a category yeah
egregiousness yeah yeah exactly people can only tolerate so much because people ultimately
understand they are watching a story so people have a tolerance for what they will ultimately see
and what eventually happens yeah like in stories like if a character gets shot in the gut we all
immediately understand right clock's ticking they have to get to a hospital now otherwise
give it like um yeah handful of hours we'll see them go pale handful of hours more and then
they're just not moving not talking like oh they're probably dead but if they get like shot again and
then again and then a week later they go to the hospital we're just like this fucking shit sucks
and if someone's like why does that suck why can't that just be the story it's like well because
the stakes how could i care about anything that's happening if there's no rules hey what
this is a slightly tangentially related question sorry not on efap uh would it be plot armor if
a character survives something like incredulous and then they're just completely plot irrelevant
um like they do nothing for the entire rest of the film but they they survive something
they absolutely shouldn't have is that plot armor um i guess the question then is is plot
armor directly related to their effect on the plot yeah is it contingent on their importance
on the plot mate um i don't know it's interesting i don't know if it's i don't know if i'd say that
that's necessarily how i use it i usually just use it to mean that it helped them survive something
that should have killed them yeah i use it with reference to like their importance in the plot
like oh that doesn't make more sense it does make more sense i would say it was a plot itself that
gave them their survival so whether they're important to the plot or not it was the plot
that determined they survived and arguably their plot goes on whether or not it's relevant to this
story okay so it's it's arguable but i like the question yeah that's interesting um and again
both of those would still come down and under luck you just be like oh you just say nah it's
just inconsistent they were shot in the head they didn't die fuck off hmm tellings of real world
events where luck and randomness are indiscriminate because stories are constructed narratives they
can only simulate the factors of luck and randomness and it's the degree to which they do it that we
can calculate their believability as a reflection of real world examples it's not just luck though
we're talking about like if you have a character that gets their head chopped off it's not lucky
that they survive it it would just be a direct contradiction you'd be like you can't survive that
like but they did okay okay you do not then say they're lucky that's not a thing you say
it's not lucky when a person survives something with as about as close to 100 fatality right
as you can get and then yeah fine in the next scene like they literally separated by the atom
ultimately plot armor does rely to some degree on individuals ability to believe something that
happens on screen but i think there's enough i think there's enough people out there when you
talk about plot armor with people they're like oh yeah absolutely plus the example you gave an
explosion everybody react like a hundred people see a guy with an explosion of dynamite two meters
away from him and then he falls over and gets back up straight away half the audience is okay
without the other half like what he he's just straight up dead maybe all the audience are okay
with that but someone like wow that was okay yeah yeah we can talk about the concepts of plot armor
without all necessarily having to agree that it is plot armor or not and then we even the fact
that we're discussing that it whether or not it is plot armor means we all are trying to come to
a conclusion does it meet the requirements for this thing this thing is a thing we have all
agreed exists even as a concept yeah and we usually we talk about feasibility to stop it from
turning into a plot hole and turning into just a convenience slash inconvenience when it comes to
plot armor like being disintegrated or being shot in the chest and get into the hospital in a couple
of hours it's like i think that could work and then you google it you're like how long can someone
survive a gut shot then it's you know it says however long and you go okay i guess i can believe
the character did that then that's fine just my understanding of how gut shots work but the
literal chopping off someone's head and they survive just like no sorry you have to have
an in-universe rule for that like this character species their heart is located in their fucking
head or something and you're like oh world events where luck and randomness are indiscriminate
because stories are constructed narratives they can only simulate the factors of luck and
randomness and it's the degree to which they do it that we can calculate their i wouldn't say
simulate it i say they determine it
simulate luck and randomness does he mean that it's all preconceived by a writer therefore
none of it's actually luck or randomness it's just simulated i wouldn't i don't think simulate i
don't think simulation is a good way to describe it really oh shit someone's just a super chat no
plot armor and sakario too i don't actually want to say it until you've seen the first
rag sakaro too is a fucking disaster and i hate it it's an insult i've heard that sakario too is
not nearly as good as the first one i hate it but i've heard almost universal praise for sakario
one but i can say without spoiling anything a character is literally shot in the head and then
they're left for dead and then a day later they get back up and they continue living and it turns
out they had this big cover on their head and they were shot through both of their cheeks
um that's yeah that's possible it's possible this is the thing it's not an actual contradiction
it's wow okay it's part of the thing where if it it's not unheard of i can believe someone getting
shot through the cheeks absolutely i've seen pictures of it but oh man why would you aim for
the cheeks if you kill someone those are some bad odds i mean you can have your jaw blown off and
survive um this is what i mean it's like oh my god you're so lucky the bullet went through one
cheek out the other and i don't even think it hit his teeth oh that movie anyway it's a complete
it's a it's a middle finger to the audience like that's what i would argue i'd be like yeah that's
just a fuck you it's just like look the character you care about is now dead it's like lol no he's
not you're like what why did okay fine here's that guy just fucking hated his cheeks and it's
the degree to which they do it that we can calculate their believability as a reflection
of real world examples as long as an author has a story to tell well a reflection of real world
examples if you're going to say reflection of real world examples it should probably if you're
trying to reflect something maybe a real world singular example also because the real world is
just a shit ton of general trends yeah and funnily enough you would tend to go for the
general ones if you want audiences to be convinced they need ones that people people typically
understand like i said about the gut shot one does anyone know how long it takes for someone
to die from a gut shot because i don't actually know it yeah depends where they were shot what
they were shot with it depends how quickly they get first aid it depends how quickly they get to
a hospital there's a gajillion billion million variables to something like that and then if
you have but this is the other thing it's not even necessarily that though because if say they
were shot by um you know a quantum phase ray i'd be like okay so what is that you go oh we'll go to
episode three they explain that quantum phase ray fires blah blah and it does blah blah and i'll be
like oh okay so actually you need you need the additional shit otherwise i can't follow the
stakes i need to know what this stuff does um like a lot of shows and tv will have tranquilizers
as the instant action and work on humans and it's like oh that's how they're wearing it it's not
logically impossible but that's not how they generally work in the real world but we can
buy it i'll just go okay i guess they have that kind of thing in this world sure yeah whatever
i mean we do it with time travel all the time we're like i'll buy it as an author has a story
to tell the characters in that story will always need some sort of protection from the story's
choices to imitate real world hazards stories are contrived in their very nature because you
have to take characters from one point in time to another depends on how you write your story
you um you can literally because i'm pretty sure joe dremont has talked about this he does
have a couple of endpoints he wants but uh it's the whole garden thing i think someone said garden
versus something else oh there you go yeah i would absolutely prefer an architect approach
but i appreciate a gardener approach the idea that you're like you set your characters you set
your world and then you let them go and you write as they would do what they would do and then
things will happen because that's what happens in real life all life is is a fucking bunch of
motivated people with a world that has rules and then things happen and you can you can you know
have a tsunami here and there you put like ultimately we're gonna die every five chapters
to see if a natural disaster hits and then if you're like well how do you know the story will
be interesting it's like well in a world where you've got seven kingdoms fighting over a chair
uh some interesting things are bound to happen
problem with that approach is you get what george r r martin has right now which is uh
the work spiraling out of his control yes more and more elements get introduced
the mirror needs not as well right that's the famous one yeah that's the one
one point in time to another both points of your own creation as a writer while we as people are
affected by factors outside of our own control all the time stories are a nullification of these
factors because characters can only go through what the story wants them to these not necessarily
it's kind of a weird way to put it they go through what the story wants them to
because uh you can have characters that essentially dictate their um their journeys
via what they want or where they want to go like i said again the gardener approach kind of
how does that depends on what you i mean it's a quote unquote rule that you generally want a fairly
active protagonist as an author seeks out and does things towards whatever goal it is they have
and if someone's writing and their goal for the story is not everything i want to happen
everything that i desire to happen in a story will happen in this story
sometimes things happen in a story and the the uh the artist of the story that the author
yeah i don't really want it to happen i don't like it but it makes sense in the story and
it makes it very believable so therefore it will be in the story i am ignoring my own personal
desires that's the kind of thing that happens when you write yourself into a corner you realize
i need to i need to either let something really happen that could affect the narrative down the
line or i need to want a character to live but they're in a position where they just can't live
and you're like yeah i like this guy yeah his characters can only go through what the story
wants them to these factors have to be reintroduced at the expectation of an audience yet not at the
random peril not necessarily uh you don't have to whether or not people like it doesn't have anything
to do with any of that actually what what the story wants them to these factors have to be
reintroduced at the expectation of an audience yet not at the random peril of the characters so
while it's easy to say that a character has plot armor it's far more beneficial to explain the
situation the character is in has issues with its believability and examining and that's what it is
i was gonna say who doesn't think that's what plot armor is it's pretty yeah it's pretty much
intrinsically tied to believability and that's why if someone says this character's got plot armor
and then you go uh no they put the mithril vest on earlier in the film so that's why they survived
that and you go what the fuck's a mithril vest it's like the strongest i think i started off by
saying it was about the audience's tolerance determines whether or not they would call it
plot armor or not which is essentially believability is the tolerance whether or not they can believe
it is this video addressed to five word long youtube comments because that's the impression
i'm getting because like it does get out of that vibe yeah who says these things who are these
people and where can we punch them has issues with its believability and examining and critiquing
why that character or characters are in the situation they're in to begin with since we've
started talking about characters another 10 cent phrase i see getting thrown around a lot these days
is should be fun yeah i don't know where's he gonna go with this one oh yeah i don't even know
if i could answer to guess character arcs are a story's way of simulating how people change
through the course of their lives based on the experiences they have one of the problems with
the term character arcs and they're so well an objective standard for critique uh you guys are
slightly ahead of me i think i need to rewind i'm at 6 22 6 21 i'll try and go to 6 n does that work
yeah changed through the course of their lives based on the experiences they have one of the
problems with the term character arcs and their sudden bizarre inclusion as an objective standard
for critique is anything bizarre about it is he doing that in like quotations like objective
standard or is he saying like that is an actual objective standard i don't know what about i'm
confused here because how is character arc a standard well but i was gonna say i don't even
agree because a character doesn't necessarily require an arc static characters are fine yeah
dependent on well for example what is the arc of um you can name a lot of villains villains don't
typically go on arcs what's the emperor's arc is he a bad character because he lacks an arc
really so i guess i need more information on yeah if he's gonna because it sounds like he's
not gonna agree with this either um again i need to know what the people he's arguing against are
saying yeah i don't know i don't know if i agree with that yeah i don't know if these are real
people or if he's just fucking up some dudes he's thinking about in his head pretty much
is that they imply that characters must change and that if a character reverts
i mean there probably is some guy out there no you know what you know what i have a reference
people told us to respond to jenny is it jenny nickels or jenny nickelson i always fuck it up
i don't even know it doesn't matter uh she she says she's complaining about the characters in
rogue one and she goes through them all and explains they all don't have arcs and i remember
like listening to him being like why is this your standard right now like why can't you talk about
what they do and who they are why are you talking about whether or not they have an arc i was like
this is strange if they have an arc talk about the arc and how well it was executed but the
character doesn't have to have an arc yeah um so there are people who apparently use it as a sort
of like litmus test of how good a character is i suppose and you know typically again this is not
an objective good or bad as far as i'm gonna say but typically people will like a protagonist in a
long story to have an arc i like to see a character change over time especially in relation to events
that they experience it makes sense it means everything was you know it's all remembered it
it was all impactful it was all worthwhile it wasn't just watched it and now it's gone yeah
it's just how people generally are they're collections of memories that respond to events
and all i can say is that they imply that characters must change and that if a character
reverts to a previously plotted point in their arc that their arc is then ruined character
well that's possible that's possible yeah some people can naturally regress
again it's all contextual i feel like this is a very loaded kind of thing to say because
you know oh a character reverting to a previous stage in their arc or having their arc undone
where have i heard that before i guess tlj but game of thrones game of thrones Jamie Lannister
has upset many people but um yeah that's definitely um something you can say i'm curious if he just
does he just flat out disagree with that characters like people change if they want to and it's the
nuance in that choice and how they interpret the experiences that change their lives that is
interesting not the mere fact that they change by implying that the only good characters are the
ones who have changed through the course of a story we ignore the fact that there are people
in life who yeah i feel like are we trying to defend who says this was gonna say whoever said
this is wrong yeah whoever said that's clearly wrong i don't even know if i don't think anyone
our audience would say you have to have a character arc for the story to be good or for
the character to be a good one and then to the idea of is it strictly better for a character
to have an arc than not i'd be like not necessarily there's it's really dependent it's complicated
depends on their role within the work what is what is jack sparrow's arc throughout all of
his films doesn't pretty much just stay the same not like his whole thing and yet people absolutely
adore that character so i mean as long as people if people don't change but behave consistently
i'm totally fine with that kind of race he's led just joker yeah i mean a lot of people
they don't change very quickly the dude but they're consistent with themselves
and this is the thing if it doesn't make a character better lack an arc and therefore
character with an arc could still be really poorly written um because the art can be broken
yeah but i guess it doesn't work i guess he's implied that that isn't necessarily true oh
someone said patrick said it and that gave me a bit of a flashback i think patrick says about
batman versus superman but the character's like a flat slash don't learn anything which there's
like there could be an implication there of patrick saying that they have to grow and change
in order for it to be good or at least engaging for him because he obviously doesn't believe in
objective stuff i don't think anyway what was ned stark's character arc um there is something
there he at the end of his rope he does give up on his idea of always being honorable and honest
in order to try and save his daughter's life and it ends up technically killing him i would argue
that he breaches but the thing is that's not necessarily against his character because he's
already breached his quote unquote honor to protect john snow so ned stark a character doing
honorable things when they can or extremely often i think no character is perfectly consistent
with their morals or at least no human is i don't think i don't think so no real world is a
there the real world is a very messy place that doesn't care about your perfect streaks so i think
it's just natural for i think it's just inevitable that at one point you're gonna have to make
hard choices ned's character arc is being alive and then being dead yeah it's definitely a change
went from one place to another although shagley boy said post of it it's coming it's gonna be
really long i've already tested more than half of it on fringy and he liked it even without
seeing game of thrones so it's coming this is a common people gonna keep asking me for this coming
change in that they can be equally as interesting as those who do for example general zod is the
same character at the beginning of man of steel as he is at the end of it but that
doesn't make his interactions with the world around him any less interesting because it's his
conviction that defines it see so he's just i actually have a criticism for him now because
he's he said people saying character bad if no arc and then he responds with it doesn't make his
interest is in interaction with the environment around him any less interesting it's like oh
was that was what they were saying by good or bad were they saying that if you lack an arc as a
character you are therefore less interesting when you would interact with the environment is that
their standard it'd be nice when you bought their standards i was gonna say like i did maybe that's
true i don't know i don't think i'd agree with that i kind of yeah i broadly agree with what
he's saying but it's it's quite easy to agree with um yeah i guess we'll just i don't care
you know i guess he's just making standard arguments for why a character isn't terrible
even though they don't grow which i would agree with him on so because it's his conviction that
defines his character as he is quite clear about his unwillingness to change stories have the
incredibly difficult task of trying to mimic human behavior characters that don't change are
hard to write but characters who look like they're changing and then don't are probably the hardest
what do you mean why did you reference jamie lannister when he said characters that look like
they're changing and then don't he does change he literally abandons cerci lannister to fight
for the living that's an action you can't just say like no he's just lying like he nearly dies
like three times in that episode he did it but he was lying yeah he didn't mean it fuck off he's
just fucking did it you can't reference any scenarios of him like quote unquote relapsing
throughout like after he leaves other than the part where he just up and decides and i'm going
yeah it all seems to be a collective decision it's like he doesn't ditch he's still team cerci
when he gets back and he sees what she's done he's still team cerci then he sees that she blows up
the sevens like still team cerci want to go back to but as soon as cerci basically says
i would rather everybody die than lose the throne he's like yeah nah like i like you and everything
but nah this is too much i don't stick my dick in crazy and then yeah so and the whole briantha
action point going into it here but like if that's not a character dark break i don't know if there
is one don't are probably the hardest we're not very forgiving of irrationality in our characters
because of how out of place it can seem in our own day to day life well that's why you have to set
that up you have to show us the elements of the character that inform that you don't just have it
happen i.e star lord saying like like the idea with jamie is that supposedly cerci is supposed
to be something like an addiction to him and uh addiction so i suppose is the constant temptation
so he relapses we we need to see that yeah we don't see that yeah we see that he's kicked it
yep you don't understand that yeah we've we've seen that uh jamie he's kicked his
cerci addiction i suppose otherwise then nothing is anything anymore we're just like oh so anything
can happen because anybody can really make any action ultimately like rags could just
randomly jump out a fucking skyscraper window yeah humans can do it like what why why it it's
the sub it's the subtext of rags realizing the futility of life the futility of being objective
yes are probably the hardest we're not very forgiving of irrationality
i mean dying is not objectively a bad thing for me so fuck it in our characters because of how
out of place it can seem in our own day to day lives but a character we think makes an irrational
choice that sets their progression as a person back to square one isn't instantly a bad character
well you just implied then that there is such a thing as a bad character
is there or is there not and does he just they're not this thing oh so you think this thing is
a thing that exists he's fucked because he just said that and it's like okay so you don't mean
objective right because you're just talking about uh subjective stuff because there is no objective
bad and he'd be like yeah and i'd be like so why are you saying that whether or not someone can
dislike a character has to be based on them doing x y and z when it's all subjective anyway you can
dislike a character for being consistent i can be like i fucking hate this person because they
always do x but he's just yeah it's no fun he's just running himself around in circles you can't
say like oh it's not that doesn't make a bad character it's like you can't decide that if
it's entirely subjective screwed himself by saying that good and bad are inherently subjective terms
that early because then he had to write the rest of his script without saying good or bad ever again
as a person back to square one isn't instantly a bad character nor that choice automatically
illogical irrationality exists and it's i think we should i think we could fairly well
measure whether or not someone's doing something logical or irrational right yeah or irrational
yeah i mean that comes into the hole you can be irrational while being logically written as i'll
just keep using star lord as the example the problem with him hitting thanos isn't him hitting
thanos that makes complete sense it's like we understand why he's doing that he's a very
emotional character he loves gamora he's already done this previously like that's fine it's the
other the surrounding elements and what the character the other characters are doing um
so like the the idea that someone does something absolutely out of character and insane and his
answer is well you know people are irrational it's like that it's just like patrick williams
people aren't logical are we really that irrational apparently we will see that there's
such a thing as crazy people do things that they believe to be rational yeah there are crazy people
in the world my conclusion on this one so even crazy people will behave in a way that they
believe is rational well i would want to write a crazy if i had a crazy person i would prefer
that i have some level of like there's a consistency to their insanity if you if you
know what i mean just for the writing sake of it thanos is a fucking psycho but he's following
rationality that he thinks he's being rational right even on a more fundamental level in a sense
a character is a collection of attributes assigned by like the creator to explore something or for
whatever purpose that character might have all of those attributes rather than and like
that has to account for that has to count for something so you can't just deviate from that
at any point because then is it really the same character it just spits in the idea of progression
then as well because any character can do anything at any time so there's no point in even having
fucking characters why even have names everyone is everybody yeah why why do i bother assorting
these characteristics and attributes it's called a one a two a three a four and then you're like
why did you say a four did some things like they may as well just all be a don't call them characters
just call them events a four jumped out a window then a three caught him and threw him out another
window to analyze whether or not that choice the character makes along their arc is one that is
true to the character by defining everything as a character arc we're saying that progression
on everything's a character arc what the fuck are you talking about define everything that
character when you define whether or not a character is committed to an action that's true
to them you have to figure out what their values are what their motivations are and then see if
it's in line so um oh hey the ex is in chat by the way sorry apparently the ex is in chat the
creator of this video oh my word travel fasts on the planes hello there we're nearly done with
your videos uh if he is in chat i'm i scrolled up and i saw someone um dx do you think that your
video is good i think he thinks it's good i just want to hear him say that his video is good
because if he's i know where you're going with that right uh we shall crack oh yeah there he is
hello we are responding to you in the chair by defining everything as a character arc
we're saying that progression must be linear when sometimes it's circular
just because progression is linear the results can be circular but i was about to say it wouldn't
a circular progression still be linear it would have gone in a complete circle it wouldn't have
jumped around the circle yeah results can can come you can have repeating results so we call
that circular however the progression is going to be linear um because like jamie lannister
people are calling that circular well i would call it a 180 and then jumps right back like he
gets halfway around the circle and then he just fucking teleports back to the beginning point
this is the thing because there's no there's no progression there from further on it's an arc
from a to b i suppose and then no arc back just you know he flickers out of existence at b and reappears
it that's not an arc and that's not circular either but yeah but the idea that i don't know
like i don't know anybody who really defines everything about a character through their arc
as opposed to what they value like i said that's that's where i typically would start and their
values may change across their arc like um uh a lot of the times like a character's arc they'll
they'll have a fundamental value that stays the same but maybe they will um
change the way that it's expressed or at least uh will they incorporate a new value yeah like it's
learning something about i mean i guess or an experience makes them appreciate something like
oh i appreciate my family now i appreciate you know something it's a reference good old homecoming
but going from i must get into every battle possible and help every person possible to
i must pick my battles and do like responsibly act responsibly and use my power correctly not
just jump in um it's the same value the goal of helping people but it's like expressed in a
different way thanks to the archives when sometimes it's circular just because you end up at the same
place that you started doesn't mean you haven't grown as a person that one dimensional yeah
you can go back on one thing but you can develop in other ways
um yeah so i guess dx if you want to uh come on you welcome to do you have discord
well um we typically since we're close to the end we'll try and finish a video and then we'll talk
about it that's what we did with uh the doom sausage man i think that's what we've done with
everybody pretty nice stand on its own did we do that with snowman gaming i think we got through
most of it i can't remember if we finished yeah i think we pretty much finished it i don't think
we've ever had someone in while we were watching their video um the whole the video should stand
on its own yeah so in the description for this video there is a link to my discord get in there
and then at me um and then i'll i'll add you into this conversation be wonderful but uh we'll sort
out like i said we'll just try and finish this video uh change who you were to begin with the
final term i'd like to talk about is a strange one subverting oh god oh boy this movie here for
subverting wolf and ironically believes that rya johnson's destroyed the concept with the
tlj because subvert expectations is such a like neutrally understood it is well we we use it as
a meme right don't forget don't forget benny often wise's contribution to that destruction of
well they've also destroyed foreshadowing like the concepts
that the everyone's had to talk about foreshadowing versus development thanks to them
in theory a story that subverts expectations is an amazing one it does two things we've already
talked about it creates a cast of characters so closely resembling actual people that their
behavior is consistent and therefore their actions predictable yet it also forces these characters
into situations that make us question whether or not their choices that have subverted our
expectation of the choices they would have made were choices that were true to their characters
yes in a way in theory it could be very good so like a character who's i i just think that you
need uh not a strict one-dimensional source of information you need a bunch of things like um
there are characters throughout buffy and angel who some of them have a rule of never kill humans
some of them have a rule of never kill good people and so they will conflict it's the same
with superhero like stories where the punisher versus daredevil for example um and so could you
enter into a scenario where the person who said they would never kill a person would and you'd
need a bunch of additional information and context to be able to set up this moment but maybe maybe
that's something you would expect because you understand the i guess the ultimate what's like
a great subversion of expectation i was going to reference the depart i already did that in my video
so um you argue net fate as a subversion who's game of thrones net stocks oh um yes actually
probably one of the best because it's the reason we don't expect him to die is because of meta
subversion yeah we understand that you don't kill not only a top billing star but your protagonist
you don't kill them that's not something you do but everything points to him dying in that episode
there's no reason why you shouldn't and then the closer and closer you get to it you're like no
no no the other characters reacts would be like no and yeah he doesn't come back so
there's a couple ways it depends on what you're subverting i suppose which expectations
complicated feat i tend to be of the opinion that a subversion is like it's still a kind of payoff
in terms of setup payoff kind of uh the way films are made like it still comes from something
within the work yeah um and then again it's like uh our expectation of what the character will do
or what will happen to the character where the story will go there's lots of different
things there's lots of different uh i guess ways we can gain our expectations like you know you
can have a scenario where something happens and then two people one of them's like yep that makes
sense to the ones like what that came out of nowhere and it's like oh so they got information
differently yes the problem with this line of thinking and why this phrase needs to see the
pits of hell soon is because you don't actually need well-written characters or difficult personal
choices to make the subversion of expectations a component it doesn't have to be think of so yeah
you don't have to submit yeah you don't have to have subverted expectations to have a good story
not at all a lot of the times they can't help if they're done right but as we learned from the
last jedi if they're done really crappily then it really hurts the final product they expect
everything to be meaningful let's make nothing meaningful like okay you got me you showed us
you've successfully paid off nothing i feel good about a component of your story think of
subverting expectations as a box now i'm going to put everything that has ever fooled me into
thinking something about a character or a situation inside of that box without any context as to how
i was fooled by the story that is the problem with this term i said that a character's behavior has
to be consistent so their actions are predictable but that doesn't mean you have a great character
on your hands because i don't think what do you mean by any of these terms though if none of them
are objective is does great just mean character you like in which case
are these are is there a standard by which we can objectively like measure
how is it measuring what makes a great character is a consistency because he was almost saying like
it doesn't you don't require x y and z to make a character great and i'm like but what is a great
character by your own definition because i've thought that wasn't a thing beyond you saying
the character you enjoy i don't know this is true either for every general zod there's a
uron gray joy both characters never changed but only one was actually interesting wait is he
saying that uron is interesting i some i hope not earlier i think in a mo in a some somewhat
possibly i think that was a positive reference for zod yeah all right yeah because i haven't
seen man of steel in long enough to not remember if sod was like i don't know a great character i
hesitate to ask chat because i'm pretty sure everyone hates man of steel you know we could
we could explore that one day we will i also said that irrationality exists and while the
choice a character makes that subverts expectations could fall under legitimate irrationality it also
could have been pulled out of the rear end of a horse right so how we define that is the important
part how we figured that out was it them being irrational but within character or was it them
being uh out of character if we label anything under subversion of expectations we're not
actually specifying the quality of that subversion yeah no i agree with them you need to be more
specific than saying it's a bit of my expectations they're for good yeah we're just like what if
your expectations were good what if your expectations were excellent and they made
sense and they were rational and then therefore the traits of what what made it subversive was
the fact that was terrible what if the subversion doesn't doesn't pay anything off doesn't do
anything with any of the material present and kind of i guess wanders in that sense
like say tlj i guess
i think that they did really well i don't know what you're talking about
i didn't see that shit coming that it's a subversion and many people think that subversion
is objectively good i don't know who says that which brings us back to objective i'm sure there
are people in there the problem with modern criticism is that some critics both professional
and amateur would rather encapsulate their criticism into descriptors than actually mostly
a games critic these days but my ability to resonate with an audience still comes entirely
from being able to explain in great detail how something fails or succeeds if i said a
gameplay mechanic was objectively bad and left it at that the viewer oh yeah saying something's
bad on its own is boring so you gotta say why you don't you don't get to say something's
objectively bad without then qualifying yeah before or after because fuck otherwise
yeah what's the point it's just a thumbs up or down for every video it's like okay
doesn't learn anything if i explained why i thought this mechanic was objectively bad
the viewer learns something but is in a poor spot to debate because i've determined that it is bad
no matter what if i explained not bad no matter what no matter what you haven't explained it
it's a different sense of objectivity yeah it depends on how you guys use it
because yeah i completely agree dude like if i said to rags the fucking end game is objectively
badly written 100 and that's it and he's like wait and i go no that's it
i'd just be an asshole so it wouldn't be that we're having that that word doesn't stop discussion
i guess because that's something that he's echoed from earlier in the video um but what
it tells rags is that i've got information that goes beyond my feelings so you can be like so what
are you referencing well i really all i know is that you believe it well no even all i really
know is that you've said it well i'm going on i'm going on the fact that you know me rather than
i'm a random person like you know that if i say it that i'm probably going to have references but
yeah it doesn't end the conversation is my point why the mechanic no objectively doesn't
conversations if you say something objective it is conversations there's no discussion that can be
for me it's a great pryber i'm like ooh rubs hands together pay attention how dare you
brag is we have it like you haven't like built a channel around that is your main
contentious point no i wonder i wonder if he's heard of me he probably has
add no matter what if i explained why the mechanic works against the player's goals and how it also
works against the intended design of the developers the viewer not only understands my position on the
topic i would understand your argument i'm not sure i'd agree with it if uh you said a mechanic
was bad because it wasn't necessarily intended oh yeah you can fuck up into a good mechanic yeah
but can offer their own insight on the matter which could influence my previous judgment
we all benefit from having a discussion on these issues but only if we actually talk about the
issues and not summarize our opinions in terms that sound cool without any reasoning as to how
we arrived at this opinion or what to do about it it sounds like this guy might be on team efap to
a degree we're all about people explaining everything they say i completely agree with
him i just don't know who he's talking to necessarily and don't agree that when you
say something objective like there's no counter argument that can happen some of my criticisms
do amount to like nobody's explaining what they like we do that on efap regularly right all the
video essays we cover when they just say a thing is a thing and we're like what do you mean by that
i mean we kind of done it with this video too i mean it happened which we're all free to do
obviously but the more people who do it the less nuanced a topic becomes until the only thing you
have left to talk about is how much you hate what you're talking about all right uh so he is
he's joined the discord just get him i'll add him as a friend if you accept my friend request i'll
jump you into this call mr dx what did you think of the video guys um it's far from the
worst bag yeah it's definitely not even the contention for the worst video we've seen
so you take that as whatever victory you want to just uh there's certain misconceptions about
how objectivity or objectively rather tends to be used by people did he actually ever define
objective no that was part of the problem is that he's assumed there's one definition i suppose
the the two the two uses of objective i tend to be familiar with are the more journalistic sense
of let's try and be as unbiased as possible to be as you know fair to the subject as we can
and then the more formal sense of irrespective of human thought and ideas on the matter
the thing as it is i guess hello sir hola what's up guys
your video sent to me a couple times because it's the that first uh weird you tackle is something
of um i'm i'm something of a proponent of it in youtube criticism have you have you heard of me
before i'm like a demon when it comes to this sort of thing yeah i've heard of you but i haven't seen
your content um to be here to be fair though i don't watch a lot of youtube content these days
it's just a time so you uh this video you made it after i'm assuming seeing these
words being used in a couple of videos sure i saw them in a couple of videos uh i saw them on reddit
as well reddit's a very strange place for critic can i ask if are there any like youtube critics
that you don't like that you really think don't do a good job at what they do are the people who
like you just don't think are good critics uh sure you know i was watching a skill up video recently
about uh wolfenstein youngblood and regardless of my feelings on that game i feel like it was a pretty
shit critique um yeah i don't think he went into the right mindset i mean if you have somebody
that doesn't play first person shooters review a first person shooter it's it's topical you know
so if you don't play what you're reviewing you're probably not going to get a grasp on the on the
matter but i mean um i'm a little curious what have you played youngblood oh yeah i'm playing
through it right now what do you think i think it's okay i don't think it's okay i don't think
it's the best wolfenstein game obviously i think it's okay as well and we seem to be in the mind
i've got a review it's not up yet so but i that's that's what i say is i think that's it it's okay
guys it's not terrible but even that that seems to put us into the minority i i do think there's
right i think people sense blood in the water and they do want to hop on it well i think i think the
knives were out for that game even before it came out so yeah beth
they're they're uh happy tree friends out there everyone loves them right sounds like what you
highlight as well would be like how episode nine will be hated even if it was a great film at this
point now i think uh potentially um i for a long time had no interest in watching episode nine um
i left the theater after the last jedi and i finally felt how the people who walked out of
the prequels must have felt and my interest in star wars was totally destroyed and i'm gonna go
you know i'm gonna watch episode nine and and watch it but you know um i'm sure that i'm sure
there's gonna be a lot of people who go in with the preconception that you know this is gonna be
dog shit no matter what yeah i think there's a lot of channels out there who uh kind of have a
vested interest in it being bad i hope it's good i think i think all of us we all hope it's good
are just our expectation for it to be good it's not high if i was given one year to write
a good end to the trilogy of the sequels in in in disney i would be like no i can't do it
like this is so fucking hard to do well i mean i i've never talked about this and i haven't done
a video on it but i think a lot of the problems with the last jedi originated from the force
awakens so even though that's not an i i like the force awakens but i think a lot of the problems
that present themselves in the last jedi come from that come from that film and just the entire
you know concept of of universe shrinking i don't know i don't know if really if i was tasked to
have written tlj i'd be like so first things first jj fuck you like for putting me in this position
because i've got to build our world all over again because you just ignored it like and and
it's tiny now so i've got to spend like half of my movie establishing where everything is and who
everyone is uh but yeah tlj as much as it's it's got some horribly bad elements on its own it didn't
have a lot of great things to work with thanks to tfa but it also had some stuff it could have worked
with a little better than it did like the people who were fans of tfa felt uh that tlj was a terrible
sequel to it and all i'm referring to is just paying off some of the mysterious elements i suppose
i mean yeah what they did with snook i've been because i had to rewatch the movie to make this
video and um i think the production you know it's just top of the fucking line it's an incredibly
orchestrated film visually but i mean the writing still the writing didn't really hit me
i mean you know sometimes i like i re-watched batman versus superman after i saw it in theaters
and i thought to myself you know maybe i was a little too hard on this film i haven't changed
my rating on it but i see some of the merit there the last jedi no it just no no it is the doo doo
but you wouldn't go as far as saying it's objectively bad would you no yeah that's the
thing that's the point of my video or at least one of the points i'm making the video is that i
hate the movie i just straight up hate the movie um but do i think it's objectively bad no and i
guess you know the definition of whatever we describe as objectively is important here
well we can start there if you want what do you consider the definition of objective to be
sure um i'm gonna go off what it says in the dictionary so let me pull that up give me a second
okay in a way that is not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in a way that is not
dependent on the mind for existence actually that's what i think objectively in the context
should mean or i guess in overall content and so what does good mean in this context
good is whatever you think it means good is you know a subjective word yeah sure if you like
lobster lobster is good right no no no lobster can be good but lobster isn't inherently good
no i don't think anything can be inherently good or bad i think good and bad we're good
is lobster because good can be anything well yeah that's the point good can be anything to us
anything that doesn't mean um i i guess but well they're different so uh with what my question i
meant um which which definition of good are you running with and i know that may sound
as a strange question but i'm almost being literal here like how would you define the
weird good in that sentence something is objectively good i don't think objectively
good can exist i know i know so like if i said um a wheelless car with wheels you'd be like that's
not possible a wheelless car with wheels is you and i'd be like why it's like well wheelless means
without wheels taking more basic than that is like this if if a shape has four equilateral sides
is it not a good square well it is a square um the definition of square is pretty defined so
whether or not it's a good square is irrelevant it's a square it's the definition perfectly of
something yeah but what is a good square yeah i mean a good square is what not a triangle because
a triangle is in your line of thinking objectively not a square so well yeah it's a triangle is
objectively not a square yeah sure but that's a tautology uh you're saying the same thing twice a
triangle is not a square a triangle is objectively not a square there you're saying the same thing
you're just trying to find out what you think like to define good oh okay so like in the context of
a story or in the context of you know overall things as a as a quality of something the thing
is you seemed you said the good and bad object like inherently subjective terms so sure implies
a singular usage to give you a rope are you are you suggesting good means likable
no what i mean by good and bad is and i i guess i should have clarified this in the video is that
i yeah i i could think i have a good phone you know um my definition or what i think is good
about that phone is not going to be what i think is good about anything else if that makes any sense
so like whatever i say something is good i'm judging it off the merits of whatever it is
in relation to how to what i think about it its effectiveness and then we get into categorization
from there so what makes a phone good sure uh to me a phone that's good has you know a huge screen
it's a responsive phone has a lot of features um his picture in picture i have the galaxy note
nine so i have a pen that's a useful feature as well but see that's all subjective um so if we can
agree upon criteria and it doesn't matter what our opinion is but you'd agree that if we agreed
upon those criteria then we would be able to behave objectively to it as in we pick up another
phone that lacks a pen is small and then we go that by the standard we've just employed is now
a poorly uh a poor phone objectively sure but if we created that standard and i guess that's the
point i'm trying to make in my video is that if we if we create that standard then it is not
objectively because objectively is something that actually just is so the earth would you consider
the earth exists just to clarify would you consider is there such a thing as an objective
standard in any any any walks of life in any conversation about anything ever no i wouldn't i
wouldn't say so everything everything there's no objective standard for a square no because
a square is a square has a definition so well i'm with you on this right so uh the idea that
scientists fight over whether or not a pluto is a planet or a dwarf planet right is um i mean i say
they fight i'm pretty sure there's always an answer they just change uh the parameters or whatever so
dependent on what other standards been generated it would be objective of me to say it is a planet
or a dwarf planet depending on what the current understanding of science is and if you said to me
well those standards therefore are subject to change by whatever standards are being generated
by the science as it exists on this planet by human beings i'd be like well yeah but that's
the best we can so like is anything is nothing objective at that point well i feel like in the
example you mentioned you assumed that the discussion is about planets if you told me
pluto is a rock then i would agree pluto is objectively a rock but that's but a rock is a
standard that we've generated ourselves i i don't think so uh a rock is rocks exist in our universe
you know uh rocks in space so what i mean to say is that a rock is formed of certain um materials
regardless of whether or not we want them to be a planet on the other hand is what we define it to
be if that makes any sense how isn't it something what we define it to be because rocks existed
before us but so planets our definition of what a planet is did not exist before us neither did the
rock definition well are you saying that the categorization is made by us yes that's exactly
yeah that's what i'm saying i'm saying the categorization is made by us so yeah pluto can be
a planet regardless of whether or not it's a planet but at the end of the day it's it's a rock
we're arguing about whether or not it's a planet because we haven't really decided you know or i
guess we did well can i couldn't i go further than that and say no it's not a rock it's a collection
of atoms yeah sure and you'd be right but so that's kind of what i'm getting at is that
everything we we make any kind of conclusion about is run on standards that we've generated
ourselves in the first place i i wouldn't agree because um okay so in your example about uh
a collection of atoms um the collection of atoms exists whether or not we want it to it existed
before us our definition of a planet did not exist yeah and that's what i'm saying it's objectively a
rock but so does the planet so does pluto it's just the name we gave it
right i i i don't think we disagree i'm not sure we disagree on this because what i don't know
what we're saying it's a difference in what you understand to be objective i think yeah i think
that's i think that's the discussion we're having because i don't disagree that pluto is
a collection of atoms i don't disagree that it's a rock what a discussion can and has been had on
whether or not it's a planet because well we haven't decided on that but you know whether or
not it's a rock is indisputable well as someone just said in chat it's not actually a rock it's ice
then it's ice my bad i thought well but you get right that all of this changes based on how we
define we look at all of these things that exist that what they are and then we just use language
to to explain to other people what they're defined as which is how everything runs there
isn't anything that doesn't run with that because that's what language is and so when uh we're
talking like what i'm saying is that whatever you agree we can be objective about with a planet a
rock or atoms whatever we can extrapolate that into basically everything because it's all based
on how we define and what parameters we generate and the only problem is to just explain to the
other party what the framing is but when you say like it can't be objectively good i'd like to
know what you mean by objective what you mean by good and then i can explain to you what i mean
when i say objective and good and uh you can understand what i'm saying that you may give
different names like if i said pluto as a planet and then another scientist goes no no no it's a
dwarf planet and they go well we we're saying the same thing we've just given it different names
because we didn't understand each other's standard and which is the correct standard well typically
we just run with whatever's most commonly understood at this point or whatever science
tells us is the correct answer at this point because we have to run to uh authority figures
with that because we're not scientists but typically we run with with uh definitions
of ways we just go to the dictionary common understandings um for example someone saying a
shoe is a car will just be like well we're not going to be taking them very seriously because
that's just useless well yeah there's a there's a difference between i mean i believe in facts
obviously um but i don't think facts are determined by people if you tell me that um the solar system
is going to collapse in a billion years that's that's a fact it's just going to happen regardless
of whether or not we're around not necessarily but sure i mean isn't that what happens with uh stars
again again this is all based off predictive models is the thing so i can't say that for sure
um because to try and bring it around again right so the way i look at
good if i conclude at the end of a video essay that uh let's say game of thrones season eight
was poorly written and i say it's objectively poorly written then you say okay you can't say
that or i would have said sorry it's objectively bad and then you go what do you mean by bad and
i go by the standard of poorly written it fails by the standard of writing it fails to reach
a high standard and that's a definition of bad likewise with good it reaches a high standard
but someone you can use that word for it's it's typically looked at as the second definition as
opposed to the subjective side which is just like it i like the thing it's good because it makes
me feel good um so when you say something's objectively good that's why people say like
that's an oxymoron you can't be objectively a subjectively good thing because everyone's
gonna have a different reaction so when someone says objectively good i would assume or bad
that they're referring to a standard and i agree with you in the portion of your video where you
you're explaining that someone saying something is x or y without having any kind of explanation is
pretty much useless because you're just like okay by your mysterious standards you've defined it but
with my videos and i hope with with many others they would do some legwork in explaining it and
mine typically runs with like a sense of logical consistency an establishment of rules that do not
get broken a progression that does not get broken um which i would argue is intrinsic to the idea
of what a story is you can't have a story unless there's progression in the first place so it's a
standard that's tied to it objectively um so whether or not i like let's say of season eight
of game of thrones it is poorly written and i would have to separate myself from it if i really
enjoyed it great examples endgame i rewatched it recently and me and my friends me and my friends
like non-spoilers or anything but me and my friends are going through and it's like damn
like i love this film but good god none of this makes any sense like loads of decisions they make
is so stupid um and a lot of the events take place are very contrived unfortunate but uh that would
be the objective part where i pull myself and how i feel away from it and judge it based on
these standards that i think are intrinsically tied to storytelling as a whole and then someone
comes at me saying hey by saying that you've invalidated this guy's feelings over here and
i'm like oh well if that were true i've technically invalidated my own feelings but i
don't feel that way at all i'm just like yeah i accept all of that but i still enjoy the shit
out of it and vice versa i can really dislike something that i accept is actually very well
well made like a lot of people feel that blade runner is very boring or lame even though they'll
say it is pretty well constructed though um sure um so i don't think we disagree on much beyond
the concept that like the example with game of thrones that if you say it's poorly written based
on the standards or based on standards my problem is that those standards were just i mean like
it's hard to get my point across here standards were created by people yep so i mean yeah we can
all agree to them but there's always going to be dissonance within that standard there's going to
be people who don't disagree so i guess and correct me if i'm wrong what you're arguing is that
because of the arguments we've made we have determined that it is objectively bad
and we're running with that and the only reason we're running with that is because no one has
presented an argument proving the opposite so if somebody presented an argument i don't know maybe
it's the greatest argument ever that season eight of game of thrones is good oh well uh things like
that can change over time i'm trying to think of um if you remember a lot of people consider
ben kenobi is made inconsistent by the prequels because he looks at anakin as this
person that he's like uh he thought was an amazing jedi and a great friend and stuff and it's like he
looked at prequels like oh clearly he wasn't but you know i don't know if you've seen the video
where someone made a mash-up where he's talking about anakin with luke and then they intercut
scenes from the prequels and it actually makes a really emotionally impactful scene because it's
the idea is that ben is deliberately talking about it in a flowery way when he knows that
it was all painful and it's like whoa and once you look at that as an interpretation it's hard to
make the conclusion that he is now inconsistent in the same way that when he goes um from a certain
point of view people are like wow that's a retcon it's like well it's in line with his character
because he ben makes a lot of decisions that are kind of manipulative i actually see the fact that
he let himself die to vader as quite manipulative in in retrospect because he was like this will
make it so luke will definitely hate this guy like he'll definitely want to kill him and if
you look at that from the perspective that he's vader's his dad and ben knows that like wow ben
like you really wanted to and and not without reason vader's a piece of shit and if luke goes
to the dark side that's going to make everything even worse so hiding the fact that he's his dad
is probably for the best to a degree it's a it's a relatively you could call it an immoral choice
to lead to um a moral the ends justify the means is kind of what i'm getting at there i guess you
could you could also argue that you know vader eventually does get what he wants which is killing
ob one but it doesn't result in anything and he's yeah it's completely it's completely pointless
victory so the discussion isn't necessarily uh over in certain topics but for example i'm assuming
you've seen the clip people reference where someone's about to kill ray with a knife and it
disappears yeah that yeah there's no that conversation's over we've we've had different
guests try and defend it like uh we had major lee say yeah that's only a mistake if you judge it
as a mistake and it's just like you can try you can try all you want to walk around it to find
any kind of standard that makes sense i was like the only way you can make sense is if they
randomly have a movie later on but they go yeah it sucks that the imperial god that were
on this note sometimes their weapons would disappear that's just a thing that they do
it sucks see not yeah just i mean knives dematerialize all the time didn't you know
well it's the thing it completely changes uh the stakes you'd be like what then then their fucking
their weapons can disappear like what well see i i think i get what you're getting at here and yeah
so so that's a production mistake i mean obviously my interpretation is that that was
or what i think happened is the knife must have been erased in post
because somebody realized why isn't he killing her right so so it has to be a production mistake
a production error um my point and the point of my video is whether or not we think that's a good
or bad thing is ultimately up to us so yeah it's a production error we can look at it that way
or i mean i guess you can quantify it however else you'd like but whether or not um it's a
good or bad thing is it is to us i think it's a bad scene but does that actually make it a bad
scene i i feel like i don't have really the authority to say that even when you know when
you say good or bad i assume you're referring to whether or not it's a it's a ultimately like
either moral or desired or approved of thing that's the primary definition right well i'd
be like well by the standard of maintaining a progression of events maintaining stakes
having your story match without it's it's a complete faltering it's a complete contradiction
of events so it's just like absolutely a bad on the binary scale if we wanted to put it that way
certainly if we were to say characters walking from a to b so it's like all good everything's
in line it's all making sense nothing's wrong then they just disappear it's like whoa we got
a blip but someone's fucked up what when i used to and this was years ago i guess at this point
i used to review like really really bad anime and a point that i'd always like to make is that
yeah it's like here i'm presenting this argument as to why this is bad and i think this is fucking
terrible but i think it's terrible um i'm not really interested in arguing with other people
who think it's good because ultimately that's their interpretation and i'm not i'm not interested
in arguing with that person the merits of the content because at the end of the day both of our
both of our arguments are going to be motivated by personal feelings as to how things are
work or they don't work do you not think you would you not want to change their mind on it
no absolutely not um that that's just how i am it's like if you enjoy something
i know what it feels like to enjoy things so i'm not going to try to rob that from another person
um and this is in the context of power from people well sure i do if i know and and i've
gotten these comments before it's i've seen you i love this anime and i saw this video and wow i'd
i'd saw all the flaws in it and now i dislike it or i like it less i i think you can absolutely
rob somebody of their enjoyment if you trust them or can convince people but it's not like you're
forcing them into doing anything yeah i i would take issue with the word rob it's it's like would
they not would it not be consensual for them to engage in your video especially if the title
is like critique of or review of or something something is bad i think the question is if they
noticed the scenes themselves how is it any different to if you showed them it is that still
them robbing themselves and i suppose is it really robbing rather than enlightening i mean i think
that's um i think that's an interesting take on it enlightening but i don't feel like i have really
the right to do that i mean i state my opinion and whether or not you agree or disagree is you
know ultimately up to you so it's like i don't the the the focus i take with my videos and my
critique videos like i did of rainbow six siege is i have these problems with the game you might
not have these problems with the game but for me here's why they are a detriment to the game you
don't have to agree with me um i guess we can even argue the merits of my complaints but at the end
of the day these are just my thoughts and that's the that's the that's the um approach to critique
i take that everything is what if that makes people enjoy rainbow six less well then it makes
them enjoy it less just like it makes me enjoy it less but there i mean there are in the previous
examples there are plenty of people who would never i mean i mean there are plenty of people
who agree with my complaints about siege and there are people who if you go on the rainbow
six subreddit right now would never agree with a thing a single thing i said and all the unbalanced
garbage in the game makes the game more fun for them um i recently did a video on call of duty
where there's a lot of people who like black ops 4 for the reasons that i hate the game so
so why why would that not apply to the previous example of the anime um can you remind me of
you don't want to you said you didn't want to rob people of the way they feel about it
sure but it's like a double standard in a really obvious kind of way
how how would how would you say i'm i'm genuinely just trying to understand my bad you don't want
to put out your you you said you don't want to rob people of their enjoyment of the anime
why would you not oh okay so yeah no okay i get what you're saying when i post well when i feel
like when i post a video on youtube yeah i can get shared by algorithm yeah i can get shared by that
but my videos specifically the ones i've done i've done on anime have had this very strange
effect where people start taking them as gospel and bible and people just start repeating the
talking points and repeating the talking points at a certain point it just went well beyond me to
where i was seeing these talking points spewed everywhere on the internet points and people i
mean i i guess but agree with them then sure but i don't mean you make good points sure but i don't
think that makes them objective points i mean they they can be argued um and i've i've even
seen some replies to my video where i've seen well yeah maybe i was wrong about this
but does that change anything because even if i think it's wrong about it the
the consensus has gone way beyond me at that point i can't rectify whatever i said in that
video at that point well shouldn't you do you think it's better for us to be able to justify
the things that we believe i mean in the context of critique yes because i help i feel like it
help gets uh your point across but at the same time it's not um it's not law you know well it
never was law well i mean if you're saying it's better that people should watch a video and through
that video be able to justify the way that they feel instead of just in an ambiguous impossible
to express way like something for reasons that they could never explain i mean i i would consider
that almost infantile to a way i think i definitely think it's growth if we can be able to express
the way or why we think the things that we do would you would you prefer that everybody liked
everything no i mean people can like whatever they like if someone liked the holocaust for
instance would you not want to rob them of their enjoyment of that i mean i don't think people can
enjoy uh the holocaust considering that they weren't there i mean how there how would you
enjoy the holocaust if you weren't there to enjoy it it's subjective so of course it's i mean we can
substitute the holocaust for the concept of the holocaust what are we okay so you like killing
jews is that is that we already know that they were people who existed yeah i mean we know people
enjoyed that is it not do you think it's good to rob them of their enjoyment of that
well how would you go about robbing them of their enjoyment of that by killing them
the same way that you rob people of their enjoyment of an anime the exact well i i don't
think those are nearly the same thing i think uh genocide is far different from enjoying a fucking
no no no they're not the exact same thing to like but the same way that you would rob someone's
enjoyment of the concept that's not that's not the same concept what how the difference would be a
significant moral judgment right you consider it far more important to consider people humane than
it is to enjoy an anime i think rags is more weighty than the other yeah rags concept is a fundamental
like so just right argue to us the well to me and wolf that uh we shouldn't necessarily
uh break a piece of media down that people are enjoying because you can rob enjoyment from the
world that's that's the words he actually used uh so the idea that it's a it's almost a bad it's
just strictly a bad to explain to someone why season eight of game of thrones is poorly written
because they might have enjoyed it i don't i don't know that it follows that because they're having
a positive experience it means that to prevent to explain something to them that stops them from
enjoying it is always a bad thing and rags has chosen an extreme example on purpose to prove that
that is not definitively true so now we need to draw a better line i i just don't i just don't
understand the equivocation of no no i get i get what your point is i get what your point is that
the methods are what's being equivocated there there are people obviously who want to see jews
removed from the face of the earth that's you know yeah there's seven billion people out there yeah
yeah and there were nazis you know that committed atrocious crimes in in germany and across
all of europe but i just yeah we have muslims i mean hey it's a very real example that we can pull
from i feel like i
who are you to rob them of their enjoyment of the concept of the holocaust is that you're right
no because we have free speech laws in this in this country so for me i mean what how do we
are we killing them like how are we are we arguing against their points because that's
that's just illegal so i i mean this is the exact same way that you use with anime
how how is that possible how when how is it possible sure i would have a i would have okay
so in in your example i'd have a debate with somebody yeah that the holocaust isn't something
that uh you say it's bad essentially the holocaust is bad right and if you're also trying to explain
this is why this enemy is bad well you would use the same methodology for both of those things
yeah and in the same light and in the same using the same logic if somebody liked that anime
well what if somebody's a nazi they also like that too are you arguing that
what you're arguing it is is that it's bad to kill jews essentially is that what you're arguing
no no i'm arguing here i'm saying that because i this whole this whole thing stemmed from the idea
that there was a there seemed to be a very obvious contradiction in why it's okay to do
the rainbow six thing and not for the anime thing right and so yeah we're getting into the methodology
for you know this stems after that it stems from should you take people's enjoyment away because
you frame that as a bad thing to take away people's enjoyment sure but you can extrapolate
that to me taking people's away me taking someone me taking uh someone's enjoyment from a thing does
not void their rights as a as a citizen of this country or of their lives um i don't i don't like
see how that even i mean because i i feel like okay answer this how do we rid nazi's enjoyment
of the holocaust oh i would say we should we could make arguments with them and show that this is bad
for the world that it's not fair that we should have foundational principles and we could show the
results of these principles in society and we could use you know apathy as a way to get them to
understand how cruelty works and other people and how they would feel if it was done to them
figures all sorts of things and much the same way that you would convince somebody right but i don't
know we're doing it with the holocaust i don't think that's the same thing you can consume
a work of fiction how do you consume the holocaust i mean you watch you read about the holocaust
just like uh just like with anime you look at the source you go to the source material and we have
a lot of it for the holocaust look at this i feel like this is a very disingenuous uh
no it's not disingenuous about it i don't i don't understand this are you why
no it doesn't mean it's disingenuous just because you don't understand it
i mean whichever part you don't understand i could elaborate on
uh i don't i don't know man i i don't think you can and especially in the gameplay example i
mentioned even the gameplay is different from the anime because you play a game so your experience
is going to be fundamentally different than experiencing an anime um we can disagree to
examples from it in order to explain to people why it is of a certain quality or whether it
meets certain criteria right how would that be different from the holocaust
uh well for one um rainbow six siege is a game so okay we're not debating the merits of a game
we're debating the merits of a genocide oh yeah we're comparing the merits of a game with the
merits of a genocide one is not they're not equal in terms of their scope and their scale and their
impact on civilization this is about the methodology that is used right i understand
the methodology um yeah i could we can argue anything like that i i i feel i feel like you
you can't i feel like a more accurate analogy would be to say um i'm going to take away the
enjoyment of i don't know committing homicide um because there are people who enjoy killing
other people i think the example you mentioned with the holocaust is so it's okay it's fun to
make people's enjoyment for certain things yeah sure of course i mean that was if that if that
was all you wanted from the if that was all you wanted if that admission was all you wanted i
mean i could have given you that before because you could have but this was interesting i i mean
my my my problem with the holocaust analogy is not that you know of course killing jews or
killing anyone is a bad thing it's just that i don't know how you derive enjoyment from
a fictional event um i mean i guess you could i think holocaust actually happened just for just
oh fuck oh shit uh yeah no no i'm not no the holocaust actually i got i got shit i'm sorry
did you say you don't know how you all arrive oh no this clip is going up somewhere i'll tell
you why because if if you really really hate jews and think they're subhuman then you will derive
enjoyment from no no you said you know how they would derive enjoyment from a fictional event why
not well what i meant to say is i can see you deriving enjoyment from hunting down jews right
now and killing them but but deriving enjoyment i think i think the i think we're arguing semantics
in here anyways i think you can't derive enjoyment isn't enjoyment to present so i mean like how could
you a present derive enjoyment from what i mean is i don't know even the idea even the idea of doing
it even the daydream of it can bring you joy yeah oh i mean i guess for a moment this entire thing
isn't it started from a semantic distinction on how we use the word objective and what it can be
yeah the whole thing is semantics anyway i think this is going up i honestly might agree with you
on uh objective not being suitable here i might use normative instead but honestly i think you
could use common standard as well it's about the nature of people's enjoyment is really
the the closer basis than objectivity or not it depends on how far back you go i suppose when
but that's where the conversation's gone too yeah yeah well i well yeah i'm aware that declaring
something objectively good or bad is a conversation ender which is weird but i've seen it used as a
conversation ender it's certain it certainly can be an an argument ender i mean like i'll give you
an example here um i agree with it sure but in rainbow succeeds there's a character called lion
he's a broken piece of shit and based on what he does in the game none of us really deny
that he is a broken piece of shit if i start my argument out with that stance then all i'm
arguing is whether or not he's a piece of shit i'm not arguing the merit of having a character
like that in the game but we agree with you here but we don't like it when people just assert
things and don't provide evidence if well i mean like my argument is even if you provide evidence
as to why he's broken and i believe me i could provide you fucking pages uh fucking college
thesis on why lions are broken pieces of shit that doesn't i mean that makes it that makes
it true for me but that doesn't make it true for other people there are other people there's
only one truth wait the idea here is that whether it is objectively true is obviously it it exists
whether or not we think it however this is our attempt to identify whether or not it is objective
or not if you said he is broken i said how and you say by uh the standard of imbalance he is more
powerful than other characters this is not something that is an opinion it's provable
damage values or his abilities uh have far more pragmatic use than literally any other character
or i'm assuming you've got standards or values haven't played the game so i don't know but
to give you an example that i gave uh before i think this was i don't know if this was major
like i don't remember who i said this to but um hit boxes like um to match a model i don't know
if you've played ds2 or any of the games that are terrible but when you have one that completely
unmatches the box when the entire like circumstance is understanding your opponent
in battle like there is it's essentially a binary conversation did it match did it not
no objectively bad hitbox because that's the whole that's what a hitbox is i try to run with
what is intrinsic to the the thing itself bring a bring an argument down to its core um i get what
i get what you're saying but wouldn't it be more accurate to say the hitbox is inconsistent with
the rest of the hit boxes in the game uh well at that point i'd be like it wouldn't so much be
about its inconsistency with other hitboxes in the game it's the inconsistency with the model
that if they yeah if they were all one meter to the left of the model yeah like i suppose you
i don't even i don't think that would ever like i don't think anybody would be able to uh
account for that in a consistent manner but at least you could actually say all the hitboxes
are consistent in the game's design and maybe there is an in-universe reason for that as in
there is the what you see is not actually real and that there's a ghost to the left of everything
that's the actual hitbox could be a really bizarre justification but you could probably do it that
way in the same way that a character getting their head blown off isn't inconsistency for
them to live but if you had context in source that identifies that as being a possibility because of
the species they are or the circumstances then that would be your ready before yeah uh so but
but at the base level a hitbox matching the model that's entirely it's supposed to represent because
the hitbox isn't even necessarily supposed to be a thing we recognize that's something it can be
measured um also i was going to say southpaw uh would like to ask a question as well so just
going to bring him in um unfortunately wolf has said he's not going to be able to make it at all
typical man so uh i figure southpaw will be our southpaw will be our fourth uh but he said he
wanted to ask questions i'll let him jump in while he does jump in i need to refill my beverage
anyway so i'll be back in just a minute very well tea time hello everyone hello hey dude
so um dx i have a question for you sure sure brother so do you believe that there are
differences in talent for writers there's a kind of a second follow-up question i'm going to ask you
but like we'll just start with this yeah sure i think that there are you said differences in
talent and renders yes yeah sure okay so how do you quantify that i quantify it by whatever i
feel like is good writing and bad writing so if you're telling me rekikawa hara or let's take
rekikawa hara's example i feel like he's a pretty terrible writer um based on whatever i feel makes
a story good um here's another example um i'm blanking on his name right now but let's say
let's compare him to the guy who writes one piece um i think he's about a writer yeah oda yeah
so it's like i i feel like yeah of course but i mean whatever i quantify a good writer or a
bad writer as in the differences in their quality is based entirely from what i what i um determine
makes a good story to me uh which is not what would maybe determine what's a good story to somebody
else or somebody else okay so um let's say that i uh i'll tell you i'll tell you about a a bad movie
that i enjoy right what kind of is a guilty pleasure sure so the amazing spider-man 2 is
a universally reviled film for several good reasons i yeah i i don't know where you're
going with this but i i feel like that movie also is not a movie that i detest either despite the
writing wait i'm sorry what he said he doesn't detest it despite the writing either yeah despite
the writing yeah yeah so there are there are elements of it that i enjoy but i admit that
the writing fails uh to meet a standard that i would qualify as good writing like i think that's
kind of all over the place uh you've got characters that are being set up to be significant
and then the payoffs aren't even in the film there's too many villains there's not really like
uh development like they're focusing on making a cinematic universe that doesn't even
happen after this film so it's kind of a kind of a pointless film um there are still elements that
you can enjoy in it regardless but you can acknowledge that there are flaws
right um yeah i'll use your example uh there's a game called rogue warrior which is absolutely
atrocious um it's just mickey rourke saying fuck for like two hours and by any standard that i
would have for different games and the standard that i have for games it's a one out of ten game
it's a terrible piece of shit but it provides uh fun and laughs in other ways so yeah i i understand
what you're saying and i separate that aspect when i'm critiquing something however that doesn't
mean that i feel like that is just the truth of the matter if that makes any sense so yeah rogue
warrior is a terrible terrible game right yeah but it's a terrible game to me it is it could
be i don't know maybe maybe it's a game of the year to somebody else i don't i have no fucking
idea and it's also what their standard is for rating the game if they rate a game entirely on
laughter and how much fun they had with the game then it would probably actually be a 10 out of 10
game to them so whatever we grade things by is different and that's that's sort of my point
do you think there is no common ground in that regard uh potentially um i'm sure there there are
groups of people who agree with certain things and and i think objective standards the way that
we may understand them or the way that they're popularly used are derived from large groups of
people liking something but there's always going to be outliers or outliers and and people who have
you know different i give you an example i gave um i hate everything of all people when he called
me childish condescending and stubborn uh about this whole topic why did he do that because he
had never seen my videos and he believed the right opinion quinton reviews about what i say
and then i got him into a call and he like reversed all of it once i did explain myself
i hate everything you remember the whole fucking debacle oh yeah i remember who knows i know it's
funny i just i just played hunt down the freemen for my channel after years of fans pestering me to
play it and uh i was quite an experience he was uh he was actually one of the better parts of the
game um amazing so he was he was of the opinion that there is no such thing he said it previously
in his videos that something is objectively bad so i was very confused that he said there's no
such thing as something being objectively bad and the one that cracked him i'm curious what
you'll think about this um so have you seen suicide squad yes sir i own the movie so you
know when they introduce to uh i guess i can't remember if it's arkham or whatever place
they're going to they they have black text on a background that is very dark
the point where people can't even read it yeah of course yeah i would be like that's
objectively terrible you have writing that can't be read you fucking idiots
well see that's where i agree with you it is writing that cannot be read whether or not that's
objectively bad that's intrinsic i don't think i would i i mean it sounds it sounds dumb in
this example in particular sounds dumb because i think it's a terribly edited film i i agree with
you that it is a that i think it is a terribly edited film but it's entirely possible that
somebody places no importance on that aspect of the film no no no no take it take it out of
of the film and we're just now i've used as an example of it existing and now we talk about
writing that cannot be read is intrinsically bad because it's of the standard of the writing it's
of what it is it is not what it is and you'd be like so isn't that binary and it's like well
take um a label for something and then blur it by a little bit everyone can still read it blur
it again blur it again gets the point where most people can't read it so now you're in territory
of like five out of ten it gets the point where it's literally just a blotch no one can read it
it's a zero that would be how we'd scale this sort of thing and then you know like plot holes or
inconsistencies can all be done in this way like how much they affect progression or cause
progression arbitrarily so i have i have let's go with a hypothetical murder mystery right
um let's say that you have a a murder mystery where it seems like there's no viable suspect
for who killed this person and then at the end of the book you find out or movie or whatever
whatever medium this that's uh doing this the story um let's say that you find out that the
killer was an astronaut who was on the moon at the time of the murder now there are a few different
ways in which this is possible uh let's say let's say that the astronaut has a death note
okay and the establish that the death note is is real in this universe okay so that's that's one
thing but then let's say that the author says no no no but the astronaut didn't have a death note
so you go okay well maybe the astronaut can teleport across the galaxy and thus uh teleported
to earth real quickly to kill this person then teleport back to the moon but the writer then
says no that's not what happened either and then you go okay what if it was a shapeshifter that
shapeshifted to look like the astronaut and then uh the writer says no that didn't happen either
that like the astronaut was the one who did it but the astronaut was on the moon there is like
basically no way that this is possible and the entire story hinges on this massive plot hole
is that not objectively bad okay so run it through me again he could not have been
at the place because he was on the moon of course right so right and all methods of him
killing that person have been exhausted or the author just doesn't offer an explanation or um
wait i'm sorry can you repeat that does the author
no there's no explanation given you're just told that the right that the astronaut did it but you're
not actually told how to clarify though even if the author gave an explanation that wasn't present
in the source wouldn't really matter i mean i feel like if he gives an explanation and then of
course has has the element of how he killed the person explained beforehand then is it like let's
say he has a 50 fucking foot laser sniper rifle it's a dumb thing right but if it's in the story
beforehand is it really a plot hole what uh what if it contradicted previously established
information that that's the point of the of the question yeah sure yes then what well yeah i
wouldn't call it objectively bad what i would describe that is is what you guys are describing
it as it's it's it's it's in it's inconsistent with the rest of the story which is objectively
bad right right yeah it's just to connect that way to connect the dots objectively bad translates
into without my feelings being present it is of a low writing standard by which i'm referencing
progression see but you're putting the standard in there my definition of objective ends at
whatever um right but that's what language is so like weirds mean multiple things once
we've clarified what we mean our perspective i mean yes if that's your definition of objective
absolutely and yes it would be that's a man's progress all right here's the thing guys i've
never i've okay here's here's my problem i've i've never like if you guys want to consider
something objectively bad i'm not going to argue against because i mean she would
if you want to call something objectively bad you're free to do so it's my opinion on why you
shouldn't call something objectively bad and why it's it's detrimental to the standard of critique
that or not to the standard to the state of critique as we have it today i mean i don't
think there can be multiple definitions of a word um but okay that's uh that's baffling
what do you mean that's an interesting thing to say well how how are you okay
how are we describing objectively here like right now okay here so so dx um so in the
murderer astronaut example here you have a story establishing that a person is dead you have a
story establishing that of course there's an astronaut who is on the moon at the time of the
person dying and this astronaut is somehow connected to this person in some way and then
you have the story telling you that somehow the astronaut is the one that did it and wasn't
framed and didn't have a death note and didn't have any superpowers or even a laser cannon
that allowed him to snipe that person from the moon so objectively you are given two contradicting
statements and there is no explanation for how exactly the astronaut was able to do it
not in the text and not uh on twitter by the author so that is a plot hole that is going to
really uh significantly damage your story because like especially with a murder mystery
it relies on the conclusion making sense because if you don't have your conclusion makes sense
and if your story doesn't abide by like the rules of logic then you're cheating basically and it's
kind of a waste of time i feel like this example could be well here though the point is that you
this is more about the concept no i i understand i understand yeah it's the concept of it's an
exaggerated example i don't give you that no i agree yeah i feel like the example i mean you
could just use game example yeah no i i understand um so yeah but here's the thing the way that i
would describe that in my own critique is yeah it's a fucking plot hole yeah it's you know
bullshit contradiction it doesn't make any sense but i don't feel like that's the end all be all
to to you know to to my opinion i feel like that's my opinion that's that's not it's the
solution to the mystery that supersedes the words that we use to describe them and we've gotten you
to well not that we've gotten you but we've you agree with the concept that we use the word
objective for and that's basically the big thing yeah that's uh because i was just gonna say to
draw you back to saying a weird only has like the one definition are you aware that a lot
of people think objective means that everyone agrees on it sure but then they would be wrong
yes we we if that is that in a dictionary anywhere because that's how i would define
it that's not i don't actually i'm not actually sure if it is but that's what just right
just right said to us and then they aren't wrong then then then they aren't obviously
wrong about the definition well but so you do agree then that words can have multiple definitions
to try and steal my new point a bit dx are you trying to say that there is a difference
between saying that x is inconsistent saying x in x is inconsistency is bad absolutely that's
been the entire we only know that part because we've moved on to that's a fact value distinction
that's a that's a very big distinction make make sure that yeah well i feel like well that was what
i feel like i've been saying that this entire time that i even if i feel something is x that
doesn't mean it is objectively x i was gonna say that's rewound because we we i made it to the
writing thing right defined that uh it would be considered binary but you can stretch it out to a
zero to ten with with the writing one you can do it with a hitbox the degree to which it's tied to
the model and then plot progression you can do that again you could have this character is
wearing blue shoes or he's wearing pink shoes a second ago and that's it who the fuck is that has
no effect on anything unless the main villain looking at pink kills him at that point you'd
be like what the fuck would you get the pink shoes from you know what i mean like the the
progression and it's it's all very relatable as much as you could be like how can you draw a value
judgment and it's like well it would be based on a wider context of how it's all framed how you how
how in a scale it would be judged like a broken brick in a house doesn't destroy the house
how many bricks were broken and then it does destroy the house if it's if there's enough
um and none of this stuff relies on how i feel uh you might you might say like well is 10 bricks
enough to break it and it's like well it uh the most important payoffs of the film being
that's usually what a story is for everything we see is all it tied together to create the
for example we don't skip from we meet luke and then it then it goes 10 years later or whatever
the fuck and then it cuts to him and vader fighting because we'd have no investment we'd
like who even are these people why are they fighting each other what happens if one of them
wins um so everything and this is the whole concept of plots versus subplots right so like
the biggest everything's in favor of something so like a subplot will technically only be in favor
of its own subending but it would still be all the stuff we saw was all for the purpose of
that one payoff so uh again with the pink shoes thing it's like we can draw conclusions irrelevant
of our feelings from the standard of progression and that's that's what we're using the word to mean
irrelevant of how you feel essentially and that's as far as i'm aware the primary definition
essentially and then you'd be like we've added good onto it and i get that the the surefire way
to judge what good is is just how how much you liked it but we're using what i assume is
understood as the second definition sure each and a high standard or being high within a standard
yeah because i i don't think that lazy and inconsistent writing should be like held
equivalent to consistent writing where tons of effort was obviously put into making everything
makes sense logically you can have a writer who uh like they make a movie based off of the first
draft of a script or you can have a writer who redrafts several times and takes years
to master uh like to masterfully craft a story that is logically consistent that has a sure
it's like we're glad we live in a world where people think the lord of the rings is amazing
and the room is so bad it's good sure but again in that example where the people you know some
guy makes some bullshit in 10 minutes versus some guy who makes some bullshit in 10 years um that
that's an also and i'm not saying that you're saying this but that's also not a designator
quality yes yeah exactly yeah well for example it's when someone's if you say like this actor
disappears halfway through the film what the fuck's like he died it's like oh that sucks but it's
are we talking about the room when the actor disappears i'm just talking about a general
sense but you know it sucks the people will be like you can't just and i think that if i was
making a critique or something i would actually mention it because i think it would be fair to say
like there is a reason for it but it does damage the story regardless unfortunately that's just the
reality we're in with that happens well yeah i mean i i which is why i mentioned about episode nine
it's like jayjay's got a year to write a sequel to the fucking last jedi i just like i don't know
that you can even make a good but yeah he's gonna try good luck good luck to him because
i think it'll be pretty difficult because what i'm expecting is he's gonna rush out a story that
he had a basic idea for with with payoff cc's in his head and i'm gonna just say random shit here
but like you know ray defeats the ebra kylo sacrifices himself for ray he just has these
ideas and he's like how do we get there and he does a bunch of things and then we watch it and
we go wait that ship doing that thing in that moment that wasn't possible back in episode
and he'd just be looking you're like you're a fucking nude well i mean i don't know how far
we want to go into this discussion but i feel like fundamentally um starting the story off
with the first order being the uh oppressive power in the in the galaxy was already the wrong way to
start the story um i think you kind of just walk yourself when you do the same story over again
even after the universe is already shrunk with the emperor's death and vader's death
so i i feel like that was just instantly the wrong thing to do and yeah i was going to say we've
we've got a we've got another two videos to watch today and i've got to make sure we watch them
before we hit time where i'm not able to stupid youtube's actual eight hour cap might fuck us up
i have to leave in 30 minutes anyway thank you for having me on guys thank you this is this
is ministry yeah um i will pop your channel in the description so from what people saw if you'd
like to check them out or hit uh do you want to join i mean i i think it's fair to just
what do you do on your channel and uh why should people check it out i guess sure i do a critique
of games um i recently did a critique of black ops 4 where i spent 200 hours playing the game
and i laid out all my thoughts why though it had to be done uh recently or last year i i spent 600
hours playing siege and i tried to extrapolate all i could from that game um i do long form
game critique basically and uh you having fun with it oh yeah it's really fun especially
when i play games you actually like from that i agree yeah playing games you don't like is
shit what kind of games mostly shooters or sure um i've done about three big videos on shooters
before um i'd like to do some videos on you know third person shooters but um i feel like i am
pretty pretty burst in first person shooters i imagine if you can do first person shooters you
could do third person shooters just oh absolutely yeah yeah yeah thank you thank you for having me
on you guys yeah we'll uh we'll see around so we can uh talk more i enjoy this conversation
definitely man thank you peace guys see you later on efap is mean and terrible and horrible
okay we are the hate mongers of the toxic
surprised how many times we've covered a video and then the author will be in the chat um and i
say a lot of times as if it happens more than it doesn't it it happens less than it doesn't but
i just didn't expect it at all i guess i don't know well yeah you know that youtube is such a
big fish sorry youtube is such a big pond and there's so many fish in it that you wonder how
these one guys talking about my one video is something that you come to learn about you know
yeah somebody tells someone else who tells you who is interesting it definitely is interesting
you thought so how long have you got rex i got about 30 minutes well uh there's the invite so
the southpaw and yourself can jump back in if you want to uh we're finally covering just rights
video on objectivity and the funny thing will be the wolf isn't able to make it and rags will be
leaving soon yeah i did the best i could you guys a b team for tonight i'm gonna say enjoy
a load with b team now yo theo and theo two yes i think you guys are more than capable of handling
just right oh i mean theo is our actual guide for this so it'll be great theo all of the pressure
is on you every single piece of meaningful content in the stream has to come from you now
i have to keep my mouth shut in that discussion is there any bogging us down too long is there
any primer you'd like to give about any of this uh right so do you guys know who a manual count is
he is a real percent barely really stable isn't it cunt uh technically it's cunt uh you know i have
news right what what apparently wolf is available oh yes i always knew he was untrustworthy yeah
i should just not let him on due to the fact that he is a blatant liar
olive well yeah i guess this is a thing isn't it oh god we should be in singapore i'm so
there you go we're in singapore first off the server location in u.s south that the
u.s south is a fine place nope simple better so i i just have a simple question because i wasn't
able to listen to most of this um i don't know who the dude with the anime chick profile picture
was but why were people in the chat calling him i don't know who that is either why were people
in the chat calling him new j new j oh uh i didn't see that i guess because j was covered and then
j came on and the guy was you know friendly we covered this video i thought i thought it was
supposed to be like an insult or something it was like you never know with chair um you made it
just in time wolf you can probably see the link still in in this group chat to the watch together
we're about to start covering just right oh fuck with three hours into the delayed stream
ah son of a bitch i should leave now i don't know if i want to do this yeah sorry for interrupting
you theo what did you uh go ahead and carry on uh i didn't i don't honestly have a huge amount
to say in primer other than uh yeah can uh essentially get ready for the reading of a
wikipedia page of a book oh exciting and yeah for context this came out soon after um
all of the conversation started to rile up about objectivity in writing because holy shit hold on
hold on i'm sorry this is more important than just writing a video is this true j is actually
seeing the lord of the rings finally i didn't someone get his twitter i don't have i don't
have a twitter what's his twitter handle i'll google it i should have been at it if that's true
by now okay don't you lie to me i'm checking don't worry yes j xc oh that brought it up i was
about to type in add to j the faggot and hope that would brought something up but i should have
won that's a fan account uh i'm not seeing this this sounds like fake news um so all i know is
he recently uploaded a photo and i was going to tell you about this but yeah didn't want to
hurt your feelings yeah he was playing a lord of the rings like pinball game and he said this is
about the same as watching the movies right oh no i'm sorry i'm sorry
uh no pinball is not the movies christina you are correct
unfortunately j might not might not he might just not watch them at this point
simply despite wolf and us until we see him in person and you know clockwork orange him
watching them he may never do it or my theory was that he's actually seen them and he's just
fucking with us no he would no he would be so proud of himself he would want to let us know
and he would want to talk about the movie with all of us he's like yeah fucking air gorn hitting that
knife and yeah yimly was funny and he's seen the first one and he didn't even say any of that he
was just like yeah he wasn't he wasn't blown away by it and it's part of what upset literally every
person on this planet so uh wolf are you actually there are you dead now i think that he's killing
himself f press press the capital f button i suppose i mean i'm like actually play this video i
don't know if well yes you know you almost got you were on the cusp of being able to play this
video i was so i can add one more thing it's like a preface i guess i mentioned this before
we start the stream but again uh at this point the critique of judgment which is the book uh
by emmanuel kant that uh just right is gonna reference here is about 200 years old so who
here thinks that it has gone unchallenged in the field of aesthetics for 200 years
well if there's anything that i know about philosophers is that they love to agree with
each other all the time yep oh it's their favorite past yeah it's what's what they love
it's just a circle jerk in the philosopher community they definitely don't make their
entire living and reputation on disagreeing with each other for the dumbest or greatest reasons
well i'm i'm ready and willing to see just right just tear through all the fat and get
straight to the point and uh well we'll put f in chat it we'll we'll just we'll check out
the beginning at the very least i'm sure you'll pop back i'm ready so there's a particularly
flawed idea about media criticism that has gained a lot of popularity recently it's the idea that
we can judge art quote-unquote objectively it's a great start it's flawed i mean
i don't know i find that pretty agreeable that you can judge it objectively that focuses
if we go solely from the idea of uh uh what is you know there's this i don't think many
people disagree with the idea of being able to say what what is objectively like if someone said
you may have seen luke attack pylo while he was sleeping but when i watched the film he didn't
be like okay you won't find you won't find many philosophers or people for that matter
interested in debating the fact that facts exist yeah but uh i guess he said criticism so
well i like that he put objectively in the the really cliche font that every single movie in
the world uses whenever it is going to a new location like just imagine new york in this font
at the bottom left corner this screen it's the transformer is establishing shot font
do they do the whole like it comes up military style time began there is the game the cube
Autobots roll i was just like hey come on they poke him with a stick it's like we needed
seven more movies it's the idea that we can judge art quote-unquote objectively a kind of criticism
that focuses exclusively on things like plot holes and whether the events of a story make
strict logical sense the goal of this criticism is to establish that a piece of art is objectively
good or bad i find this position pretty damaging i i would say um it's probably more accurate to
identify if elements of the film are objectively good or bad whether or not you think that how
that affects the whole for you is much more debatable but once you can establish that an
element of the film is objectively good or bad we've got you anyways this whole stupid premise
here we don't do it to say to like point the finger at ryan johnson i mean we do but you know
we don't we don't do it just to point the finger at ryan johnson and say you're a faggot no we do
it because we want people to improve yeah that's the whole point and besides to help people avoid
these mistakes in the future yeah we want to enjoy star wars movies and in a world where the
last jedi is touted as an amazing star wars film will probably make star wars films in the future
be really shitty and this is where it gets complicated because poor filmmaking can't simply
be defined by poor writing because there's a lot of elements and we've even conceded that tlj has
some nice shots or acting or um set design characters like there's a there's a shit ton
of elements that come into filmmaking we agree and if everything is good except for writing can
you truly say it's poor filmmaking as a whole it's like not necessarily however all of those
additional elements are usually i i say usually because i'm trying to think of examples where
it's not the case they're all attempts to facilitate the story so they're tied to something
that originates in the writing uh and anything meaningful about a film's um something you can
draw out of it in terms of a lesson or um an idea it's probably from the writing rather than a
visual like a series of colors because at that point ow at that point you um you're advocating
for the idea that you would have just happily watched a fucking oil spill on the floor you'd
have been like yeah that was amazing and i drew lots of it it's like we usually have references
whatever you reference is typically going to be something that was drawn from the writing
as opposed to i just love how big godzilla is it's like okay that's fine also isn't he kind of
um overlooking the analysis of like contrivances and very convenient coincidences
used to solve problems in in art i think he would just say i think he's lumping that into
plot holes are typically worse than contrivances we probably put in the same umbrella yeah i i do
want to bring up his framing of the objective analysis there at the beginning saying it focuses
exclusively on things like plot holes and whether the events of the story makes sense
that's uh perhaps too reductive generally as far as i can tell you could be objective about
pretty much everything you're focusing on things that are tangible like what about like special
out of the work what like uh the scorpion king and the mummy returns is objectively bad cgi
yeah i guess you could say that i would want to uh seen the film i'd love to listen to the
qualifiers because for example bad cgi on or airbrushing for superman's lip is because it makes
his lip look like jelly which is by the standard of it's inconsistent with the rest of his fucking
face so you would avoid it's hard in the uncanny valley sure yeah i would like qualifiers but i
would totally uh be ready to agree with something like that or bad i find this position pretty
damaging to film discussions as a whole so today i'm going to see and i like that he doesn't take
the idea of like invalid strictly there his conclusion is almost damaging to film discussion
if there's anything we do on efap fucking discuss and the idea that according to him
it should damage our discussion significantly and maybe he would argue that that's what just
took place like an hour ago maybe it damages his position like the last time we had a discussion
with i don't know what you mean you know if he came out of that debate really strong you know
what's funny is i actually re listened to that debate a while ago and mauler when you were
describing to him the process of two people actually arguing about something uh like from
objectivity like one person saying it's objectively bad one person saying it's objectively good and
they have a discussion and a back and forth and then they like uh they both come away a little
more enlightened about the material that they were discussed they were discussing um it kind
of actually uh made me think oh you kind of predicted that mission impossible fallout debate
like a year before it happened because that's basically what we did yeah and we have to show
references we i could tell when he said that they didn't show the facial prosthesis thing i was like
we're gonna have to show him because he won't believe it if we just say it's true and like
i was actually talking about something far more substantive which was debunking the plot hole
thing and then he interrupted me and even though it's like i could just drop this and keep on
talking about why he was wrong about the plot hole it's like no you're wrong you're objectively
like you're factually wrong about this and so it didn't just for his credibility when he died on
that hill when it was like on the screen and he and he moved the goalposts like three times
like it wasn't there no it wasn't there long enough no it wasn't big enough it's like dude
the efap mask debate but yeah no that's that's the thing oh you can have an objective objective
for him that was objective it wasn't in the film because his information was faulty you couldn't
believe it's objective but that doesn't you know like he wasn't doing it based on his feelings he
lacked information that he required yeah it was it was an objective argument sure but it's it's
definitely like it was one that could be debunked absolutely and that's that's why i find the
conversation very interesting i i think i'm gonna reference once i finally get to making more of the
tfa thing the the fin one people like fin saying that uh the discussion whether or not fin should
have known that light speed was possible it is the conclusion these days is okay so he forgot for a
second what's wrong with that and it's like that's when you pretty much have given up when we have to
delve into the realm of absurdity yeah just stop just stop you'd think you would have told someone
about it because it's like when they find out it's possible they like blow it away it's like yeah
it's a pretty because even if you forgot for a moment is like he was with them for how long
yeah and and like major lee being like you know he was about to betray the resistance and leave
him it's like when the fuck did he join him i don't remember him signing up he just helped them
defeat the the death star but for his own reasons i don't remember him being like i'm a resistance
fighter now as opposed to a defected stormtrooper well you see no no the the definition of betray
is subjective you see because you can just redefine it to mean uh you're going up against
people that you were never with in the first place he probably i don't think he tried that
but he could have he could have been like well they thought he was on there well could have
that dude said that there can't be multiple definitions for a word isn't that fucking
insane i think i don't think he would have i don't think he stood by that
i think he gave up on that once we uh i don't know that was a weird thing for him to say
hmm bridging to film discussions as a whole so today i'm going to explain
all the many reasons there is no such thing as objective criticism in 20 minutes yeah man i'm
already regretting coming on this 20 minutes 20 minutes okay we can well we can do this
we can do this 24 hours show part one get there so i just want you to hold on to this one idea
before we begin the dark knight what's with the shitty paint net like drawings he keeps doing
substitutes it's a theme my god just use fucking video game footage please you know i i was i almost
actually said that with the last video instead of just random one second clips of actor close-ups
i'm like just play game yeah at least we could see a little i'd rather see someone wrecking
mordhau or something than just actor faces from i know it's weird because i know that just right
has shown his face before so he usually has film clips but he's not doing that this time
just hey mauler uh don't do this mauler can i quickly respond to uh go ahead uh can i quickly
respond to a super chat um so a guy named the love doctor 69 all day said hey there southpaw is it
true that you enviedo DM'd each other on discord and you shared what you said in private to laugh
at him on a stream without asking vito if so that's pretty crappy response so no vito did not
DM me uh he DM'd a guy named stephen and then uh he he was basically uh talking to stephen about
something which he got into an argument with about like with with wolf on wolf's stream
basically contradicting what he said um like privately so stephen messaged me and i told wolf
about it and then we decided to cover it and respond to it i don't think that that's crappy at all
and i i think it just it's not really even worth talking about much but i wanted to just quickly
uh the only thing that's crappy is vito's stream numbers
wow takes you 16 minutes to get one guy to type in the chat takes me three seconds before i'm even
clicking the go live button for like also to show up also vito and i actually like made up
our differences like months ago you know there was there was a funny uh back and forth that
we had on mauler's discord server uh someone uh tried calling him a cuck it autocorrected to duck
and then i i well that that turned into a meme i basically continued calling him a duck
and then he even embraced the meme laughs laughs were had and then we uh we made up
so it's not really an issue anymore this is just old old-ass drama well and uh i'm sure vito and
wolf will be best of friends eventually right wolf i mean when he like develops a functioning brain
sure so anyway thing as objective so anyway i have to go all right well it's been fun rag is
i'll catch you again for the next one i doubt i will be back but this is efap so maybe i'm not sure
i feel like we'll be pushing this one to the eight hour limit probably yeah i gotcha but i will be
gone for uh quite a decent amount so maybe i'll be back maybe not i guess we shall see very well
thank you for for coming in and around yeah yeah i'll catch you later toodles
what a massive it's going to take me quite a while to get there so i just want you to hold
on to this one idea before we begin the dark knight the movie every film bro keeps on a
shrine at his bedside has more plot holes than virtually any other movie you can name
he has apparently never heard of the dark night rises i was about to say what about the dark
night what about the last jedi which you deny having plot holes every time you talk about it
and who is Jurassic world falling kingdom and who cares Jurassic world one but we can just
name films all day he's wrong but i was gonna say like what about people who were like yeah it does
i still love it like you can who are we talking about here because i'd have to watch the film
again and listen to the arguments but off the top of my head i'm not 100 sure of what like all of
the plot holes are for the dark night any of you guys know of any just left top ahead he rattles
off a few a while down the line but i i would rather not spoil it for the for the chat if just
for the sake of redundancy what's a film bro that's his way of disparaging people who think
they're critics while they're not well so i'm assuming i'm assuming it's the the straw man that
the uh movie circle jerk subreddit likes to uh respond to man i used to like this dude's channel
like a lot i used to like your channel you see again it's very yeah i used to like my channel
too but now i realized i've never made a good video in my life and don't worry i'll be deleting
my channel soon episode 50 last time i'm here that's a very massive thing to say you're gonna
scare everybody also hi jay hi jay hi jay hi to jay wolf
all right just hold on to that real tight because we'll come back to it so first let's get the
semantics straight you can make objective statements about art okay star wars was written by
george lucas there are spaceships in it the main character is luke skywalker i'm glad he's
got that far at least and give him a gold star for that these are real facts
the no those are so those are like observations about like what's actually in the film but there
is no statement on whether they contradict any prior information i mean you could still even do
that you could be like uh you'd be objective i'm just saying that well i i'm saying that you can
do that i'm just saying that though like none of what he has said is doing that yeah well that's
why we've we've we were almost side because it's like yeah of course these things are things you
can it's like again it's non-controversial to agree on objective facts being present in media
facts you enter subjectivity the moment you make a qualitative statement about those facts george
lucas is a brilliant writer these spaceships are cool luke skywalker i don't think anyone's gonna
argue that i mean it depends like the funny thing is if someone said spaceships are cool
i'd be like hmm uh and you'd be like more is that an objective or subjective statement i'd be like
depends what you mean by cool and they go low temperature and then they find out from the fucking
information to the law books that the the ships run on a temperature that is lower in comparison
to any other ship they are they are a cool ship i'd be like i guess okay yeah i guess that's true
but if they were like oh they look cool i'm not sure is lucas being a brilliant writer
oh well also well also the thing with luke skywalker being well written if that's just
an opinion then why in the world do people teach writing about like how you need to give your
character goals and motivations and they need to be proactive and they need to have flaws and be
relatable and weaknesses the answer referred to that is that teachers only ever teach what they
believe to be good writing always subjective i do want to i do want to keep belaboring this
because again he's what he's just outlined outlined here is uh the fact value distinction
there is a big gulf between what is factual and what is valuable yeah no and i i get it right on
that distinction well like i said though that there are scenarios where we can actually create
scales that'll have values when we're simply talking about what is yeah it's a like i said
there are words for it i wish i remembered what i was talking about with glib like a year ago but
the um the degree to which a standard is achieved isn't always binary
oh yeah and the standard can you know and uh if we're talking about how much someone
likes something yeah of course it's like the fucking peak of subjectivity but oh value is
being used in like an alt sense here as in a film like a story ought to be internally consistent
um you understand what i mean yeah but um i don't know that you have in the same vein as
that uh writing that can't be read like i don't know that you have a story if it's inconsistent
to begin with because your story is now not a story because the story relies on it in the same
way that let's just take it to the extreme i just have the first five minutes of one film second
five minutes of toy story third five minutes of the dark night fourth five minutes of uh
you know fucking shindler's lists you'll just be like what is this garbage i can't follow
anything that's happening you know yeah because this isn't a story this is just a series of like
i can't even call them it's a clip show pretty much yeah i think you actually have to call it
a clip show and you know i'm sorry someone the chat asked if uh the guy the guy on the left being
theo if he was shawn oh god that's the third time this has happened before yeah we should
we should get you a pvc fap i've been on what an unfortunate thing to be we should get him to
really work on a shawn impression and then have him use the icon and say that we've got a special
guest shawn i don't know who shawn is you can like oh bless your heart well maybe you can like
pretend to be shawn and then you can say something like i'm a dumb faggot i like hate
black people you know i'll just say just say things lights of me on the internet hey it's not
going to be you it's going to be shawn i'm just glad that i'm compared to chris stuckman instead
of shawn i'll just yeah they compared me to this molar guy and uh and the other dude in this this
cool he's often referred to as like he's like wolf she's like what the fuck we have our own
blessed southpile i watched a chris stuckman video like a couple days ago and it was like the
dumbest worst shit i've ever seen how dare you which video okay that's hyperbolic but it like
it was a worthless video he didn't say anything at all oh so the whole thing oh wait were you
talking about the his 80 minute long shazam review yeah that thing was garbage oh no
it's like it's like southpile took it in a different joke way but wolf's like no i'm trying
to say this stuck with his shit like yeah i'm trying to say that you're the better stuckman
oh when you something like god you see this is the thing well so i'm not a mind reader okay
and i can't even do that i can't even be nice right it's okay episode 50 grand finale stop saying
that brilliant writer these spaceships are cool luke skywalker is well written these are what's
called opinions i know this is some simple stuff so far but if you have evidence to back them up
you dunce yeah so having one thing happen that is directly contradicting another thing
no longer is something that is like dependent on the person if that's how he defines how an opinion
works i like that he says though that if so for anyone who disagrees with this is essentially
not understanding something a child should it's like thanks just right i love how he had that
little pause where he was shifting through his papers just to say opinions in that condescending
way did be me saying or doing this this is what you call pepsi i thought you were going to call
him a retard or something oh what no did did you hear the the i did but i thought okay i just i
you've subverted my expectations that means you're no no if i was going to call him a retard i'd be
like this is what you call a retard you can't do that on live television as the idea i'm reacting
against is the all too common phrase this movie is objectively bad which presents an opinion as a
fact hmm i mean we kind of been over this in the first few hours yeah it really depends on what he
thinks objectively and bad mean we're not going to find out he means doesn't surprise me i don't think
the proponents of this idea will assert that the objective critic is only speaking i want to remind
people that he failed miserably to defend this perspective in a debate like and then he goes on
to say it's obvious i'm like that's interesting mr right that was like actually that produced
our very first meme it was before efap will potato made the uh curb your subjectivity video
or curb your objectivity i don't remember which one it was it was good shit yeah yeah sunrise
that was the first meme in the movie before the names facts of the matter while so-called
subjective critics only go ahead so the whole thing with him with him saying that this film
is objectively bad is an opinion um it can be backed up by facts so to say that this film is
objectively bad would mean that this film has that's what it was it has a it has a sum no no
that's okay it has a a sum of issues with it that are uh you could argue are substantive
and the um the number of issues that it would have and the size of them um because like stuff
like again the four guys walking away in the bathroom and fallout that's not much of an issue
but the disappearing knife is um so not not all you know what cinema sins we call sins
are are equal but um to say that a film has a giant number of issues with its writing and
um you know maybe special effects failures or whatnot or maybe the sound balancing is bad
maybe the dialogue is really bad um you know the the like take attack of the clones for instance
and the i don't like sand line um that's just like one example of really bad dialogue and attack of
the clones and it's littered throughout the movie so if you have a large sum of problems with writing
in your film and you come to the conclusion that therefore it is objectively bad it can be backed
up by an opinion and if your conclusion is wrong because you're not informed it can be disproven
so it's just he's he's saying that these are these statements are opinions but they are backed up
by facts um he might right he might consider that well founded as an opinion but still not
um an objective issue that that is uh i'd say it's like yeah you can make an extremely strong
argument for why something is an issue but then that does not make it objectively an issue that
does not make the thing that is not present uh objectively valuable remember he's evolved
as a critic us all have not that is true that is true he has evolved that's the best line he's ever
said that's the thing that got me to unsubscribe from him like what a condescending thing to say
i used to think like you until i evolved as a critic thank you you know what you know what
maybe maybe it's because he's older than you guys
he's got some it would be funny to find out if he was like 20 or something we were like oh
not actually and then we could be like oh just right i used to think like you but then i evolved
we were like no sorry i was never that retarded he's like what
like oh sorry the proponents of this idea will assert that the objective maybe looks around
speaking about the tangible facts of the matter while so-called subjective critics only talk about
their feelings but this is a false binary it's totally possible to no i would say subjective
critics that's an interesting label um i stand by what i said in the tfa stuff so that you often use
it as a escape hatch or a shield just like when you can't figure out why you didn't like a thing
with any basis in reference you just go it's just bad in my opinion
you're sitting there like i mentioned that that's already like a straw man we don't say that you
that subjective if you're going by this terminology quote-unquote subjective critics
only talk about their feelings i mean you can we'd be okay with that only by subjectivity
and you can still talk about other things other than how you feel about something yeah like well
they'd also be like they'd also be covering stuff like themes and whatnot like that's their
their main well not i'm not saying it's their main themes character arcs i mean you you can talk
about a majority a plethora of different things while still being subjective about it a great
example is high top so he opens with saying this is all his opinions all subjective leave him the
fuck alone like okay i don't like this film okay um i'm a big fan of spider-man comics i'm not a huge
fan of how they've adapted him i personally feel that it's blah blah okay uh peter never has any
consequence for things that happens in the film you're like oh you just crossed a line because
what you were saying before was all things that nobody can argue against because i i can't argue
to somebody they don't feel a feeling that's ridiculous but if you tell me that luke skywalker
isn't in the original trilogy i'll be like he demonstrably is you go okay no okay he's there
but he never uses a lightsaber i'm like he demonstrably does okay does this sound familiar
by the way with a certain mission impossible fallout discussion some things don't actually
come down to your opinion if you simply talk about your feelings that's absolutely fine with me
i have no issue with it whatsoever it doesn't typically make for a fantastic video beyond a
few minutes though because there's not a lot you can actually say once you've explained how you feel
and that's usually how videos start they'll tell you how they felt and then they'll go into
references for what made them feel that way and then they can typically get things wrong or right
for example i didn't like mission possible fallout because it's the first mission impossible that
doesn't show us how they made the masks like okay you did feel what you felt but it's based on
invalid information you fucked up speak entirely we're saying that it has a plot hole that he
totally makes up yeah the only the only way that you can actually disprove that someone actually
liked or didn't like a movie is mauler let's say that i'm messaging you saying i i really
hated shazam okay but then at the same time i'm messaging wolf and i'm saying by the way i'm just
fucking with mauler right now shazam is actually like really good and so then wolf could send you
the screenshots where i'm admitting that i'm not telling you the truth about my opinion but the
thing is there's no way to do that with these people and we all acknowledge that we're not
trying to invalidate their opinions we're not trying to disprove that they actually liked or
disliked a film we're trying to go over you know again whether it's actually well written or not
and again it's like when i when i made a review on shazam i wasn't trying to uh say you were wrong
for liking it you were uh you don't actually like it or you shouldn't like it or anything like that
i was going uh there's a ton of really bad writing errors in shazam and so i don't know
it's just yeah and i would actually pause it this is a bit controversial but i don't think people
watch uh reviews strictly for how people feel about the content as in you go oh let's watch
chris stuckman cover tlj and he goes i liked it and you go okay now jeremy johns i liked it no
now mauler i didn't like it oh that was a good day anyway i'll go to sleep now like no the
interesting part is usually how they construct the arguments what references they're using and
the information provided like i don't think i mean i'm probably wrong on this but i don't typically
tell you if i like or dislike something in my videos doesn't happen very often because i don't
it's just not necessary if i tell you something is inconsistent um then and then i move on or i
might say something like this can frustrate the shit out of audiences because i'm actually trying
to sort of not only be a little bit more engaging by flipping what i'm talking about but actually
trying to tie myself to the audience to be like oh he's not a robot he's not just explaining what
happens he actually does feel things too but i can use language that doesn't necessarily give away
how exactly i feel about a thing like we had that with uh i think it was just right i can't
remember which debate i was in where i was explaining an issue and then they were like
just because you don't like it i was like i didn't tell you if i like it or not
telling you that it exists it's what is do you guys want to know why i don't like chris stuckman
so because he doesn't make good content well so let me give you a tangible example mauler uh in
the beginning of the stream i mentioned that i was watching saccario uh and i was enjoying it so far
implying that i haven't seen it before because i haven't seen it before but i had seen saccario
too why did i see saccario too well because i didn't realize it was uh actually the second
movie and i watched chris stuckman's video on it and he had given it an a-minus and so i went and
saw the film and like i didn't have to i didn't necessarily have to see the first one to understand
what was going on but i didn't understand what was going on anyways because it was a bullshit story
and so to see him give uh saccario an a-minus whereas i know that if i had watched someone
that cares a lot more about the exact types of things that i care about when watching a movie
i'm uh i'm more likely to you know talk to agree with them i'm and then i don't trust
chris stuckman anymore because the standard of quality is shit i've never he oh he's he's the
quintessential bland reviewer he reviewed hill house in four minutes joe frustrating that is
like and you might be like but more he could have said he's like no no four minutes short bad bad
how fucking review hill house in a meaningful way in four fucking minutes and it gets even worse
because you watch the video and he spends loads of time talking about the person who made it
he's like the person who made it made this i like this the person who made it made this and this is
gonna see it's like fucking two how the fuck are you doing it was it was it was really bad and you
look at him covering other things and you'll spend like three times that amount of time on
like a random movie like oh and you might be like well hey it's his prerogative he can review
whatever he wants and i'm like yeah it just makes for a shitty you think reviews don't have standards
you think that a review should just be anything and it's all up in the air this is the part that
they really don't like and you could say this about me i don't agree that i can't take criticism but
whatever people say it anyway the um the idea that they rip movies to shreds and then you're
like your video is very bad at explaining and they go hey hey it's my video and then you know
it just slips out it's just my opinion no no no no no no stop it um we're all conduits right
but everything is as it is and we're all here to be able to point things out support things that
like all of us could technically make the same video it's technically possible i suppose other
than we don't have access to the same voices but i could feasibly create wolfs if wolf releases a
video i could recreate it it's just the voiceover would be different like i could get all the same
footage to a decent degree and i could just copy a script over um again we're all conduits we're all
particularly good or particularly bad at different things we all have our limitations and we all have
our biases and getting rid of the things that get in the way of being um you know really strong with
clarity is part of what i think makes um a review stronger because when you give people false
information there's a lot of negative results that can that can come from that i don't think
we need to reference them but i think you already did once it's it's not it's not that his uh
like he's he's never able to spot a good movie like he praised mission impossible fallout so
obviously he can recognize a good movie when he sees one but man i mean he's a little too
inclusive with uh what he considers to be a good movie and i think if like you need to be able to
i was about to say like i've never really experienced a stuckman video where he's explained
himself he uh i watched his blade runner review with friggy it's so funny he basically explains
that he kept watching the film until he liked it because he didn't get it he was like why can't i
like this film everyone says it's amazing and he just says it's really embarrassing to watch he's
just like i just kept watching it and you know what i'm starting to like it like what the fuck
i the uh other day i watched his review on uh your name because i heard about it and i was like oh
this looks interesting and his whole review can be summarized as it is an anime it was made by a
guy who made these other anime it was good and i was like wow so insightful i learned so much from
you and yeah so you need to watch them all the months i don't actually think you have to watch
i could probably get a better response from the chat chat tell me if your name is good so i can
like make a judgment if i should waste my time with it i trust the chat more than i trust
fucking chris stuckman i don't think he requires multiple viewings to understand i don't
necessarily i think it would benefit to watch more than once but he watched it way more than twice
he was explaining like he kept watching it until he finally saw what other people saw
or something like that and i just we found it amusing because doesn't it break his entire
reviewing scale if he concedes that he only saw the value of blade runner after many viewings
and then chooses to judge other films after one like wouldn't you say well well chris that seems
like you've kind of skewed everything but just because of the reputation of blade runner that
doesn't seem fair accidentally fuck up the actual name hold on i think it might have been your name
and i've said my name your name yeah no i'm sorry i mean your name if i if i start talking about my
name well i gotta i gotta know the chat has better opinions than chris stuckman
yeah i think it's like sometimes it looks like people are actually able to get it though so
it's fine i don't know i mean some some movies you can tell from a first glance that they're
shit like transformers two or suicide squad but others like it for me at least it took me it took
me a while to fully understand how bad shazam actually was because the first time i watched
it i was just enjoying the the jokes and the comedy because that part of the movie is genuinely
pretty good and then once you see it multiple times and the novelty of the jokes wears off you
just have the story left and the story and the writing is shit so um and if i had if i had
reviewed mission impossible fallout after only my first time seeing it i wouldn't have been able to
give like an in-depth perspective of it because there's a lot of stuff that um you would have to
catch on repeat viewings or you know like little little details or um you have to spend some time
thinking about the story and analyzing the plot and trying to find holes in it and then realizing
oh shit there's like there's no inconsistencies here it's it's just an a-plus story um so it's
weird for chris duckman to yeah to with one movie he sees it a couple of times it has his opinion
on that change but then for every other film he reviews it after only seeing it once that's a
little bullshit and yeah it's a necessity for me when i'm like reviewing the thing and i'm like
oh this thing didn't make sense because say for example fucking fin says that he's aware of it
and i'm like wait did he say that i think he said i'm gonna have to rewatch it because i can't go on
a lot of the time i can't make a judgment based solely on the fact that i remember it being that
way feels like it's just poor research on my part at that point yeah you know and it's enough for a
lot of people to be like hey man it's just my perspective it's like okay well you got something
wrong you agree and you get to that awkward place where they're like
um
motionlessly about the themes of a particular work
for instance i could say that the original star wars film is about why nature is superior to
technology and i could point to the climax where i can't i can't help but think of uh shazam
directors uh like at the end of the um of his video where he goes yeah yeah yeah yes
there is such a thing as a stronger and a weaker interpretation
if you're gonna think about that and this is your reference then you're gonna need more than that
yeah my interpretation of this app is that this is an obscure right-wing podcast
trying to don't you've got a lot of references for that the dog whistling through star wars
analysis stop them think of the children uh yeah so the idea that you can interpret anything
anyway at all and then when i say in my video that if you want to say that the themes are like
fantastically consistent because they all match the way that you see everything in the film
when it completely flies in the face of all the objective references like yeah at that point you
just you it's entirely subjective what you consider that theme and people took that as
you see if you don't agree with him you're being subjective i was like that's not what i said but okay
the fact that you consumed a piece of media has to count for something
like the the interpretation comes from the piece of media otherwise why do we need the
media itself well he's about to argue right why don't we just do the interpretation and
who needs the media he's about to argue that all of his references are gonna be from the media
isn't he yeah weak references that's the thing technology and i could point to the climax where
luke puts away the targeting system and embraces the force and that doing so helps him defeat the
technologically superior empire except he uses technology to defeat in in the shape of a fucking
missile yeah and yeah then we bring out that reference okay that interpretation probably
doesn't hold much weight a missile coming from an x-wing no less yeah it's it's not it's pretty
flimsy with that reference embraces the force and that doing so helps him defeat the technologically
superior empire nowhere in that analysis have my emotions factored in but i haven't described an
objective quality of the film either i've used evidence from the text to support a position
and he used extremely flimsy evidence i was gonna say yeah you've got one reference you got one
reference that it's faulty so you gotta do better than that process i've revealed something about
my subjective perspective but someone else could say this why did you need subjective the said
perspective but no my objective perspective scene isn't really about nature versus technology
it's about atheism versus religion the rebels what what what the fuck no it's not if we cut
him some slack right if we have a charitable here how do those two things conflict with each other
is it not possible to draw both meanings out mutually without either like i mean i'm i'm
kind of on his page in that you can uh ignore elements and pick out elements to reach
conclusions you want to but that's part of my issue with analysis when you're not being honest
with yourself i i don't think he's trying to claim the like through interpretation you're
describing you are talking passionately uh but you are but you're also not describing
objective qualities of the thing which i don't know maybe is the case but interpretation like
precede precedes the assessment you can't say something until you've interpreted it some way
i'm sorry is the implication here that the empire are atheists and that religion defeated
the evil atheists even though the empire uses the force which is part of the whole well it's
gonna wait for it to qualify because i think it's i don't think it'll hold yeah it's not like this
is you know god's not dead where there is overtly a religious versus atheist theme well it's the
thing i wish he would pick ones that are actually you know supported so i could be like oh yeah
yeah no that's fair but someone else could say the scene isn't really about nature versus technology
it's about atheism versus religion the rebels won because luke had faith while the empire lost
darth vader did too though you idiot but i think yeah his clients because they they're like scorned
darth vader yeah but that's one person in the collective that's not all of them that that's
the point he realized darth vader and his master were the ones that made the empire in the first
place this is so dumb it's yeah it can't really be compared to religion because religion is not
falsifiable or provable but you've got darth vader like vader is a bad guy he's forced choking
a dude in front of like a bunch of witnesses like 15 guys it's not like they think this isn't a real
thing that's happening look at this guy played along with vader just trying to spook us
references not doing him any face this is what i mean it's all falling apart immediately
could you imagine if like the clouds split and you see mount ellipus and then zeus
fucking chucks a lightning bolt down and wipes out captain marvel and then you have you kind
of have to go okay apparently greek mythology exists in the mcu now i mean norst does so
could you could you imagine like someone walking away from that though and still not believing
in any of that all right well that's the thing i get this isn't making any sense you can't draw
this line when he's like see these guys don't believe it's like they're talking to vader he's
on their team too how do you and they're watching him force choke this dude like if anything this
scene has destroyed their assessment that it's a fucking hokey piece of shit it's about atheism
versus religion the rebels won because luke had faith while the empire lost because they belittled
religion your sad devotion vader's on their team into that ancient religion apparently
Greek mythology does exist in the marvel comics well okay that's beside the point but not not just
not just on their team he's like one of their leaders he's like what number three you've got
vader then grandma tarkin and then the emperor but grandma tarkin come before vader though
no well it's implied that grandma tarkin has yeah if you take it all as it is grandma tarkin
has control over the death star so i'm guessing that vader is under his control while there but
he's still extremely high ranking because i'd have to actually i'm pretty sure grandma is an
actual thing right yeah vader strikes me as some kind of paramilitary thing well tarkin tells
vader to let the man go in this very scene so he has some it's either authority or vader just has
enough respect for him to yeah i would i would say it's probably both he probably has jurisdiction
here uh talking so okay so he's fine vader is number two he let's say that he's number two not
number three big big fucking difference but it's like yeah not just on on their team he's one of
their leaders the empire does not belittle religion well i can't believe the guy above vader is the
emperor it's like this is the evidence and it's like of the team where the two top ranking
fuckers are using the religion fully like i don't understand how this makes any sense stolen data
tapes are giving you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fort we've come to two slightly
different readings of the same film and neither of them is objective they're because neither of them
stupid this is all besides the point i was about to say i'm not sure he's using those words correctly
because okay so i all we've got here so far is that yes interpretation precedes assessment isn't
interpretation inherently non-objective as in because you can only support an interpretation
as best as you can well interpretation is a part of viewing uh because has to go through your eyes
through your brain and then you process meaning from it that yeah yeah that's kind of what i'm
in your head and so and then put things back like the idea that tlj was the whole failure can be the
greatest teacher i can say that they failed to achieve that and you could be like what do you
how do you know that that's what they were trying to achieve it's like because they were fucking
overt about it it's it's in the text itself there's no interpretation required for the overall lesson
that's trying to be delivered theme he said it but there are multiple interpretations you can have
that don't have any kind of overt message that ryan johnson could then in turn be like
yeah but again this goes both ways you can actually have a very valid lesson supported by
a shit ton in the film that the director was completely unaware of it wouldn't necessarily
make it invalid it's just that interpretation will have supporting references and when you're
just right you just make them up and you're like oh fuck they were like directly contradictive in
the single reference i even had anyway go on uh i've lost my train of thought i had i think i wanted
to say uh about interpretation uh nah it's gone it's all good i guess move on it'll come back
maybe we've come to two slightly different readings of the same film and neither of them
is objective they are steeped in the perspectives of whoever believes them to be true and both of
our hypothetical critics here could use their analysis as a reason to claim that the movie
is well made and they would be speaking just as subjectively as someone claiming it is well
oh well at that point they wouldn't necessarily be subjective in that conclusion if they'd claimed
a standard and then they adhered to it one to one with whatever's in the context of the film
they would be operating objectively with a subjective standard displayed so but like you
then you'd be like well the standard would still be subjective and that's that's a whole
different conversation it's like two different uh levels to the discussion
and i actually find it very interesting to talk about but the idea that they couldn't be
objective when judging from this format is wrong because he presented the idea to us the panel
and we just determined that he's inaccurate we didn't have to have like an emotional connection
to it we didn't have to care about the idea of religion versus atheism to be like well whether
or not this is valid can be supported by references blah blah we could be objective about it we've
concluded that he was wrong like immediately yeah because interpretations are weak yes well
made because your plot makes logical sense they are opinions based on evidence that are held up
to a personal standard very fucking weak evidence can i also point out that this is uh this is
different from an assessment this is a reading for the sake of an interpretation to determine
what meaning is being communicated yeah it's not actually attempting to assess whether or not
anything's malfunctioning within the world like off topic almost he probably thought he was so
smart coming up with these and he was like man people never thought of any of this like you know
no one in their right mind thought of this but this lands us in a bit of a pickle that is a
sticking point for a lot of people if all value judgments are subjective he how do we know what's
true he he used the pickle rick animation there because he has a very high iq which you need to
understand this reference right here i just i just like the how do we know what's true it's like oh
no we're getting super philosophical very how do we know what's true doesn't that make everyone's
opinion equally valid i mean why can't we just agree on a standard of quality and then judge
everything against that wouldn't that be objective because well yeah you make it really difficult to
do anything don't you you have to argue about shit from a really stupid perspective so we have to
have a stupid argument these are questions that plagued two 18th century thinkers most respond
you know what's funny about his two ideas of people searching for themes in star wars is they
almost sound like straw men that uh a like a worst version of us would make up to bash
the subject of us and argue against and he thinks it for us pretty much
this is the fun part because now humans can't they're gonna get involved you should yeah
questions that's plagued two 18th century thinkers most responsible for how we think
about this today david hume and ammanuel can't oh god he's starting to beat music this is where
it gets serious historically speaking thinking that you can judge art objectively is not entirely
unheard of too many ancient and medieval thinkers the idea of beauty being located in an object was
a very popular position it was as objectively true to say that a rose is red as to say that it is
beautiful but it depends on what you mean by beautiful uh a lot of people now i was talking
about beauty i was about to say that uh a standard of beauty that a lot of people
either reference or consider valid is symmetricality like in a face and you'd be like that doesn't
determine whether or not they're beautiful it's like well no but they're saying that the face is
symmetrical and you know that that's that's something provable we can actually measure it
so you know like that would be into subject based on people yeah your your left eye is not horribly
out of proportion with your right eye which you know allows you to not look that much like
quasimodo it's just i don't know yeah and whether and whether or not that is this is what i mean by
like the standard can be judged objectively we can actually get there but whether or not that is a
standard that everybody should employ is another conversation or whatever but again that's when you
start to you'll be like oh so then everything's subjective and it's like not necessarily depending
on how we created labeling in the first place like what is like i found it interesting that
our guest earlier was like you can't say something is objectively a planet but you can say it's
objectively a rock hmm interesting i mean yeah i guess that someone could have a beauty standard
that would allow the lady from matagascara which i assume is what wolf's profile picture
is beautiful yeah she's she's gorgeous
i saw it in a thumbnail today you know i was like if i can make it to the show i have to use this
you see i was i was first thinking of asking if that was a photoshopped version of roz from
monsters inc and uh no no it's the lady from from the matagascara movies i choose to interpret it as
like the older version of eric taxon speaking of which i don't think we we talked about it on the
show mauler have you ever mentioned that time that eric was like sobbing and quinton was just
standing there i was only uh i was only told about it i've got no reference for what actually
happened um it was what i do know is that cj covered it on his podcast and uh he pissed off
eric significantly and eric has called him a liar about all of it um and i think it's due to the due
to the context that he shaded in as in cj said that he had heard x from person and then shaded
and then eric was like that's not how it went down um so they've got their own beef going on but
yeah all i know is that apparently eric was crying and quinton wasn't doing anything about
it but eric says said something like quinton wasn't supposed to be doing anything about it
so are you guys i'm just saying i would absolutely kill to have a picture of eric crying
like that would actually make my entire life better so are you are you telling me that eric
taxon might actually be spider-man i don't think i think he's older than 15 oh right 19
he's yeah and besides you know he could be spider-man from into the spider-verse oh
but i was gonna say black wouldn't it no wouldn't be peter b parker wouldn't he not be spider-man
though if he was he cried wouldn't he wouldn't that definitively make him not spider-man
wolf would make him a good spider-man guys that that's not ammo i would have i don't even want
to use it as ammo myself i just want to like hang it on my wall and like shuffle every time i see it
also yeah i i read a couple things i have no idea why he was crying uh i didn't see anything
for y but but apparently friendship over for him and cj if they had one most like rip it's
i just love it like i love like the idea of cj just walking it just do minding his own business
and then he like glances out of the corner of his eye eric like sitting on the ground cross-legged
and crying and then quinton's just like standing around with his hands in his pockets looking like
he doesn't know what to do he like that he like kicks eric and he's like stop it oh that image
in my head is like the most beautiful thing i think i've ever seen yeah tried to see from
what i understand the image was told about it he didn't see it himself the image the image in your
head wolf does it include running mascara anyway no but i could interpret that published of the
standard of taste which relocated beauty to the eye of the beholder beauty is no one's gonna draw
it now oh my god bayouin bayouin making my dream come true i swear to god i will print it off
and i will hang it on my wall above my computer and i will take a picture of it and i'll show
it on the next defap so wait make your specifications clear you have to make it so that eric is
cross-legged on the ground crying and quinton is standing right next to him with his hands in his
pockets staring a little off into space like looking kind of nervous doesn't know what to do
so cj the background of the telescope
kind of like the people in that collider clip where they're just like trying to
to not acknowledge what's happening and they're just sort of staring off and you know ignoring
the the tism that's taking place collider clip collider live oh i don't know what that is well
for you there for that i can't remember it was you talking about the the meltdown thing yeah
over over the oh the one where the dude was like yes oh the guy who was like i don't get to go to
this thing so therefore yeah and you've got like three other people there who are just like very
awkwardly just oh yeah i remember the two at the at the head of the table that were like looking
at their phones and we're like that one lady trying to go oh yeah i like that you did that
catch me outside how about that reference trying to save it and then it just goes back to the
meltdown oh fantastic um and also i don't care if eric like uses that as a means to say look at how
mean wolf is it's like okay eric let's talk about that video you made where you lied about
me for like 20 minutes he still says the he keeps saying nobody has shown me where i have
taken him out of context we know it's because he's a fucking idiot he did it definitively
on the efap when uh was it the efap where i was fucking ripping into jack's like lies for hours
i think we did we covered you as well briefly on how how we took you out of context i think we
clarified i hope you cry for the rest of your life also uh i mean there wasn't there a whole
video of his that you guys covered like when wolf returned from his hiatus yeah well yeah yeah so
there's that too there's like eric the amount of care i have for your feelings is equivalent to
the amount of brain cells in your empty head oh i might have it blished of the standard of taste
which relocated beauty to the eye of the beholder relocated beauty to the eye of the beholder
what does that mean so i guess that he means that there is no such thing as objective beauty
that all comes down to the idea being that beauty is no like it is not a quality of the thing in
itself it has to be formed in perception beauty is no quality in things themselves it exists
merely in the mind which contemplates them and each mind perceives a different beauty one person
may perceive deformity where another is sensible of beauty uh i think deformity could definitely
be defined by relation to what standard human genome presents as a standard human body there
would be a difference isn't isn't a deformity by definition in abnormality as in whatever is not
normal yes defined by what's most common so this is this is something that can be objectively
measured difficulty is being used like an opposite of beauty here it's seeing you so let's say let's
say it says ugly yeah yeah i mean does this guy does this guy not actually think that a rose can
be objectively beautiful because like if you're trying to compare two different flowers to each
other like there are okay let's take a rose that's dead versus a rose that's not dead one is
objectively beautiful and one is not why are we really going to argue this
i can't so i can't all right admittedly i can't really qualify that myself i would typically
avoid using the word beautiful uh because as far as what is the standard definition for beautiful
i'm pretty sure it's actually entitled to feeling right how is it defined pleasing the senses like
what can you yeah i can't so we're stuck there regardless of uh any particular definition it
carries connotations of like aesthetic satisfaction that's true the interesting thing to it is that
the second usage is of a very high standard so fair enough if someone well this is this
almost supporting your point if someone was to say it is beautiful objectively and then i go no it's
not and then he says well by beautiful i mean that it is 100 symmetrical like i said as a standard
i could be like oh okay but that's not how i use beautiful and then he's like okay fine that's how
i use it i'd be like okay i think the only time i try to vaguely invalidate someone's saying like
i said earlier about the you know this shoe is a car i'd be like that's just not at all how anyone
has ever used that way you're just making that shit up yeah well i'm also it's like um if you try
to compare a rose to a different kind of flower um like a lily or a tulip um and you try to say
that a rose is objectively more beautiful than uh than a tulip i think that's where you go into
like subjective territory i don't think there's a way to really objectively prove that a rose
uh like at the peak of its beauty is at the uh or or life rather um is objectively more
beautiful than a tulip at the peak of its life i think that's a that's a matter of personal
preference whereas there is a standard for what a rose should look like again like you know it um
like one that's not dead versus one that is dead right um so that's that there's a standard for
what you could call beautiful there but when it comes to what's more beautiful it's kind of
difficult it's also kind of like trying to compare uh michael angelo's um uh david sculpture to
the um the sistine chapel i just this is the whole point of discussion so i just have to find
out what the person's actually saying and if i told you the uh x is beautiful then you go what
do you mean i go it's pleasing to my eyes well then yeah that's entirely subjective pleasing to
your eyes like what am i going to do about that like i can't there's no way for me to know what's
pleasing to your eyes unless you explain some kind of like consistent set of things and that's that's
how people look at all film criticism it's like all of it's just pleasing to you so nothing else
beyond that and like well not true i think at this point it's important to make clear that we're in
the realm of philosophy so we're using the philosophical usage of objectivity being
irrelevant of human uh thought on the matter the thing as it is which is a lame way to use that
word because it's like oh it's a very important way to use that word no i know but it's really
important it's irrelevant of of the human it's like but everything we do is from is
we're filtered for everything right everything we say do and conclude is all filtered through us
anyway well yeah also i i would just like to drop any pretenses of me being that deep of a thinker
when it comes to philosophy because i i don't do much thinking on philosophy so i'm going to let
carry it from here i want to also say that i'm not a deep thinker at all i'm actually an idiot
so it's okay you're not well you know so don't expect intelligent thoughts coming from my head
thinking is subjective anyway so i don't really know what to say
and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment without pretending to regulate those of
others oh you sweet summer child if you had only lived to see youtube for hume you need a
perceiver to exist for beauty to exist but of course this creates the problem we're running
into if everything is subjective then how can we make any truth claim about a piece of art hume's
answer is in the title taste basically people can improve their taste over time and make well
founded judgments that we can trust strong sense united to delicate sentiment improved by practice
perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this
valuable character so creating a standard that's defined and improved over time i'd
be curious what improved would mean at that point though shrug uh just strikes not going to tell us
because he doesn't spend much time with him he just gives us this brief account of his wikipedia
page and then moves um is this is this uh kind of implying that beauty can only exist
or quality maybe could even could only exist if there is someone there to observe it
essentially yes beauty exists as something within the eye yeah beauty is in the eye of the whole
there i guess so i i really hate to uh send us on this tangent but um so let's say that there is an
event that causes the entire world to go deaf um and we have what does that what i'm sorry there
there was just a thing me and mauler have seen recently that yeah it's not death it's not death
it's okay everyone goes everyone goes mutilated yes okay so then um sorry uh so what does that
do to beethoven's music does that mean that beethoven's music is no longer beautiful just
because there's no one there to listen to it anymore or uh does the music that beethoven
composed have a timeless quality to it where it will always be beautiful whether there are people
there to listen to it or not at that point i challenge you to show me the inherent beauty
value in it
i mean i would have to think a little longer on that but sure we could if we could try to
go over that one day i just don't i have sorry i know i keep coming back to this but that it's one
of the big ones is objective value is the value isn't value is not necessarily to actually come
back to saying if a if a tree falls in the woods does it make a sound if no one's around to hear it
uh kind of basically that's dealing with matter of fact rather than matter of value right because
beauty has opposed to because beauty implies a thing is desirable so we need to we need a way
for this thing to be objectively innately desirable maybe instead of beauty i should say
rather it's well composed right as opposed to uh chopsticks okay take take moonlight sonata
versus chopsticks you've heard chopsticks i'm sure right nope you know the the piano
song chopsticks is like super super simple oh i thought you meant like i'm afraid i thought
you meant like actual chopsticks it's no it's it's the musical equivalent to drawing stick figures
it's like the easiest thing to do on a piano oh so i can do it yeah basically so like i'm
just going over like fuck that up too though like maybe the word beauty is the wrong word to use
here but i think that uh Beethoven's music is always going to be well composed even if there's
no one around to listen to it maybe how do we arrive at that i think that it's just because
you know well while it was being observed um we agreed that it was well composed like
you're unanimously but i would need someone to argue that it's not well composed
so it's based on the agreement of people
not necessarily you'd have to have people arguing uh two different points and having to
uh qualify their statements i'm just like i'm just going you're noticing how this is dependent
on the people yeah uh the i'm i'm just interested in all of this statement because all of it needs
strong sense united it's like stop what is strong sense yeah united to the delicate
sentence what do you mean united to do you mean presented by sentiment and then what kind of
delicate sentiment what does that mean improved by practice what is improvement and i was just like
just rising gonna go to any of this so we may as well kick on because yeah there's not a lot
we have to do here other than speculate on things that aren't even just right points so we're gonna
have to wait for hey we're actually five minutes in that's that's more than i expected i can give
you small amounts of background on him like he was a hardcore empiricist and skepticism so like
shit is the idea that sense data is the thing for knowledge for the most part so the idea that uh
beauty is in the eye holder is probably typical of him but you know we're not going to get any more
from of the standard taste in this video so you'd have to wonder of spending exactly a minute
on a book uh is not a great idea well theo the here in his defense long critique is not deep
critique i see what's the thing a lot of people greatly approve of this video and i already knew
it was just like he's not gonna fucking qualify anything he's just gonna it's just gonna be a
reaffirmation of what people already thought it's all subjective well in the words of wilbo
shakespeare's brevity is the soul of wit and by the way if you look up the full quote of that in
context you'll notice that it's part of a much longer line of dialogue but let's not let's not
address that i uh that was in my that i put it on screen but the in my tfa part one i said h
bomber guy has gotten that criticism and i put his defense on screen and his defense involves
the fact that in context it's like a self-aware statement as in he's very much taking his time
to make a point so like it's it's just whatever it's such a fucking catchphrase for people though
and the joint verdict of such wherever they are to be found is the true standard of taste and beauty
so hume's answer is we can't know what's good for sure but we can get pretty close by listening to
an expert and that anyone can become an expert with practice it's also better if we listen to
critics as a whole instead of just one person because by joint verdict he means that critics
tend to come to a consensus on great art over time basically since great pieces of writing tend to
withstand the test of time the fact that they have been well regarded by so many critics in so many
times and places functions like an objective standard making it uncontroversial to say that
hamlet is an excellent play for instance it's sort of like polling data a few decades later and
yeah see and that's where i would i would be disagreeing just because a lot of people say
it it's it's good wouldn't line it up but um yeah i was i wasn't trying to to argue um arguments and
add populum earlier when it came to Beethoven i'm just saying like i think that you'd have to have
two people that were um trying to quantify their arguments for why Beethoven would be good or bad
um well you know yeah like like like like Mahler once said in the the mission of apostle
fallout debate he would be stalwart in defending a certain scene making sense even if um everyone
else in the call were out numbering him and saying that it didn't make sense yeah i completely get
where you're coming from it's just that again the fact value distinction is the first big
what is one of the big bumps in the road for an objective assessment so when we're trying to reach
our objective assessment we need to bridge that that's that's one of the first things we need to
of course Emmanuel Kant was a little disappointed by Hume's essay thinking that he hadn't gone far
enough to solve our problem in 1790 he published The Critique of Judgment a landmark and enormously
influential book that tried to get as close as possible to figuring out how we perceive the world
around us and i mean how we perceive the entire world around us Kant isn't just talking about art
here and is actually trying to find a way to describe why art is different from just about
every other kind of object we encounter so i'm i'm not going to read all this out because
Kant doesn't write because that would be work i'm not i'm not gonna actually go through the text
is this such a like limp video you know it's horrible like a regular human but instead like
a computer describing math equations but what he says here is that taste is inherently subject
okay friend i'll just take your word on that yeah i was gonna say that's a really great video just
uh what he says is sort of this um Kant said tastes subjective so it is also depending on
what you define as taste i might agree with that statement i think most people would depending on
what you mean by taste yeah i don't i think it's relatively uncontroversial to say taste is person
to person it's a subjective thing objective when we feel pleasure or pain when looking at something
it has nothing to do with that object it is taking place within our own minds the essence
of subjectivity now as Kant often does he splits things into categories when you experience pain
or pleasure the object responsible for that belongs in one of you can safely ignore the
sublime for the purposes of this discussion since it alone would be its own hour-long video okay so
three categories there's the agreeable the beautiful and the good the main difference
between them is based on which we desire let's say you're starving and a man offers you food
because you need the food you're in no position to judge how it tastes you can only say that it is
agreeable like what so the agreeable is that which like satisfies a function yeah well the
good is more about functionality the the agreeable is that which satisfies the food would be functional
rather than uh gourmet or exquisite wouldn't it sorry how do you mean so to be functional to
satisfy a function being the food satisfies hunger like any any said you wouldn't quarrel
about taste it's like yeah it would be functional so wouldn't that be the functional
i suppose so but that's that's not quite what he's getting at the idea is that
like you file something under the agreeable when it's not when it's not specifically serving a
function like a hammer it's not serving a specific almost like sort of i don't know like you put a
book behind your head to weigh yourself uh prop yourself up as opposed to a pillow yeah like the
book is agreeable full and the good the main difference between them is based on which we
desire let's say you're starving and a man offers you food because you need the food you're in no
position to judge how it tastes you can only say that it is agreeable likewise our judge you can
still judge how it tastes i'm confused with this analogy yeah i'm calling bullshit on that one of
the worst things about this video is it's a horrible account okay so um compare uh let's say
have you guys ever had five guys or um in and out is there anyone here that knows what a burger
like okay right um shit fast food is always thing yeah it like basically well okay those would
actually be considered very high quality as far as like um fast food goes and comparing that to
something like mcdonald's i'm trying to compare like a like a low quality food to a similar but
high quality food like the one that actually does taste better and it's it costs more money because
there's higher quality ingredients that are being used you know for instance mcdonald's freezes
their meat and five guys does not and so um that does affect the taste of the burger right and
makes the five guys burger taste better and so you are if you have the money to like if you if
you're a millionaire you're not going to go to mcdonald's you're going to go to five guys if that
is an option yeah i'm just like all i was saying was this analogy is really strange and i think
i'm going to be able to understand what he's trying to say he's just doing it really poorly
if i try and put it really simply the agreeable is like a purely it's purely a sensory judgment
that's all it is it's it's a sensory judgment of satisfaction of a desire there's nothing
more to a particular this particular category of judgment but he's not going to spend much time
with the desire let's say you're starving and a man offers you food because you need the food
you're in no position to judge how it tastes you can only say that it is agreeable likewise our
judgments of what is good are also prejudiced by our desires we want things that fulfill their
function so we say that they are good if they do but when we look at something like a flower we can
call it beautiful because we don't need it for a specific purpose it's an unbiased judgment
there's another important distinction between the agreeable and the beautiful and it helps us solve
part of the problem of total subjectivity things that are tied up in the idiosyncrasies of our
senses can never be anything more than simply agreeable you may find the color purple agreeable
i prefer blue and there's no conversation that we can really have there our senses just like
different it probably is actually it's just we're not capable of it yet like there probably is
wait wait wait hold on he's comparing the um so he's comparing uh different colors to um comparing
an egg to a rose isn't that a little strange like this kind of this whole thing is strange
because you can't you can't compare a you cannot say that a rose is objectively more beautiful
than a tulip um when they're like at equivalent health right um but you can say that a rose would
look better if it is alive and not dead and i i just think that this is you're comparing um two
colors to each other purple and blue and i i don't think that that's an equivalent to comparing
an egg to a rose well that current like the the purple versus blue thing is purely within
the the realms of the agreeable uh straight into the beautiful if i told you i preferred
black to white and you said why and i said because white is too striking it like hurts my eyes it's
like oh you've actually referenced something that's tangible there like i can't actually
but if i just told you blue versus purple because it makes me feel better you'd be like yeah okay
there's nothing we can do with that still still a sensory phenomenon though uh true but it's still
provable that white is absolutely brighter than black true um so it depends and like sensory
phenomenon that determines whether or not it is agreeable yeah and bright is technically relative
but it would be relative to the black is kind of what i was getting that way yeah for instance but
the beautiful is different when we see something beautiful we actually feel that we have a good
reason to believe that everyone should see it the same way as us now see i feel like he's slipping
almost getting to the point where he's gonna slip me in soon because like the whole you you create
an objective analysis specifically to make your uh subjective one understood and appreciated by
others or some shit like to validate it further um which which is a it actually explains the
motivation like it would explain people like me but it's not what i do and um i can't get away
with it anyway because i've already established standards that i would never be able to now get
away from if you know what i mean like my families would absolutely hold me to them now this entire
video is so far a missed shot i would say anyway like if you try not to deal with the beautiful
like uh as was outlined very very very briefly earlier what you guys try and do in terms of
an objective and assess in terms of an objective assessment is categorize art under the good or
whatever elements you can you try and categorize under the good because that concerns functional
and like purpose ofness and such like like hence the image of a hammer a hammer is a good hammer
if you know you can hammer nails really well that's how you're trying to see art so all this all
the stuff about beauty is like okay yes can't said all of these things by the way also no
information on why can't says all of these things nothing on the huge level of metaphysics and
understanding that backs it so he'll he'll explain that within the remaining brain i'm sure he's
going to explain the entirety of transcendental idealism yes leave it to be a true quality of
the object even though it isn't this phenomenon there are things that are true qualities of the
object we can reference there are of of value to standards we've generated even if they were
by us or whatever i don't know just also who's moving around the um the thing
holding me south pole also
imo wolver doing nothing
all right hey can you guys hear me yeah sorry that yeah that was me i i i was trying to ask
if we could uh rewind uh 15 seconds and i guess that my mic muted out sorry okay very sorry about
that problem all right we have there our senses just like different stuff but the beautiful is
different when we see something beautiful we actually feel that we have a good reason to
believe that everyone should see it the same way as us we is that actually what we think though
when we say that something is beautiful that's that's what comes to saying the nature of a
judgment of the beautiful is okay that when you when you when you are witnessing something
when you're witnessing something beautiful you have okay you have a reason to believe
or or reason to demand i suppose that everyone else who should witness the same phenomenon
would have the same like withdraw the same conclusion that it is beautiful okay if i was
to read count very conveniently i could say he's arguing for objectivity and i would cite that
you see you see how a convenient reading can change how you can present someone's work
and perhaps this is what's going on here believe it to be a true quality of the object even though
it isn't this phenomenon is what cant calls and bear with me through all of these terms
subjective universality yeah that is that is a big weird phrase so i know what you're
thinking this sounds like an oxymoron how can something be universal if it is subjective and
i hear you but cant is using this phrase to talk about the fact that while we can't irrefutably
prove that we are right about something being beautiful what matters here is the fact that we
feel like we have a good reason to believe that other people should agree with us we have a
justifiable opinion it's in this sorry to pause again really quick uh i don't know how deep you
want me to go into the philosophy behind this but all i'll say is that is a horrible account of
what's actually going on with the beautiful i was going to pause and all i was going to say is
is that what cat thinks is that what cat says all right fairly honest god uh right so let's
stop that's what you're here for dental idealism so in the shortest terms i can think of cant
believes there is a very first off cant has things like causality space time are not actual things
out there in the world they're human concepts that we use to process experience into what we
understand we never actually interact with things in themselves like the things as they are or i
suppose you could call objective reality that's that we don't perceive objective reality i mean
that's part of what makes lovecraft scary right is there's this whole universe beyond the one
where you understand and perceive yeah we perceive reality through the categories in our brain like
space time causality so on and so forth and that processes it into what we understand and what we
see and then a judgment of the beautiful we've got this uh subjective universality going on uh which
is one thing i don't know if can't ever use that phrase by the way i don't i don't remember
actually i'm gonna assume that that's a convenient way of putting it from it but yeah who knows
uh essentially what's going on with a judgment of the beautiful is uh what what cant refers to
as the free play of the imagination and the senses the idea that uh because we have these
concepts that i've referred to previously like for example the concept of a dog would be what
we understand to be a dog and then we've also got the categories in our head like
uh space time so on so the idea the way a normal cognitive rational judgment goes is
some uh the uh what do you call it the object we perceive is subsumed under a concept
to try and like as we process the experience but with uh but with an aesthetic judgment a judgment
of the beautiful uh there's sort of uh it's really hard to sorry uh like an excess of cognition i
suppose is how you put it like it can't be fully subsumed under one concept and that results in
the free play of the senses which then results in a judgment of the beautiful and that's that's as
close to a brief account as i can give of it uh and i want to point out that's got very little to
do with what just right said was going on in a judgment of the beautiful because he didn't have
time in his 20 minute video to give us background into all the reasons why can't believes what he
does and says what he does what if there was a story about a guy who was trying to defend a movie
he really liked through a standards that was nonsensical and went on a stream where he was
unable to defend it and then he went as far as uh being frustrated by that event and so looked
into philosophers that may or may not have discussed this particular subject read a brief
summary of their work on wikipedia and then constructed a video with a couple of jabs and
snarkiness while also referencing them just make it seem like he's actually got a lot of clout here
to conclude on the subject and then move on with his channel as if he got the final word
what if that happened i'm not saying that happened but what if that no i could see that being the
case who knows never know though i'm sure this is just a genuine look into some ideas and he's
reached some interesting conclusions that's all absolutely face that all conversations around art
so to recap kant's theories so far taste is inherently subjective however to talk about
the beauty of something you can't be biased towards it you cannot need it or see practical
value in it and the terminology of the agreeable lets us set aside totally abstract personal
opinions from those we think should have universal validity who boy that is a lot of stuff kant is
literally the most difficult literary critic to figure out why do i not think that's necessarily
okay so first off kant's not a literary critic shut up he's a philosopher he worked in
metaphysics epistemology all kinds of other fields this was very much a tertiary work for
him hell he wasn't even on about uh objectivity versus subjectivity the main purpose of the
critique of judgment was to do with uh the traditions empiricism and rationalism being
previously outlined yeah it's it's just your opinion that kant was not a literary
he is he is not objectively haven't you based that on your assessments and your feelings
south court so isn't it just subjective that you think what he's saying is subjective about
his subjective take on subjectivity you are you are subjectively right i knew it
one more distinction to clear out oh wait did you want to say anything else
i think i might have but i can't remember it now shit i'm sorry dude i didn't mean to okay yeah
it's fine sorry it's me you did say first of all he's not a literary critic so i assume you wanted
to go onto something else oh there we go thanks thanks for rewinding you reminded me must be
unbiased to judge beauty so this is a problem with uh kant's idea not necessarily with just
right's depiction of it because that is a thing he says it's disinterestedness that allows for
a judgment of beauty to take place but clearly we as humans are not fully disinterested i don't
understand how that matches taste is inherently subjective combined with you must be unbiased to
judge how would what would the judgment be at that point um by by by kant's assessment i guess
it's it is entirely and like just how the thing appears to you because uh
it's been a while since i like part of it the idea that like if you're unbiased you'll be
able to judge it i mean i want to use the word objectively but i guess i don't know if that's
where what this is doing subjective universally objective universal why does he put it that way
i think he's done a mistake i'm gonna say it wasn't that before right it was
subjective universality and i saw someone in chat confirm that kant never uses that phrase
in the critique of judgment well yeah so fyi psa don't trust just right's take on these two
philosophers look into it if you want to know what they actually think don't take his word for it
i have issues with reviewers who look at a two-hour series of moving pictures and then try and
recount it to an audience i'm like you usually fucking it up massively and i use that word
specifically so when someone's judging an entire body of work from an ancient fucking philosopher
like yeah don't don't trust it don't don't trust 90 of internet critics using philosophers to try
and support their claims especially if their videos under like an hour hey universal 22 minutes
long i can't believe how short this video is for the subject so funny and people will say it's
concise i'm like okay what have you said validity hoo boy that is a lot of stuff kant is literally
the most difficult literary critic to figure out but there is one more distinction to clear up
and it's wait didn't you say that kant is literally the most difficult literary critic
to figure out isn't that subjective though i guess he would agree with you i guess you'd be like yeah
no with my opinion he's also not a fucking literary critic so so it wouldn't literally be
the case then neither was human for that matter by the way he could argue again because he's slippery
he'd be like i was using litter literally the word hyperbolically but not literally he's using
the word literally not literally what i would say in fairness is that a lot of people do use that
word hyperbolically down from some nature or some spin this isn't necessarily the time to be
fucking hyperbolic when you're trying to explain it yeah like philosophy whatever yeah yeah really
like you're trying to connect one more thing so so far we have tried to cover almost the
entirety of the critique and judge of judgment in about five minutes you know when i went through
that small paragraph where i was like this this this there's like my video on this i don't even
know if i could get it done within an entire year first of all i need to read all their works and
see how if i could understand it then get translations then look into who they reference
and like figure out all of the ideas of everything they're talking about and figure out what words
they're using and what they think they mean versus what i think they mean like it's there's so many
levels to this and he's just fucking shattered a 20-minute video someone in the chat said that wolf
uses literally hyperbolically all the time we know that but we're talking about hypocrisy here
yeah like you're saying in reference to just write himself it's pretty amusing
yes the usage just writes hyperbolic usage of the word literally while trying to argue
that uh everything is subjective here and he's using it uh in reference to saying that these
two people are the most difficult literary critics to understand which is a subjective statement i
just think that's hilarious i don't care about yeah people i understand that a lot of people
use that word hyperbolically i'm saying in this particular context it's super hypocritical and ironic
yeah the beautiful and the good and i think this one helps to explain the impossibility of
objective critique i said earlier that things that are good have a specific purpose and we can say
objectively whether or not they are good at achieving that purpose yeah see but that would
be one standard so for example i'm trying to hammer a nail and my hammer breaks like well
i can actually use this table leg as a hammer like is it is it a good hammer it's like uh
by the standard in which it can hammer a nail to a degree yes but you're still damaging the table
leg when you do it because i seriously doubt it won't take a few punches to itself if you know
what i mean but integrity goes down for every nail it hammers and to a degree a hammer does
the same thing but it would be a significantly lesser degree you definitely shouldn't be using
a scalpel to get that nail in and but this is the thing though like uh he's like tying it to
functionality is interesting to me because it's not necessarily like what it is versus what it
can do i suppose i don't really the idea of a judgment of the good is how well something
fulfills its purpose yeah so how well a hammer hammers a nail and such like the the problem
with that when it comes to aesthetic judgments and judgments of art is uh i guess you'll get
into that a little bit later on but um we don't have a clear specific purpose for art yeah it's
the problem with using the word art too i try and avoid using it oh so do i and it can confuse what
someone thinks you're talking about like if you say like this is poor writing so how can you say
art is bad it's like no i said poor writing it's like how can you say art is bad though
like again that's how you talk about like stories and such like and here we are with a reference to
kant who's talking about roses and natural beauty because he was very focused on natural beauty and
i have to wonder how we got from point a to point b in there it was fast and loose to say the least
the impossibility of objective critique i said earlier that things that are good have a specific
purpose and we can say objectively whether or not they are good at achieving that purpose
the weird thing about things that are beautiful is that while they i'm really sorry to do this again
just a quick uh notify i don't think can call it objective even if you are making a judgment of
the good because the purpose is implanted by you i mean if he established the he we literally
can't have a take on anything that is objectively anything then yeah he may as well throw that word
out if that was kant's take uh essentially we humans are never going to deal with anything
that's objective at least in the real world yeah we can elevate it to a different plane or whatever
things things in our minds we can happily work with objectively like one plus one equals two
happily definable as an objective statement is he going to is he about to argue that you can't say
that art is objectively good because in order for something to be objectively good it would
have to have a purpose and art doesn't have a purpose therefore it can't be objectively good
is that really like where he's going here that's where it counts gang
okay because i guess we'll give it a bit more time yeah the won't serve practical purposes
they feel like they do so when we say that a flower is beautiful we're not talking about
the practical purpose it serves as the reproductive organ of a plant what's beautiful about a flower
is that it feels like it was designed to please even though that is not its purpose i wouldn't
even say that he didn't he didn't say designed to please that's a oversimplification of what's
going on there it's the purpose of an object to the concept and uh why would you leave that for
now why did you even need to say that you could just have satisfying two senses yeah well then
it's the agreeable designed to please is an interesting way to look at it so let's say that
someone loses a family member or someone close to them and uh they they receive a bouquet of flowers
from from friends that hear about it in our sympathetic and uh gift them a bouquet of flowers
right and um it achieves the desired effect so can you say that that bouquet of flowers was good
from from the standard gotta let him make that argument first i guess because okay sure
let's talk about flowers a lot a piece of art is a little different than nature though since
we are constantly debating what the purpose of a piece of art is a painting or a film doesn't serve
an obvious practical function um not sure i agree because okay well it depends on
so say for example i'm creating a story the purpose then is to be a story
is i'm not like i wouldn't end up with a fucking camel so like the idea that it has no purpose
like well it's purposes to serve like a video purposes to serve as what is a video um if you
would say it's purposes come from sorry are the idea of what a story is uh come from well yeah
but like i'm on board with the idea that every single standard is created by humans fair enough
how could it not be like it's but yeah when we create the thing and then we try and achieve the
thing the thing is therefore got standards and that's how it works in science as far as i know
and you well you could be like well the thing existed before while a video did not necessarily
exist until we created it i suppose you can try and distinguish them that way but i don't know if
that's uh so so like you'd have uh i'm trying to think of a series of macaroni i can call it what
it is we can categorize it and then i put it in a particular uh formation and then i'm like now
that's a piece of macaroni art whatever uh technically just because no one else had made
a piece of macaroni art up to that point does not make the definition any less significant um i guess
what i'm trying to say is that saying the purpose of a story is to be a story of a purpose of a
i guess well after you know painting is to be a painting is that it doesn't really
i suppose reveal much more about that uh about that subject well typically not no but
qualities are entailed with them that's yeah but there's only so far we can go with stuff
like that like if you a popular idea is arts purposes to elicit a reaction or feeling from
someone in chat and it's like i mean yeah i don't think i'd be against that but it's if
the problem is that with how subjectivity works gonna be a guy out there he's the painting and
doesn't react at all and therefore has it failed in its purpose and therefore is bad
so um i went and saw hobs and shaw last night and when i went there i went there uh to see the movie
knowing that it was going to be pretty stupid and the plot was going to be paper thin and
the dialogue was going to be cliched and the characters aren't going to have much depth
but it was advertised as a dumb fun action movie and i got exactly what i wanted out of it so it
achieved its purpose rather well even though i wouldn't rate it as high as like many other
movies that are out there right um however if i'm watching a uh let's say that i go into
a star wars movie like uh oh let's let's rewind time back to december 20 december 14 2017 to when
i went and saw the last jedi and i was expecting a a good movie uh that had a story that would
make sense and i got the exact opposite of that if the purpose of a movie for me uh depending on
what movie it is i'm picking of course is i'm expecting a good story that i find intellectually
stimulating because it features characters that are all smart and the good guys are trying to
outsmart the bad guys and vice versa and um what i get is actually everyone is making ridiculous
decisions and the story only moves forward because everyone's an idiot then the story
didn't achieve the purpose that like like the movie didn't achieve the purpose that i came in
for do you guys what i'm saying i think so and yeah the the question is more of an inherent
purpose versus one that is given by uh the viewer slash creator yeah okay that that's
that's the big one is that inherently uh because we're dealing with philosophical that's why
earlier i said like a story is intrinsically progression isn't tied to story there's no way
to have one without it again writing that can't be read the intrinsic values the ones that
it has to be that to qualify as that um and that's yeah that's how i see uh how you'd be able to
judge an objective value because it's not something that you've projected onto it
it is what it is and and you could be like someone else did though because it's a trying
to be an x and it's like yeah but adhering to a standard you can still be objective and if the
standard supersedes the thing in terms of the standard was created and then the things were
created like in carpentry or because what is objectively a dovetail joint is objectively
you can't get out of it you can't go no my it's a finger joint is now a dovetail joint like you
can't do that um and you'd be like yeah but it's just up to that carpentry guy he's the one who's
saying it it's like exactly that's that's what it is you're trying to achieve what it is and uh
yeah i don't know i don't see i haven't heard uh actually approach from that angle before so
i can't offer any particular oh it's it's an ongoing discussion i mean i'll need to think
about that i might get back to you on that at some point yeah no it's all good i've said before
that it's like it's always going to be an ongoing discussion well i'm after i'm dead and well before
i was alive and like that's evidence to some people it is obviously not true then like what
like i wasn't going to end the discussion on art how the hell was anyone going to do that
nobody's done it yet in fact the core blockades that were there are still the core blockades
like even from kent's time and the idea of the fact value distinction and defining an art object
and the purpose of art and such like these are all still big hangups the differences that people
have become more entrenched in their positions that they've become more nuanced the positions
are more like intricate than they were before but they haven't moved forward in any sense
it hasn't no one's gone right we've solved it art is judged objectively or art is judged
objectively and even if we did you know you could get a new wave of people who could conclude on
it because they felt a conclusion on a completely different idea because it feels like it matches
reality better or maybe it does like it'll just always keep changing you get rational people crazy
people or people who saw the truth where the previous set of people didn't it'll just everything
keeps changing everything goes on but it's fun to talk about in the meantime we're all here for a
small amount of time people let's have some fun now i just file a bit we are constantly debating
what the purpose of a piece of art is a painting or a film doesn't serve an obvious practical
function and even if the author creates it for a specific purpose art tends to take on a life of
its own and can fulfill many unforeseen functions and this is really important if there's one idea
i want you to take away from this video it's this one because how can you establish the object
yeah so the purpose of art is uncertain it's again the meaning makes me go like well i
i suppose because yeah art is very it covers a lot of stuff isn't this still just kind of
irrelevant to the discussion on whether something is well crafted like the last jedi
has several shots that are beautiful you could say that the movie is objectively beautiful but
it's also objectively poorly written again i tend to throw that word out it would be like welcome
po when i talk about like strong cinematography you probably go straight to composition
or clarity or or and then talk about like the subject in the frame rather because beautiful
i mean more so than good beautiful immediately makes people think of you saying it's it's pretty
and it's like that sounds like the peak of subjectivity okay yeah so i mean
sorry sorry well uh there is a certain shot like on on crate that i was thinking of specifically
when i when i was saying beautiful there um but i would say that something like the throne room
fight there's um i would say that it's well shot there's no shaky cam it's it's a wide shot it's
it's like it's competently shot but it's not well choreographed um and they clearly there's a ton of
mistakes that they could have fixed in um reshoots or going for a different take or something um
but i just uh now i've lost my train of thought i'm sorry i don't know where i was going with that
so uh the idea of judging art on a sort of purpose level we call that teleology
over in philosophy based on the word telos which means purpose and gree uh the idea of judging art
teleologically uh carries with it some i guess issues in because let's say you take an element
out of the work and you start examining that element to see how it fulfills a function
which is then fulfilling a purpose within the thing but then you wonder what is the purpose
like again mauler has to be a story and i currently don't have an answer to that i'm
quite interested to look into that so because i figure there's that easy of a solution
well there's the thing there's no way i'd be cracking anything so it's just uh
ultimately it's only everyone's take on everything right that's what everything is
fundamentally i'd be curious to see what is said in response to that is what i mean uh then
like yeah that's the idea is that it seems from what i have seen at least relatively uncontroversial
that the purpose of art is uncertain which makes it hard to judge any given element of an art object
to working towards an uncertain purpose because we can't really set the standard there's no nails
for the hammer to hammer if you if that makes any sense we don't we don't know what we don't
want to know what the function of the thing is we don't know what it's trying to do so how are we
supposed to tune the elements of it to work towards that function you where he goes i guess
objective criteria for a piece of art when art doesn't serve a definitive describable purpose
like you can say that a particular hammer is a good hammer because it is good at hammering nails
since hammering nails is the purpose of a hammer but with art yeah see when he says the paper so i
would just be like it's by definition what it is is what it's defined as so how does it perform
in the attributes of what it's defined as um and there's always so many different ways to look
at uh whatever that might be and like i said it supplies to all crafts and uh in the case of
dovetail joints i was really bad at making them because you have to make them you have to be very
measured i was i always wanted to make finger joints but dovetails are stronger they're just
harder to make because you got to not be a spastic idiot like i was but that was back in dt in my
school it was fun i liked making things the perceiver has to invent the purpose of whatever
they're looking at is it to entertain provoke thought communicate a message stir emotions or
nothing at all with every piece of media you encounter those questions are up for debate so
if your criteria for a story is whether or not it has logical consistency if that's the box you need
checked to have a good time that's fine what i'm arguing is that implicit in that belief are a lot
of assumptions about what the purpose of a piece of art is i don't think so no no i let me see if i
can uh you guys can uh take it from here i guess i'm going to try to figure out my own response to
this well so when when he's like oh if if logical consistency is your box to tick then uh you'll be
waiting for that's what you'll be looking for in movies or whatever typically not with me and uh
eric taxon actually uh spoke to me about this and he sees it as i run two subjective uh
sort of perspectives at the same time that's how he sees what i'm doing i see what i'm doing is
running a subjective and then an objective i will i will take it for what it is and i'll react as i do
for example with captive marvel when it finished i was like that was okay that i said to my friend
at the time that it's like a four and then i got objective about it because i was able to watch
the film again and really break down everything that happens and it conclude at like a two or
maybe even a one and then the reverse of that is endgame which was like fucking 11 out of 10
we're watching it for all the payoffs and then once i get enough time to come down i was like yeah
okay so this is pretty cool um these what makes me enjoy a thing is so goddamn subjective it's all
over the place it can also depend on my mood in the day whether or not i'm hungry or sleepy
like or whether or not there's a certain actor in there it's like there's there's just so many
things that come into it but which is why the objective scale is just like it brings everything
down to well for lack of a better term ones and zeros just try didn't like my robot and now
didn't bring it up it's a nasty subject but that was an idea of conduits as well if we're all
conduits of art explaining things the robot would be unable to reference anything that was emotional
the idea being that if i say blah blah blah i think consistently blah blah blah the robot would
have said the exact same thing as me so saying that i am biased and when i'm saying the robot
could have said it you can't actually say a robot is biased unless you're going to talk about
someone who programmed it biased like someone put it in there that he was going to be biased i don't
know i guess in a sense though uh if i want to get pedantic about this the robot would have a
bias towards uh well the robot would be biased towards the standard set bias programming from
the person who programmed him well i said that he was just looking for logical inconsistencies in
that environment i'm pretty sure i'd have to actually listen over to what i specifically
said to just write um i remember him his issue was the robot couldn't possibly exist i believe
i think i'm fine with the robot existing yeah because it was theoretical anyway yeah um
the question is just again is what the robot says valuable i guess because the robot can
say all he wants uh uh holder was inconsistent uh so on and so forth uh the question is is that
is that valuable i'd probably say yes i'm of the opinion yeah well i was gonna say i think i talked
a bit shat about that on the other podcast like the the fundamental question of is an
objective assessment valuable is like well it doesn't matter really that's down to the person
do you find value in it do i find it's like i certainly find value in it
i my biggest deal with it as wolf mentioned earlier was that it's uh it's going to lead us
to better things ideally that's why we want to point them out and um when you get to fundamentals
like words that cannot be written and weapons that disappear during battle to prevent characters
from dying we've got problems that in in just right's view are almost objective because the
majority of the planet when shown them would be like ooh and so is it not worth scrubbing those
out um and and then once you realize what the like he maybe he agrees with that let's just say for
the sake of argument he goes yeah uh 100 of people agree that that disappearing weapons are bad and
we should never do that again it's like okay cool why though why was it and then you identify all
of these parameters for why that was a problem beyond the fact that people just reacted to it
then you discover there's a bunch of other issues in your script that match that thing but most
people didn't recognize only 60 down to 50 down to 40 so i guess the point was like why not erase
all of them yeah so let's say that there's um there's an inconsistency or a plot hole or
flub or error or whatever that uh can break your immersion when you notice it right so
i think that we have an acceptable like like there's a threshold that we have where we will
kind of um like like a mistake allowance that we give to um to movies like okay we understand that
no movie is perfect and there's going to be the occasional like fuck up here and there
but as long as there isn't like a pile up of errors that are very crucial to the story
and how the story makes sense we're going to give it a pass but then you get to something
like the dark night rises level where nothing in that in that movie's story makes sense
it's distracting like whatever plot holes that just right is going to talk about with the dark
night i can tell you that none of those were noticeable to me on my first viewing of the dark
night but first viewing of dark night rises i was not having a good time because nothing
but just right in that movie makes sense that he didn't notice the holdo thing just run through
but tlj yeah jeez this is why noticing something isn't something i consider to be completely
irrelevant because i can just be like oh i didn't notice any problems it's the works fine on my
machine answer of criticism it's really annoying for instance you may believe that movies are
primarily about escapism and so anything that takes you out of the narrative is an enormous flaw
there's just nothing that makes that belief any more correct or incorrect than any other
assumption about what art should be what bullshit no no no no i'm sorry but if you've got a fucking
if your if your story takes place in uh in a if your movie takes place in a universe that's
supposed to be realistic like the dark nights and then you're introducing bullshit like magic leg
braces that that fixed fuck it that fixed the stupid bullshit um lack of cartilage in Bruce
Wayne's uh leg and allows him to kick bricks out of walls and the um the whole bullshit with the
stock market heist thing where yeah they they're going to just accept these trades that uh basically
defraud Bruce Wayne out of all of his wealth right after terrorists took over the place and held
hostages there and did some bullshit with the computers and oh my god nothing nothing in the
dark night rises story makes sense and when that's taking you out of the film that's drastically
affecting your ability to enjoy it yes it is a major stain on the film's quality because the
writing could have been better the writing could have been significantly better i mean that's the
point of this being philosophical he would just all he needs to throw back at you is yeah according
to you the question being fuck you the question being raised is what do you mean better yeah
because and then we get to yeah it stands concocted by us at which point he says it's not objective
it's normative which honestly i don't really care either way so long as the arguments are good but
someone is saying that the dark night trilogy was never intended to be realistic you know what i
mean here it's not meant to have magic leg braces okay the leg race is bullshit i've never understood
the point of them when they invent that he is weakened at the beginning of the film only to
then undo it it's like well the legs anyway and it's just like okay why not just have it so that
his legs weren't to that degree crippled why why did you a strange move but yeah it's yeah it's
like saying the problem then and had to invent a solution to that problem for that film it's like
it's like shafrel is saying that luke couldn't have shown up on crate because the x-wing was
in the water okay rewrite the film so that you don't have the x-wing in the water it's an
arbitrary writing decision it wasn't that wasn't established in the force awakens it wasn't
established in return of the jedi it was established in the same movie where they did the force
projection bullshit therefore we critique the quality of art we first make an arbitrary
assumption about what its purpose is then we invent criteria to decide whether that purpose
is achieved and it's only after that that the analysis proceeds logically
let's look at a concrete example perhaps you're writing a review of oh i don't know star war is
the last jedi to pick a film totally oh god we're only halfway through the video
totally of you been you disgusting degenerate okay so remember how i told you that uh
i was doing some car work today that's your opinion but yeah okay well we need to buff
out a bunch of shit but we couldn't get the thing to buff out the um little scratch marks
on the side so um initially i thought okay well i'll just do it tomorrow or something when i can
go to the store but then my dad comes back and he's like hey you got the buff stuff and i was like
okay well may as well do it now and yeah that's what i've been doing well i hope it worked out
you've missed yeah nothing really yeah i didn't think i would a whole lot of nothing
and he's just he's bringing in the last jedi just now so i don't know this is weird timing but
it's like wolf has the sixth sense that someone is about to praise the last jedi on efap
i ordered pizza while i was doing it so thank goodness right oh i don't know star war is the
last jedi to pick a film totally at random and for no other reason in the first scene the rebels
use these big bombers against the first order and they get destroyed really quickly because they are
big and slow but aha you've been watching star wars your whole life and you know that there's
another kind of ship called a y-wing which is also supposed to drop bombs so why aren't the good
guys oh my god don't tell me he's actually going to try and say that they couldn't use y-wings give
us a minute this is really funny i was gonna keep this in mind he's not done with it yet
since it's smaller and faster and would survive longer that would make more logical sense check
mate ryan yes it would okay oh my god right give me a second let's this is the thing wait
because he's gonna he's making a wider argument here so whatever he says within the last jedi
he's making a wider point that i kind of want to hear him get to as well as whatever he's saying
about the last jedi if you know what i mean yeah go ahead you might have to let him talk
for a bit actually now it's totally fine to dislike any scene in this film but let's talk
about why this is not an objective criticism it's partly because most people do not know what a y-wing
is no no no no no no no no no okay first off fuck face everyone knows what a fucking y-wing is
anyone that's watched star wars knows what a fucking y-wing is it's been here since the first
fucking movie released 40 fucking years ago don't tell me that people don't know what a fucking
y-wing is you disingenuous faggot what's the fuck how could you possibly make that argument
everyone knows what it is it's been in every game it's been in every movie okay maybe not every movie
maybe not every game but most games in most movies this is so stupid how could you possibly
make this argument you fucking idiot everyone knows what it is yeah but the fact that some
people don't mean it's me no i need to no no just because you're an idiot just because you're a
fucking retard that doesn't know anything about star wars does not mean that that claim is accurate
it is not accurate it is the exact definition of inaccurate here's the thing if it shows several
shots in the very first fucking star wars movie ever released of y-wings then logic goes people
know what a y-wing is because we've seen it in action before there's even we don't even need
y-wings to exist for the fucking bulbas to be terrible we don't even need y-wings also oh my
god well this is the dumbest man on the internet all respect for you that i ever had in the past
gone completely you're done so i i would like to to uh try to address something here let's say
that there's someone that has only seen star wars uh like just the force awakens and the last jedi
so they are unaware of what a y-wing is because a y-wing is not in either of those two movies
the point is so uh i'm not much of a harry potter fan and um the latest prequel film fantastic
beasts 2 shows a fully grown um Minerva McGonagall at hogwarts several years before her uh confirmed
birth date uh that was detailed in the books so that's a massive contradiction but i wouldn't
have caught it myself just because i didn't uh remember that particular detail it still is a
problem though even if i personally uh was unaware of that disappearing knife dude most if not like
90 percent of the fucking audience did not know that a knife disappeared during the fight
yeah can i raise just quickly as well what the hell does this have to do with anything he was
saying before i don't know this is why i suggested that it's i suggested you don't stop but he did
make a point like this is a this is a singular point here yeah he's doing the same bullshit
he's doing the same bullshit that he did with you guys in your debate where he said that well
there could be one person out there that actually unironically likes the room and therefore it's not
objectively bad also let me add to this let me add to this fucking rant i'm going on
go ahead because just because other people don't know what a y-wing is does not give you uh an
excuse to not put in a y-wing when they are an established thing in the star wars universe over
this slow piece of shit bomber hey we could just because other people don't know about it does not
mean that that's an excuse you fucking moron we could just have like you go to see this film
and it just plays just right never write anything never write anything i swear to god if you write
anything i might actually kill myself i mean i'm probably going to do that anyway but you'll
just make me do it quicker just you'll you'll you'll come back to say absolute thing i have
ever heard on efap unironically you will come back to life just to kill yourself a second time
yes be wolf the white yeah well i've never heard of efap so him saying that isn't a problem
oh my god so like yeah when i was gonna i was like if this is truly based
on memory we just have anything in star wars episode nine like it could just be lord of the
rings the two towers and someone's like where's luke and then ryan jones is like luke luke who
like luke luke skywalker he's like no i don't who's that like oh okay and then most of the
audience are like no i don't remember any luke this film's great okay look closely barney the
dinosaur was piloting one of the bombers i didn't notice it and i'd watch it it's not a problem
in this film but let's talk about why this is not an objective criticism it's partly because most
people do not know what a y-wing is and even objectively quantify that your dumb box so to
even make this wait did wait hold on didn't he say most people don't know what a y-wing is
most people fewer no wow i didn't even notice that one word shit oh
remember some people don't know that's one thing most people though
bullshit and even fewer of them know if it's military purpose i'll have you know
oh well i guess that's how it works this is not definitely high dude i fucking wish i was high
yeah this is pizza wolf no this is sober and i really wish i wasn't
because if i was high i would think that i'm not watching a real video wolf what is it with you
like whenever i'm in a call with you you go on these like absurdly passionate rages
i don't know you just bring out the worst in me so far we should fuck sometime
time agreed it's partly because most people do not know what a y-wing is and even fewer know
what its military purpose is so to even make this critique you have to have a certain knowledge of
you have to have watched the other films you have to have watched a single star wars movie
congrats your fucking relations wait so you mean to tell me that in order to criticize
something you need to be able you need to have something of an understanding of it
this is why if you're going to argue to me that the the films that come before it and the line
of it being a sequel are irrelevant when you critique it because people might have forgotten
then when we talk about act three we don't need to consider act one and two people might have
forgotten about it by that when i watch this video i can't help just go why the fuck does
the art object even matter just right why can't we just sit here interpreting like thinking about
like tlj came out i didn't go and see it but i have my interpretation on it and i have my
assessment on it from that it's about space christians and i'm right because someone said
it's over anakin i have the amnesia ground hey you know maybe uh he should have gone with the
wren's reviews approach he could have just said they never do show y-wings in the previous films
i'm trying to think of like how to how to gedelb this statement it's like it's not valid if you
don't remember it it's like it's it's so absurd do we have to rewind it we can rewind it it's insane
that he was showing rogue one footage the movie that came out right before the last jedi the year
before the absurdity of the idea that it's a bad thing that you need like a certain level
of familiarity with a subject in order to analyze and critique it he's a he's an interesting man
this this is just right you know i'm starting to think he might not just be right that name
you know this is why people don't like game journalists because they're bad at games and
review games anyway mauler can you add to your gedelb notes um the thing where most people don't
know what a y-wing is i feel like that that belongs on there no i want to go something more
obvious most people don't know what uh what a sofa is don't know what i like and planet is
what what a person is what i don't know what the people is most people don't know what a mask making
laptop is i think i do have quotes from red reviews to go into the next eve remember now
you are expected to remember multiple faces several things you're also expected to remember
imagine imagine this criticism of efap the amount of memes you got to remember
yeah i can't believe i was about to resubscribe to this guy at some point
well good lord don't do that well yeah there's this killed any chance that that ever happened
the y-wing is and even fewer know what its military purpose is so to even make this what
you have to have a certain knowledge of the lore but on top of that you have to
they don't know what what purpose is it's a bomber most yeah people know that it's a bomber
ah dude
i don't think it plays that pop for me i'm best i'm overdosing on stupid right now
you have to have a certain knowledge i'd like to overdose right now but on top of that you have to
overdose on just right i believe that adhering to the lore established in films is more important
than the immediate impact of the scene so you have to establish that adhering to the law is more
something than the impact of the scene the implication being that they're
dichotomous yeah you can't you can't do that you can't just have both yeah which is he says
enough time to write it that way he says that you need a certain knowledge of the lore
as though this is like a y-wing is equivalent to understanding who morgoth was in the lord of the
rings like what a stupid fucking person you are you are actually the dumbest youtuber i might have
seen so far like i i'm not expecting the average star wars viewer to understand everything about
like mandalor but y-wings yeah yeah it's kind of obvious what their purpose is you see them in the
original x-wings like in terms of what people should recognize and if you could argue to me
yeah most people don't know what an x-wing is i'll be like well they fucking watch it at that point
aren't there y-wings on the the attack on the death star in the first film yes so i'm pretty sure
i can find you the shot of it yeah one of the teams is entirely y-wings yeah and even if it
wasn't in the first movie it's still in fucking return of the jedi why is wolf so autistic today
gee maybe it's because i'm watching a fucking moron tell me that nobody knows what a y-wing
is in star wars you see the screaming or stupid is not clever or entertaining dude please fucking
kill yourself okay the immediate impact of the scene the fact that the bombers are big and slow
is a non-verbal way of communicating an idea to the audience it justifies in our mind why the
ships are destroyed so easily whichever side yeah as if there's no other way to justify why a ship
will be destroyed you see the problem just right this is post-hoc he takes everything that happens
in the scene and then justifies it as it had to be this way to be this way but you want these
results you can get them in many ways this story would not have happened though if the resistance
weren't all fucking idiots that really i'm getting tired of people actually unironically
making the argument that i need my characters to be retarded otherwise i don't have a story
like this story literally relies on the resistance going yeah we're going to take these bombers with
paper thin holes that can get destroyed by half of a TIE fighter crashing into one of them and then
killing two others in the process that are designed to basically get destroyed if it can
successfully deliver its payload and they're super slow as well they're they're they aren't
even compensating this with speed or anything and the the the bombs have to be dropped directly
above the target instead of being sent out like a like a torpedo or a missile yeah we're gonna use
these bombers instead of y-wings which are better in virtually every way that's where the plot relies
on the plot relies on that i make stupid that it would take these terrible fucking bombers
that make no sense as to like as why anyone would choose these things over the fucking y-wings that
are previously established we need these bombers because it's non-verbal communication the
treadmill doesn't have shields but it's non-verbal communication that i mean i would still argue
even despite this video that just right has some of if not the best videos on the hobbit on all of
youtube how the fuck did you go from that to this what is wrong with you were you like dropped on
your head when you were 20 or something a good picture of like it is in someone's arms getting
fed milk and they drop it did you go how did you go from a good youtuber to a fucking moron
didn't we ask him that in the debate like what if his hobbit videos led to people disliking it
he was like that would be bad i think he like he said something to the effect of like men i think
it would be bad if my hobbit videos that are really good led people to disliking it even though the
hobbit movies are fucking garbage really calm and that position show some fucking balls you
sackless little pussy don't make a whole series of hobbit videos shitting on them and then say
that you would feel like a bad person if you got someone to dislike them that's the whole point you
idiot it justifies in our mind why the ships are destroyed so easily whichever side of the argument
you land on it's simply a personal preference and it's based on a bunch of beliefs about which
aspects of a story are more important than others wait but we you say that as if it supports the
idea that why wings shouldn't be there or something although that isn't an actual like criticism to
be presented and acknowledged he's just like well you know you need we wanted this to happen this
way so is that really more important than why wings being there this video is it's predicated
on like this really weird like it's it's not overtly stated but it's it's implicit in the
videos that this really weird idea that this the piece of art could only ever have been one way
fucking patrick wouldn't have said about holdo like if holdo wasn't retarded we wouldn't get our story
yeah the film could not have been made in another way you like you said those two things are
dichotomous adhering to the law or the emotional stakes of the scene you have to have one or the
other you can't have both with a different setup what a sound given this you definitely can't have
the visual of of page tico kicking the ladder to get the detonator to fall down you wouldn't get
that in a why wing because that wouldn't be logistically possible in the why wing and there
would be no reason for that to happen in the why wing because why wings are not designed terribly
like these terrible stupid fucking bombers are but um the scene itself where you're having these
bombers get obliterated in this bombing run yes it could still happen if you replace them with
y-wings and they functioned the same way as they function in the previous movies you still could
have had the the purpose that this scene plays into the story play out exactly the same way just
in a less retarded way i don't buy the you have to have everyone in your story be retarded in order
for this to happen no yeah if you need a sacrifice moment you can make it happen that isn't the exact
same way but in the same spirit i have to understand tlg tlj could only have ever been
like this it could not have been at all different from what it is apparently is tlg like the last
tlg the last artist guardian okay that's the one and then others even though none of them are
inherently more important than the rest artists are constantly faced with these kinds of trade-offs
where they can choose to sacrifice the logic of a scene to a degree in order to improve implying
that the logic in the scene is actually something they care about and then you ask why and then you
find out there's a principled argument and then they sacrifice that principle the second they want
to cheat i just feel so bad for all the writers out there that are going like putting in a
painstaking amount of effort to have their stories make sense as opposed to writers like ryan johnson
and colin trevorrow who clearly don't give a shit about that kind of thing and you're having
morons like just right and patrick williams defending this garbage so you have writer one
completes in a year and it looks like the last jedi writer two spends five years and it's the
last jedi boat way superior and then he's like just right what do you think about my story i
worked really hard and he goes it was pretty great uh no better or worse than tlj because
ultimately tlj couldn't have existed in any other way you'd have to sacrifice emotion if you wanted
logic and the guy wrote the five-year story is like wow there's no purpose there's no purpose
to putting in effort into your writing if this is if this can be accepted this is the whole purpose
of having a standard for objective quality i mean does he redraft this just right read i doubt it
if i could if i could uh just agree with with just right and patrick and just change a word
in their arguments like yes it couldn't have been this retarded unless it was this retarded that's
what i agree that's true yeah i can agree to that man just the other day i was like showing
some of my writing to fringy and i showed him like the the notes of like okay this is how the
thing is gonna go please tell me if this sounds retarded because i want someone to tell me if my
ideas are fucking stupid and i need to rethink them yeah but wolf why the fuck do you bother
like i mean i just can spend an hour an hour and a half a year and a half uh a year and a half
writing the book i'm working on now just to get the first draft done and i'm still trying to think
okay what's wrong with this how can i fix it how can i make it better and then go from there if
anything you should just right by the seat of your pants don't redraft at all and then just
crap it out if anything is happening have a character get killed in a really dramatic way
if anything a logical is going on just distract the audience why am i wasting my time putting
why do you care why do you care about making it good about making your story make sense
and not contrived and logically consistent why do you care wolf it doesn't matter it's all
subjective life apparently yeah idiot but other qualities of the film here's another star wars
example that is the purest version of this it's often said the first star wars film was saved in
the edit you can check out rocket jumps video for more on that and one example of the editing
changes to the film is that the original edit lacked the ticking clock elements in the finale
instead of the death star being moments away from blowing up the rebel base which imbues the scene
with an incredible amount of tension and makes the heroes feel like underdogs the original ending
had them being the aggressors the death star was just hanging out in space somewhere and the rebels
went and blew it up but changing the ending introduced a handful of plot holes leah says
that their ship was being tracked and yet the heroes foolishly lead the villains directly to
yeah but it's with the risk because they have the plans it's with the risk because they have
the literal plans to the death star that can get them to destroy it yeah she acknowledges the idea
that she says this in the film and you consider that something the film isn't acknowledging it's
like weird so a plot hole i feel would be um let's say that uh the empire is not actually tracking
them but then they somehow find a way to uh get the death star over to yavin four but there's no
established uh like like there's no throwaway line or anything that would explain how the
empire would be capable of doing that that would be a plot hole this isn't a plot hole
this is as an idiot all we would necessarily desperately need is for her to say
that um uh it wouldn't matter if they're tracking us because x or that we're desperate to get these
plans to the team but that's what i thought was implied when she says they're probably tracking
us and that's why we escaped easier they have the most important thing in the world on that ship and
it needs to go to the people who can actually do something with it the rebel base on the moon of a
planet called yavin the death star teleports into the rebel bases solar system but on the other
side of the planet meaning that they have to wait hyper spaces moon base when they could have just
teleported right next teleported stop saying teleported why is he saying that you know we
talked about this on a previous efap but when you get key flags that give away that someone's not
actually the fan of something teleport styles you're like okay baller do you remember that
video i think we watched it on my channel last year uh from annihilation when that one guy was
like they walk into another dimension it's like it's not another dimension it's on the other side
of a wall you dimension it's like a sign of a dimension you don't know what a dimension is
if that's what you think is another dimension is the exact same thing why are we surrounded by
idiots what is wrong with these people and yeah the idea that yeah so they turned up um they're
on uh currently if i'm wrong yavin is the planet they're on a mood yes yavin four the fourth moon
of yavin so for the the empire unfortunately when they turn up yavin a one-to-one on the opposite
end of the planet so they have a choice of i suppose they could blow through yavin um and then
charge the death star backup but i can't remember what the charge time is on the fucking laser or
they can move around it which takes x amount of time the idea that they could have just hyperspaced
past i don't know that that's even possible that they can just hyperspace to like a few meters
we don't know they can do that that doesn't sound like that would make very much sense if you
hyperspace just a few meters i suppose they could have hyperspaced away by x amount and then back
by x amount but the thing is they were right here they're about to shoot them and the very important
detail and this doesn't apply to tlj when people go ah you see hux chose not to attack the people
because he's stupid this is tarkin does not believe for a second that they actually can destroy
the death star he doesn't even consider this a ticking clock he's like no they have no chance
i'm axing you mauler i'm axing you you know what are you willing tarkin wasn't wrong tarkin wasn't
wrong he used the fucking force to nail that shot hmm tarkin's a good guy i talking for 2020 present
i agree i miss talking i mean he the competence of the fucking empire was just him personified
the entire idea of uh the of the death star immediately firing off to tap has me has this
great visual in my mind of the thing just appearing in the system and just immediately snapping off
a shot and then just teleporting away again yeah teleporting by the way like a troll like hello
mauler i'm axing you are you willing to give hux leeway for being arrogant he called him a boy
oh no to the moon and at any time they could presumably shoot their laser at the planet and
let the rebel base spin out of orbit now if you were in the shoes oh so yeah but that wouldn't
have stopped like like them from exist you know like blowing up the thing directly versus throwing
them off orbit i don't know if i was making decisions i'd be like maybe we should just
obliterate them it would be better because we're trying to erase the rebels not you know who knows
how much they could escape if we just throw them off orbit who's of the great marshall lucas the
editor on the original star wars wait did you just say the great marshall lucas what makes it great
i think that was just because of uh heard decisions as i don't know i'm making fun of him
but there's no such thing you're right you're right i'm sorry it's just i i'm i'm forgetting
that he's being a total fucking inconsistent hypocrite here i mean but you know what he's
consistently inconsistent he is he is arguing that inconsistencies are not a bad thing and he
is being inconsistent himself and he's being consistent with that at least which looks like
he's wearing a dog on his head hey man it was the style at the time two versions of the film stand
before you the whole thing has already been shot there is no third solution so you have to choose
do you and georgie released the cut that has tension for the one that georgie logical
that's not the case just right that's not actually the case you've just said it is
sorry there is not an objective answer to this question
said what is more logical what is more tension filled so he's objectively making those statements
no yeah yeah he's claiming that those are the case one of them is more tension filled one of
them does make more sense yeah he's he's you're able to be just begging the question here he is
just begging the question here and he doesn't have like an alternate point of view to scrutinize
the bullshit that he's spewing can i ask you guys a question go for it yeah where did kunt and hume go
i don't know i missed them yeah i like the idea that he was like kent had many opinions on star
wars first of all the y-wings were not and you're like wait wait wait hold on a minute
oh and by the way this to me is just residue from his experiences with with not only me but
a lot of people who would have criticized his channel he's he spent so little on philosophy
just to be like star wars isn't that bad okay trying so desperately to justify his love for
this piece of shit fucking movie listen listen me high cheek sent me high said this thing a long
time ago and that means that star wars the last jedi is okay all right
no this may all just seem like a semantic grievance to insist that the terminology of
objectivity versus subjectivity is wrong here but i think it's more important than that
kent and hume disappeared like that damn knife and wolf's patience
this is i remember i can't believe i joined just in time to hear him say the dumbest thing ever
yeah that's probably the dumbest thing he said throughout the whole video so nice job your
timing was just immaculate there christ subjectivity is wrong here but i think it's more important
than that implicit in the terms is a hierarchy the idea that objectivity is better than subjectivity
no since when no um so if i tell you that i feel that endgame is blah blah blah and it does
this shit for me and then i go objectively speaking it's a it's poor spaghetti narrative
where everybody is making poor decisions to make the narrative run smooth that doesn't then make
me go well uh the subjective my subjective take and go out the window no one's ever going to talk
about that because objectivity is better than it the uh my fundamental reasoning for why i like
the discussion of objectivity is because it's the part that we can all agree on
what we took away from it personally is the part that we take away with ourselves and we can share
it with each other but we can't share the experience as in like i don't know i fucking adore
civil war but i can't make wolf adore civil war i can only explain to him what i think what gives
me those feelings and then he can understand them and be like yeah i still don't experience what
you're getting and i'm like yep that's just the way it goes for example how about i think the gray
is amazing but i probably don't think it's like i don't have the same experience watching it as wolf
does or how about um the mission impossible fallout debate we convinced ren that it's not
a bad movie he doesn't like it that's okay but he agreed it's not objectively a bad movie
yeah like this does exist there are people that are capable that just to get out of the
rest of the debate that is true that is only ever said he did also unlist he did also unlist the
video actually that he made oh okay well that may mean maybe i'll rescind that i think i think
that he genuinely got like a change of heart or mind about uh saying that it's objectively a
bad film and he understood that he made a bad video on it so i mean that's unironically our
goal and i'm not going to say it's an altruistic goal because some people be like well you try to
fucking make people change their minds i'm like well i mean i don't know say to a degree but
ironically my goal is to delete my channel before the end of the year well there's only a couple of
buttons but we'll yeah i mean we can always kill him to prevent that from happening yeah um i've
only been interested in drawing the line between the two and if someone said to me but maula you
always talk about the objective elements not your subjective experience so of course you value one
of the other i'd be like oh well it depends on what the topic is if we pick the stuff that's like
criminator 2 for example would be something that's really close to my my my cold dead heart
uh buffy and angel are um aliens films that i watched when i was super young and then i can
talk about some experiences i have with them and why i adore them to the ends of the earth but
they're also you know there's reasons for that and then i can talk about them but um
i've been subjective in my videos it's usually when i can't make an argument for uh why something
is poor uh beyond a preference i have which is absolutely fine because that's what we do
um and then there are times where i might admit that despite being tisme i actually still kind
of like it but oftentimes when i'm redrafting i'm like do i need to say this i don't know
do people it depends on how interested my fans might be on my personal feelings on a thing
which is a thing that happens you'll get people who are like where did you see shazam for example
did you like it and i'm like just as a aside thank you to being mauler and blessed southpaw
for fucking telling me that movie was shit because i was like on the verge of wanting to go see it
because the trailers were like hey that looks not terrible but then you told me it was terrible and
i was like oh okay well yeah like there's fucking bullies that carry nunchucks on school property
when they establish like five minutes before that that the school has uh metal detectors and
they and the bullies fucking beat up a disabled kid on school property in front of a bunch of
people who all don't do anything and then there's like this little eight-year-old girl or whatever
that tries to do something about it she doesn't get picked for uh shazam's champion uh even though
the criteria that shazam needs is someone who's pure of heart so obviously he goes for the much
older kid who is more capable of fighting off those bullies who decides walking away
until they say something that personally offends him because they make fun of the disabled kid for
not having a mom which the main character shares in common yeah and then you've got the fucking
tv with the news report in the mall and oh my god there's so many fucking problems in that movie
yeah i'm sorry to everyone in the chat that likes shazam but it's a bad film sorry
so uh i was very unimpressed which is absolutely where i watched it with battle in fortier and
battle was ripping into that film so much it was so much fun uh oh by the way metal watched john wick
three and he got so upset about how terrible it was he demanded i come into a conversation with
him so he could rant it was quite funny that movie was so i am forgetting most of it just
like john wick two it was i don't think i've ever said it on the chat but or on the chat
in on a stream but i i walked into john wick three on vacation because i had nothing else to
do with my time and it was raining and i was like okay i'll watch a third one when the movie opens
up with john wick running with the fucking other dog i had forgotten john wick two so intensely
that i genuinely didn't even remember where the second dog came from and i and i was i was so
confused for like a good 10 minutes until i was like whatever i don't care anyway the knife fight
was cool it was done but it was done with john wick two and three i like i enjoyed how stupid they
got i liked the knife fight and i liked the the scene with the dogs that was pretty great um but
the story itself is not good i like that the fucking german shepherds were more relevant to
the plot than fucking john wick was i like i like summing up the plot to someone who has no idea
what the plot is and being deliberately vague so it's like john must go to a library to collect a
necklace to go to a russian lady to get a boat that takes him to like saudi arabia to get
instructions on how to go to a desert to be found by a man once he's near death that can chop off
his finger to be able to get out of the fact that he killed a guy on continental grounds
you'd be like what the world building is stupid i love the fucking like you pointed out mauler
every single character is like i can't help you three seconds later okay i'm helping you now
ironically i think they usually go um i can't help you but i won't help you anyway and then
he talks for five years is like okay john fine john i'll help you but guys the assassin vatican
though the action in that the action in that film is super impressive from how it's choreographed
and shot but the story is terrible i'm sorry it's the secret order of assassins we should
stop having fun talking about movies we need to hear more from just right and make sure we
watch this video fully no no fuck just like he's gonna teach us it's gonna teach us and that we
have to agree on what something is objectively first before we can even get into subjectivity
the terms empower those who want to end discussion rather than oh
oh shit remember the guy who said that earlier he wants to they actually think that we want to like
stop it like prevent people from having different perspectives and stuff it's like no
and as rags point out if anything it encourages it because people want to challenge the statement
can i can i point something out uh maul you might need to push the video forward like just a second
or so because i'm noticing something about these bombers i'd never noticed before that is okay so
at the bottom of the bombers there's that little glass ball turret yeah but it's on it's really
far back i think that's where the bombs drop out from so the gun is pointed right where the bombs
drop out from want to so if so if the bombs drop out and he's shooting the cannon he might shoot
one of the bombs and blow up the ship itself yeah but i assume they'd be aware of it i think it might
actually be in front of her not behind don't be so funny if they were shooting and then they drop
the bobs just sorry no wait no don't shoot dude dude as one bomber takes out the entire
bombers like a ball sack they do oh my god what is it oh ryan johnson by the way i'd like to pause
it as crazy as this sounds hot take subjectivity tends to end discussions i'll give you an example
hey wolf fucking the gray is bad because all the characters are like the same
don't ever say that's my opinion your opinion it's his opinion wolf shut up shut the fuck up wolf
i've reached that point in discussions many times where you're trying to hash something out and then
it just falls back to someone's opinion you're like can't we still discuss the references and
stuff like that oh what is your opinion on meteor x's again and again i'll say it now
video is coming out it'll be my last and it'll be a three-hour one there's a lot of work to do
but i i love it i really love it and we're gonna talk about it it'll be a long video i'll be the
longman now in discussion rather than those who want to encourage it okay so up until this point
i've been arguing about why it's impossible to say whether a piece of art is objectively good
and you've done a horrifically bad job also can i just say object it's impossible oh i guess the
discussion's over sounds like an objective statement to me yeah yeah and if you want more on this
oh no
i'd like to i'd like to
press f for wolf sanity
oh
can we just not even watch the rest of this video we know what it's gonna be
like what's even the point of even pretending like we give a shit
it's such a terrible person it's okay i'm a terrible person too
it came along this topic which just came out last week and touches on a lot of things i haven't
talked about here but i also want to speak more broadly about why the things that are typically
brought up in these kinds of discussions aren't as important as they are often treated mainly
plot holes and i want to make the case so i have a question are we going to watch his uh game of
thrones season eight review after this the plan was actually to watch his video on the last jedi
and the seven basic questions of narrative drama but we'll save that for another time and
i we're nearly at six hours and it takes me because his game of thrones yeah his game of thrones
review of like of season eight like he's basically going with the objectivity type analysis
it's so confusing for him to make that video after making this i mean in my
the comparisons i had with him in the future compared to his season seven analysis of game
of thrones you remember he just goes back on a whole bunch of shit it's a shame honestly but
he evolves and there's nothing we can do about it he evolves and then devolves and then evolves
again revolves that's what they call that in my opinion other kinds of criticisms are
from my perspective just playing better
now a lot of greatness limitations of logic based a lot of great how dare we use watch dude i like
the idea that he's like let me tell you about the limitations of logic yeah you got patrick
williams there it's the holy trinity i was about to say those seals people the events are assembled
shut up about plot holes is unironically such a fucking bad video it it helped kick start
efap that's episode three i believe two actually yeah because i think that's when we yeah this is
the time people were like do more of these and we will and this was like the perfect video for it
and it feels that's just a really fun people that the people that made efap are jerry genesis
tone of thrones yeah and patrick williams three pillars of efap warrior
founding does uh does jonathan does jonathan mackintosh count with his i think so
i've already talked about this too i recommend checking out patrick gage williams video on it
as well as film crit hulk's essay the point i want to make you couldn't have made a better video
honestly than this like citing all of like the efap enemies i will it's like this is the prenup
band this is the this is the start to the 50th episode we're getting this like this is the
thing this video feels like episode eight of like a season this feels like the straw man we would
come up with like the the like really ridiculous idea we would come up with like man can you imagine
what a just right video would be like he'd probably cite jack saint patrick williams
and then he unironically does it well yeah i was just saying like this is you know who
knows what we'll cover in that 24 hour and this is like uh this is like foreshadowing i'm surprised
that this wasn't picked for the 24 hour everybody's been wanting us to cover this for so long it's so
this video is just like this video is horrible someone said he should have just titled this
video shut up efap this this how they massacred my philosophy this video is absolutely one of the
worst that you guys have covered like i will accept that the jack saint video that he yeah
that the the um hatchet job that he did on mauler is the worst when satan one and satan two decided
to lie about everyone satan ren saint ren's video on fallout is the worst representation
of a film i've ever seen on youtube ren you're a nice guy i respect you a lot but that was a
terrible video and i will never ever take that back um this is up there though this is up there
with with the worst that's been covered on efap i can't remember we've covered a lot of videos
remember the extra credits major lee's video yeah oh boy extra credits major lee
subjectivity is implied patrick williams i mean there yeah like the right opinion
it's gonna say we've covered like a cavalcade of horrible it's only the best for us
i just want to say that this picture of the old woman like glaring at the screen
it's like what i looked like during my initial rant before i lost my collective fucking mind
in this stream yes oh i i forgot i forgot you later i forgot legal legal oh god you this is
what i mean i i feel like we say that it's the worst video we say that too much on you we do
and i'm sorry it's just hard to know because in the moment they're all the worst video
the point i want to make about plot holes is this they are usually not the real reason people
didn't enjoy a movie there are all other fucking horse shit side sign sources foul beating you
didn't really dislike it because of the issues in the story you actually disliked it because
of something else that's the real true actual legitimate very the mark of a true critic is to
tell other people why they feel things okay so the solution the solution to a to uh problem to
the to the conflict in your story is something that should not be possible again the astronaut
murderer that who's on the moon when the victim on earth is killed that there's no explanation
for how this happens and it is the crux of the story so yes that ruins the story that that's
an exaggerated example of course but there are other ones that i can't really think of them off
the top of my head there's a ton of them in the last jedi and dark knight rises and fallen kingdom
that are ruinous to those films i can i i i can't comprehend all of this this is too much stupid for
my head to process yeah i should probably i didn't word that well what i meant to say was what a
critic uh tells you how you're lying to yourself i guess or the implication that he's saying that
we've been lying to people about why we actually don't like a thing so so is it
is it not object is it not subjective then if we can just pin it down like that there is there is
a truth to why i didn't like something rather than simply the experience i had to them meaning
subjective i like it it is true this is why you didn't like it i don't care what you think
in your head your head is so oh it's so presumptive and so fucking i like that their side i like that
their side of the aisle is always like you guys are trying to say that you can't like things like
your opinion is objective you you're telling people they can't like movies and then this
motherfucker is coming here and telling us why we don't like movies the true reason we don't like it
i'm curious not to mention not to mention that they're also the ones that tell us that we're
watching movies wrong oh yes hey cited that videos being great criticisms uh the real reason
great response luckily luckily i can say that we only have four minutes left because
i can guarantee that last two minutes is going to be like a square space ad oh let's hope so
people didn't show spare or so i know so because he always puts a giant chunk of his videos toward
an ad at the end i mean we've this is my favorite part we've earned an ad i think the ad is like the
reprieve from the video there are almost always deeper and more personal issues with a film that
prevented people from connecting with it which aren't as easy to identify or articulate as plot
holes are but plot holes are very easy to explain and since you didn't like the movie and the plot
hole is a problem in the yes so just right just you know not being condescending here but the reason
a plot hole will bother someone so much it's because it'll fuck entirely with the stakes
and the stakes for the whole reason that you were invested in the progression of the events in the
first place ie danny cannot possibly take king's landing because there's about a thousand scorpions
when three of them killed her dragon in the last episode and then the the show just says nah she
can yep so now we're like okay so anything can just happen then fuck it why am i even watching
so bruce wayne traveling from where the fuck is stan to gotham with no montage showing us how
exactly he does it um that's not necessarily a plot hole because it doesn't contradict any prior
information but it would definitely be a giant blank that needs to be filled in by the filmmakers
and not the audience yeah i'd call it an extreme convenience it's because basically he's spawning
resources off screen that the writers don't feel the need to actually come up with themselves and
i really appreciate that spider-man far from home actually did the exact opposite of this mauler we
we talked about this a while ago so far from home spoilers warning um peter ends up in the netherlands
because he gets hit by wait wolf you've seen far from home right you can you can explain this
without your spoilers he ends up in a similar position as batman and he finds access to a phone
and then he calls someone he knows to help him they show that on screen they just take a couple
of minutes of screen time to show it and it makes sense and they then are able to show how he gets
to where he needs to be instead of being in a different country from from where the action is
happening so far from home does exactly the opposite thing even hobs and shah actually they
they they have characters travel from one country to another and then they briefly have a little bit
where they're talking to the guy that hooked them up with a plane that got them to where and they're
they're talking about this so the very least there's a throwaway line about how they got there
this is basic elementary bullshit about how to tell a story they're not real reasons to enjoy
or not enjoy the true reasons are much more meaningful and intrinsic no no they're not real
i am in this theater and i'm wondering how the hell did bruce wane with i'm assuming did they
take away his like brace apparently not because that's i don't know why they didn't take it like
brace and then and then fucking no no wealth no resources that we know of or that are established
and then he just makes it back to gotham in time to save the day after he spends his entire day
painting a bridge and gas yeah he fell into the trap that's not a real criticism real ones involve
much more meaningful things that's not meaningful just so he just explained how you fell into the
trap of assigning a film to a plot hole rather than the real actual times two reason to explain
yeah since you didn't like the movie and the plot hole is a problem in the movie it's very easy to
fall into the trap of saying you didn't like the movie because of the plot hole and i believe this
it's very easy to fall into the trap of thinking hold on a minute he just said he just said the
plot hole is a problem in the movie is that objective uh oh you didn't agree with us on that
i don't like the movie and the plot hole is a problem in the movie it's very easy to fall
into the trap of saying yeah because he's tacitly agreeing here the plot holes are an
actual problem and thus but but they're not meaningful problems they're not actual real
super yeah such a solution so slippery conflict if the solutions here conflict
relies on a plot hole the stakes are gone the the immersion is broken
he's very slippery this man saying you didn't like the movie because of the plot hole and i
believe this because there are a bunch of movies with a ton of plot holes that pretty much everyone
really likes remember what i said about the dark night a million years ago when this video started
admit i wouldn't be done with my fucking intro at this point this video's it's been going so long
is he really does feel like that as more plot holes than any movie you can name the joker's plan
makes no logical sense in virtually every scene he's involved in it requires him to have information
he couldn't possibly have moved things to places they couldn't possibly get to or need literally
months of planning despite the fact that he claims that he doesn't plan anything okay but
that doesn't necessarily mean he's like origin story like that doesn't mean he doesn't plan
anything that's dumb the crazy man told us he doesn't plan he must not plan he this whole
thing is that he's insane he's just trying to fuck with people also just right pro tip pro tip
the references not just vague statements like is bad is bad is bad i need a reference give me
get to or need literally just because yeah hold on pause it just because he says that he he doesn't
have a plan when he says do i look like a guy with a plan doesn't mean that he's telling the
truth there especially in a scene where he is manipulating harvey dent doesn't don't they say
at one point that he um all of his clothes are custom made with no like traceable elements
idea being that he plans to wear things that can't possibly give away any of his history
yeah that sounds like a plan
but he doesn't make plans the crazy man the crazy man said he doesn't make plans
yeah he told us he doesn't plan it's not like even though literally every single thing he did
in the kind of requires a very complex plan like the first scene you know which needed an extremely
complex plan to kill everyone and still get away but it's not like there's told us it's not like
there's anything in the movie establishing that the joker is very competent and would probably
have several backup plans in case one of his uh first plans didn't work out this is like the
whole thing with like in in fallout how that whole thing makes sense is like you're talking
about spies that are very competent at their jobs they can improvise pretty well when things
go south i would say that the joker is probably the same way i'd be willing to accept christens
if you just like give me one you know like you just give me a specific one just right don't just
be vague it's the fact that he claims that he doesn't plan anything money doesn't burn this
fast what happened what you okay put oil dalston gasoline you fuck i'm pretty sure they poured oil
on it yeah i did okay i haven't seen it in a couple years but i'm almost positive they poured
gasoline on for him yes because you know what's actually happening no no no what's actually
happening i remember it i remember it so they're pouring gasoline on the money the chechen guy
is confused and he's asking about why burn the money so it's before joker even throws the fucking
match on the money when they know oh you're gonna burn the money because you're pouring gasoline on
the money and why would you pour gasoline on the money i was gonna say i got i got control over
good old efap i'm just gonna play the clip in the background so that people can see it pouring
gasoline man is upset and they continue to pour it and sorry just right the first time you make a
reference and you fuck it up that's not exactly how to look at everything so far he literally
can't be correct on anything no no no no no no mauler mauler mauler let me let me let me do this
for for just right okay listen that's a that's a small detail it's only there for a couple of
seconds and it might be cgi you know it was too small for the amount of fire that was made
even if we give him this criticism like did you guys know that apparently all floors with a film
are equal in size purely just right no degrees of scale to it just right go fuck yourself go
i can't wait to evolve as a critic myself and become a fucking idiot like him
taking movie scenes out of context taking movie scenes out of context to concoct a plot hole
from thin air fuck you this is fucking garbage video creator you're terrible
let's just hear it again though it's just for the fun of it information he couldn't possibly have
moved things to places they couldn't possibly get to or need literally months of planning despite
the fact that he claims that he doesn't plan anything money doesn't burn this fast what happens
at the party after batman jumps out the window how come no that's not a plot hole what happens
at the party after batman leaves is not a plot hole god damn it just right like the plot the plot
didn't hinge upon that party you idiot like yeah is it like he wants to know if if the joker killed
any people or if the joker just left yeah i don't know yes recording the issues is purely a tally
trap thing there's no scale or scope i like it see and this is the thing like i like it if they
make fun of people like cinema sins it's like at least cinema sins is like partially accurate
okay so hold on hold on does anyone remember what the purpose was of joker showing up at that uh
getting a kid my pavi dent and harvey dent wasn't there so well as far as the joker news yeah well
exactly i mean yeah harvey dent was there but he was hidden so the joker sees that harvey dent is
in there so he leaves instead of massacring everyone there which i think is fine like
i i don't i don't get why you're expecting him to just massacre all those people i'm like
well if you remember just right said this movie is filled with more plot holes than any film you
can name you're right because money doesn't burn that fast he's gonna need to try harder
get out get out of that get out of that money doesn't burn that shit yeah that's true
oh there's a good video i like this video this video hurts yeah
you guys go to entertain yourselves i gotta write this whole thing down entertain myself okay okay
okay how they never showed they never showed how bain's mask was made are you kidding me
it's a plot hole in dark night rises all right i'm done i'd like to imagine that just right forgot
that dark night rises even happened and when he went to make this he was like okay okay how do you
well while just right kind of forgot that the dark night rises happened the efap guys definitely
did not no and it's because of how much we probably fucking loved the dark night and that's
why we remember the dark night rises being terrible i can't wait i can't wait to make
an eight hour long video series talking about why that movie is one of the worst written movies
i've ever seen that was the first batman movie i ever saw too
i see i was the only person in my group of four friends who thought it was terrible everyone
was like no man it was great and um i hold this over alex's head forever smile around
he said it was the best of the nolan trilogy when we came out of the cinema and i was like um
that is like milk well if i laid off these days he'd be like no it's fucking terrible it's like oh
it's like the subjective take can change and the objective take does not assuming it's accurate
yeah drivers are alarmed that one of them drove into a bank and how did the joker still get away
with this why does a cop stand inside the cell with the joker when they all okay so why is the
cop stand the cell i mean sure that yeah i'll give him that one actually that could be an issue
of incompetence it's still not on the same scale go ahead i was just gonna say it's a brightly
lit room and they have access to all of the double-sided mirrors i don't see why they need
someone in there yeah and i agree with that but i would like to say again he's saying that he's
using the dark knight instead of the dark knight rises and i would say that the decision to send
all the all of the police into the sewers at the same time in the dark knight rises was significantly
dumber than this this is a terrible example to use it's like i think he's he's using the dark
knight instead of the dark knight rises specifically because he knows that the dark knight rises is
going to be it's going to have fewer defenders than the dark knight he's using this because he
wants to show that even great films have plot holes which doesn't plot hole isn't the reason you don't
like a film because great films have some but even if that were true that wouldn't necessarily
if anything you might be bolstering our position yeah that subjectively it could be amazing while
still having objective issues anyways the people in chat saying in fairness the joker says a bunch
of shit that pisses off this guy he does that after this scenario begins like i think it actually
made the scene a bit stronger if the joker was talking at the mirrors like goading the people
behind them and then one of them came in to beat the shit out of him and they fucked up
okay so let me let me try another defense um so uh the joker and this cop have a have an exchange
where uh the cop basically reveals that the joker has killed a couple of his friends
so is it possible that the cop got in there in the first place because he wanted an opportunity
to come at the joker well if you were going to make it that evening there's no reference for
that we'd need that he's just standing there casually and then the joker says you want to
know which of your friends were cowards i think that's the line and then he like looks at him he
says i'm going to enjoy this and takes off his coat and it's like if you that's like after the
fact if you had that before i probably let it slide i'd be like yeah but as it stands it's like
wow it's fucking convenient for the joker to have a guy in there and you see what we're doing here
this is the process of objectivity where we're trying to come up with different reasons for why
this would still be a problem or why it wouldn't be a problem and seeing which one holds up against
scrutiny better i think that your argument there mauler stands up to scrutiny better than
my defense unless there you go and that's the thing you know you didn't respond well in my
opinion is fine because it's like oh okay that ends the conversation then then the conversation
stops and you're like oh oh yeah i guess depends at the party after batman jumps out the window
how come none of the bus drivers are alarmed that one of them drove into a bank and had
so how come the bus drivers weren't alarmed that one of them drove into a bank i'd say that
uh there's definitely something else may have happened there we don't know if the joker like
fucking just drove off with the bus we don't know if the buses were so like what the fuck just
happened there's not enough there's no necessary contradiction there's just a loose end what
happened next for the joker there and i think that it it does require a bit more than um like what
you could have done is have him drive out into some kind of alleyway all the smoke goes off him
and he gets onto the road and then he joins up with a bunch of buses at the back of the line
not necessarily in the middle of the line yeah yeah um so yeah i think that's fair
to a degree but i'm not sure how much of an impact it has how did the joker still get away
with this why does a cop stand inside the cell with the joker when they already have him safely
locked up since this creates the risk of a hostage situation which is exactly what happens
can you really get a fingerprint off a shattered bullet how did batman i mean that would be a tech
thing the film is telling us within its universe that it's possible to uh recreate the pieces of
the bullet and extract teaching i mean is it really possible to have the av of every single
person ever projected by the phones from this guy's like basement technologies like i mean yeah i
guess so is it is it really possible to have realistic looking rubber masks and voice changers
that allow you to basically mimic any person in the world no not in the real world but that's how
it's established in the mission impossible series so it's tough to make technology criticisms in
what is essentially like almost sci-fi stuff it's like soft film tells us it's not as far as
it's like it's like the nanotech for stock it just it is just in infinity war and someone could be
like hologram did he invent that it's like you know what it is that's it's not it's there
or like the holographic computers in iron man one and and all of the mcu like we don't really have
those to my knowledge in the real world i think we still have those that was 2008 that he first
had that this someone said is it really possible to be as dense as just right no he's uh he's not
from our planet and build the super computer while everything else is happening why is batman
so worried about not killing the joker when he very clearly kills several people in this very movie
so the shot that he just showed doesn't necessarily mean he killed people does it
it looks like they would have taken some damage inside the cell with the joker when they also
so there's this uh this concept of um there are some lives you can say that maybe there's some
lives that batman took there out of necessity due to the emergency of the situation and there's
not really a way for him to uh dispatch the threat and um preserve the lives of the people
that are causing that threat whereas what happens at the end there with the joker there is he has a
grapple gun that he's able to hit yeah he has a choice to kill the joker he has he has an
opportunity like whereas he's trying to save harvey dense life and all the cops that are
in the van with harvey dent and jim gordon um like he doesn't have uh that luxury in that scene
but he does is this i just want to look at that scene again because i don't know i don't think
this creates the risk because we do know that he kills harvey den at the end of the film but it's
to protect a family from being killed he technically kills him anyway he drags him off the edge and
folds with him so if it's anyone's fault it's of a hostage situation which is exactly what
happens he really get a fingerprint off a shattered bullet how did batman build the super
computer while everything else was happening why is batman so worried about not killing the joker
when he very clearly kills oh also he uh he tackles harvey dent off of a ledge to save
jim gordon's son and like i said the family because yeah yeah it's like there are instances
where you're not going to be able to save the lives of the innocent people and the life of the
threat but then there are cases where you could and if your principle is to preserve life whenever
you can uh like within reason basically then yes it's consistent for him to do this but there but
there will be some situations where look he's not god he can't just you know he can't control every
situation equally well it's part of what some have an issue with with this batman is that he's
not 100 not going to kill um more complicated than that i think and yeah the harvey dent does
get killed it's not something that he i don't think he desperately wanted to kill him it seemed
to be a he didn't do it in cold blood it was it was result of circumstances yeah while with joker
he has a choice to let him die or save him at no necessary cost other than fucking pulling a wire
yeah i think he would have saved harvey if he could have and these guys if he can dismantle
them or you know knock them unconscious without killing them i'm pretty sure he would have chosen
to do so but this seemed to be the necessary like i don't see this as any kind of contradiction
yeah several people in this very movie you could literally talk for hours about the logic in this
movie not adding up and yet people still love the film because it has incredible pacing probably
because there's a difference between objective and subjective how about that how about that
and besides strong on other merits and if you do he says that go ahead i was just gonna say that i
love he how he says we can talk for hours about how the logic of this movie doesn't make sense
and then he has yet to really bring more than one entire criticism that's valid yeah i would say
that like fucked up on one i was i would say that pretty much like all the crucial uh plot points
and the storytelling beats uh have a very consistent through line like the the cause and
effect uh that results in the the events of the dark knight taking place you like for the most
part makes sense even if yeah there's there's some problems here and there but again it's like it's
trying to take a film that has uh like a relatively low percentage of issues compared to something
like the last jedi like there is just a giant disparity in uh the number of issues that the dark
knight has versus the last jedi you can even accept that the dark knight is a very flawed film
but it's still going to have a much higher score than the average film um i want to highlight that
uh it's a long confusing day but it's the uh kirop loki and karloki and karloki and karloki and
whatever he said the um there's the uh the quote from the first film i'm not going to kill you
but i don't have to save you he says that to raz al ghul and then raz al ghul gets killed
so it's technically in line with his he's not someone who directly kills with his prior
established character and you you might be like listen inaccurate to him in the comics let's not
get into that the uh the character of batman at the dolan trilogy does seem to be on board with
the idea that people will die uh be it by his hand indirectly or as a result of desperately
trying to save people that's just realistic occasionally if you go out at night and beat
people to a pulp with your fists you might give one of them blunt force trauma and kill them
and there's many other situations it's just it's not very realistic
you know if you have absolutely no mortality rate when you're going out and fighting crime
i think that it's just kind of unless unless you're unless you're actually you know someone
with powers like superman or spiderman then it's pretty difficult to actually achieve a
zero percent mortality rate batman is just batman he's just a human being i have a question
at what point do we factor in the innate uh superhuman durability of film characters
because you know that's a thing like it just seems to be a natural thing in films where people
survive things that they they wouldn't if everything was played straight and i would happily
accept references for that i'm pretty sure they show batman takes a lot of damage and like even
isn't it alfred is like looking at him with loads of bruises and he's like
it's like how uh john mcclain would have died like 30 times over the course of die hard from
all the damage that he takes and john wick also like i think that john wick takes way too much
damage in all three of those movies there's no way that any the end of the third one that is so
funny but he falls off that 80 foot building being put here we're laughing off fucking asses
off watching that oh my god that was hits like four things on the way down to like straight up
gary osborne from spider-man three and i mean at least it breaks the impact a little bit of the
final fall but still have you guys heard of the bodyguard with sam jackson nope the bodyguard no
the film with him and i think it's the body is it something oh hitman's bodyguard that's what it's
called go to that no oh yes yeah yeah with uh ryan reynolds so there's a scene um in that film the
whole film is like a parody of action movies and i it's a comedy as well and i actually had a lot
of fun with it um there's a moment where sam jackson fucking jumps off like a building and
he slams into the side and like does a back flip slams his head on the back or something i think
i said like the trailer i like i burst out laughing and it's like one for one what's in john wick
oh my god like i want someone to do a comparison it's just like oh my god it's like the same fucking
thing john wick plays it straight yes awkward but uh anyway great acting compelling characters
intense action interesting provocative and relevant themes and gives the viewer the
on all those things like partially outside of interesting all of what he just said is provable
to a degree we can we can work with this regardless yeah although this is a tangible
does he remember what he was trying to say with this video
like half of this shit could have been in a video we made but you know we would actually
get our references right in the back and left for the vicarious sense of being batman along with
a hundred other reasons which all successfully distract you from its logical failings successfully
distract you implying that they are there regardless of whether you see them and isn't
that our whole thing what if they didn't what if they didn't successfully distract me i find this
fascinating he just fucking argues against himself but also again it's like so isn't he
kind of trying to argue here that any film that has uh like a certain number of plot holes is bad
like having any plot holes means that your movie is now bad as opposed to like having a few that
are like spread out pretty far across from each other in the film as opposed to being littered in
every single scene or every other scene like is is there is there not like a difference here
are they all the same apparently do you mean this degree he's he's he's trying to say that
the dark knight has more plot holes than any other film but he's not like he's listing uh
like what 10 different examples and all of the different things by the way not all of them are
plot holes and not all of them are valid as in like he's actually got the references wrong exactly
yeah if you have to make if you have to ignore context like them pouring gasoline on money in
order for your plot hole criticism to make sense maybe there aren't that many plot holes in the
dark knight because given that context you could have just picked a different one that was actually
valid huh how you like them apples just right hey he didn't he didn't notice your criticism so
it's not real yeah he didn't notice the fucking gas being poured on the goddamn money in the very
shot there are some terrible films where the logic holds up and some excellent films where it doesn't
now this is not to say that the logic of story never matters of course it does uh oh when does
it matter just right tell me when it does matter literally every choice in the artistic development
of a story matters and it's totally fine to have an appreciation for films that get the logic right
but what i'm saying is that to make up is he saying that winter soldier got the logic right i guess
maybe we had to cut back to that and then back to dark knight i don't know better case against
the film it's important to demonstrate why the presence of a plot hole impacts other aspects of
the storytelling if you notice a plot hole in one movie and not in the dark knight because the dark
knight has better pacing what not necessarily no no no not necessarily no it could be fucking
any reasons hell better pacing means better movie that was uh i i wouldn't even say that
the left jedi has they just came out of no way yeah aside from canto boy i wouldn't even say that
the last jedi has particularly bad pacing just a bad movie pacing's complicated to actually
like break down yeah what does he mean by that like the only time you notice plot holes when
it's badly paced how can you possibly remember the plot hole isn't the real actual literal
very real reason hey mauler i have a question for you do you feel like shazam was pretty well
paced overall in spite of its uh other writing issues because i felt like it was pretty well
paced so the part where the bad guy first gets to the kids and shazam is first having to deal with
that i feel like from that point but like you skip forward like 40 minutes and you're essentially in
the same position still in the story like they they really pad that shit uh and i remember i
was just looking at the runtime because i found the film pretty terrible but i would make an
argument against that particular portion of the film but i i think i'm going to agree with your
overall point anyway that pacing good pacing does not equal good film regardless of plot holes i
don't know yeah yeah because or like i don't know um there's uh i'm trying to think of like other
films that have pretty decent pacing where the plot holes are still noticeable because i think
the dark knight rises is a film with many plot holes and the pacing is pretty bad so it's not
as strong to counter argue here um but still like at least have solid pacing but there's a lot of
issues with them i think that like also the size of the plot holes in the dark knight rises are
significantly bigger than those in the dark knight again one cop being uh like like waiting in that
little cell with the joker or interrogation room sorry um is not as noticeably stupid as
literally sending every cop into the sewer it's stupid i will grant you that but there are
several orders of magnitude uh more stupid that the you know sending the cops into the sewers is
like that's just it's on a different level there are stuff that's just going to be more noticeable
because it's dumber if you understand how pyroclastic flows work the thing with star lord
surviving them in falling kingdom is going to make no goddamn sense well if he could survive
them so easily why do we care about them at all like you know oh they seem to not remember where
he shoots through the bullet proof ball yeah underwater where the bullet shouldn't even be
in fairness all i have to say about that is one when you see a bullet fired at the thing
in the first film it makes a crack i believe and in the second film that that uh ball has already
been like broken cracked and smacked by a bunch of things the idea being that its structural
integrity would be down i still don't think it should work but ultimately it doesn't necessarily
work he has to get the knife to do it robot head also mentions lisp batman's tech as a plot hole
making batman a plot hole in a batman film well this is the thing i don't think you can criticize
the batman tech we get told how it works and what it does and as long as it remains consistent with
what we understand about it it's fine the idea you're like batman shouldn't have i think one of
his critics was like how did he make it so fast that was something he said yeah how did he make
the supercomputer while everything else was happening we don't know how difficult it was
it might have been something that he just had to check a few boxes or i think he even says like he
he did a thing he took whatever lucious made and he made a few adjustments and now he's unlocked
the ability to blah blah blah and lucious is like whoa not something you should be using it for
are we given reason to believe that such a thing's improbable or highly unlikely or even impossible
i don't think so this matter why am i so committed to the idea that this kind of
criticism should occupy a smaller fraction of film i don't want to hear opinions i just agree with my
what is the correct fraction oh god so three reasons why we should stop talking about plot holes
as much as we do yeah not completely stop that remember despite this
despite an objective analysis being impossible we shouldn't stop we should only occupy a smaller
fraction so wait didn't he didn't he also cite patrick william's video shut up about plot holes
shut up implying it's not talking about them completely he just right is already in food how
we truly feel to let me infer how he truly feels he hates that we talk about it when it
comes to things he likes go ahead on things he doesn't like like game of thrones but do
not do it when it comes to the things he enjoys okay jesus okay such a bad video i lost a debate
against wolf and mauler and i despitefully prove them wrong because i'm too stupid to say it to
their faces and make myself look like even more of an idiot than usual i mean he fucking counted
himself in this video so we didn't even need to congratulations just right you actually made
yourself look worse in this video than you did in the debate against us three reasons first since my
channel is dedicated to writing and is meant to be useful to writers i think it's especially
important i'm going to be useful to writers if there's no way of getting better as a writer you
turnip you're talking for writers to embrace other forms of criticism analyzing the content
of media the ideas it's communicating and not just the form is the best way to improve the
content is the it would create the form since when do you not do that how is the
how is talking about plot holes not talking about the content just right can you hear me
out in the field of the straw who are you talking to prove your own writing if you treat
stories purely as logic puzzles to be solved i think you are only setting logic puzzles to be
solved what are you talking about who said any of this who are you talking to yourself up to produce
superficial pieces of art oh so if you follow our ideas you'll end up with superficial pieces of art
wait i'm sorry so uh mauler what uh what timestamp are you at right now
uh 1836 oh 1836 okay um i'm at 1840 so i'm um i'm yeah same here can we like
synchronize a little bit treat stories purely and now back at 1830 yes yes all right we'll stand
you for a second good night robot head he said he just liked to pop in and hate on stuff with us
night robot head um night robot head so sweet dreams if i was to this could be a straw man
as far as just right is concerned but i don't really care because i want to talk about this
regardless of if he's what is what he's actually saying the one we're babbling on about plot holes
and all this shit he's like what does the dark knight truly tell us about society and morality
or the ethical stance you take on how crime should be dealt with all of this stuff and we're
like but the bus is blue and it should be green that he's like oh my god these guys are getting
stuck on all the minutia and they're not actually paying attention to what the film means and
my position has always been fucking make a poem or a sentence if you want to talk about an idea like
should we kill or should uh i don't know should we protect children from the idea of death till
a certain age how important is innocence all the stuff it's like i don't if you want to say it say
it when you make a story to represent those ideas it's very important that the story does that so
when you go oh failure is the best teacher lol let's have poe not fail and then learn a stupid
lesson that gets near enough all of his team killed at the end because that supports the idea
that failure is the best teacher like if anything it's the reverse that success is the worst failure
to teach you how to be more of a failure like i don't even sound what the hell and then they're
sitting there like wow boy you're focusing all the might do show you don't take it to the the
less of the failure is the best i'm aware that you can learn from failures and if you're gonna
have a story that gives you that sort of presentation that idea i fucking hope to god that
you're consistent with those ideas otherwise you're gonna confuse the shit out of your fucking
audience see what you should be doing is talking about possible interpretations in wider literary
context for some because it's despite being a different conversation i like the idea that we
can learn shit from stories and we can draw large amounts of meaning as part of what makes
my favorite media my favorite but good god i can't stand it if they bungle their own message
and you need to be logically consistent fucking nine times out of ten to be able to do that
obviously comes down to context tell me a message does not stand if it is poorly communicated or
poorly expressed through the work you know what work telling us that there is that message by
definition yes how about the fact that uh shazam tries to try to depict billy as uh being selfish
and mean with his powers and in order to deliver that message they're having it come from a
handicapped boy who's been exploiting these powers himself yes living vicariously through billy
to give context to what southpaw just said you have this character who doesn't like getting
bullied and he's aware that his friend is a superhero so he's like hey superhero is going
to come here tomorrow and show all you guys it's like dude you shouldn't be doing that that's not
only like irresponsible blah blah blah and then he doesn't turn up and so the kid gets angry at him
for not turning up and then he criticizes him for spending his time entertaining people with
his powers and it's like you have no leg to stand on i know that's contextually cool you have no
leg to stand on when you're talking about that when your whole thing was i want to impress people
with you it's like you would do the exact same thing you have no right to complain it makes no
sense can i also just mention that there's an establishing shot in the movie where there's a
student watching a youtube video that these two have been uploading because they upload youtube
videos of billy testing his powers and uh not only can you hear freddy's voice behind the camera
in all of these videos but in a couple of them he actually like shows up like his entire body
shows up on camera and there is one that is being watched by another student on their phone so he
could literally just pull out his phone and pull up that video specifically or even just his youtube
channel go hey look i'm in control of the youtube channel that is uploading these videos of the
superhero and here i am i know the superhero so he doesn't even have to have the superhero come to
the school anyways so the the whole conflict could be resolved instantly if he just pulls out his
phone and opens the youtube app on it and then he he goes on to bitch at billy for being irresponsible
with his powers when he does not have any moral high ground whatsoever fuck freddy
all right
as logic puzzles to be solved i think you are only setting yourself up to produce superficial pieces
of art oh yeah and so i think your art would more than likely i can't say it definitively
but you're more than likely going to project much more of meaning if you can actually line up with
the fucking point you're trying to make with your story so in the case of the last jedi i would
actually have poe behead strong and maybe make a mistake that he can learn from and thus create a
better scenario in the end of the film instead of doing it all inverted and backwards because
for some reason ryan johnson doesn't have any idea what he's doing and if all you have is a theme
that's it it's like it's a nice theme so it doesn't even make sense the film's like okay
so get fucked up i see
you have to read deeply to write deeply second because the quality of art and the quality of
criticism are interrelated it's hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in
judging ill but of the two less dangerous is the offense to tire our patience than mislead
hey i'm sorry can we quickly address this tism in the chat ray day saying lol a child doesn't use
adult thinking movie bad mauler how would you respond to this exactly because i think that
i thought we were on the topic of the lesson of the film and we were saying that characters were
being conflicting with it also i'm not i'm with yms on this uh i'm not a huge fan of being like
oh it was a child character that did it then therefore it had to not make sense
yeah apparently childs have an idiot license even though this is like a 14 year old kid who's
established to be somewhat intelligent with some modicum of common sense and this is a common sense
thing where if you you know that you have the means to prove something to these bullies that
you want to impress and you don't do it so freddy's pretty level-headed outside of that moment that's
that's what i'm saying is he has a modicum of common sense throughout most of the movie i
don't understand how how this this i don't see how this is adult thinking you fucking moron
ray day sorry terrible argument wow we're just ripping into chat also uh
theo you can respond to this argument from just right go
nice poem it is hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in judging ill
but of the two less dangerous is thy i'm sorry what the the fence the fence to tire our patients
don't know what it is in this me mislead our sense some few in that but numbers are in this
10th century wrong for one who writes amiss a fool who might once himself alone expose
now one inverse makes many more in prose thanks buddy all right that's not an argument those lines
are the opening words of alexander pope's an essay on criticism published in 1711 i don't care
about alexander pope how dare you look at his hair that bad criticism does more harm than bad
writing since come up with your own ideas stop taking them from other people that critical more
than you bad criticism does more harm than bad writing we agree with that no i don't think that
we can even quantify it yeah and who is this who is this guy again pope he's he's the pope
oh the pope alexander oh alexander pope no it's no alexander the pope
it's bad criticism will influence more writers in the wrong direction so the implication being
just right that you think that we're into influencing writers in the wrong direction
while we would accuse you of that yeah i guess we're at an impasse except we have references
and you don't because you don't know how to reference bad stories to care about the shit
you're right about this ism creates the grounds from which great art springs and so if we want
better art we need better criticism i agree which is we gotta start with you buddy i want to know
good criticism is tea also yeah i'm sorry if we can't have good films how do we have good
criticism i'm curious how that works film discussions that are too focused on logical
inconsistencies will lead to art that is too focused on logical inconsistencies what a terrible
thing how dare art try to not be logically inept i love the idea that you have like there's a
supermarket getting held up and you have a character that may be a hero and it's like
wait i have to consider this logically would you have gone to the supermarket maybe he wouldn't
i can't have this scene you're like frank it's okay just have it so that he went to the supermarket
no logic dictates he would not go to the supermarket okay my vision is ruined
just a bit of advice just a bit of advice to you know everyone in the world if anyone under any
context says that logic or implies that logic is bad in literally any context you're in trouble
maybe you should maybe you should stop listening to them or taking them seriously hey hey mauler
i have a question for you and this goes to you too wolf and theo um would you rather watch
john wick 3 which has an absolutely stupid plot with like really cool action scenes that are shot
well and everything or would you rather watch mission impossible fallouts which has a great
plot and all of those great actions not even competition i will take the john wick 3 please
how dare you that's subverted my expectations this is you know anything with john wick i'm
waiting for the action scenes with fallout i was just like shit man what's gonna happen next
you're good all the way through you're not having to sit through a terrible story to get to the good
action all i'm saying is the hobo king assassin is hobo king oh do you know what uh go check this
anybody uh metal brought this up to me who's he's like an aspiring critic right now i i could
believe it if you slow it down when they say you're gonna get cut seven times the gut the
sushi salesman man cuts lauren's fish food six times oh there's six slice sounds and you can
clearly see six movements why doesn't he cut him seven times oh my god i'm getting alpha and omega
eight it was so funny because i was when he said it i was like oh you know it was probably seven
he was like no i checked it four times it's not and i was like okay i'll check it and i was like
oh my god it's six oh no you're on par with the alpha and omega but that's not a good thing
and yeah you know uh i need a hd vision because i had like a dvd vision or whatever but uh so
there's potential for me to be wrong but i'm almost certain there's only six slice sounds
so is that at least there's there's someone there's someone saying are there people who
watch john wick for the plot so here's the thing there is a lot of uh scenes in john wick three
that aren't going to have action in them as as a standard for action movies you can't have
action be literally 100 of the film so if those scenes are not well written then it's definitely
a less enjoyable experience than if you're watching an action movie that has a ton of
great action and also a great story to complement it and that was the purpose of that question
like it's the plot in john wick one so yeah i'd say john wick one is absolutely the best film
in the series yes can't believe you guys aren't on board with the assassin vatican
yeah you know what it's honestly perfect as a standalone film it's a well for me i wish
they never made more than one but uh i understand that people really like the actions silences in
the subway i adore how stupid the world building is it never fails to make me smile the whole like
when the hobo faction the assassin vatican yeah the hobo faction get wiped out by the sushi faction
the sushi assassin story character and theme i don't want future artists wait wait how are we
not going to mention there's like people getting stabbed in the middle of the subway and no one
fucking acknowledges that we got it we got to stay on track assassins too they've got to let the guy
you got to finish this video please we need to listen to it anymore all right consistencies
will lead to art that is too focused on logical inconsistencies at the expense of story character
and theme i do you notice how when he was writing that he's probably like they'll focus too hard on
it and then he was like oh wait i need to actually highlight why that's bad well it'll come at the
expense of character it's like stop that's not true you just said it's not true i could just
assume it is because for some reason you lack imagination it doesn't have to be that way
terminator terminator two mission impossible fallout predator there's a ton of movies that
can be just excellent on you know every level logically and also being like emotionally
satisfying and having even deep themes you don't have to sacrifice one for another you can strive
for excellence that's a thing that you can do you know you don't have to settle for mediocrity
there is a there is a a vert there's a far superior version to like every bad film
that has been made all that it took was just effort and care and talent
and and when go sorry nevermind go ahead all right it was just so close
actually i won't write this story since it doesn't make perfect logical sense nobody
fucking said that nobody on this fucking planet said i'm not going to write my story because
it doesn't make perfect logical sense you don't stop writing it you don't stop writing it you
sit down you sit down and you think about it for more than three seconds and then give up idiot
oh my god but i want to have to imagine having this mindset where it's like man there's a problem
do i fix it do i give up or do i just leave the problem in knowingly hmm which of the three oh
i'll just leave it in because i'm lazy terrible there is a version of the events that happened
by of youtube there there's there's a there's a version of game of thrones season eight
where like the events that unfolded were actually earned you know like it's out there somewhere
in the ether yeah the piece of work had to be it was made it couldn't have been any difference
different guy guy asked me if i have asperger i reflect i relate to so much you say and i too
have asperger i don't think i have asperger now no that's me we all have a bit of asperger inside
of us no i mean who wants to live in the universe ironically the wachowski sisters don't make the
matrix because their idea didn't adhere to the law of thermodynamics so now he's straw man the
shit out of us to say that we don't want them to make stuff unless it's logically consistent
perfectly like and also abiding by the laws of thermal thermodynamics i don't think that we'd
necessarily give a shit about that in science fiction per se i mean i think that when it comes
to i don't know way of surviving the vacuum of space that's a bit out there and indiana jones
surviving a nuclear bomb by climbing into a fridge that's also a little out there i think
that when you have jarring moments of like total unrealism i don't know if that's a word but i've
made it a word now in your film yeah that's going to stand out more than like having a scholar's
knowledge of the laws of thermodynamics fuck you just right and we want people to do the best that
they can but there's no fucking way you're not going to make at least one mistake like everyone
makes mistakes it's fine jesus like holy shit the idea is that you get better the idea is not that
you ryan johnson yourself and go i've not heard any fair criticism you know fucking grow do all of
the things and uh yeah judge a thing for what it is don't be i just give up idiot the idea
that we don't want any stories unless they 100 logically consistent it's like jesus christ i'll
take i'll take any story i just want to see what you did with it you know i said i was willing to
look at a tommy why so star wars film i'll do it gimme mauler i mean big shark is like unironically
i enjoyed the shit out of endgame it's still logically inconsistent but mauler we wouldn't
have gotten indiana jones and the crystal skull with ryres went you know what it's not going to
be realistic if indiana jones survives a nuclear blast by climbing into a fridge and shyla buff
swings on a bunch of vines with monkeys that's not realistic so let's not make it although actually
you know what never mind i'd rather that they have not made it but it's a pity that yeah
dynamics our culture would be immeasurably poorer for it yeah if this nightmare scenario
that nobody's advocating for came true we'd be worse off all right good job sure
honestly for both writers and non-writers i think this conversation matters because media analysis
can for lack of a better phrase nourish the soul it listen listen to this emotional music you got
playing in the background nourish the soul and that's why you're wrong about why you didn't like
the film nourish the soul man if that was true then i wouldn't be depressed ever
because my soul would be nourished that's why objective analysis is wrong because of soul
helps you make sense of the world often when we see a piece of art we are confused by it
confounded by it it's only through the act of creating and absorbing criticism that we can
bring sense no not even talking about sometimes art makes sense if you don't you don't necessarily
have to watch a critique of art like think about the people that made those critiques of
art in the first place obviously they understood it before without having to like watch someone
else analyze it that's bullshit there's some there's some art that also just doesn't require
any analysis that like that in order to make sense of something in the chat but who's the grandma guy
don't don't answer him don't answer him i just want to i just wanted to think for however long
it takes him to figure it out himself i'm sorry i just love the term grandma guy i i'm sorry i
just have to to to make this reference my grandma what massive teeth you have oh fuck i get it big
gay and bring the insights of that process into our everyday life the kind of criticism i think
you should seek out or produce is one that seeks to understand what is being communicated in a piece
of art a criticism and i think you should seek out for ones that communicate the idea consistently
instead of confusing the shit out of the audience because communicating ideas is is one element
communicating ideas is like contingent on the communication anyway
i mean fucking by his logic anyway the communication of whatever's being said
could be entirely subjective as he fucking pointed out with like how
styles is apparently religion versus science if you take one specific thing and ignore how
everything else contradicts it i'm sure he considers that valid because that was his point
yep that puts those messages into context one that demonstrates how art affects us both
personally and socially and that shares a unique perspective that can make something beautiful
even more so criticism can do so much more than say whether something is good or bad and
oh good i'm ready as if that's what we are only capable of anyway like we could only ever say
something is good or bad and then that's it the conversation's over yeah because in my three hour
upcoming metro exodus video when i criticize the hell out of a ton of aspects of it and give
very good reasons as to why it's bad and tell them how they can fix it i'm just saying that
the game is bad that's great and Jamie Lannister says he doesn't care about it once Jamie Lannister
says he doesn't care about innocent people all i'm going to say is that's bad and then move on
i'm not going to talk about him whatsoever not going to reference past
elements of his character not going to mention how it strips away everything about him nope
it's bad conversation starts at that i want to do more to show you what criticism can be that's why
this episode is the first name you miniseries on this channel which by the way he has not continued
yet this is the one and only spot please make up when i want to tear it to shreds thank you
no no no no no don't ever make another video again it was like a pilot please tell me what
Aristotle had to say about the arts it was a tv pilot for this aborted sitcom if they played one
episode of like all right we're done oh give me just right's reading of the birth of tragedy
i need that no did you know that there's actually there's a tv show that uh it was a sitcom called
ohio honey i'm home that was centered around adolph hitler and and how jews like move in next
door to him and his wife and it got canceled after one episode anyway oh god and all that i'll be
calling the history of arguments oh hilarious as if he's going through the arguments even a little
bit on the one hand i really want this but on the other hand how dare you sir well this is the
thing i would actually argue just right you're gonna do some damage to discussion if you make
this series how fucking dare you posit that you're gonna write a history of argument series after
what you did to kant and hume you fucking monster i'm i'm actually under the impression this might
be the most pretentious youtuber on the entire website it's pretty bad it's up there yep it's up
there i cannot believe i respected this guy i'm so embarrassed to say that i was ever subscribed to
you you should be embarrassed what about plato afra ben and oscar wild there is a 2000 year
long plato and oscar wild it's debating a small collection of interrelated questions that i want
to explore foundational questions like what is art what should it i don't think you're the man
for the job i'm sorry the killer one influence how we talk about art today i'm really excited
to get into all that and if you want to help ensure that those videos get made then click
on over to my patreon meaning that the reverse would be if you want to prevent these videos from
being made please unsubscribe chat chat please go to his patreons and fund him so that we can
have more efaps like this wait why would you both wolfeld ever agree no no i have a better idea
southpaw do you have a uh do you have a patreon i do not but i should set one up one and everyone
go to that one and go to mallers and theo you can probably set one up too i keep seeing people every
now and then in chat saying hey where's theos channel and then i get a little bit sad yes theo
hey look i'm working on it kind of i actually just like to think just support everyone that
is not just right everyone on the planet so literally every youtuber
i don't think you just meet youtubers i can like like support bryce o'connor an author who's
self-published who's actually good and cares about consistency go to his patreon he only has
like 36 patrons so go fund him making good books and don't ever give just write your money
trion and chip in as little as one dollar a video this video was brought to you by
so if you've seen my other videos then you know that this one looks very different than my previous
what with all these hands on is that his real name sage aden yeah i guess so i like the idea
that in the mission to go and support everyone who's not just right someone goes and supports
patrick williams because the hardest choices require the strongest of words now now we
need to be done the hardest choices for cool
oh that's good i think that's it for the video though we're good now
what a nightmare we made them there so many people wanted to respond to that for so long i
hope it was everything you wanted um i now have one hour and seven minutes to go through every
super chat good luck of so i'm gonna have to seriously machine gun through these in order to
get to them before splitting this in some kind of weirds like i don't want to do it so that i begin
the next efap responding to them because that's just we can't have a roll over here so that's
where he's thrown yeah i'm gonna have to do this i am sorry if we can't give detailed responses
to a lot of them but uh short answers only guys uh so at the first it's always good to see how
people come and debate with you guys in a chill manner and explain the point of view by the way
do you guys know the video made by make stuff the last jedi restoring balance to the star wars
fandom it was pretty horrible that i believe is in the backlog for a potential uh look at i probably
would like to have jeff and jeremy back on for those types of ones because it's just so funny
seeing the two sides of the quote unquote fandom and to let them see the toxic brood meme man that
was just glorious and that was with them so don't see um and the lackluster boycott what was your
opinion on once upon a time in hollywood if the panel has seen it i have not seen it i've seen it
i liked it i liked it a lot it's good uh a bit behind but that dude's name sounds like something
doodle bob from spongebob also hi-recks
hulu holds the title for longest video live stream at six days seven hours 11 minutes and 32 seconds
could efap be capable of beating that for episode 100 no we're not gonna i can't do that we couldn't
even do that if we wanted to because youtube caps us at eight hours or whatever so you know
like a continuous live stream would actually be halted hey theo's back howdy everybody hey
hello from evo 2019 oh that is but oh evo that's a big old fighting game event that sounds like the
gay nice nothing like efap on a sunday with some freshly brewed iced tea wonderful if a man pushed
thul from behind so in return he smashed him in his creamy meat stick into mjolnir do you think
people would defend him like captain marvel no it would be a sexism even if he did it to a guy
uh take me too quick go ahead well man of steel has a scene where superman like wrecks a dude's
truck and i don't think that that was approved of by a lot of people because they agree that
that wasn't a superman thing to do
hey i remember he lets his dad die that's something everyone has a problem with right
he was doubled he datted and left woefully dadless he did uh rags you massive why did all right i'm
just gonna copy that so we can check it out next year mola where's your unbridled rage for the
bells we're starving to death it is currently at one hour of edited visuals um the audio's got a
little bit left to do i've got someone else doing a certain section of it not editing well
technically editing wise but it's a certain special little segment you'll know i'm talking
about and you see it um i'm hoping to get it done this month that is that is it it's coming it's
going to be like two and a half hours at least so you got two chunky videos coming from me and wolf
soon enough uh tfa part three critique as a guest for 24 hour refab i don't know how that would work
but uh it's it's always coming it's always coming i would say i said the captain baller video was
coming for a million years before that finally came so you know i'm i'm good for it guys it's
coming that's your most watched video now hi rags i demand you sing akbar's theme on 24 hour
stream in honor of drunk rags and we'll we'll have him answer that i went in a cornfield today
hey rags this is for you spend it irresponsibly also watch your own i'm gonna have to copy that
by rag is not being here he's gonna make it so that we can go through these really quickly it's
great um movie binge update why do people like kingdom of heaven Orlando bloom is a massive
gary stew and he also doesn't have any emotion at all the only good thing i can say about is
every shot is stunning do you reckon anyone i'll have to watch it again i remember really liking it
and yeah but i mean it's been a few years so maybe my criteria has changed but i remember
the actual like uh director's cut which is really the only cut you should watch the theatrical is
really messed up uh i remember that being really good so um
you said one out of two but i don't see a second oh and yes i watched the director's cut okay
that's the second part i'm maula big boy rags and theo your pfp is looking hot as always reminder
y'all should watch monogatari ignore him okay
oh hi rags three-way split right i will sort that out um i'm a epap 13 i'll catch up with you guys
epap 13 that's gonna happen good luck out for me at 16
um there you go theo who was on efap don't spend all my
damn i have to keep making notes about everyone who needs different pieces of money can't you guys
just donate to them directly don't give me money i don't give you anything in return
well you were here you provided help with the philosophy aspects you uh i mean i guess
would be on that if salad king wants to give you money then you know it's because i was just
gonna say you guys get right that sending money through this takes 35 percent is it off it already
so gotta like uh if you can get direct donations to any of the people you want money to go to i
would totally recommend it instead of pushing it through uh my stream or anything i'll still sort
out i've got notes of all of them i just try to wait until they're up to a chunkier number before
sending it instead of sending those mini payments and then having to pay the payment charge through
paypal it's this whole thing um have you ever played monster hunter world yes i love it but i
haven't played it enough because i've been busy with everything else that happens i've been back
on that game recently it's awesome it's great fun friend of mine is making a video essay what
should i tell him don't do it good don't listen to just right just just get going uh fundamental
advice redraft that's always my fundamental advice just really think through everything
you want to say and what you want to do anyone else got fundamental gems of of advice
try to make sure you're saying something you think is worth saying i suppose whenever you're
saying something that sounds very basic i know i mean mine was pretty that's what i go through with
like essay writing at uni and with my attempts at video script writing
it's just trying to make sure that you're saying something worthwhile with every second
uh give this money to my favorite massive n-word doggo named raggers shall be done random comment
that won't be understood in five hours i mean i understood it molesley i'm working on another
efap comic stay tuned for the next few days very well soon i hadn't seen captain marvel or aquaman
i just watched them out of some weird sense of obligation back-to-back and now i hate movies and
brain left no have love you chaps yeah those two are those two are great to do back-to-back
speaking of that comic that he was talking about and the memes did you so so show that picture
i uh sent you of denarius like leaning over the burning child oh no like your frequency so i'm
just collecting memes right now we've got a shit ton to go through they're all going to be for the
50th seven hours i was gonna say we're gonna have like fucking we've got plenty of times it'll be
fine uh was just rewatching your outlast critique and i must say burning yourself on a jesus stick
is a great way to die yeah so um someone of many of the critics i covered for outlast one of them
was like this kid he referred to a crucifix as a jesus stick it's like the best thing ever jesus stick
uh saw a lion king with fably today was meh be prepared was an atrocity though talk singing
cut the song by three minutes best best part of the original yep oh yeah i actually saw the
the video footage of it and it was horrible i listened to the uh the upload like the uploaded
version of it on youtube and it's literally just a slam poem version of be prepared and
i immediately was like no i'm not fucking seeing this film just not even to see how bad it is like
that uh long live the king scene was so embarrassing me and i think it was me mauler and
frickin we watched together and we just lost our minds it's amazing so terrible so how's your day
going guys my day's going pretty good did some editing did efap we're gonna go sleep wake up
do editing go to sleep wake up do editing great i returned on efap so pretty great some something
of a script i hope to someday make and i was on efap it was a good day through one one who was
blessed and one who was on efap thrice now rice indeed this time we actually you committed to
your purpose you see in the previous one you did not commit to your purpose therefore you were a bad
theo but what if the middle of the sandwich is made of another sandwich oh no sandception
everything about sandwiches is just too confused i know people named sarah ohara and clear a deer
funny names come from everywhere i agree so that was for me uh is anyone interested in seeing the
lighthouse and thoughts on the trailer i'm surprised to see edward in a good movie defoe
looks on fire so what i've heard is the um edwards what's his name guy from robert panson
yeah apparently he's a good actor i've just not seen he's in a lot of indie stuff and apparently
we're supposed to be watching that if we want to judge him because judging him from twilight is
unfair and i was like yeah fair enough i i wouldn't know the lighthouse is like a 4x3 black and white
movie that's made by the guy who made the witch which is critically acclaimed i watched the
trailer it looks interesting i might check it out that is and yeah defoe looks kind of crazy in it
always great i don't know if you any of you guys have heard of it or i don't know if i'm thinking
of the right movie let me look up the trailer i've seen the poster not the trailer i tend to keep
up with video games a lot more than films i just typed in the trailer and that did come up with
what i wanted the trailer the trailer that came up with like every single trailer oh no i have no
no i was thinking of something else okay yeah i haven't seen robert panson's also going to be in
the next nolan movie he's the next batman isn't he yes hello gentlemen is it a coincidence that
in my time zone efap started in the middle of the day like i said i can't make any definitive
comments about the middle the middle is a controversial subject where is wolf is he love
make is he making love to pizza well we can get the answer where is no i hate it he oh god he he
fucks it then eats it you like a praying mantis or whatever you think rose got everyone that she
captured before fin killed seeing if she left on a pointless adventure and then holdo kamikaze
oh yeah probably all those people because there's a shot where you can see her taking fin towards
this like holding area so i guess everybody on the holding area was just killed because everyone
would have without them rip imagine being there suddenly you enter hyperspace and get obliterated
like what the fuck all because of the fat asian bitch it's like racism you think rose oh wait
sorry hey you guys have got to get hello future me on your lineup of guests if not you need to
increase efaps australian haram we have a few australians i come on i actually really do like
his channel well then getting he's a really good youtuber rag him on if you want well i don't i
can't get into contact with him useless useless you guys have helped me to think more critically
about media thank you also hi rag is no no no we've made you think more about logic which is ruining
writing congratulations on your more superficial takes yeah you'll have superficial characters
doing superficial things like being logical so get fucked aha our evil plan to dominate the world with
logic is working yeah have a great have a great stream guys hello rags did the ancestry thing
did the ancestry thing and it turns out i have a very welsh bloodline good to know that my ancestors
were long men also high regs yes a lot of long men over and well welshland that's what they call
it nowadays um after chat last episode explaining what happened to me when i made a spelling mistake
night terrors etc in a chat i made two more i no longer wash live on the street and rim hobos for
pennies also high rigs that means you serve under the hobo assassin king that's gotta be a good life
i mean he's he's cut up right now but he's probably healed up by the time you get john wick
but i found out there's a job wick four before job wick three by the way i was like what he's like
why isn't it ending um oh yeah makes money i am running out of time i gotta speed this up mauler
if you could live in america which state and what city would you like to live in i'd literally just
pick the one that wolf or rags are in whatever it is just so i could hang out with him i am that
i wouldn't want to live somewhere in like alaska so fine let's go there
maul you said you're rapping please it's too hot james more fun this
your tfa critique was supposed to be safe for kids yet you spoil that santa claus and the
tooth fairy aren't real um sometimes you just call the pull that band-aid early gotta sorry
you can mute that part for your kids i guess high raggy rags i may be massive but at least i don't
wear glasses also what happened to cornstarch girl did she give birth to the cosevic chicken
i actually remember her oh that was a weird thing wasn't it that was weird but yeah um i don't know
how she fits into the law that's gonna that's to be decided i suppose mauler my brothers and i want
to rip off efap how do we format obs and also shout out our channel please so format obs i'm not
sure what you mean by that but um yes streamlines obs it says how do we format it
oh when i think format i think i just think factory defaults yeah yeah that's what i was
thinking yeah streamlabs obs um and then google the rest i'm not even kidding just google the
rest everyone always asks me the same question discord comes up as black on my screen and you
can see this in the re-upload of j stream i do it live you just google the problem and you have
your answers it's how i figured out pretty much anything that i can do on the internet
um but yeah that's three brother three brothers movie reviews that's the channel they want to do
a similar sort of efap thing check them out um guys dear efap would it be worth it if you got a
one-time payment of five million dollars but you would forever involuntarily involuntarily end
every sentence with this is my favorite part regardless of structure or context sincerely
mr massive uh yeah i wouldn't agree to that because it would be insufferable i would i
would agree to it only because i would like have a legitimate excuse for not having to talk to
people yeah you could just take the money and then yeah i'm sorry i can't speak to you
but i i do find the music that you just constantly hear like learn sign language pretend to be a mute
my favorite uh sanctum peter cottium deus in ray unum hippitus hoppitus rayus
domain also high rags it's your fault i'm addicted to efapping
i do speak read hard the reason why hack creators push subjectivity is because it makes it so nothing
they can ever be nothing they can ever make can ever be considered bad it's a cheap shield for
cowards it certainly can function that way um molly you said that uh thanos was overpowered in
endgame but infinity war he beat the hulk in a fist fight yeah it's a bit i'd say it's harder
to beat iron man hulk iron man captain american thought at the same time than it is to beat hulk
especially since you have a power stone when you're fighting hulk
yeah i don't know i would imagine that that makes it a little easier to fight the whole
didn't fall kind of he knocked out hulk uh in ragnarok yeah um it'd be weird well he didn't
win overall because of the the the what's his name electrocute and him but yeah um it'll be
weird for ray and kyla to be in a relationship if she time travels and turns out to be anakin's mom
i've seen a lot of talk about her being anakin's mom what is this ray's going to be anakin's mom
why what is happening i want it to be the case just because it won't make any
i want that to be the case just so that attack of the clones can be made slightly better when
anakin's mom dies so we can start calling my anticipation of the absolutism in episode nine
is gonna be through the roof on the night i go see it i'm gonna be so excited like how did they
fuck this up shmiray shmiray shmiray who is theo and why does he look like such a massive
weeb
maula check out the trailer for carnival row cara delavigne plays a pansexual a pansexual theory
how do you play a pansexual theory with great difficulty i'd imagine in this upcoming tv show
also alando blubers of the show all right sounds interesting i guess hello efab have a kit cat it
goes well with rhino milk thank you dr martin luther pepe good guy hitler being bad is subjective
well it depends on whether or not you think people getting killed arbitrarily is a bad thing
well if you start a morality well if you missed the rags and uh our random guests of the day had
a whole back and forth about the holocaust oh dear in which the the guy accidentally applied
in the holocaust happened wait what the accidentally said essentially the the
holocaust is a fictional event hold on was this today yes yes yes
i gotta rewatch this now boobler and co have any of you read content from scp foundation
yes i've played the game briefly but i have not read any like stuff from i guess the website or
wherever it's from yeah the website is the original thing if i'm remembering right
um there's a question for rags i'll save stuck at home on ivy antibiotics for the next week and a
half so far i've had a marathon of 29 ephaps and counting drink antibiotic milk perfect for when
you're feeling under the weather hi rags well yeah i was gonna say if you actually have all
free time and you spend solely on ephap you probably could get through it quite quickly
actually three episodes per day that's stupid as that sounds that's gonna take more than a day
no not typically i think the average length right now is probably six hours so six twelve eighteen
twenty four it's like four p day i think we had one the the slow the slowest the quickest one
we was with apoband i think when we covered why the last jedi is so great which has one of the
best highlights of ephap in it if you remember wolf um when we were losing our minds yeah that
one i think is three and a half hours like the it was shocking how short that was now looking back
but i still remember thinking that three hours should be the average and these days it's like
how could i possibly osmic chicken the one true god death to the infidels
completely off topic what are you guys's opinions on the writing of attack on titan for those who
have read it i like it i think it's uh way more airtight than people get it for
i can't say i've read it but i started watching it and it didn't appeal to me so i quickly fell
off of that i know nothing about it yeah the writing's really good especially later on
it's pretty slow at the beginning but it's it's got really good writing yeah watch evo or ephap
why do you make me choose like this maul i think the answer is obvious very i mean i picked this
over sakario and sakario was really fucking good so i'm looking forward to watching it now that
i know rags hasn't seen it i always love it when people haven't seen films i love um but i also
chastise them for it i'm like how do you not see this god let's watch it right now the duality of
man uh what mics do you guys use i'm planning on buying a mic and a headset separately that
doesn't have gaming on the box something professional i use an at 2020 so do i
all right then blue snowball that southpaw uses a blue snowball i do oh i don't think casual
yes that was that was unironically the first uh microphone i ever had i had yeah i've never
bothered upgrading but i i will eventually of course yeah i went from crappy headset to snowball
to yeti to 80 2020 and then i it's 80 2020 it's just i think 80 2020 is pretty much top of the
consumer line that you're gonna get the next step up is the one that everyone uses who's like
got really fucking really popular channels like the h3 podcast or joe rogan i think uses them i
can't remember what they're called but you guys know i'm talking about those microphones that
a lot of people use them i think they're sure microphones or something like that
um they're the next step up from 80 2020 as far as i can tell at least in that sort of tier
hi rags i'll i'll invest in that oh maula you had a backlash for being in sargon's video
uh i've not had one but i know that there are people out there who when they want to guess my
politics say that he's spoken to sargon that tells you everything and i'm like i've several
times wanted to speak to people like h bomber guys because apparently if you talk to someone that
means that you share the same politics you know this is the thing like um i fucking unironically
said i would do voice work for quinton reviews if you wanted to on twitter i'm not i'm not joking
like if he said he wants me to have a british character to say something like you know
oh dear we need to get out of here now i'd be like yeah i'll do that for you why the fuck not
like it would be fun but then if like oh so you endorse quinton's politics i'd be like so but uh
yeah maybe a better example than that would be someone i don't fucking i'm not blocked by on
twitter i don't know uh but yeah no i haven't really gotten backlash for it beyond the standard
people usually say it's like yeah he's got a vague association with sargon he's the worst thing ever
how it works uh is ds i don't associate is ds to the 75 off a good or bad buy please help um
unless it's free no even when it's free they owe you money so uh
owe you something for your wasted time uh mauler undo the rag oopsie i'm not sure what that's
referring to it might be the objectivity is the opposite of subjectivity thing
he didn't mishear that i think everyone thought he did but i know i think people misunderstood what
he was trying to say the opposite of x is not why it's anti-x i think is what rags wanted to
say but i'm not sure where i stand on that idea the opposite of objectivity is subjectivity is
a weird statement to me um but it's not necessarily untrue i'm just not sure how
i would look at it but yeah um i think playable theodlc when okay just write your quid to this
showing oh no remember to never answer a phone during sex even if you hilariously answer with
i can't talk now i'm going into a tunnel uh the room is like a cucumber it needed to sit in a jar
marinate for a while to become good it became a pickle also hire a gaga for hoggis okay um yeah i
guess the room was out for a while before people absolutely adored it right it needed to be out for
like a few years i guess i don't when how long did it take to become like a cultural icon of
so bad it's good i don't know i figured wolf would know maybe how long did it take for the room
to become like the cultural icon of so bad it's good from release was it like a year
well i don't know the exact number but i know that it was uh pretty popular amongst people for
quite a long time before i got popular around the internet there's like pictures in the disaster
artist of people from years and years ago uh watching the movie and theaters i think there's
been a theater in la that's been playing the movie every year since it came out
it makes sense it's a great film it is a great film teaches us a lot about what values are
important um i'm framing objectivity is the n word of criticism undeniable truth
objectively i came here for theo and objectively i'm staying for theo
oh thanks i feel like this guy's problem is that the term objective is not as meaningful
sounding as other words i mean you can replace it with other ones i suppose uh but yeah a lot of
people i think a lot of people have a problem with how they feel the fact that he said you can only
define words one way was a red flag i suppose as rag said that's a that's a big no water is no
objective clearly is thought bath water objectively good for you yes ask vito
stop using words that have more than two syllables please it hurts my brain objective has three
mcqueen is an objective good is allen objectively or subjectively in the middle
i'm gonna have to be both my first super chat ultimate fatty congratulations thank you
how's your game of thrones video coming along molar i've answered that a few times it's coming
along wonderfully i'm working on it every day i'm looking forward to releasing it it's gonna be
fun um i'm nice and vague but there was a twitter update with a bit more detail if you want to check
it out gta 5 online currently has an exploit in the track race betting capitalize on it before
it's patched okay there you go guys uh what are you guys's music tastes also high rags uh wolf
what's your music taste you i gravitate toward rock metal and classical
okay but that's actually kind of similar to mine then again i'm really not picky with music i like
uh for many walks of tism um but my favorite would be metal and
eo south pole what do you guys reckon i tend to stick with dark synths but i'm not too picky
that's just my usual field hills what's wrong with light synth you know it's not dark enough
i mean i just go with like alternative rock generally uh or even alternative pop like um
have you guys ever heard of the band churches spelled with a v instead of a u
no no sounds interesting okay they are they're a scottish synth pop band and they're very very
good it's not music i normally listen to but uh they're one of my favorite bands ever check
out churches guys there you go
what's everyone's favorite type of meat mine is buffalo
i mean i would say chicken but it's poultry so i don't know if it counts
i could still meet all right good i'm glad you validated me uh i would say
there's like some good elk burgers i had in colorado so i'll go with that big as it is
you got two more votes to come come on guys
fuck if i know i don't know what was the question what's your favorite meat
oh uh tri-tip a what tri-tip try to uh roast that sounds like a sci-fi animal but i'll agree with you
it's a it's a it's a cal if it's a cal so writing teaches grade students work based on an objective
standard they don't judge the work's content but how well it adheres to the standard
yeah but they would say that that standard is arbitrary based on the teacher or whatever
but um it's a it's definitely a way to be objective though another part that some people
don't agree with from southpaw mission impossible fallout and unbridled praise when that's actually
a potential it's just that i've got a lot of films i'd like to do that with and i'm just
super fucking busy with everything else it'll things will happen you know things will happen
that's my promise it's definitely definitely a movie worthy of an unbridled praise though
yeah uh characters in children's media that are more of role models than characters such
of many of the disney protagonists that's in reference to us talking about how um characters
don't always have to necessarily represent a person as opposed to an idea in stories they're
often characters are often stand-ins for a perspective or an idea or whatever because
they're not fully fledged that's true question when you do a 24-hour stream are you going to
read super chats during or at the end because otherwise we might be looking at a 48-hour stream
um the plan i think will be to when we reach seven hours of the first second and third stream
i'll start reading super chats every time i'll get through them consistently i think
if you survive an event you shouldn't have then that's irl plot armor we'll see in in real life
it would be luck in writing plot armor because the writer made it happen as opposed to it happening
naturally um but yes damn it you guys my husband did the this is my favorite part to me rags i
mostly blame you for this one way to ruin the mood i i knew that was coming up in the previous efair
but i was so excited to show people it this wall for context we were covering um video that was
talking about walking dead but like i mostly wanted to skip the video and just talk about
the ad at the end and it's this guy trying to sell a mobile game and he sounds like death he's like
this is what you do you play this here and this is my camp and it's meticulously designed now i'm
going to have to defend my characters from zombies this is my favorite part it's like oh no he put
so much energy into that it was great you could just you could use it on anything this is my
favorite part i really like the fact that we have husbands and wives watching our stupid show
oh yeah i really love them all the video this is my favorite part
do you imagine if you guys ever get to a tonal woke video where he says this is my favorite part
and just about the same i'm still waiting i'm still waiting for him to acknowledge
and like say tonal like even if he's just like he acknowledged it on twitter he's acknowledged
on twitter no no i mean like i want him to verbally say tonal in the video i want to hear it from his
mouth i don't know if we can tolerate that kind of you know that's gonna be that that can can
efap contain that level of holiness i don't know i wonder if he does like twitch streams where
someone can we can like rate him and just spam tonaled and get him just get someone to do a super
chat where it says my dave is totaled and then have him read it we can do it hey rags i think
you're purchasing a handgun what recommendations are you going to copy that god rags are so many
questions he's gonna have to deal with your mum has plot armor because she didn't die giving birth
to a massive oh oh shit not no plot armor yes so the the super chat about plot arbor and sicario
too which i addressed uh get back to playing your devil monster cry five world instead of hanging
out with these schmucks theoth will wholesome hugs to molar and rags though oh i guess we'll
just go back to playing video games soon enough you will be allowed to oh god i've got 34 minutes
your character in falling in vegas should 100 be dead they were shot twice in the head and buried
in a shallow grave and god knows how long it took victor to drag you out with his lobster claws
i don't even i haven't played it so i'm guessing it's ridiculous that you survive whatever you
survive in that game shrug i didn't play it i have a question about the guy who got shot
through the cheeks in sicario too one that could annihilate the film even further did it send them
high um his cheek may have sent him high uh how do you guys feel about narrative shortcuts
detective shows often have tech to speed up the plot not related to unknowable info but slowly
acquired oh do you mean just like uh oftentimes in those kinds of shows the pacing of the
unlocking the secret to the next part of the the plot is just a piece of tech and it'll operate
as fast as it's required to because it's mostly okay if um there's reasoning for it to occur that
way i would just go as far as saying that as long as it's not arbitrary in one direction or the other
you gotta be careful i think it's yeah i think it's like an unfortunate um uh part of of the medium
that it's telling that story and i think it's just you know like it like a sort of necessary evil
it's like usually within reason if you know batman for example in the dark night they were
like we need to find this guy who's an ex-con and he's gonna be with like some kind of parole
officer it's like that shouldn't take them five seconds to do because they have like access to
say levels of shit but then if you're doing some kind of uh private investigator who has limited
resources in like the 50s i'd be like oh that's going to be tough for him to do that so you have
like limitations but you can still just tweak how long it'll take for them to do x y and z
uh wolf get high and rag on sargot again
trudy says victor pulled you out of your grave right after benny in the con's left your character
in fallout new vegas could survive that again that's an argument between super chatters i would
actually know because i haven't played it um beef app on sundays made to be high to riff on sargon by
the way i could do a stone cold sober beef app on sundays makes sense remember the sabbath by keeping
it objective yes uh how much money do i have to give you guys before you finally do the right
thing and condemn my friend for constantly DMing me scat hentai every every stream every stream
you know that's disgusting i don't want to think about that uh rags can you leave a link to your
book in the description i think rags has a book yes wolf yours is called iridescent right
yes and available not oh okay um a bad character in my opinion i'm not gonna yes tonaled and just
right could team up for quite an interesting video i would imagine don't know if we should
allow it though because it'd be it would like infect him i don't really want that to happen
to me can you foreshadow subversion yes i guess the red wedding i'm not sure actually how you do
that like the foreshadowing of an event that you don't expect so like you could have i mean the
red wedding was foreshadowed and that's definitely not something anyone was really expecting
conventionally that is would you call it foreshadowed or you call it set up
uh i'd have to there was a pretty good video i saw on it that i don't really remember all
the arguments too because i saw it a couple months ago but uh there definitely was foreshadowing
example in that video i'll have to find it and show it to you sometime all right cool i love you
guys have some taco money wait why are you guys talking about character arcs don't you know rhino
milk is out hey rags molar i sent you a message on stream labs a few weeks ago when you weren't
streaming do you still read stream labs yes but um i'm afraid that one's probably lost by now
i showed the same name i might be able to search it uh rip wizard friend friend karen wizard friend
karen oh uh that's a dnd joke okay from a dnd that i wasn't in you sacrifice did it come on every
frame of a massive what was it i said about the the hardest of choices earlier strongest of will
just wanted to say hi hope you're all having a good day now i'm off to watch the ds2 playlist
for the thousandth time well keep you that it's good yeah uh blade runner 2049 an unbridled rage
praise or meh for molar uh it would be a rage if anything because unfortunately for blade runner
2049 i'm not invested enough in blade runner the original to be pissed off but my friend is
and he wants to make that video one day he hates that movie and he's explained all the reasons to
it for it to me and i was like holy shit later on 2049 is terrible um but it needs to go out
to the world because a lot of people think that movie is amazing um even blade runner fans so it
would be interesting to see what the conversation might lead to but i'm not passionate enough about
either film to make that video uh would you guys do an efap on rob agers uh blade runner 2049 plot
fails youtube video i've not watched it but if he highlights similar things to what my friend wants
to then um perhaps it's a well-reasoned who knows but again i would have to rewatch the films and
then maybe if it was like particularly would you rather try your hardest at something and be seen
as mediocre or not try very hard and be called the worst of all time at that something
is probably the former
i mean would i know that i was going to be seen as mediocre before putting it out because i would
just try even harder until i would feel this is great this is genuinely great yeah i just
rather try my best um regardless of what everybody ended up saying i did i guess mola give this to
dx i don't i don't think like 80 i don't think that's gonna work unless we bring it on as a guest
sometime just a dx okay uh hoped it would hold out a bit longer but my computer is officially dead
big f for the meme machine meme machine 2.0 coming in september when the amd 939 50x comes out video
essay is also coming that's from meme repository so looks like we will have a deficit of memes
from him for now but we've got plenty to use for uh for 50 so yeah i hope that all works out
my good man um can you use all of your force milk time powers i sick
that's something we can do here do we have force milk time powers not how the force works
i mean it might be it might be by episode nine
i don't know there's still one spider count dooku
20 26 minutes all right a vote for trump is a vote for more quinton i really hate trump
memes that's all folks i think that's reason enough to vote for trump all right
we're done uh there's a question in my paper to a paper to a level a level economics exam how does
a fall in how does a fall in real incomes affect subjective happiness so dumb what the fuck
how does a fall in real income affect subjective happiness it's a pretty easy lie to draw in kingdom
no it was it was apparently at a level question okay uh oh yeah now that you guys have switches
i would highly suggest getting monster hunter generations ultimate is a much deeper game than
monster hunter world
hortla did nothing hortla didn't do nothing
i don't know as well the mental gymnastics oof
odor did nothing wrong is being consistently bad objectively worse than being inconsistent
yeah consistently bad worse than being inconsistent
oh so like context context oh yeah i was gonna say it would have to i need some examples of
what you mean but if if the question is is always being inconsistent worse than being sometimes
inconsistent i would vote for the the worst being the always inconsistent imagine unless
ultimately if you're making a fucking comedy i'd probably gun for the always inconsistent so you
can end up something like uh actually no a comedy probably wouldn't work as well if everything
didn't make sense you need some things to make sense you have like a grounding yeah
um uh finally a live efap i'll watch live later as i'm leaving molar i have something for you please
dm this i don't uh a discord thing i'm not sure what that is like too many numbers for um
try me on twitter person uh the solution is poison who's wolf who's fucking wolf watch this
fucking joke what question is that he's a bad youtuber don't worry about him wolf are you to do
a review on shad's book once you're done reading um probably not although i am gonna talk with
shad about it message him the other day getting references and everything um here's some money
for wolf very well crab is worst girl cat for the win crab is worst girl cat for the
reference to the anime my profile pictures from yeah yeah what if jay watches lord of the rings
and thinks they're objectively bad you'll be killed yeah we don't know how to do anything
literally if you watch lord of the rings and you go that was objectively bad it you just detonate
like it was a part of the living experience you can't see it you get smoked i thought your
neighbor just felt a sudden compulsion to enter your house and do whatever it takes to it's within
your own body we all come with a stick of dynamite in our stomachs oh shit the cosmic chicken
basically you know hypnotizes the nearest person into having a sudden urge to fucking bash your
skull open with their bare hands um f philosopher man bad get louis levi and please rewind on the
show they're both both on a very long list we're getting getting people's uh gimli's actor john
reese davis is going to be at hawaii con want to try and want me to try and get his autograph for
you wolf for me yes so i mean i mean i would say get his autograph no matter what
i guess they're off for everyone for you as well
yeah yeah i'm not giving not giving out addresses for that
uh was it just right who started crying or was that someone else no that was great debate man
well they're not so great debate really sad oh wait you answered that question already uh damn
sorry i'm late was busy wiping my willoms after dropping a massive quinton in the jack saint but
anyways guys here's an extra large donation this week to celebrate by raise at work gotta go but
have fun shitting on just right's trash oh thank you zach um our movies art like art and design
aren't the same uh this is the problem we haven't actually discussed that on efap i don't think but
like what counts as art some people take it to the extreme and they're like a leaf in the wind is art
and you're like okay but good luck essentially defining art yeah good luck can't stay for the
whole thing but i can't wait for you guys to get to his reason as to why ywigs waited tlj it's
terrible well yeah boy we got a reaction out of that to a degree no we did um yeah wolf uh he i
think that he likes that argument quite a bit he thought it was great let's just get through
the super chats james moore said wolf no don't go you're upsetting james wolf well you know
it's okay people will be upset for 10 minutes and they'll forget oh well you often talk about a
standard being achieved with objectivity what's a great example film of the being of a high standard
lord of the rings is the easy one to go for because it it excels in a massive amount of
aspects of filmmaking um it's downright it doesn't make sense that the lord of the rings
is as good as it is to be honest with you it's really good yeah um rlm appears to think tlj is
not as bad as the prequels calling it a mess with interesting ideas get them on efap to debate it
rich evans is a god they i don't think they'd ever come on efap we would gladly have them on but
yeah they think the prequels are worse than than tlj that's their take i would happily talk to them
about that because it's just so unfair the fucking sequels are a disaster at this point and if you
remember they were very much in favor of tfa and you can since tell they're not sure about that
anymore um and it was it was kind of the same for for me with with tfa i was on board with it but
then once you give it a real critical life like this narrative that went around it was um it's a
clone of the ot and it was like it's not just that though it's not just that it's a clone of the ot
that's not it's it's it's a horrible clone it's like a botched clone it's not a good clone because
good clones can actually be okay look at the lion king that did pretty well didn't it
people might think i'm referencing the uh the live adaptation i'm not i'm referencing uh the
kimber wolf that's the name oh yeah the white lion that that there there's a video out there
that shows like just how much the lion king stole from it and it makes me it made me lose a lot of
respect for the lion king it's insane it's actually i mean i don't think i can remove how
much i like that movie but at the same time good lord that is the most clear act of plagiarism i
think i've ever seen uh you are wrong wolf your videos are excellent please don't leave from
chip chiply he's convinced clearly uh wolf have you heard about the upcoming lord of the rings
game where you play as garland it takes place a couple hundred years before the hobbit it comes
out in 2021 you can find the logo how would that even work i don't i have never heard of anything
like that i'm curious i haven't either so yeah all right i would like to thank all of the efap
viewers who subbed to my mark the cyborg channel my newest video is a review of wolfenstein young
blood and i end it with one of wolf's favorite quotes rhino milk cosmic chicken i think um but
yes mark the cyborg i remember that name uh check it out i guess you want to wolf how many slash
which lord of the rings games have you played um i played both the middle earth games i played
a bit of lord of the rings online um i tried to get into war of the north but it was really boring
and after two hours i stopped playing it and i think that's it uh just rights aversion to
objective qualitative statements appears to be a kneejig reaction to tlj criticism your discussion
with him was fascinating i didn't realize how fundamental that discussion has become in terms
of like a originating point in terms of the discussion as a whole and what it did to him
and his channel it was such a casual stream that'd be a wolf it's out we're just like okay i feel
like wolf was was it wolf are you doing it anyway no we were watching a video we said should we
stream it that's what it was yeah and uh i think it was actually your idea to stream it then we
did and we didn't expect anything and then he just happened to be in the chat and that's how
that came about we're gonna have to do a part two for this aren't we i've i've got like 17 minutes
i i think i'm a really good morley you should consider comparing tlj and kotl i'd have to play
it first and uh i think there are people who are doing a way better job than i ever would
at that already online so fair enough uh is darth vady gonna dave to force choke a bitch
maybe um yes i d allen volo i'm destined to be king my immortal mid crimson will erase the middle
of the next 10 seconds of time and i will finish my enemies that's a jojo i was gonna say there's a
couple references and they're the efap related too so i guess just a big old reference uh wolf if
you leave efap you won't be able to demand art from bayouin anymore also i'll cry and become a
bad adaptation of spider-man um this is as this is as bad as the nichi as a nihilist
this is colon i feel like there was more to that but it got cut off or something um would anyone
consider sloth from the goonies to be subjectively beautiful his mum didn't face even a mother can't
love uh wolf thank you for banning ra in that one stream that's from creepy sheath
i banned ra he did uh 20 minutes equals a billion years i can't remember what that's referencing
but yes oh when uh just right said uh remember the dark knight that thing i referenced a million
right because to him a 16-minute video is like a lifetime
uh oh 16 minutes of time anyway here chad stuckman take a monies and as well add stuckman that's not
so bad you know like that they were chad also stuckman uh the just right guy is a salty bitch
would just right argue that films are objectively subjective
well this is the thing a lot of the time with the whole nothing is objective thing it's like
isn't that an objective statement it's like no like hmm seems like you're pretty definitive
about it it's like how you're proving that how do you know you know the counter argument being that
how do you know we're not being objective just by accident in your world view we we could be
committing to it but we don't have the necessary uh framing to understand that that's definitively
what we're doing is this whole thing well if i want to buy you a pizza with this but i want it
to be a healthy pizza maybe even some pineapple on it or at least some cosmic buffalo chicken
oh good lord don't
uh when is just right going to start making excuses for his logical shortcomings by claiming
subjectivity how long can the charade of sophistry go on well it's already he's already gone back
on it in his game of thrones season eight video but nobody cares because he'll make the claims
and then be like oh it's all subjective lol anyway this game of thrones really backs logically
inconsistent as fuck it's like yeah but it's all subjective like you just apply the same thing to
everything he says in that video you go hey just right you say this thing is in congruence with
this other thing but ultimately if they had done that it wouldn't be as emotionally resonant
they need it to happen for the story to happen just right just right right you're not making any
sense just right so you know just go on forever i don't think his fan base are paying enough
attention and notice anyway not you know no offense to them i'm sure they're wonderful people
uh i just finished shad's book while listening to this and i enjoyed it but you should make fun
of him for making the symbol of one of the factions suspiciously similar to his own logo
oh that's it's a reference if i was making a book i'd probably throw a whole bunch of efab
references in there like i'd have this faction that have a name that you know like is ea ef efp
maybe with an a like ef pa just people could be like oh subtle references that's the that's the
that's the key uh if i had a cent for every time someone cherry picked things a philosopher's said
to suit their agenda i mean it works apparently yeah people twist your words uh does orphan art
have value no no also someone in chat said uh i googled youtube stream max length and says 12
hours i've looked into it several times the most common answer i find is eight hours and i i'm
pretty sure that is the case and if ever i try and test that it'll mean that we'll actively
delete part of an efap as a potential so i don't really want to push it further than that at that
point i hope that they extend it someday for sure um efap is the red pen of death for video essays
potentially flowers are literally proper use of the word designed to be pleasing to the senses
they are a plant's way to trick animals into doing their work because they didn't evolve legs
oh well that's just your opinion that's a big old tin of worms that we don't have time to get into
no we don't know wolf your diet oh i guess they're saying because you had the pizza
he literally made the argument that if i don't know about it it doesn't exist
yeah uh so glad i got to watch just right give wolf and add yours alive oh yeah wonderful stuff
most people don't know what the millennium falcon is so it's not a plot hole by not being in the
prequel i can i'm not even gonna go over that terrible argument for how it explains anything
tell you what tell you what nobody knew that the millennium falcon had l 337 as the navigator when
the original trilogy came out mauler give this to wolf and it must be for drugs and alcohol
all right hello mauler hello there literally more people know the name of a y-wing than most people
know what the bomber in tlj was called go to hell just right i would agree with you on that
just right you made really good hobbit videos but i truly deeply really deep down in my heart
think that those videos were an accident and you should stop now uh you guys need to focus
on praising what you love not critiquing what you hate just tico inspirational at word of wolf i
can't take any more of just right's video i'm going to go out for a bit before i kill myself
hopefully you guys will still be on when i come back love you massive copy so often equals taiwan
oh yeah uh either actor could have played either character honestly oh damn that's a good point um
metal man bad john wick three is objectively good tism but it has a lot of tism it's all good tism but
right so good action it's good fun tism fine i'll give you the fun tism the action scenes
are definitely worth watching on youtube there you go i'm incredibly biased because i adore how
silly it is it is really silly exactly stupid as world building is it's it's like up there with
hobson's shy and like dumb action movies wolf are you actually serious about deleting your channel
crying face yep and silence it's a bit of a bombshell there's a moment of silence for
an excellent youtube channel leave for you won't be missed i mean all these super chats are about
it i leave for two seconds of wolf is going and saying well if wolf wants to delete the channel
we can't stop him but we'll make sure he's aware of how much we'll miss him piece of shit
lol as we know jack saint is honest absolutely here's my tithe for the holy trinity of dumbassery
thank you wolf is keith and natani a good couple i think they're cute also when do you think they're
going to do the nasty wolf is keith and natani oh no oh i read that okay no i know what he's
talking about yes they're actually better than the two main characters in my opinion
uh and it's never going to happen because tom likes to mess with his fan base in that way
uh guys calm down stop being immature you should just evolve as critics right guys
just rice kind of forgotten how to make valid points only when it's on stuff that he likes
objectivity ends conversations efap six hours plus it's like yep end conversations my brother
walked in during the freakout about the y-wing he went on a straw man rant the criticisms of tlj
are out of stupidity and con artist reasons in a kirmit voice what we criticized tlj out of con
artist reasons okay all right i was watching ironman one and tony should have died like four times
him flying in the first ironman suit out of the cave and just landing in the sand was so jarring
yeah actually uh we me and alex re-watched that after endgame just for like nostalgia
and i remember saying it was like this is a bit weird that he survives that it's such a major
fucking blow like and the suit is destroyed what he lands and you're like wouldn't that have
i'm telling you even non superhero characters in films have superhuman durability
oh well that's the thing i think that it's valid to point those things out but i think some films
do take measures to try and you know keep them at least a little bit grounded they'll show them
taking wounds or something well they never actually have them attacked by something hugely
significant i personally i'm just happy to like accept that the tolerance threshold for damage
for a film human is higher because it allows for more stuff to take place typically it's just me
but what's the secret to mario's jump we'll never find that out it should be noted a new hope tarkin
did say he was risking a lot by letting layer get away with the plans even if they were tracking
them yes uh but it was more of a it's absolutely a risk versus having them kept prisoner
but uh i'm assuming that's tied to the fact that it was layer specifically too and losing them
compared to but the thing is it did pay off as far as he was concerned like yes we've got him
and then um there's the line where he says um
uh abandon the ship in our moment of triumph i think not or something like that i can't remember
the actual quote just right theory is crap history already proves art continues despite
objective critique what if i said i'm not going to write because subjectively someone might think
my work promotes murder exactly you can you can absolutely make the the argument in reverse i don't
know why he thinks it only applies to his side um well this is from meme repository wolf i wanted
to just say how much your video on depression and mental health meant to me keep up the good work
you're beautiful massive i will you'll get another video soon glad to see that you guys are still
going gives me more to catch up on later if rags comes back ask him when his next video is coming
out uh split this between yourselves will do i'll put that in for rags as well as far as i know
his next video is on the way uh i guess similar to all of us wait 2000 years we only started
arguing 19 years after jesus oh i just don't know uh also surprise you live through this
make the dmc content you coward oh wait dmc content work on it oh that's that's what you're doing
working on devil may cry 5 video uh more please say all right steady slow and easy and okay you
guys can come and pick me up now guys hello there you go and wolf they want you to say
we are ready to go what are your feelings towards our success rate
we're ready to go what are your feelings toward our success rate yeah but i guess
it's for a meme video i'm guessing so they probably want you to say it
in a way that sounds like you're saying that hey that's cheating okay okay we're ready to go
what are your feelings toward our success rate
oh theo i am platinum mad okay bobson here's some money for wolf's next pizza also high rag
or you'd say hi back how long have i got oh four minutes okay molar ignore theo and watch
mono gattari it's important you do it is theo's favorite thing yes i'm spending five more quid
to dab on theo wolf uh 91 of orie so glad to be out of spiky windy hell was playing while
listening to this stream and had more fun than you did tonight okay uh saw once upon a time in
hollywood loved it excellent speaking of memes i got a couple coming out soon as well as the
first part of efap the movie can't wait for efap 50 oh neither can we i want theo who was on efap
to read my bedtime stories i'll read me bedtime he will huh yeah uh damn you guys are still going
i missed the stream i wanted to drop by to say i hope you're doing well and also we should repeal
the 19th of course raw could you release videos where you guys react to memes separate from the
actual efap no that's part of efap uh any chance you'll have sargon or shapiro on efap 50 i doubt
we'll have them on efap 50 efap 50 is like gonna just be past guests coming back on so um but who
knows what'll happen in future uh i'll take a few years but i'll get to work on moving efap to a
beautiful home in alaska i promise there you go james it's a wonderful project for you to engage

going to be terrible but who knows that's next 007 to you yeah attack on titan is based its core
conflict is the world's most impotent important issue right now people who disagree deserve to
be thrown off rooftops emir did nothing wrong okay molar i want to thank you right now for
watching rise of skywalker so that i don't have to oh yeah i can already recommend it's
probably not worth it and then i will confirm that for you soon after it's released probably
thoughts on black sails on stars i have no idea what that is
uh do an endgame critique like the tlj one i am tempted to do that i'm not sure
what i'm going to be doing exactly with endgame though but it will be something
you should do an efap with ryan dawson to discuss shindler's list united 93 zero
dark city and sakario guaranteed top tier episode yes i don't know who that is though
wolf when will be able to when will we be able to buy your book again don't know
mola what's with the drawings in your somavids they were supposed to be funny stupid and represent
the fact that i'm just a randy dude who's trying to comment on stuff but they're also great but not
how to convey emotion in what i was saying because i was a little bit less emotive back then but um
i might bring them back oh god i have a minute uh watch the doom eternal presentation with the
dev plays it on stage is amazing there's still a developer listening to fan fans thank you id
software oh yes it's probably going to be a very good game whoever said crab is worst girl and cat
