there are absolutely really funny if like this man the first suggestion he
has is just bat shit and say to dizzy like well well i heard that his plans
for the sequel his own sequel scripts like right were a bit far out there he
was going to go into like the wills which are like the gods of the star wars
universe and stuff have you heard that those rumors i've heard there was some
crazy stuff where he plays like they go inside of bodies to shrink themselves
down and talk to the bit of chlorians or something yeah what i don't know i know
what's that what's that old movie where they shrink themselves down and go into
the human body is incredible i'm picturing little cells with like
hyping voices as well as like and yet and yet better than the sequels
we speak for the jedi
we don't give it a shot i know we would why do you say force like that we do it for impact
see it already sounds like a very interesting story does it not
i i'm i'm intrigued i want to know now
it can't be worse
well i could ask josh but why why must you say this ringmond
why what it can't be worse yes why do you hate why do you hate
no answer sorry it's it's i'm pretty sure lope made it it's lagging big time so i missed all
that i was just asking why you must hate on things leave disney alone they didn't they didn't do
nothing they didn't do nothing
when in reality they did a lot of things
not the funnest of things as well disappointing things
um you know well hey chat saying hi how are you chat i was gonna say i can i can give you some
questions that were left over for you uh oh yeah well while you just get a few random ones
there's a there's a couple there's a couple of comments in the uh in the um yeah in in the
comments uh i haven't slept much guys leave me alone um but just to just to answer those
no my surgery is tomorrow so this is like my last big hurrah before before i'm out out of
commission so good to enjoy it yes let's make it a fun one what a fun question to begin with check
out this wonderful super chat that i save for you chad for your next book please get a real
publishing house to get you an editor no offense but your story had all the ideas but died in
execution wow yes but i i it's a valid opinion i disagree on certain levels because there there
are some like you know choices that i made absolutely on purpose and some people didn't
like it like for instance the more expository nature like mine is what is considered a hard
fantasy where the uh the reasons behind how everything works matters and it's important to
understand it and things um and so some people try to say well an editor would have thought like
obviously would have cut those longer expositions and stuff and at first when i heard those the
feedback i was like yeah maybe right but i actually since then i've hired like a really good editor
to do a second edition of the book and we've recently completed it and so i went through
like several rounds of additional editing on the book because there were some like
little things that even i was like all right i want to iron out those wrinkles and stuff
and went through beta readers all over again and stuff and when i got back to those things i kept
them in because it's like i like i like it and there's a lot of people who really enjoyed
the detail of the world building and stuff and that's just that i decided you know this is the
style of book i wanted to write for this one uh and so there is that but if uh other things
are bothering people well um uh yeah there is a second edition that the editing is already
completed and in terms of uh like a proper publisher release right uh there's something
in the works as well so when i was talking to brandon sanderson he actually suggested that um
i have my book a uh get it a print only publishing deal with one of the smaller presses he did this
with emperor soul and he recommended his own agent it's like that's a great idea and i wanted to wait
until the second edition was done and now it is done i've sent it to brandon's agent uh joshua
bilms is a champion and he currently has the manuscript and is looking through it so so yeah
there are some cool things happening on that front that's nifty indeed um let's have a look here
well i guess this could be a follow-up shad any advice on marketing a book
have a youtube channel i feel like you may have said that before yeah i'm sure that helps it
really does help like that's one of the reasons i started youtube not the only reason but uh
having a you know an audience and i was very lucky with uh well not lucky but i was very
intentional with a subject kind of theme of my channel because basically meant anyone who was
subscribed to my channel had a very good chance they'd like my the themes but also the genre of
my novel and stuff um you know fantasy swords and everything and so uh that meant basically
my youtube channel was not only it was a good marketing platform but it was targeted marketing
it was targeting targeting an audience that was like perfectly you know it would be interested
in my novels so how much did you pay yourself to advertise nothing oh my god you did it for free
whoa i haven't i've been paid oh actually there are there are small things i paid like um ingram
spark they do the print book they give you the option of having your book featured in their like
um their catalog and it's like 150 or something it says like yeah that sounds good i paid for that
i haven't done any amazon publishing everything because i mean i get to advertise for myself uh
and and the value in that is tremendous because my current rates for how much you know i charge
like other you know companies to advertise through shadow versity it's it's it's significant now
because of the size of the channel and i get that for free and so the comparative value of the um
of the advertising i've been able to give to myself is over a hundred thousand dollars now
uh so it's crazy but i can do that for free because of the youtube channel
shadow businessman right here oh you know do some do some of these more than one lesson
in shadow versity you're gonna build one of them eventually a university called shadow versity
pro well that's why shuttle is really having uh the end game i i love the decentralization
of information the freedom of information and stuff and and so i don't think i'd ever put myself
you know behind a paywall this is why i would never do a skill share course or anything like
that because i love the fact that you can get information for free and i would i just want to
encourage them you know um and so i wouldn't ever really make a exclusive kind of university thing
or anything like that i'll just put it out for free on youtube well why don't you do the the
prank invasion thing for 30 a month i can teach you how to pay actresses to make videos with you
the amount of scams like that you can find on the internet for the low low price of $59.99
i'll teach you how to be a complete fraud this novel brought to you by raid shadow legends
yeah the the the the the most ambitious rpg
so yeah it's it's been hilarious because i'll be you know of course i watch all the streams
into the raid coming up everything and listening to that now i have my i have my time i can talk
about raid oh here we go is that i turned him down like oh this man here yeah i don't have
much they're paid sometimes too so that's really quite and like war of clans like mobile and
mobile sponsors look no shade on guys you know who you advertise on because you know i understand
the whole youtube it depends we we mock you can throw some shade ovally yeah i just like that i
really dislike the way that they try and they they give you such a scripted thing and you just feel
like you know you're lying when you do it and everything and and especially like some i won't
say which one specifically but they purposely misrepresent you know they're like millions
of people are playing it's like what what live active players that's the most played games is like
fortnite and stuff and they don't have a million concurrent places you're talking about downloads
it's like no they always want you to say millions of people are playing this game it's like right now
this very second including me and you can play with right now during this video and then they
want you to play the game i'm like no you look if you want to pay me you just recommend it and i
won't i don't like saying it's good because i personally personally for me i hate mobile games
and so i'll say all i'll say is that look there are a lot of if i ever because i have done one
vikings or a cleanse but i didn't like it and then i've turned them down since right and it's
because i i won't say it's great but i will say look some people enjoy it and and if these people
enjoying it there's a good because my wife likes mobile games as a matter of fact so i know when's
the divorce yeah what a horse what what you said someone did you say something a horse i don't think
so i don't know okay i don't know um yeah but so some people like it i'll say and so if they're
gonna pay me just to let my viewers know that this game exists and there's a chance they might like it
that's that i'm you know i was willing to do that then they want you to say i play it and you can
join me in the game and it's the best thing ever and all this stuff and i'm like yeah and don't
don't forget to mention your favorite character as well yeah Blorganak the orc barbarian yeah all of
their interchangeable characters all the women with their t armor chest flames like it's just
i don't when somebody's there like oh this is comparable to the greatest to the biggest rpgs
on console and pc it's like yeah the witcher three cyberpunk 2077 skyrim and raid shadow
hey listen raid shadow legends is the citizen cane of mobile games all right yeah i just like the
whole uh there's that meme but i swear this this meme came out like six years ago where it was just
like all the words that get interchanged on the something of something like the two somethings
always always change um and there's just loads of selections and i'm pretty sure there's raid
shadow legends is the next one i can't wait for raid shadow legends too that's where it's really at
yeah raid shadow legends is so good how come there's not a raid shadow legends too
and i guess it's gonna be called fighting daylight heroes yeah i guess
the thing that's just like frustrating is everybody now like acknowledges that you know
and all the ads are like we know you've heard of us like so why are you doing this why are you
subjecting with this just give it up because they keep the lights on you have to imagine that uh
they've reached like critical mass in terms of is there anybody who hasn't heard of it
who is willing to do something with it now you know well i mean well we had the victorian age
the classical age the information age and now it's the raid shadow legends age
it's just the progression of our species i think i think the best one i've seen that like the
sponsorship i've seen for raid channel legends was the internet historians one because he just
takes the nikki out yeah i like uh i like the one that flash gets does i'm surprised they left it
into it internet historians one go honestly um i i think it was uh chase who was showing
uh rags and i i can't remember but um the the ad itself i was like if this was my mobile game
i'd be like nah you're making it seem like a fucking joke which i'm surprised they let him do
it you know if i was ever to do another mobile sponsorship i would want to do it something like
that where i actually purposely take the nikki and i'm kind of nodding to my own audience that
because you know that i don't really like this game i'm just doing it
raid shadow legends i love this game
i'm playing it my face is it's a changeable uh archer lady with no like armor at all number 16
she's great i love her so much these characters are amazing aren't they
i'm the best part it's free i signed for the microphone
seriously guys help me i need something to get me out of this game i've played every day once
once we get some cyberware i'm gonna hook myself up to it and play it forever in my sleep
when i wake up for raid shadow legends vr oh god there's probably is some people out there i can
idle in the real world um i was just gonna say to get a few more of these double few shadow this
one just says shadiversity is amazing so do you agree with this objectively oh definitely not
i think he has a lot of issues and is this big neck beard armchair you know expert and it's just
yeah i i i don't know i don't know what people see in him honestly um shad what techniques could
be possible with dual wielding two swords that the blades pass through each other but are solid to
any other substance interesting hmm just means you get more versatility like this is why a dagger
in the offhand became far more preferable historically because uh there was far less
chance for the blades to hit and get tangled up in each other and when you got two long weapons
that's much more likely and it limits your versatility and so just means you're gonna have
far more versatility like if you were using a dagger in your hand and so uh like it wouldn't
make you unstoppable but it certainly would improve the techniques that you could employ
and so it's an interesting idea actually oh okay um how does shad think revenge of the sith has the
best duel crazy watch my fight scene autopsy i give a very detailed answer in that video
there we go
uh do you think that um any from the ot hold up strongly
as in the fight scenes oh um yeah yeah i re-watched um uh empire strikes back and there's some decent
exchanges there actually in fact i think the and i've been saying i'm i'm intending to do a fight
scene autopsy on this for a while and i still am there's just going to be a longer delay than i
was expecting um uh but yeah some of the exchanges in an empire actually really good and solid uh
the one in um uh return of the jedi that's when the techniques get a bit more oh uh but they can
be justified with the emotional brutality of the fight scene because it's just kind of given up
and it's just hitting as hard as he can and so there's a lot more telegraphing in that but yeah
like in terms of the exchanges in empire there's some yeah really good ones no telegraphing quick
fast good stances and things uh good stuff still holds up and what about
oh like i'm definitely gonna be doing one of the riser sky because that is horrible
if you had to pick one is the best
the best it might be the first if out of the seagull seagulls it might be uh force awakens
has the best one and that's still pretty bad um probably because you can get away with like
they're mostly hacking at each other it's just kylo this sort of weird in that one
yeah but there are i like from memory i think there's a couple of small exchanges that actually
had a bit more um uh technical complexity in them um i'm not sure i'm not sure if you'll
agree with me on this shed but do you get the impression that in the sequel trilogy
lightsabers seem to have doubled in weight yeah like holy crap like the yeah the amount of
telegraphing and it was just the most horrible blatant example of this is in riser skywalker
they are swinging around like they're ten kilos my god yeah i you know in the original movies
they seem like really light weapons they seemed really light well in the prequels they seem really
light too but even in the ot they're pretty light because they're Darth Vader yeah Darth
Vader is using one in one hand in um empire strikes back and he's doing some really quick
subtle movements and exchanges in with one hand movements um and so yeah not only does
it show that they can be moved you know uh with speed uh but also that they are decently light
but the other oh sorry go ahead well i was just gonna say that the other thing with lightsabers
is that you don't need power to do lethal force with a lightsaber exactly you just need a touch
of basically that that's the thing it makes sense that they're really light because all the weight
is um is the you know the the um handle well there's no way canonically this is uh this has
been said but it's contradicted by how they've been portrayed in the movies but i think i like
people have all shared with me that even george has said lightsabers themselves are actually
decently heavy the beam basically has no weight but they feel like they have weight from a gyroscopic
effect from the magnetic field they produce or something like that because uh when even when
like um darth vader and this is because it's a prop when darth vader threw it in return the jedi
the rotation is spinning around the beam portion but that's because it was a problem and they've
justified that in canon that and that they have a sense of weight in the energy portion but with it
but with everything else that's shown in the movies that um you can move these around really
fast and then they try to explain that's because using the force but then you have non-forced
users pick up these lightsabers and move around just as fast like fin in rise of skywalker not
no i mean force awakened yeah he is a force yeah but he didn't know how to use he didn't know how
to pick things up yeah but ray didn't know that there was such a thing as forced mind tricking
people but he raised a freaking mary sue fringy they're all about mind control i just love how
people are like yeah that makes sense it's like do you think it makes sense to do something that
you never even conceived of being something that you could do you know it would be good if i could
control this guy's mind right now holy shit i just i just tried it i don't know i can't believe
this this is fucking amazing i i i didn't know that i could uh just turn off the the the lady
of falcon and flip it around so that you can do it where to direct it on a time so oh before you
she's got experience with ships like she explicitly says she's never floated before
uh yeah and also like even if she has experience with ships could you imagine like in another
movie or something like a world war two movie where the guy like whether or not she's experienced
or not how is she better than anyone who's flown that thing before because she bypassed the
compressor oh shit what is it with the compressor because anything came up in the right the
rise forced bull crap the last one it's like yeah yeah i came up again
can you guys finally fix the fucking compress you just keep screwing around with it
so i actually i don't mind the fact it's not consistent which is a big problem but if they
if all of the fights were like from the sequels where the lightsabers did apparently have some
weight to them but they would like slice through anything they were so there was a little bit of
telegraphing involved but i i i probably might actually prefer that um it's easier for me to
keep track of when i'm watching a fight and in a way it's like it looks it looks its own way when
you're fighting with heavier stuff instead of you know the very very quick motions but i'm fine with
lightsabers being heavy but you got to pick one are they lighter are they heavy well a heavy sword
would get telegraphed a lot but a heavy lightsaber still wouldn't because its blade is super hot it
doesn't matter how fast you come at someone with it what do you mean by heavy sword this is a very
triggering comment for me a sword that's heavy i don't know i don't know what to say
some are the heaviest one the heaviest sword the biggest ones but heavy heavy swords are heavy
by definition also yeah but heavy is relative shad you know what i mean shad i own one i know
yeah but poorly made was a competent swordsman won't get overly like for the for the in their
right categories right uh for their size because of course a great sword is heavier in comparison
to a long sword or a arming sword and stuff like that but for the size of a great sword they are
remarkably light for the size of because they're thin and then they probably balance and stuff
like that and it's the poorly made ones that when you actually pick up they feel oh this is heavy
like the proper sensation for a properly made sword when someone picks it up is like oh this
is lighter than it looks that's what swords are they are generally far lighter than people perceive
it's so sorry what about clouds buster swords
so yeah i'm fine with lightsabers being like heavy swords
yes but even even still they wouldn't be telegraphed the way that someone like ray does it
where she like she like yells and lifts it above her head and goes
and i i so much prefer fast well executed complex kind of maneuvers that we see in the prequel
that takes planning and effort yeah and speed is a game change in swordsmanship if you're faster
than your opponent you have such an edge and so i i wish just funny i i feel like ray would lose
against an average night like a really average night in rise of skywalker she just gets tired
in terms of the technical complexity in those fight scenes if they were still using a fight
scene i am arrogant and confident enough to say that i reckon i could beat ray with a regular
sword against her using a lightsaber because i just wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't bind with
their weapon because she telegraphed so much you just hold your your stance let her swing at you
and you see it a mile away and just move your sword out of the way you step back and then take
adventure because they overswing all the time and so you just need to let them swing they overswing
and then their side is way open and then you just slash them and it's like they're that bad i've
already ran away with this in my head and it's like okay so you win they do what about rags and
you've got a little lightsaber in your mouth and then as soon as the fight starts you drop it and
pull out a pistol and shoot it i don't think she ever blocked because she only ever used the
lightsaber to fight kylo ren it's so boring did we talk about this before that if you try to
block a bullet with the lightsaber it would melt and splash the molten steam on your face
and while we were watching um mandalorian i think mauler and i we were talking about
i had mentioned that you know if you were going to go around killing jedi then if you had a blaster
that shot three bolts at once you could kill jedi with that without much of an issue and then
mauler brought up oh my god the super battle droids have tri shots is that what it's for canonically
to kill jedi they have that wrist gun that shoots three at once which you can't block with a
lightsaber so i'm like oh my god it's all coming together george new george new
the bad lad we're so sorry george come back i said the exact same thing in my problem with
lightsaber's video that it's shown that jedi's can get overwhelmed with blaster fire they're
technically not invulnerable which is why they should be using shields my goodness right um
and the fact that shields canonically exist in star wars both juristy shields and energy shields
that the gungans use right um and so yeah you're absolutely right if you just you know
i overwhelm them with enough shots three in like in one single shot what do you mean shields don't
work in atmosphere and the other thing right the best weapon for the jedi based on their powers
is actually blasters long-range blasters they can use the force to increase their aim and so
can you imagine like death sniper jedi that would be insane oh he was my xbox life friend
back to 15 years ago you go death sniper you know he's a great guy um i like how this one
says before you go shad i think the fight choreography was bad because i could not follow
any of it at all i don't even know what this is referring to you must be referring to the
prequels i'm thinking is that is that like a follow-up based on how can i say that prequel
fight scenes are good no i i have no idea and i don't even know what episode that's from that
could literally be from like 20 episodes ago from from all i remember like but i'm sorry yeah i'm
sorry that we don't have the context for it uh could you tell shad that in his fight scene
autopsies he keeps referring to shots as scenes as a cinematographer it irks me love you guys
i'm sorry i understand that you have been shamed i have hey shad what do you think of
corvo's folding sword from dishonored i haven't played it i need to see um huh i think the folding
sword it's been a while since i've played it i think it's a sword that folds on like at the hilt
where the generally where the blade connects with a hand guard it like pivots in and out but let me
double check don't let me actually google it all righty generally folding swords are have inherent
issues because you need rigidity in your blade and if there is like a fold point that is also
a focal point for stress and can and so even if it like it's holding it in point having a hinge
there creates a much higher chance of it breaking this is like the disassembleable swords you know
the ones that are made out of a separate part that you're like highlander every you guys seen
the classic highlander yes that guy he's got the sword that he like clips together out of parts
that would that would that would oh that would break really easily i think i have a i think i
have a gif of it that i can post for you to look at real quick all right also is your microphone
top efficiency right now shad you sound a little bit muffled that's all do oh i don't know i can
check um is it all about is it sound issues not too much of an issue but if there's anything
you could do to you know do anything with it all right i'm gonna check because i wonder if
it's even picking up the mic audio
okay
sorry sorry just just chat amongst yourselves while i try and oh boy that sun sure is hot
oh that's uh dishonored yeah corvo's the protagonist of yeah this sort of looks
really cool doesn't it yeah one of the questions i've got saved in here is satan what makes a good
spiderman adaptation
oh you guys on the subject of swords are you familiar with a show called forged by fire
or forged in fire i think it is um sounds familiar it's it's a show yeah yeah on the
history channel where they build swords and it's awesome it's a really cool show and there are a
couple youtube channels doing that as well like only build fictional swords oh i mean maybe yeah
like they make the sword and then they do a bunch of tests like um trying to cut through
a thing as to how sharp it is try to cut through bones to see if it'll break
yeah i think uh the one i used to watch was matted arms and then it became like matted arms
reforged i think um right yeah they made some cool stuff a lot of it was very impractical
because it was all from video games and movies where it was ridiculous but
you know like like dishonored sword i think they made the uh the buster sword
and it was like it's just so ridiculous this enormous sword that has this really thin small
handle it's like to pick it up but it's uh it whacked it it whacked a wallop it packed a punch
people know what the show is in chat i can see it has become static i'm
i understand oh sorry can you hear me now is that better yeah yeah we can hear you
is it clearer yes i think so yeah i think hard hard to tell you're all right before for me at
least yeah okay because if it's not this it'll be internet i apologize people no this is this is
fine this is definitely clear um also yeah i guess i meant matted arms if i didn't say that i think i
said something else but yes oh matted arms reforged yeah great stuff really like him
well we're just talking about um shout have you heard of a show called forged in fire
oh yeah and i like it is hard to get a get like a copy of that here in australia um and it was on
one of the broadcasters here all the australian free-to-air broadcast is suck by the way in case
yeah the uh the pickings are pretty slim it came on sbs for a short time there so i tried streaming
it but holy crap the ads that they spin in that yeah so many ads in their streaming thing i was
like i can't deal with this nothing is like i i don't like because every single network here
except for maybe abc because abc is non-commercial when it comes to trying to watch stuff on their
platform that ads and oh you need to sign up to channel nine to watch channel nine it's like
no thanks yeah i'd rather not yep say like i gave up was like no i'm not putting on all this crap
hey but you know what i was forged in fire because yeah that show that show was really cool like when
i watched a couple episodes where they're like testing out swords on um and then they're walking
through oh you know you made your sword it's too rounded at this part or it's flexing like they
they have a final challenge where they try and cut right through a giant pig carcass and uh you do
you have like one guy who saw just completely bends and wobbles around and then the other dude
slices clean through and it's like that was a controversy i've heard like because the judges
they have experience in knife making and they have like a knife fighting expert and they know
nothing about how to use swords properly and the one that flopped his edge alignment was basically
hitting with the flat it's like right so they when they do swords they really need a sword
expert on there like get mad eastern on there for heaven's sake seriously yeah you're sort of
expert's important because if you're going to be determining who wins or loses depending on how it
cuts and you don't cut it correctly for one of them exactly exactly i'm sorry they there is a
shot of the knife guy hitting with like a claymore or something on a pig carcass and his bending heaps
and it's hitting with the flat and and it's like because he's supposed to be the weapons expert
he won't say that he stuffed up this cut it was like oh sorry the sword's bad it's like no it
wasn't yeah no it's it's it's funny when it comes to the whole judge thing and how you can't question
have you seen clips of the american master chef uh yeah not like not recently well the thing is
right because gordon ramsay's on it and there's this guy called joe who i guess feels like he needs
this guy called joe so motherfucker so this this guy joe he just he's just acts like kind of a
complete douche like he asks someone to explain their dish and cuts him off he's like this is
a master or raider it's like dude get fucked just fucking off dude he's such a twat nobody just
pray and then he like grabs their food and throws it in the bin he's not even tasting it it's like
how do you know it's bad you're just assuming it's bad based on how it looks oh it's just master
looker yeah maybe they were maggots on it freaking you don't know i just hope it walks
everybody's like is this what we expect in this late stage of the competition you know it's just
like dude shut up just shut up take your money and go home all right so i'm looking at the pictures
rags posted about the uh disorder blade thing and if it's basically a flick blade that that'll work
i mean as long as the connection point is solid enough and the blade doesn't have segments in it
so there's stress points that could work that seems all right now i actually have a question
about that you just said segments and stress points so you have a sword that has multiple
like like a hypothetical and this is definitely not something that i've come up with because i
want to do it in a story that not at all definitely but my friend was talking to me about
stuff yeah and yeah quickly patent it oh and it's like imagine a sword that is like a lightsaber
but it's just a sword so it shoots out like it extends out with multiple segments i imagine
that that's like like a telescope yeah sort of yeah so it would need to be made out of some
super futuristic or magical material no titanium would not be out of momentum whole structure
because to telescope a blade the segments need to be so damn thin for it to be right you know flick
out smooth and for the blades in between and because of that it's gonna have no so if it's
built out of contrivium then it will be fine yes then you're fine contrivium surprisingly is the
perfect material for that kind of thing like that that's like that is the perfect material yeah hit
it on the head oh well the more you know about swords of course that that makes perfect sense
that a sword and medicine isn't gonna work properly um chad is rise of skywalker the pineapple
on pizza of star wars no that's the sequel trilogy is the spider the sequel trilogy is the steaming
turd on pizza of star wars but he's just calling it pineapple even though pineapple on pizza is an
atrocity that doesn't even do the justice for how bad this is i guess i guess it's a follow-up is
like well shad was this film the spaghetti bolognese you were looking for no absolutely not absolutely
not and uh hi shad i liked your book would you let jj verms or ryan johnson make it a movie i'm
joking don't let them need a book well if they offered you like a million to buy the story like
if they paid me a lot of money and they didn't touch the script like well jj can make something
even then though wouldn't you be assuming they'd kill it in some way i know well this is the other
this is the other side right is there are so many horror stories of uh of authors getting their work
adapted and and they get these promises all these promises from the hollywood you know producers
stuff like that saying yes we're going to do this for you going to do that for you that and they
screw them over right up the rear end right after and we saw it happen with george lucas
they promised all this stuff with george lucas and yeah we'll do your movie and everything
we'll take care of your characters they totally took care of his characters oh i don't think i
could trust any promises like it like because i was gonna like if you had reassurances but
reassurances aren't enough but if if say hypothetically the reassurances were actually
held honestly and true then i'll be willing but i just i could never trust i i'm not sure i could
ever you know take those reassurances as as valid because there are so many stories of hollywood
just screwing over the creators and just by saying f u once they have the rights then it's
like now we can do what we want i guess it depends on what the contract is doesn't it whether or not
even even even like they hide things they find loopholes and stuff like um i was really following
closely uh the negotiations that awesome scott card was sharing about in this game and he had
some really strong um uh like desires for how in this game was going to be adapted and they
screwed him over basically still um oh did they yeah right like ender was supposed to be like
really young young even younger than what he was depicted they wanted they wanted to make ender
like 19 years old like or or you know some some like sexy kind of space tactician guy and also was
always like children yes children sexy six-year-old i got um how did he go ahead no i was just saying
and yeah he wanted him much younger even than what it ended up being and and they still they
did younger than what they wanted but not as younger as ender should have been for the context
of the monks i got i got two messages that call shadow in terms of law oh my god bring it on want
me to bend over ready to receive it so this this one's a little lighter it's the uh the red color
is because for lightsabers now because you're saying you choose red you don't want it to be
considered an evil color they said the red color is because of poorly made synthetic kyber crystals
that the sith use and as for eons the jedi held ilium ilum sorry where saber crystals naturally
come from that's why they all right all right so i want to like i've heard multiple explanations
of the red color and this is just one on the pile and i have no friggin idea what's true canon now
yeah first off whoever sent that super chat is a fucking nerd oi oi oi we're not nerds okay
ignore the title of this stream okay we're the chads we're the jocks nerds again you call me
chadiversity yeah i just don't know what the origin is now because even in um the four
no the knights of the old republic video games had their own explanation for where the red crystal
comes from and as they you know in in the in the caves where the crystals come from the red one
grows in an egg and you have to kill an innocent life to get the egg before it's like i don't
absorb in the animal probably and then i've also heard that um you need to infuse it with
the dark force or something like i'm sorry i thought you said to like slit someone's
throat and have them bleed all over a good lightsaber and turns it evil younglings
the blood of younglings turns your lightsaber red um like star wars is just prejudice against the
red color okay it's like if it's red it has to be evil it's like type casting it's like
it's not evil red lightsabers being evil is toxic masculinity yes exactly and so this this
one's more of a blame one because i think you said that uh it's not such a big deal that asoka
is one of the voices at the end meaning she's dead because she was probably dead at that point
anyway right god was a source of attitude well this person says asoka was confirmed alive after
the battle of end or shad her species lives up to 80 years force sensitive up to 200 she'd be in
her 70s by the rise of skywalker okay so battle of endor she was alive what the hell was she doing
fighting a star destroyer it's another place okay like so if she was still fighting something
you know i would have assumed that the whole galaxy would have been the greater threat
and that uh some people just didn't know about it some people didn't know i guess okay she wasn't
given an email did she become disillusioned with the jedi because i heard that she wasn't a jedi
anymore at the um during the um yeah she has a line i think it was in rebels where she says uh
she's not a jedi yeah but i feel like that's the kind of because this is the issue with this series
is it kind of likes to go into this gray area thing but not ever throw away the fact that the
jedi are the protagonists undoubtedly so every time someone says i'm not a jedi the jedi suck
it's like nah you don't believe i'm on your splint hairs here um but yeah that's the jedi light
that's all the ones i can find so far you're gonna have a whole bunch more the next time you come on
from this stream more than likely um uh oh wait shad a castle's still a good idea if you include
anti-aircraft weapons so just to be clear are they saying is your castle better with anti-aircraft
weapons i guess yeah well i i shad would the inclusion of anti-aircraft guns make a castle
worse i guess it's interesting there's actually there is actually an interesting answer this
because um the germans during world war two made some crazy crazy like epic um anti-aircraft
fortresses right that you might be i mean technically their fortresses are not castles if
you're going according to strict definition but castle becomes a fairly strong anyway and stuff
but it is a very interesting kind of study to look at the evolution of the concept of static
fortifications and fortresses and stuff like that and they have like massive anti-aircraft kind of
you know uh fixtures to them and uh they were they seem to have worked well effectively enough
um in terms of taking on aircraft from a fortified strong hold uh thing and so if if you actually
had to deal with air you know aircraft as a as a threat to your castle yeah add in an anti-aircraft
gun absolutely and it's been done kind of historically in world war two um oh and and
the end of this thing just ends with space cancer space cancer space cancer space cancer
space cancer ah i don't know i don't think they like space cancer you could say none of that
question for shad what would be the best elemental enchantment for a sword
what do you mean by element all right i guess the basic ones fire water air earth i'm guessing
like the classic i don't know how they would work in a sword exactly i suppose fire would
just you know slash someone and they well earth is often linked with poison well that's what i
mean like what then after you figure out what elements because i come fire included as part
of the core elemental you know things always bugs me because technically fire is air i mean ruin
swords as well well it also depends on how it's adapted into the thing if it just does it make
the blade really really hot or is it literally sheathed in fire that's just burning all around
because that would have an intimidation factor it could technically cauterize the wounds that you
strike which might not be help out the the burning around the wound would be painful as all hell for
the person getting cut um but like air right if you're adapting air onto a blade in what way is
there like a a flow of air that's a razor thin that creates a shearing force on top of the blade
which increases its cutting capacity and helps separate material because in that sense air would
actually be a vicious enchantment to have on a sword in that sense and it might actually be far
more devastating than the fire one so again it depends on how it's adapted is earth poison that's
another question maybe the air one just makes it smell nice yeah but but technically fire is
the result of you know oxygen and carbon it's technically if you actually want to pick up the
elements of fire it's air and earth if you're going to include carbon as part of the earth
things and so it's always bug me it's not it's not a core element okay i like that that you have
carbon you know what's the element carbon nitrogen yeah yeah well it's funny right like this is the
better way to handle um fundamental elements in the setting because if i was ever doing a magic
based system this is the one that i had written and i haven't you know written on one of my notes
that i would resort to i wouldn't do earth fire with water i would do the states of matter
solid liquid gas heat and cold those are the core states that's what you do and then if you wanted
to you have create fire from these things it would actually be employing wind sorry wind
and heat technically and you bond them then to carbon or flammered you know material um that's
how it would work scientifically just saying well well sounds like fun um i suppose uh the
there are the questions i can find in my in my notes there will be more for next time like i said
but uh and apologies yeah i'll just say apologies to everyone in this stream who are doing your
super chat if they're directed towards me because i'm probably not going to be hanging around for
the super chat portion i'm sorry i'm going to miss it and also i really appreciate all the
comments in chat saying wishing me well for the surgery so thanks guys i appreciate it absolutely
sir we will we will have you back the moment you're available as well there's always more to talk
about can't wait can't wait we'll probably start we'll have to kill it bad lord season two as well
that'll happen eventually they probably i don't even know if they finished doing that yes i know
they started filming it um we're getting close uh which brings us to the main event uh this is
a weird efap because there's not going to be a video to talk about at all actually it's just
going to be discussionisms which we've done before but um oh actually there is one thing
i wanted to show shad actually two things he's probably seen one of them before but the first
one is a couple people in chat have said it they want you to see the um the lightsaber suit mad
assess him
um all right so my concern would be accidentally stabbing yourself
say you're running at full sprint right the light sabers coming out of the knees has a good
chance that they might accidentally stewing you especially on like at the downward swing of your
elbow right if you accidentally cross over partially over your leg because they do get closer
you know in the jogging and you're not used to having objects sitting out so you need to train
yourself to avoid you know the direction redirecting accidentally redirecting those
light sabers into any parts of your body that would be that would be very dangerous but if you
got used to it well you know having like laser swords when you knee or elbow someone just increases
your lethality a bit so there could there could be some like falling down a series of steps or
something you'd end up as a pile of flash at the top of it just slices you up we'll just think
about all the things you can't do like this about you you sit down and you lean on your knee
and you stab both your arm and your leg at the same time you turn them off to do that for you
gosh uh how does he turn them off with his mind oh of course yeah this is so stupid somebody
looked at this and they thought oh this is awesome and then um the other image is uh someone i was
made aware of recently i don't know if you saw it on twitter yet or not but it's the shad oh yes
i saw that this morning i was like that is glorious i love it i like to be probably artistic
but rarely shows side effects king of neckbeards too humble to wear a crown i love the probably
autism have you seen the the the pommel on your sword is a little dick
i miss that oh it's glorious i love it um so i hope i hope it gets spread out amongst the
internet like this scarred his bully pillow after finding the moral compass oh that's what you got
there yeah the uh the final evolution of neckbeard i will take it i accept it and embrace it
beautiful yeah it's glorious uh with those two done yes so we're supposed to be talking about
the mandalorian um how do i how do we how do we start this up i suppose it's like uh
should we explain the arc we went on it with let's do the preamble yeah the preamble first
i'm kind of interested in hearing our our individual ratings out of 10 for it um and
and then just if you liked it or disliked it and then we can kind of oh man all right you know
i'll go first i'll set i'll set the tone so uh there's lots that i like about it on a rather
superficial level unfortunately but if i was to say like be consistent with with how i break down
stories this one suffers immensely is like we're looking very very low scoring higher than the
disney trilogy i think we'll go through it today and figure that out probably but uh i don't know
like a like a three out of ten for the season whoa whoa that's that's that's harsh man who's next
well i'll go next right i really enjoyed it i really enjoyed it and uh i mean i'll be the
first one to admit that there is some baffling kind of uh choices in in in certain parts of
the narrative and there are contradictions and inconsistencies on and just weird things
that that are happening um but i found for myself a lot to enjoy in it um and uh and so for me
because there was so much i enjoyed and i i did look at some of the more baffling weird things
and i kind of you know found ways that they might be explained in the actual narrative itself in some
circumstances and so for me i might i would i would be i would want to probably give it say a
six out of ten if i was to just rate it the writing quality overall but the other more superficial
things i really enjoyed in it like for instance just like the production values and there's all
that i have a whole list that i will get into later that actually encourages me to up it to a
seven out of ten if i was to rate it all right bring you want to go now maybe i'll go next
because i'm guessing rags it's going to be the hardest i really like just just a bit of
background so my big thing that i really like and want to see more of a space bounty hunter stories
that's like my big thing that i like i feel like there's not nearly enough you know you got metroid
but that's kind of been on ice and then you had prey too or actual prey too and then that got
you know thrown away um so like when this got i was really i really wanted to like it and i did
right at the beginning and then it just began to deteriorate with each successive episode
it just started getting worse and worse and then picked up a little bit and then went
back down again um i mean yeah like it's probably a four if i would if i would have rank it with
while divorcing sort of the stuff that i like like the armor and the music i guess the music
does contribute to it though i don't think you can divorce those elements i think you should
include those in your overall rating well wait wait wait wait if he just says i like the armor
that's not really a strong argument yeah but like music is no yeah the music is great yeah yeah
yeah the music's really good well i i probably shouldn't have said it like that so what i mean
is the stuff that i guess i was already predisposed to liking like the the visuals and there and what
i mean by that is i guess not just how technically well done it was but how much i personally like it
so if i were to say yeah it'd probably be like a four if i had to give it a rating even though
there were probably times when i was really enjoying it even though it didn't like there
were parts that i enjoyed it um even though i knew that they didn't make sense or were kind
of stupid but yeah it's probably yeah would you yeah would your rating change if you were trying
to rate it as a mercenary bounty hunter you know because you said you really enjoyed that aspect of
it okay um sorry could you just say that again would your rating change if you're going to try
and include your views or enjoyment of it as a lone mercenary bounty hunter kind of story
my issue is that um the big problem and this is something that will probably become apparent as
we go through this uh series is that there were a lot of ways that they could have made this like a
nine out of ten show if they just made if they kept the things that um like like they could have
kept the same plot points but if they just like spent more time on each individual thing if if
this if what happened in this season was spread across two or three seasons like it could have
been really really good does that mean moving on to rags yeah well so i've what's interesting
is that i think this is the same with mauler but we both watched them the first time together and
the second time together so we'll probably line up fairly closely um if i was going to rate it out
of 10 with a five being completely average then i'd probably give it around a three at the most
the things that i really like about it are for the most part um the music uh a lot of the visual
effects are good some of the sets and the props and stuff are really nice but ultimately that
stuff is a lot more superficial than stuff like story and character and the you know nonsense that
has things progress as it does that we'll get into um so i'll probably go with a three
i won't be harshest to say a two but maybe the more and more we talk about it i might uh it might
make a change either way but we'll we'll see because i got my notes here that are opened up
as we finished watching all the episodes this morning and it was just it was it was rough trying
to keep up a lot of the times trying to get our notes together from all the stuff that we found
wrong psa uh i'd appreciate it not saying you can't do it and that includes the cast and the chat
to refrain from ascribing motivation for as long as you can all right the obvious two choices are
mauler fringy and rags just don't like it because it's made by disney and or
shad only likes it because it's better than the sequel trilogy and he's not
doing standards probably let's let's keep that aside for as long as we can folks well the thing
is right it's worthwhile to note for everybody that mauler eggs and i we we like liked it a lot
for the first two episodes we publicly said that we have publicly said before that we were very
much on our side yeah we we actually we went to bat for it against uh other people yeah
we we said episode one and two were really good really solid uh i don't have that opinion anymore
but there was i legitimately really thought that the show was good and i remember when
fringy mauler and myself watched it for the first time we were absolutely excited for more we were
ready we were like oh my god is this going to be good is this going to be and then by the time by
the time we got to episode four it's like oh it's it's four is definitely the one it's so bad um
but yeah i guess does i mean we should we should start up with episode one or should we do some
kind of i think i think we should but out of interest and this i am interested have any like
just can make a comparison here to the witcher have any of you guys seen the witcher no i haven't
seen it yet and i have everything from it's great to it's terrible and everything in between yeah
yeah because um i uh like i have some more harsh views on the witcher overall um i found it
enjoyable enough to make me want to watch season seven because i like garold and i have a whole
review on my channel right um but in comparison and this is what i find interesting i actually
think mandalorian is better than the witcher especially in terms of the writing because the
witcher on the like with the writing the witcher gets really messy like really um and people are
loving the witcher and so i just find that really interesting because like because i was yeah that's
why i wanted to ask if any of you guys like the witcher because for me objectively i think the
witcher is worse than mandalorian so well rags we should watch that just to get a rest of the
situation i it's definitely been on our list of things to watch but i'm totally down for checking
out the witcher uh oh yeah i guess so if anybody's unclear on it this episode i don't know how long
it'll take it's gonna be all about mandalorian and then it's probably gonna be all super chats
we'll try and square up as many as we can from the overflow and then the following week is going to be
the episode where we we look at all of the picture memes we've got a couple of video ones uh the
script that was coming out from colin traver row the was it a quote from a nazi or movie bob
and um there's a fourth thing oh yeah the i know right the i hate everything conversation all of
that is going to be one episode next week um i'm not even sure what guests will have for that because
it's going to be weird as an episode but obviously we've swapped them around because uh it benefits
shad's schedule and um i think it works out for the best because we've we're fresh off the presses
from watching mandalorian so i suppose it's time everybody's um so indeed episode one is probably
the strongest uh imo it is the strongest i i think that after watching him again i would say that
episode one is the strongest with another contender being episode two episode two yeah
yeah would you say that episode one is is still like decent to good or um i guess should we just
go through it yeah go episode by episode again so the format for this we'll try and do chronological
but i think it should be pretty free flow and throw in goods and bads i suppose there's no real need
to say that we do them separately or something um do we just start by lining up what are the
good things that we're not going to dispute the visuals the soundtrack uh yes photography
we'll just say straight up those are really good yeah for the most part the um visuals are really
good it's very impressive looking uh a lot of money went into the production value in that aspect
the ships the effects the aliens all that stuff the environments it looks really really good
never had any issue with bad cgi that i'm aware of uh parts that i can think of are so minor it's
not even really worth mentioning um but they're very very technically impressive on that level
yeah oh i was just because i actually think it deserves more credit for how impressive
the visuals were for it because like in terms of quality i'm not talking about scale
but quality they were easily as good as film like the the individual ships and stuff and like
i was watching the mud horn fight scene again in episode two and it was flawless like the
interaction of that thing in the mud and the the physicality that you feel when he impacts
the mantle like that was yes it's uh visually it looks really good it's unfortunate that what
happens in that fight is absurd but we'll get to that well we'll get to that because like i i have
never seen a tv series done so technically well and i i loved it for that because i got to enjoy
a longer form story in the quality of a movie and i personally feel it needs a more credit for doing
that because i've never seen anything else like again look at the witcher the witcher has some
horrible cgi and that's a big budget huge netflix release right you saw game of thrones right
uh parts yeah yeah um and the the draggers were pretty darn good in game of thrones absolute
credit there um they certainly cut back in and in certain flight scenes and battles with scale and
budget constraints and also like the ways that they depicted castles they all they're always using
kind of static painted backdrops for the castles in the first season of things and so that's why i
think mandalorian had none of that like when it shows you like uh the planets or the flying in
or the overhead shots or the uh there there was a smaller city town granted but when you're seeing
it over overhead it was flawless like i it was brilliant so i really liked it for that and so
when we say that the visuals were good i think no the visuals were brilliance um i mean that do you
remember in episode eight when ig 11 fights those two stormtroopers that one is probably
the only it's probably the only example of the cgi being bad but it's bad like it's it's very
obvious the animations um i'm pretty sure the stormtroopers outfits in that one scene as well
are very plasticky looking and yeah they look very bad the rust looks like it was colored in
yeah it definitely stood out as being very cheap but that was like the only instance yeah there
was one other one the the the robots in episode was a five when they uh go onto the ship to spring
the guy from prison oh that's episode six episode six well there some of the the robot guards that
were cg were there was one shot that was oh well that's yeah but again this is this is like uh
five hours of content yeah and the other thing is is like you see those mistakes and in actual fact
you see one's done worse than that in full-fledged feet full sorry full-fledged oh yeah yeah um and
stuff and so the fact that it was still that quality so consistently really impressive yeah
yeah no it's visually it's from a production standpoint it's really well put together
agreed um but the writing yeah yeah i was gonna say it's funny because i think an easy first
topic considering the first shot and the first thing you hear in this whole show is the fobs
um yeah let's talk about the phone shall we frank let's let's talk about the fobs uh
fobs will hunt this show eight episodes basically i will see this is interesting i'm here i want to
hear your takes because i've done i've thought about the fobs a lot and and because i like
it's funny everyone has a bias and because i did enjoy the mandolary and i have found myself being
more forgiving or at least willing to go to a bit more effort to try and see if things were
justified or not and i will admit when things when things are like irredeemable and and they're
broken i will admit it um especially if you're you really have to make up stuff to justify things
that aren't even alluded to in the episodes but i actually i actually found some things that
explain the fobs a little bit so this will be an interesting topic all right who wants to take
point on the fobs anybody yeah you go for it so one of the things about fobs is that there's
a lot of stuff that we don't know about them uh which isn't necessarily a problem but eventually
it does get to a point where we start to wonder how does this work and at what point is it going
to be explained to us so we know what the rules are for fobs um one of the other one of the issues
surrounding fobs though is they're apparent uh they tend to be forgotten as a thing they don't
get made uh factions don't use them when they need to namely imperials true should we get to
that though when we hit those episodes where they should be yeah yeah i was just uh touching on it
lightly we it's never mentioned how you can get rid of a fob tracker which struck me as very very
odd especially uh if the story is there's a there's a fob tracking baby yoda for the whole
season essentially but it's never in all the episodes of one we watched and re-watched
never has it brought up the idea of how do we get rid of the fob tracker how do we
elude it how do we stop it as if it's assumed there's no way to do it which causes an
incredible amount of questions to be raised for the rest of star wars and how you can find people
and how these could be used in the story or abused for story purposes um fobs are
they're very they're strange in the way that they're used yeah the fundamental question we
need is what are they tracking specifically what are they tracking we don't know so maybe
they're tracking their their life i don't know bite okay okay so i had all the same questions
as you guys and i i was actually starting to feel that fobs are starting to break a lot of
elements because of these are like basically magic tracking devices that that kind of breaks
star wars why the heck wasn't that why didn't darth vader use them to find the location of the
rebel base and he had to interrogate and um and all that stuff and so yeah like what what seems
being implied on the surface is that these things are broken and so i was i was really
wondering and and so it started with me just saying okay how would i if i was not trying to
find clues in the episodes how on earth will i even explain how they work like dna tracking
that three hyperspace force they're they're connected with force sensing people and stuff
and so i was coming up empty but when i was re-watching the episodes um uh just i guess to uh
to bring up your point you know how do you get rid of a fob tracker it's not explained that they
did not do a good job if if they and and i'm worried that this might be me picking up clues
from what's shown and and then explaining it through what's implied and then it's going to
be contradicted later on because this happens all the time in star wars like um you know when
people say we're trying to explain why luke didn't use their the the fighter to go help the
rebels in um uh force no uh last jedi because and everyone just said well naturally the ship must
be broken okay and that was the logical implication that was a satisfying explanation and then it was
contradicted by the next bloody movie and i could be doing this i fully admit okay and i fully admit
that it is not uh explained explicitly when it should be because it implies these things
but i think it's actually shown rather than explained with two key scenes um what the first
scene is when mando goes to the imperial guy and the imperial guy gives the information on baby yoda
and he says um all i can give you is his age and the last known location but with that information
you should have and someone of your capabilities should uh be able to find it and then when baby
yoda is about to get snipered by the bounty hunter on the planet in episode four um so when
they go to the bounty hunter the i forget her name but she specifically says that um they know his
here meaning that seems to imply when i when i heard that i was like oh that's interesting they
need to know the location before the fob points which implies that fobs are restricted by range
that you at least need to be on the planet um for you for one to be able to find and then you need
something some type of marker to be able to scan for the individual what is that marker well i was
wondering i was like okay what's the answer here and i was looking well in star wars they do have
fairly advanced scanning when luke is flying down to dega bar in um in uh empire strikes back he
scares the planet is like well there's no structures but there's heaps of life forms everywhere
and so that's actually really advanced scanning that you can scan entire planet life form things
and if you have that capacity in just a small fighter it means the scanning technology can be
fairly portable and so if you could scan an entire but you need to be in the range of the planet and
if you can scan the entire planet for a life form that is specifically 50 years old that could give
you a decent number of hits well when i say decent number like if the planet is not as highly
populated well that would give you only like a certain number that you could then work through
and then okay well if it's in too secluded or it needs to be amongst other life forms everything
you kind of you know work through things to actually narrow down the areas in which it's
pointing and then if the scanning could get so advanced that could actually lock on to
um the species you're actually scanning for a specific species well then that kind of explains
it it could actually explain that fobs need to be uh at least within a planetary range and that
explains how the whole mandalorians is like how he could actually try and lie low and escape the
range of the fobs his intention was to go to a secluded planet that was completely off the radar
of anyone um and that it was unlikely that anyone would even go to the planet to check it out
and so when i was like oh yeah i was like okay it might might actually explain what about that
that scene where he was getting attacked in space do fobs work in space as well or yeah if they're
within range if they're fast enough and so we're not we're not told what got the guy in the fighter
um to attack mando and he could have been refueling or any number of things and they
could have gotten proximity and the fobs just go ding ding um and we know that the fobs were
sent out to most of the you know bounty hunters and stuff and the fact that they had so at first
it was really hard for mandalorian to find yoda but once he found yoda and he handed them in
they went they did some type of tests they obviously got his blood and so they would have
species dna and everything and we don't exactly know how scanners work in star wars but we can
kind of assume that um they had a lot more information to scan for once baby yoda was
handed in and then and so therefore the fobs might be out of work far more i guess accurately
in pinpointing baby yoda's location after they got more in i guess biological information on him
so what do you guys think that's what i was kind of noticing when i was because i mean that's
that's that's a that's a like a lot of um i feel like there's a lot of stuff that is
partially extrapolated yeah it's going off because like it's going off what's implied
and what's shown um and what it really needed is someone to just simply say
these are the rules for i mean i think limitation of distance and they need basic biological
information to be out at scan for it but it is kind of implied because the the guy when he was
giving mando he says we know the last known location and then he gets some biological
information so but i've got to go ahead and say i would say that they should have no fobs at all
that's yeah i agree yeah i think you should get rid of the fobs and just have it be that bounty
hunters need to track people down properly yeah um i i think it takes a lot out of the
this is a little meta in some way but i think that having fobs that basically just point you
to where the guy is you're supposed to go get takes out an extremely both interesting but
substantial part of what it is to be a bounty hunter yeah you don't need to be smart or clever
you don't need to figure things out for that for that for that for that note but hang on because
if all you if you don't know their location to even get the fob to start to clue in yeah
that's a lot of if that's how fobs work though yeah but see you would it could take a lot of
work to try and find where the planet is to then use the fob to like you know scan in towards
whatever biological biological information you could be you know going off for it to track
so i i think there could still be a lot of difficulty in finding the planet and that is
kind of implied that you know they were on that that the backwater planet for weeks even after
the fight they say they actually say that these last few weeks you know he's been happy in
everything to talk about baby yoda and it took several weeks for one bounty hunter amongst all
the hundreds or thousands that have these things to finally find the planet where the fob might have
given him the clue so i think it like the fobs don't break the the whole kind of difficulty of
tracking people down if they have that limitation and i'm not saying i don't know it's just kind of
implied i still think that is a huge part of it that takes a lot of the work away from it
as well as if if you have fobs and they work along those rules then if you have things like guilds
here then that would significantly narrow down the amount of searching that a guild has to do
because it's not one person trying to track down individual planets it's an entire guild
that is using information because remember the guild has a vested interest in having their
members find marks so if you have a guild then their ability to cover planets all over the
galaxy very very quickly is significantly sped up so just to play devil's advocate then all right
um i'm wondering that okay you know if you want to take say fobs don't exist and that
bounty hunters needed a track right and stuff like that what it would make they would like to be
consistent they would need to use the scanning technology that's available in starless it's
already be implied sure but then you can explain that in scenes in the show yeah i know and the
scanning technology does seem to be pretty advanced and so the question is if you had someone's
species their age and you could scan a whole planet just for those two things let alone their
name height and other characteristics based on the scanning technology that's already present
in star wars it's like they technically should be able to locate someone on a planet to spy a scan
pretty quickly just by the technology that already exists do we know they could scan
individuals on that level from like space or a certain amount of distance well it's implied
it's not explicit but because we get life form we you do get life forms right buildings
so yeah that is a good question that is and it would it would help us our understanding if it
was explained explicitly that the scanning could work but would you would you concede that you
definitely could scan someone to that specific detail if not planetary but closer like so the
closer you get the stronger and more detailed scanning could say i'd say it's reasonable that
the closer you get the more accurate the scan would be but even if we're looking for details
on a planetary level that still is i i would be it's it's hard to say because we're really doing
a lot of guesswork here well yeah i i fully admit i'm like i'm i'm extrapolating on things
that are implied and this could all be contradicted by someone using a fob in season two that is like
they're on one planet it's like oh the fob is telling me is on another planet i'll be like well
there we go you screwed it right but at the moment there's nothing there's nothing contradicting
i guess this theory and the theory is based on a specific things that are implied and how that
fits quite well with how they're shown being employed at the moment which is why i'm not as
dark or annoyed with the fobs right now i would say the show very much also supports it almost
explicitly at some points from viewing it that it's uh it's just tied to the person um like that's
just seems to be how it works that's obviously the concern all of us have we don't want that to be
the case i know and it would have been so good that you like all you need is one small scene
when mando goes to the last known location of baby odor episode one he says all right well based
on uh the the age and and we're not told if you have species information but it'll be really is
like and the species i'm only getting and that all all you would need is that age and species and if
you could scan the whole planet bang you would know exactly where baby odor is and that needs
to be seen as simple as that but it would have been even if you didn't have species you say
well it's a very um how many fields are on this planet yeah exactly but because the planets seem
fairly sparse in terms of population oh man that's i even exact 50s like depending on how
so wait wouldn't you like hollow population that's still gonna screw you over big time if you don't
have a puck because but what if you brought baby yoda back and they're like nope it's a different
50 year old on that planet it's like yeah but it seems like that could have been a possibility
we'll see but if we run with the assumed theory or at least my assumed theory um they give him
the age they give him the last reported position of of baby yoda and then the fob which let's just
pretend for a second it does lead directly to the to the person that means he can uh always get to
the planet the last reported area use the fob to get more you know closer and closer and then
figure out where the 50 year old is uh if he can't naturally the fob will just lead him directly to
him because um Werner Herzog says that you'll be able to make short work of it and it's like how
would anyone be able to make short work of this if they have to search a planet for all 50 year olds
also yeah there's no way yeah like i agree about it the more that i think we don't know how many
exact 50 year olds because that is an exact age and for the amount of population that planet seem
to have had like i'd say the likelihood you might get 10 out of all the population on that planet
which already seemed to be pretty low and then if and it was it would have been kind of cool if he
did the scan and he got 10 hits and he goes okay now we need to work through um it's going to be
protected and it's going to be in some kind of secure what if one of those guys defending baby
yoda was a 50 year old mando can't kill him well he could kill him but he'd have to bring the body
back as well in case that guy's the bounty yeah that would have that would have made an interesting
kind of conflict wouldn't know that he had to work with the information he had no i don't think
i don't think i'm ready to accept the idea that you could even scan for people's ages
hey yeah that's yeah the more i think about it the more it just doesn't like that it's a good
question really give me something solid in the material to say you could scan for people's ages
yeah be really careful too because like 50 50 years and 300 days or 50 years and one day
yeah how many years are different depending on what planet you're from you know i agree
and the satisfying thing for me i would say you should technically only be able to determine
the actual cellular age of someone's physical body with a sample myself i like um and so i mean
i don't understand i guess my problem with the fobs is it just seems like i don't even understand
how the fob like activates how do you well hey somebody so there is one thing that simply isn't
stated and this is this is one that is not supported by anything in the show so it's an
absolutely i fully admit that and i don't like and when and when an audience when the audience
needs to go to such extent to try and explain things it's a sign of bad writing and so even if
this explains it it doesn't explain it doesn't excuse the fact that it wasn't explained in the
show and it's it's bad that i need to do this it's a sign of bad writing i fully admit this right
but we're not told of any additional biological information the fob had on the scan all we are
implied about the age but it could be that he had some of the dna there's some of the species
information that he could have scanned for i'm open to the idea that if you have dna samples
then it makes it easier to track somebody sure um i i think that we're all pretty much in agreement
though that the way that they explain fobs and illustrate their use is extremely loose
to where we don't really know what the rules are for them well i think the planetary proximity
is actually shown explicitly enough i don't think it's shown explicitly at all yeah well no that
when the the sniper goes to shoot baby yoda their response was oh he had a fob he tracked him the
response was they know he's here then they can track him meaning that is a direct implication
they need to know the location before they can find it that's that's the word that has the
the direct implication there so no am i to believe that the way that it works for a bounty hunter who
has no idea where that guy is that they're just going to go to every individual planet to like
just land there pull out a phone and be like oh i guess it's not here and then get up and then go
to the next planet and then get it one that that that could be a very valid way of doing it but if
you're a smart bounty hunter you would then say what are the most likely locations they'd be hiding
him and you'd work the issue and that would have i'm sorry that would have a a very good narrative
kind of detective elements to it still even with the presence of fog yeah i suppose i suppose
my problem is that i don't recall any point in the the the show where they show us that
fobs do not work in space we've only ever seen like you know what i mean like so i've never
this is the first time i've even thought about the idea that fobs only work on the planet because i
never saw anything i'd said i agree but yeah it's it's implied by is it what's her name the cara lady
the bounty hunter it's implied in that scene specifically i don't know that you're right about
that because you could you you could read it in a different way which is when he's like
who's he tracking the kid and then she so we that line alone is like oh of course they're tracking
the kid and then the conclusion is oh well now they're gonna know he's here because this guy
came for him and he's dead which means there's gonna be more on the way as in the reading can
easily be obviously there's more they know he's here now this guy the reason why i think that's
wrong is because if they could all track him just with the fob they would all know the location
the moment mando even landed there but it took weeks for this guy to find him and so it's not
through the fob that they were able to know the location because it took so long for anyone to
find him and so they found the location and that's why the reading is well see i know he's here i
just figured that was a mistake on their part that it took so long because alternatively you're
telling me that bounty hunters are just planet jumping and hoping for the best well no i don't
think that's a disingenuous explanation of what one of the core tasks the bounty hunter needs to do
they need to find the planet that these bounties are hiding on and it's not and it wouldn't be a
random thing if you're a smart bounty hunter you would say all right known associates last known
location best places to hide i can narrate no associates on that well yeah but then remember
how they talk about in episode one in episode one they mentioned um oh you know it that's not
even going to pay for my fuel so fuel is a concern i don't see that it's feasible like
economically feasible for bounty hunters to just go to plan to clarify what i'd assume
yeah and i'd assume that the industry works by going bounty hunter this is the puck as in this
is what they look like this is probably you can get some information like how old they are over
this is the planet we know they're on or this is the last planet they were known to be on you can
accept this job or you or you can not it's completely up to you and the bounty hunter can
take the risk or not but the idea that it's like we've got a high value target that's somewhere
in the galaxy yeah it's like go to the planets and check for us hang on hang on i like surely though
there would be cases where it's like that mandalorian picked the planet specifically
in the hopes that no one would find him and so there there has to be conditions in which you
can hide and not be found and that's the thing is when he said that the issue was that when he said
that i thought it was like wait hold on but the fobs like how can you hide from them exactly
that's that's the implication of the fobs but it is i think it is answered if you just give the
fobs a range limitation by you know planetary property that means and then that means he could
never ever move again because the more time passes the more planets get narrowed down
which means even if they never find him on that planet for some crazy reason he can never go to
another planet ever because the fobs will instantly activate well no no not necessarily
because a couple of things one it would be crazy if he was never found but he was found and i think
that's if the fobs work in this way this planet is is very secluded but it's already shown that
random people do happen to stop off there and fly off you know there's the kara people there's
other mercenary like people and so it's not out of the realms of possibility that even though it's
secluded that one random bounty hunter who happened to have the fob landed on there to get a bite to eat
or to refuel and suddenly the fob gives a ting and that was like several weeks after he landed
and then of course you could jump from planet to planet to make it you're more secluded because
there's heaps of secluded you know backwater planets all throughout star wars and in fact
moving from one to another would increase your chances of not being found because if one
bounty hunter went to a planet scanned you weren't there and went to another and then you
went to that planet after they'd scanned and already knocked it off there search things
means you know moving around and that's that's a common thing in trying to lay
things in space doesn't that highlight how we don't know how we don't know how they meet up in
space that's not so we kind of like it would be it's just as disingenuous for me to say
well he was refueling ran into someone as to say that they just crossed each other when flying
through space it's it's as likely as either one so therefore it's very it's very unlikely that
they would cross each other in exactly exactly uh exactly and so but what if the fobs were
astronomically low chance exactly so if the fobs work by proximity that it makes perfect sense that
then you might run into someone massive especially in space exactly and so the chances that you'll
get close enough to another ship is by an actual location that is a gathering point if it's a
refueling station this is purely based on the extent of the proximity yeah and if the proximity
is very very big then that just makes it even worse yeah exactly but but we're not we're not
told that this guy was tracking him through hyperspace everything like that they're just
fighting in space and it's actually far more likely when you consider the scale of space
that they came closer in proximity because of a joint place that they were flying by whether well
i guess the station or something like that i because they couldn't have happened it couldn't
have happened while he was in hyperspace so i guess he was just flying around at normal speed
and then the bouncy hunter found him and then they got hang on were they were they fighting
close to a planet um yeah they're close to Tatooine well there we go that's the gathering
point so there's a higher likelihood of coming he points his proximity oh actually that seems like
a problem why would why would mandalorian go to tatooine of all places if fobst activate as soon as
you land on that stupid well hang on hang on tatooine has always been established as a secluded
backwater planet it's no but it's a it's a it's a place for what a criminal is no not
calling you out but you just made an argument for how it makes sense people would find mandalorian
on the planet that was secluded as well yeah i'm also isley is one of the most commonly used
watering holes for the implication we got technically when you say common in canon
it's actually not not common it's a secluded one but because it appears in style so much because
of nostalgia factor people assume it to be common but technically it shouldn't be tattooing wait
but whose references are we using at that point are you using third party i'm in world to my
understanding tatooine is secluded backwater outer rim planet i i find it very very difficult
to believe that a place like tatooine wouldn't be checked by a bounty hunter have a bunch of bounty
hunters especially with the house well so hang on i would agree with you if tatooine was known
and regularly you know visited by bounty hunters but that's not a step but it is because uh he goes
there for bounty guild work he finds out that luckily for him the bounty guild no longer
operates there well then this is a valid criticism there because i would absolutely agree if if
bounty hunters are the ones who are most likely to have the fobs and then mandalorian specifically
seeks out bounty hunters for work and to be therefore putting in proximity of the fobs
that's a bloody stool i guess i completely agree and so like i'm trying to play devil's advocate
here but only when i feel it's justified when you point out something that is indefensible
i'll fully agree yeah that's an indefensible stupid point okay i i guess now i i have a i
guess a new problem is is the way that it works now that if he goes to a planet and then lands there
all the all the bouncy hunters who are on that planet their fob is going to instantly activate
and they're all going to converge on him is that is that how fobs work in in this that any bouncy
that lands on any planet will think i think chat chat wants us to acknowledge the huts yes i know i
know job is dead okay yeah good very good point i agree abba jabber had bounty hunters regularly
in his oh and i made a mistake by the way he didn't agree completely he doesn't necessarily
come there for guild work he comes there for work um it's just that okay it's unclear that he knew
or didn't know that the guild no longer functions there's there's more than one guild the bouncy
hunters are sure well they refer to it as the guild so i don't know well yeah my other point
to fringy is that uh i think even i might have said taking for granted that all the bounty hunters
would have the fobs but in reality there's only a couple of hundred sent out by that guild whatever
on that planet and if you consider the many thousands of bounty hunters across the galaxy
we could rightly assume wait hold on well that hang on you could rightly assume that mando could
expect that only a very small percentage of what the overall bounty hunters would have the fob
uh to track the yoda sorry it's um i i just have like a weird brain thing
move over something in episode one mandalorian that gives back the fobs for each of the people
that he got which implies that each individual fob is for each individual bounty that you're
going for yeah right is that that's how it works that seems to be that they're correct that
that's one one for one bounty okay so it right so does that mean then that
so all of the bouncy hunters when he went back in episode three all of them had fobs for that
bounty that they were just told even though we've been requested you know and that makes sense
because that is the that's the core point that the bounty is being sent out from and and and
it's even implied he says how many fobs did you give out he's like it didn't he's like everyone
he says why would they keep them why would they keep them yeah that's another problem
it doesn't matter now he's over yeah good point good or yeah yeah it's a good point it's a good
point and uh this is all still assuming by the way that it does lock on to them personally right
because we kind of like that's what is lied by what's showing because the the two sort of
defenses for the fobs right now is that they work at limited range and that they work based on
data to do with your person rather than you personally so it could be this and you're right
sorry i don't mean to cut your off mauler but it could be a fob can actually work um for multiple
more it can only track one at a time but you can reprogram it to do another one and it could have
stored into itself several different you know information to track multiple targets but you can
only tell it to target one at a time and so it could be that what the people had the baby yoda
fob all right the bounty is done i'll switch it over to my next target um and the fob is you could
you could have options on it again i thought this is i'm looking into pretty much but if i was to
make a fob i would want convenience and say all right track the most valuable target all the time
and put that up to the top right i guess and if you made that a automatic feature baby yoda was
the most valuable bounty before it turned off okay it defaults to the next most valuable one
and then now baby yoda bounty is back on bang fob switches over to tracking the only individual
one target can at a time but it could do it automatically there's a that's a logical enough
why would mando have like four different fobs yeah why would he have four and then give him in
because it only can track one at a time yeah but you can only hunt people one at a time
you mean we'll just like well hang on just go to go to a planet switch it between the four you're
right you're right you're right you're right um that that that would be a thing because you
could just do it with one track one switch it over track another switch it over okay these
and use one at a time um and so having multiple the the idea that they have to be like programmed
specifically by certain people um i'm pretty sure that carl withers even says that he does something
uh mauler maybe can help me we did we did just watch it um doesn't carl withers doesn't he say
that he has to program them or give he's the one who passes them out or which episodes remember
i i forget uh either way it's just a small thing honestly i think i i agree with you rags it
actually makes more sense that only the bounty leaderships can put a bounty on a fob because
otherwise anyone could just pick up a fob put a bounty and say hey bounty hunter can you go kill
someone i'm not really paying you so chat chat is screwing up a lot here so one of them said yeah
one of them said pucks and fobs are the same thing they're not the same thing no pucks are
the little discs that give you their face and the fobs are like the trackers uh yeah we assume so
yeah pucks are they look like pucks and they have their face on them we know not unreasonable to
assume they have other information on them but it's like a more it's an identifier it's not a
tracker it's more like you're um it's like a wanted poster yeah right it's like a wanted
on the target and someone else said that the you don't even know if the pucks or fobs track
the target it's like a homing beacon yeah that's what a fob is it beats louder when you get closer
and that's how did the bouncy hunters who were coming for him like yeah no it tracks them it
does it's hard and he gives the the the fobs back as if i am done with these you take them
so that they can be reprogrammed for different people reprogram for someone else again um also
i just want to say this is all all of this is underneath the looming specter of the fact that
never once in any of the eight episodes is it even mentioned how to get rid of uh a fob tracking you
uh is someone else the person yeah see i don't think you can i think the only way is to get out
of the proximity and i think that's explained by mandalorian's actions in going to a secluded planet
just flying but they never wear off that's the thing fobs don't ever turn off so yes so many
things to address in chat this is good yeah somebody said that there was no baby yoda fob
it's like what about an episode where all of the bouncy huts is converted to baby there was only
a baby yoda fob there was no baby yoda puck that was that was the point he says no puck also uh
carol said uh fobs track the implanted id chips every citizen has what are you talking about when
was that established yeah people are not going to never heard that and and why would baby yoda have
what he said this whole discussion is redundant you can't just make shit up from other stuff
yeah and people will take them out the first thing that you're going to do is you're going
to get out you know that that's how you get tracked you just imagine the black market value
for that you could totally pay surgeons to do that yeah and you can put them on other people and how
and send them off and it's that's a whole other mess that we definitely don't want to get into
but yeah people aren't going to do that i think season two will be able to either confirm or
deny what the hell's going on with these fobs the funny thing is i just looked at the wikipedia page
for it it is dry as a bone it's tracking tracking fobs were devices used by bounty hunters to track
their quarries the bounty hunter would return the fobs after capturing their bounty as proof of
capture in 9 aby the bounty hunters guild handed out tracking fobs to its hunters a bounty hunter
simply known as the mandalorian returned his fobs after capturing all of his quarries it's like
thanks for that i think it couldn't be salvaged if they made like some of these limitations that
are at least shown and you could connect the dots but there's a big flaw that you know it's
not explained and and there are still problems with it don't get me wrong like the all the
fobs turning on randomly and the fact that they all suddenly have it and stuff so there are still
issues there it's just at the moment for me it can be explained and so that that helps me at least
okay i can watch it and not have the fobs stand out as is glaring problems breaking the whole show
i can i can keep watching and enjoying it i also have the empire the empire is looking for baby yoda
the fact that the empire is not using fobs and tracking him down wherever he goes
is something that they are going to have to address if they want to have good writing
yeah i would agree i mean yeah you could address it you could explain but considering everything
we know it blows my mind that um they didn't send a faction of stormtroopers to just go and get baby
yoda with the information they had okay so my thoughts on that my thoughts on that is that
they accept at the very end when there's a very large imperial presence the um uh the stormtroopers
are hiding out in a bunker and they're trying to lay low and it seems like they know it seems like
the empire factions are trying to avoid republican you know the new republic weeding them so how do
you explain that finale yeah yeah it was about to say it's a problem don't get me wrong i say i like
because like there's obviously what are they doing in the finale it's like they're specifically
trying to capture yoda it's like wow you guys probably should have done this in the fucking
pilot this would have been a good idea i think the only defensible thing you could say is that
they couldn't be bothered he didn't want to use their resources but they got the money so yeah
we'll throw out the bounty they have enough resources to start killing their own men willy
no oh my god so which is a part that i hated the one the other thing stormtroopers are notoriously
incompetent i want i want to highlight by the way as as james moore's just pointed out if everyone
had id chips wouldn't vader have found the rebels way easier especially knowing his son he has like
i don't know about this id chip thing implant thing just drop it
someone else said you can't you can't take the chip out because then you can't interact in
normal society it's like what's this though that don't that is no that's there's no like
system where you go to a bar and they scan your id chip before you can buy anything you get that
money and they give you a drink job was it said people have chips as well so i don't know this
is the thing fobs are causing loads of fundamental issues that's why i love that this is the first
thing we've talked about is lost it's like it out but well i want to play i like i know
going further is not justified in the in the plot but i'm down the rabbit hole and i like
playing devil's advocate okay so yeah what is this is yeah this is this is very much a there
there are potentially there might be explanations for things but that's basically this also that's
very wishful thinking considering we've felt this way a lot over the past with a lot of different
franchises like they'll explain it they don't well that's exactly this could be so contradicted and
everything i say is just shoved you know back in my foot and mouth kind of crap shove back in my
face in episode in season two if they contradict this stuff and so but at the moment all i'm saying
is that there are ways to explain it i shouldn't have to and it's bad writing that i i need to even
in the first place but all right one of the reasons why i like to try and see okay is there
a way to make this way it's like a uh a writing exercise yes i agree if i was going to make if
i was writing this how would i justify it to make it yeah if you were writing season two how would
you make it all make sense post exactly exactly and so one of the ways that you could explain is
that uh a fob is potentially very dangerous technology that falls into the wrong hands
if anyone gets it and could code anyone's basic information and track who they want to kill whoever
they want and and the guild seem to be they're accepted in society as i'm not even sure if they
consider necessary evil they seem to be these bounty hunters are good they help us deal with
criminals and you know people skipping bail and all these things and so it could be that fobs have
a very uh like matt they could be behind a massive code that the bounty only the bounty hunter guilds
have the codes to be able to encode a fob to track someone and not even the empire has or something
like that or you know so it can't be abused in the wrong hands essentially it's one way you could try
and spin it i want to defend you as well chance someone said you're right in the script for them
shad's not saying this happened this is the truth he's saying it's an option and he's also
acknowledged that they haven't explained it which is uh not a good thing which is bad writing this is
it's terrible you need to go to these it's totally cool to explore options in terms of how it could
make sense i'm okay with that uh but i do i i will i will again reiterate it is an extreme
weakness of the writing as well that it is is not even suggested of how to get rid of them
and if there's not a way to get rid of the tracking which i find very hard to believe
then they should say you can't get rid of the fob it's you know we have to go through the people
who did there something i don't know i i think that one is actually more explicitly implied by
mandalorian trying to get out of the range by going to a secluded planet i think that like
if you if it was impossible to um escape the fobs and again this could like the options are his eye
that are bloody idiot because the only way to if you can't break the fob tracking the only thing
you can do is to is get the bounty withdrawn which means you have to go to the source and
fight them and so it's retarded beyond belief that is just trying to run away when you can't
run away from these things that's the only that's one option and the other other option is that
you can get out of their range and that seems to be the more logically consistent and i think
that one is actually implied quite strongly in the show um i think it's quite a strong indictment
on the people who were around baby yoda protecting it that they just stated a position that apparently
the empire knew about like you should probably have kept moving i guess i don't know we don't
know what they were doing they didn't did they know that the empire wanted them because tinkley
this wasn't even just the empire it was a what one guy within the tinkley one guy who also more
people had come there before oh yeah when i say the empire i'm mainly talking about moth kitty and
the first episodes said other people had come and they all ended up dead i tried to help them
okay all right and yeah like i said i'm not necessarily referring to the empire when i say
the empire it's just the bad guys in mandalorian who are organizing the whole thing
they kind of look like the empire someone said pops and pucks trash writing no pucks make total
sense pucks are a wanted poster i'm cool with them yeah they're digital wanted posters they're
dossiers on who you're trying to find what they look like last known location maybe next of kin
age stuff like that that makes a lot of sense and the problems are only done depending on how they
work well well could you say at least that it's implied quite strongly in the show that they work
by range and proximity i'm not sure that it is strongly i'm not sure proximity yes it might be
but what again like i said how big the proximity is is it's totally unknown yeah yeah i agree it's
unknown it could be galaxy spanning it could be certain systems it could be a solar system we
don't even know so that the extremity of the proximity is not only a phrase you don't hear
often but it is really important as a detail for yeah because it would it would not only influence
how easily they would have found it but it would have influenced the decisions that mando would have
made because i.e if it was for a whole system it's like oh this causes problems if it's for a planet
then maybe it could work but if it's for a system then yeah you're you're screwed there's no way
that you can escape a fob and just to address the people in chat saying that i'm talking too
much it's because i'm doing the defense okay and so and by the way we're all we're all pretty good
friends at this point people like stop interrupting each other it's like we're fine we're okay yeah
don't worry about us we're okay um just stop uh let's uh put that in the uh the old cupboard
close the door and lock it up well i was gonna say fobs will come up as we proceed yes um so we
we will what we'll have to do is critique the the criticism based on the two different assumptions
about how the fobs work i suppose but um i i actually think it's not a bad idea that we started
with fobs because there are a few aspects that kind of go through all of the episodes um that
aren't nest that are they occur in specific places but across eight episodes yeah so maybe
mandalorian's armor should we talk about that yes um before i because i think that
sorry to interrupt but i think the the main kind of uh run of our discussion here is going to be
trying to pick apart all the things that we found wrong with it and uh and i'm probably going to be
playing devil's advocate because i'm the only one who's there are things that i'll criticize too
don't get me wrong but i think before we do that then should we at least point out the things that
we felt were good or enjoy we kind of we kind of did that already yeah well i have a list that i
didn't get oh yeah sure go for it um well we we talked about the production quality that i thought
was really really good um now in terms of the mandalorian's character i think there are a couple
of ways you could look at it because uh there you make some dumb decisions yeah okay um i like this
character and i think i like this character because the it was kind of talking about mando
mando yeah oh my god um i liked the concept and the and that concept was was consistently
represented of uh the lone bounty hunter mercenary uh doing his own thing i i personally liked his
reserved personality and the emotion that they were able to convey in dialogue body language and
stuff even with their helmet on that were like we don't see that often and it was refreshing
for me to see and i appreciate it enjoyed it um master chief best kind of yeah emoting yeah yeah
and i i was indeed towards him because he had a good heart ultimately you know he he decided to
save baby yoda and things like that and he showed loyalty to friends and other stuff i this part i
we get we i don't know like if i'm going to be just gush gush away we will get to the yeah you
can you can object my my um uh my positive points those will probably pop up as we go through each
episode all righty then so those will be addressed over the discussion of the episodes with yeah
bullet points and stuff we have um when i left we had brought up the armor had we discussed
well because you disappeared um uh shad wanted to sort of um dive a little bit more into one of the
things that he liked well several i have a bit of a list that i think that these are for me fairly
strong positive elements that um go in the show's favor and apply more broadly like because also
something that i just really enjoyed one he was he was he was a good fighter he was talented but he
was not like unbeatable actually really like they showed him struggling on many on many different
levels and failing at many points and i think there was a decent enough balance of of them
showing him competent but also being out beaten by other people who were also competent he wasn't
unstoppable and and that made for a more engaging kind of protagonist than and for me like it wasn't
always the fact that he was always going to win because you know that has failed many times already
his life had needed to be saved and and that may again just added to the strength of his uh
character at all to make me i like him i like the mandalorian um uh overall as a character for
for those for those things um sorry i'm just gonna cut you off because somebody made a stupid
chat and it directly acknowledges me and i think it's a bad point um friggy if fobs have system
size range they're screwed and then he said there are 70 million worlds please grow a sense of scale
all right um so 70 million planets in a galaxy is a very very small number there are hundreds
of billions of planets in our galaxy so that if that's what star wars has said is how many
planets there are in a galaxy then star wars has a very narrow scale for how big galaxies are
it has to be one way or the other i i think the point was it's a very large scale in terms of
the number of planets you would need yeah yeah for sure but but the issue that is with star wars is
that they've always kind of played a bit faster and loose with uh the nature of space anyway
you know what i mean like there's always been some it's surprising how many planets show up
consistently without huge exactly exactly is the best example this back yeah tattooing shows up all
the time everyone's going back there but what i find interesting is that when they do go to a
different planet it seems like the fan base still criticizes it like jackoo it's like oh this is
definitely not tattooing guys oh i mean it was technically there should be a lot of other desert
planets and using the same one here people criticize it would use a different one people
just like well which one guys come on it's for people saying it's just tattooing but a different
desert planet it's like um well somebody somebody's now said 70 million habitable worlds or something
but that's still like how does tattooing show up over time then like 70 million inhabited planets
really i wonder how many i wonder how many planets are in the outer rim or habitable
well i guess that's the thing right when we're talking about systems as well and this is part
of the problem as well as um and this was something that came up in in maulers captain marvel video
where like i think we made the point that uh the solar system like if you define the boundaries of
the solar system you can either say until pluto or you could say to the full extent of the oort
cloud which is about three light years depending on which way it goes yeah like depending on which
one you interpret the whole idea of fobs will detect you depending on which star system you're
in it couldn't just mean that if you're going at hyperspace and you're traveling the foot sorry we
shouldn't get caught up on the logs again we'll just get back to keep going with uh with what you
liked about mando specifically well yeah those are all the reasons why i like mandalori and the thing
for me if i can enjoy the main character i i can generally enjoy a tv show overall um and that's
also what got me through the witcher it was the main character um and so i thought i encountered
that as a strength to this uh tv show in terms of like making a good character for the things you
were trying to achieve in the series i think mandalori himself was done mostly well even if you're
trying to judge it on objective you know scales of what makes a good character and then my
standards would be what type of character do you want for the uh purposes of the series does does
he fulfill those needs and i thought he did it quite well um and not to say there isn't dumb
things he does he absolutely does right um but yeah and also the fact that it was a it was refreshing
to see once again one of the callbacks to one of the classic staples of the lone hero kind of thing
and and i like that archetype that's right that got enjoyment out of me as well um the nature of
the storytelling okay it's not to say there wasn't a lot of issues in terms of the logical
justification of certain actions like there are some big problems especially like i know we'll
get there but you know the the um the guy when they're bunkered up and the guy's like you have
so many hours to give in that oh yeah so there's a lot of dumb things there but in terms of the
nature of the storytelling overall it was simple and straightforward and the propositions of the
problems of the episodes were very easily understandable uh you need to do this or
this is in your way or that's it and bang and then everything revolved around that and i enjoyed the
simplicity and clear nature of that style of storytelling especially coming out of the witcher
where every episode was so bloody convoluted you couldn't understand what was going on most of the
time um and so and i think the simple nature of these overarching plots went in the series
strength that was a strength for the series especially for what it was the type of story
that was was again the lone gunslinger kind of hero so really good strength again um improved
my uh my you know um opinion of it i loved baby yoda i feel i thought baby yoda was absolutely
brilliant i hated baby yoda healing don't get me wrong okay but it i i very cute very enjoyable
just on the screen and even just the small things like i was watching it with my kids the other day
and the scene where mando gets um is fighting the girl for the first time and then they roll around
and they get shoot the guns at each other and then they just look and it cuts to baby yoda just
sitting there slurping my kids busted out laughing like you wouldn't believe and it was a good example
of subtle comedy yeah that scene we'll get to that scene um we'll get there i was just gonna say
quickly as well um this is criticism in chat that i find hilarious rags and mauler seemed to be
obsessed with applying real world milky way constraints to star wars right that's the first
half which by the way me and rags really it was more fringy talking about that than me and rags
and secondly the milky way is larger than the star wars universe if we go by galaxies so that
doesn't even make sense like well the thing is is um i what i'm seeing here and it's a bit of a
problem of trying to reach into the extended universe because i don't recall ever in any of
the movies where they said that there are 70 million inhabited planets in the galaxy and where
they said how big the galaxy was so you really do not want to dive into scale when it comes to this
because it's really just going to become a big problem and and secondly they said all of their
problems could be applied to lord of the rigs what do you mean no they can't what what i understand
that i'm just like um anyway about the ring light so yeah i was gonna say how much i uh
in terms of mandalorian as a character i hate him i never want to see another character like him
i despise him i think he's borderline autistic with the decisions that he makes
i i cannot believe that a character who makes these consistently stupid decisions is alive
after doing this job that long uh the amount of times that he shot the amount of times that
he just has plot armor the amount of times that he does things that are just insanely brain dead
his inability to use his equipment well just i cannot believe that he has been doing this job
for this long and hasn't been killed a thousand times over okay also sorry guy it is extremely
um well well i will stop there because i'll get to the next part later on as we progress to the
episode that'll be easier to illustrate it then but i do not like mando at all as a character
i am absolutely i don't i don't ever want to see another mandalorian character hang on i find that
because sorry you go for me oh i was just gonna say i think i might sit in a nice little middle
ground here which is why i figured i'd say i think my my view is that um you got a lot of things
with mando that if you had spent more time developing it as in you you extend the character
development you could have had something really really good um and i think the things you can
latch onto are so we have a character who you know is a gruff hardened mercenary but then we
he gets to the point where he you know baby yoda makes him sort of maybe change his philosophy
and even the idea even in episode four where you have um the the whole idea of him potentially
settling down these are all really good ideas but they're good ideas for later if you know what i
mean i feel like you need a lot more time with gruff hardened mando and then the progression for
him with baby yoda sort of softening his exterior and then you can start reaching into him developing
more relationships i think that if they had taken it a bit slower it could have been really good
but i think that it rushed it to the point that they wasted a lot of the potential that they had
for a uh for that sort of bouncy hunter character i don't dislike men's lorean though i like him
enough i just think he's an idiot yeah i think it's pretty tough to say he isn't an idiot based
on all the things well we're gonna go to them one by one because i think some of his decisions are
far more defensible than perhaps your feeling um so you sound a bit muffled again i don't know if
anything's changed oh really i don't know so i could bring it closer well what did you do last
time that made it change was it complicated or no well i'm plugged and plugged back in but i did
change what the sensitivity just recently and if that's made it worse i'll put it back can you
just for curiosity's sake do and unplug and plug it back in and see if it makes a difference because
you just i don't know what it is but you sound cleaner um or you sounded cleaner before it's like
a week i'm okay to deal with it it's fine it's just i was just curious if you could i can i can
so uh continue talking i'll be back in a sec very well and also there is a um just to be clear
as fringy said i have no idea with the i i have no problem with the idea that mando befriends a
bounty that he has some connection with based on his past i have no problem with that as a
concept i have no problem with the concept of him finding a buddy or a partner i have no problem
with any of this stuff in concept all the stuff is absolutely fine but when we look at all the
stuff that he does as a character especially his plans tactically in combat how he executes
missions and a lot of the other decisions that he makes we it is it leaves us baffled when we
watch him and we try to find out how he rationalizes the things that he does i guess it's all the
problem of um he's meant to be a really accomplished talented bounty hunter best in the parsec yeah he
he doesn't make the decisions that you would expect him to make he does you know what i
mean like it doesn't seem yeah if you are if you are the most well-known most famous bounty hunter
in the parsec you are a mandalorian you've trained for this your whole life you've trained
to be a bounty hunter for all this long you have strict codes of honor this is what you do you are
an elite bounty hunter it shocks me all the decisions that he makes in a lot of these episodes
i feel like we're we're we're doing lots of generalization we need to get stuck into some
references yeah because i think the specifics are going to be the one that'll either uh i guess
lean me more to uh feel your views are justified or if i feel they can be more defensible because
the thing for me like if a you know a decent amount to a portion of those decisions can be
explained and they're not as blatantly stupid um that could solve some of the issues but also
it does seem a lot of your issues are with his actions um which technically that is part of
characterization but in terms of the character itself it's going to go down to like personality
and how the the character has in regards to their motivations their goals and stuff like that um
and so overall i think the portrayal of his character in the sense of the subtle body language
the ways i i still like his character as how the character was made um and as to if is dumb or not
well that'll be a good discussion well i guess um i i actually like to because you're probably
best suited to answer this question one of the things that we observed was when he gets into
fights he really relies on his armor to save him there are many parts where he gets shot in the
face and shot in the torso where it's like wow it's pretty lucky that you have this best guard
you know like this steel armor because you'd be dead is this is this like does it make sense for
somebody to fall back so heavily on their armor in fights no if i was to say just oh but so there's
there's a lot of caveats to this right because i did a whole video on mandalorian's armor and i i
criticize it saying it's not covering enough okay and it's awfully convenient that every shot that
seems to hit him is always landing on where the armor points are so i have a little criticize this
as well all right but uh the the response and a lot it was interesting to hear um a lot of people's
responses about in terms of body armor he's technically wearing more armor than the standard
soldier does in modern warfare but the standard soldier doesn't fight the way the mandalorian
does they take cover they and it's like it's the last soldiers don't rely on their armor yeah that's
the last you know the exact last point of defense just in case they're absolutely right um and and
so yeah i i would say that he's not he is relying on his armor way too much if the armor covered
most of his body and didn't have openings then he would be justified in leaving himself open as
much as he does and just tanking it um and then i would say yeah i would agree so well i guess the
thing is is when you look at the fights there are so many instances where it's like wow if that shot
was a couple just a little bit lower or a little bit higher you'd just be dead yeah just to just
to clarify right accomplished he tanks well tanking it is fine with me because the best
is the fact that he gets hit and he doesn't get hurt by 13 different blaster shots throughout
the uh the season eight knives yeah we we did a little tally this is obviously subject to like
we might be off by one or two but i counted 13 blaster shots that he blocked with his armor
eight knives um the pterodactyl and an explosion uh his armor saves him from dying from both of
those that's a lot of uh impact and it's like what did he do before i agree i agree completely
but i guess for me this is why and it's not really doesn't redeem it by any measure but it lessens it
for me as well and it's the fact that he is actually getting hit in some instances because
if he didn't have the armor the only other option is for the hits to never land at all which is
technically what we see in we see a lot of that was the original trilogy they're not wearing armor
sorry everyone just misses unless yeah that's a criticism too convenient in the plot for someone
to get injured and then certainly a shoulder hit in layer in return for jedi and and for me i feel
that is more indefensible uh than the mandalorian actually getting hit so the fact that he is getting
hit i feel is actually a little bit better than what we've seen in other stuff i guess the problem
is that when you look at a lot of the fights that he gets into it's like he puts himself in
these very dangerous situations almost expecting that his armor is going to save him i remember
and uh i remember it was most pronounced in episode six when he was fighting in the prison
there was this instance where he was fighting some of the robots it's like dude you are
like this is really dangerous like i'm not sure why i mean there's there's a lot of john wick two
three moments where there is just there there's just no way he shouldn't be shot there there's
all of these a lot of these fights that happen where you just are wondering why hasn't he been
shot a hundred times now on a clarify people are saying like it's good that he gets hit in the
armor than not at all he gets hit not at all a lot too loads of shots missing that happens as well
but but the thing is if he wasn't wearing the armor the only other option is to have him never
get hit which is exactly what they did in the original trilogy the whole meme of stormtroopers
not having to aim is because of plot art because they can have they can have an act in the show
as if he knows he's vulnerable i agree completely i'm not saying this is purple all i'm saying is
the fact that he is getting hit for me is at least better than what we have seen previously
because in the original trilogy they're like there are so many points where the heroes are
standing right in front of people and they're never getting hit the thing is you say this is
in like empire and return of the jedi so the defense that they were purposely missing on the
death star uh doesn't apply because it is it's consistent throughout all of star wars well his
the only times the laser bolts are on party now we're lightsaber to defend themselves or it's a
convenient spot to get hit yeah so this is just it's bad and other things too yeah i know i agree
this isn't a good argument because it's bad here it's really bad here yeah but for me it makes it
at least a little bit better than it was before and and i can still enjoy the pre the the original
series with the horrible plot armor that's everywhere and to me the plot arm is actually
technically a little bit lessened because of the armor he's wearing even though it's executed
poorly which i mean i guess the thing is you said before something like if if they didn't
have him getting hit then it would be that he doesn't get hit but i guess my thing is i
immediately think of okay well maybe maybe we can do something with this where it's like
how about we have an episode where he's still got his armor and you know he occasionally gets
hit we dial it back a lot but then we have in one episode maybe it's later in the first season or
sometime in the second season when we're in the trust arc or something we have him get shot like
in the leg it's a really bad one like it's not a shoulder one where he brushes it off it's like he
gets shot in the leg and he's in big i want to um i want to stand up for the ot by the way uh
the only time the stormtroopers do really great in the opening of a new hope and when they don't
shoot luke and layer and han and chewy you do remember that they're supposed to be letting them
think that they're escaping right yeah that's in the um original in the original one right so so
the storms what i'm trying to say oh wait wait wait i'll finish so so a new hope stormtroopers
are actually pretty good from everything we understand about them uh empire strikes back
they're good in hawth they're terrible in bespin um and then return of the jedi everyone knows
it's ridiculous what happens in return of the jedi um so what i'm trying to say is they're like
they nailed it in a new hope they were 50 50 an empire and then they fucking farted in return of
the jedi and now they're taking that to the nth degree in the sequel trilogy and mandalorian
mandalorian is arguably worse because they establish its canon that stormtroopers are stupid
or can't aim i love that that's me i didn't really love that i i love it i yeah i thought that was
i hate it but we'll get to it when we get to it because i mean yeah we will yeah and also to
address on this is in the chat someone said i blindly call him dumb i am not blindly calling
him dumb i've watched the show twice yeah this is the thing a lot of people aren't going to take
it seriously because we haven't gotten him stupid we don't go the references we get in there this
is going to take a while chat because it's going to take a while it's a big one because we're still
going on the things i like so uh i just wanted to get back to that my leg shot exit go go for it
yeah the the idea that you have an episode where he gets shot in the leg and it's a serious injury
it's not a tv show oh he'll walk it off like he's in big trouble and then we spend maybe the next
episode he's with um he's with uh what was the name of i keep forgetting her name the the lady
bouncy hunter that he's working with we can add her there yeah yeah corradoon that's right so you
have an episode where i don't know she's like gotta help nurse him back to health and like help
him get out of this location that's swarming with stormtroopers or something and the two have to
work together like you can find ways to make it to where he has his armor and it sometimes protects
him but you can still have him actually be vulnerable and get shot i don't really like
the idea that it's like either he gets hit with his plot armor or he doesn't get hit at all
you know i i agree completely i agree completely yeah i figured it's still
convening contrived but i have to also acknowledge that it seems to be just as convenient contrived
in the plot armor of the previous ones um and so and i don't think it ruins a movie for me because
i enjoyed the previous one but that's one of that's one of the problems is i agree it's still a
problem don't get me wrong yeah it's absolutely so angry it's a problem all right so okay um also
we'll we'll get into the details later i do find that after what we see here is bullet proof
or sorry not bullet proof blaster proof all right um it is shocking that not everybody is wearing
arms yeah i agree completely like the inconsistency of the blasters and what they can penetrate not
bugs the hell out of me it bugs the hell out of me with star wars overall it's very inconsistent
this is a problem that i've kind of always had it has bugged me more and more as time goes on
mandalorian has made it worse but when we start to see um bounty hunters who do this for a living
uh private security things of that nature nobody has armor which is very strange considering that
apparently a lot of stuff is blaster proof we see droids that are blaster proof we have the best car
stuff and i'm not saying all armor has to be best car but it is clearly a well-established thing that
there there is blaster proof stuff not yet not even that apparently nobody uses it to to go on to
your point even further there are random transportation platforms that hover that have
blaster proof sightings on them yes like that's how common blaster proof material is that you can
make crappy you know hover platforms out of it and so the fact that no one is making armor or
shields out of this material is bafflingly stupid and that applies to star wars as a whole and i've
had that problem with it but like it's been a problem for a long time and by the way and
someone brought up in chat it might be too much for grunt soldiers or even poor bounty hunters
apparently the fledgling new republic has the money to put it on their security droids that
guard prisoners on ships i can put it on crappy hover platforms yeah this is like like a lot of
stuff is bulletproof like if you pulled the panels off of worthless carriages and slapped it on
yourself with duct tape you would save your life yeah like it's insane how prevalent this
stuff it's very prevalent now i have body armor like especially and if you do this for a living
if you're a bounty hunter if you if this is your life if you're in dangerous places then you are
shelling out the cash to cover your chest in your head yeah i agree completely massive pet peeve
for me and it's not expensive this crap is everywhere used on so many things and yeah
what's the point of blasters then what's the point of guns in the real world then
like mandalorian episode three when he's surrounded by everyone he literally jumps
onto a hover platform that has a metal siding that blocks everything okay um even his
disintegration rifle which is insanely powerful on the scales of destructibility of the weapons
we see in star wars and i kind of like that because it was so powerful it required a cartridge
for each shot i like that kind of design element to it um the the the atst walker blocked one of
those shots on its flat armor like it was nothing and so the armor is exactly just nothing um and
and they even say that there is nothing on the planet that can take out the legs of that acst
and i'm assuming that is including his ship which is like holy crap you'll get to that massive gun
we'll get to that so i like yeah when i when there's something like absolutely indefensible
guys i'm all on board with you this is absolutely well so how should we format this like should we
just go episode one try and find the good and the bad i think if i still have anything so long well
surely surely you can fit them in as we go i'll try i'll try because we have eight episodes to
go through i don't like the idea that we're taking so long we haven't even started talking
about specific references and episodes yet we're not we're going very slowly and slowly is fine
with me but also i realize you don't have all day right shad you don't have yeah yeah true i'm i'm
going through my list i'm just looking for any if there's any compliments that i could i need to
state broadly that won't come up individually um and i think i can bring up things um individually
as they come up i'll just have to interrupt and say more specifically um yeah all right
so i think we're good to go um before we do that might can i go to the toilet i'll be back go for it
damn it i'll use a cup uh i'll be back in a sec guys i got you uh and this is just a little bit
of a uh retread i guess but my first point that i have for episode one on my little sheet here
my little park notes my little bullet points is in the very first scene we see mando getting shot
luckily in the armor not three inches to the right where it would have hit him in the like neck
uh lucky i guess uh but yeah he uh that got me started on the whole thing of he doesn't even
react when the guy pulls out his blaster and points it at him he just like knows it's gonna
hit him in the armor he doesn't even he's very confident yeah very confident that his terrible
armor will save his life all the time and it does it does yeah well yeah that one of two things
will happen they will miss him or they will hit him in the armor but they are the only two things
that can happen um but yeah in my note here it says how did mando survive this long before he
got his armor um kind of insane uh how how mando is still alive and doing this stuff
uh it just seems that as many times as he he gets shot especially with when you when you tally up
the amount of time that takes place in the show where he's actually in combat in the amount of
times he gets shot it is insane that he hasn't been killed yet many many many times over um
there's i i expect him to be very what or professional like professional bounty hunter
in the way that he moves around and engages in combat david and chas said people do with the
lottery though people do when they're like yes lucky things could happen yes yes um and it is
very very lucky all the time how he has uh like imagine you're playing a video game right and
like i know um some games have heat maps for where you shoot people uh i mean you get shot
at enough times you're just gonna not hit someone's armor it's just insane especially if you get hit
13 times that quickly expand this over the course of his lifetime of work from when he started to
you know the show taking place in quote unquote modern times i don't i don't believe that he
should be alive so the experience bouncy hunter can't be confident what's okay okay so like imagine
in the real world that you have kevlar armor and you just decide to walk out in the middle of an
open battlefield just shooting at people and they're like yeah what pretty good at this so you know
i should just kill everybody this is not yet like he is again he is not he does not have armor
covering his neck and his upper torso and his sides and legs thighs and legs part of his
yeah he's not dressed up like a renaissance knight here all right he is not very heavily armored
like his head his chest his shoulders shoulders those are those are favorite places to shoot
mandalorian um but yeah uh uh definitely a problem that i have it really ruins my ability to
believe he's alive up to this point i don't want to just progress too far without shadowversity
here though like again armor in the real world especially with soldiers and there are parallels
that can be done here um you don't just walk out like if you have body armor like let's say that
your chest and your head is covered with armor right you still have the gaps in between you
still have your neck you still have your arms getting shot in the thigh is a big deal because
of the blood vessels stuff like that you don't just walk out into the middle of oh i don't know
say a courtyard full of dozens and dozens and dozens of enemies who are all aware you're there
and want to kill you you don't do that because you can't rely on your armor like let's say
that the armor will stop 90 of shots that are made and hit you that's a one in ten chance
that you get hit whenever somebody shoots at you and when your life is at the line
not taking those odds man i'm just like so every action hero should be dead that's the
entertainment we want to watch first off that's not a very good argument and secondly like you
can look at examples in movies and tv shows where the main character has to actually like make good
decisions and that's the reason why they like john wick one there's a lot of instances where he
does really good maneuvers that take him like you know a situation where he is in danger but he
makes a really good decision yeah go ahead you're you're absolutely right john wick one had really
good choreography to help him avoid go to fire john wick two was trash in front of people shooting
never getting hit and so he's got his camp last suit yeah there's magical plob
sorry i don't know if chap knows i guess just quickly before shad finishes i love john wick
one i assume everyone here loves john wick one he has i i have serious problems with two and three
and this is one of the main reasons why okay um and so i think if we're gonna be criticizing
mandalorian for you know um all the shots convenient landing of his armor we need to be
consistent because plot armor is everywhere in hollywood movies john wick two is like one of
the best examples and i honestly feel getting hit on armor and having it just be convenient
the armor is protecting him is a lot better than not getting hit at all and having plot
it's better but it's still bad and both still happen yeah good if we can acknowledge that but
but for me it's an improvement than what we've seen before so i was like all right let's let's
improve it let's keep the improvement like ultimately you want john wick one let me know
it's an improvement for me like star wars i don't even know if it's it's an improvement for me that
they constantly get hit to like a crazy amount in the short amount of time they're actually in
combat and it all hits their armor but not the unprotected parts i don't i don't know if it's
better or worse for me i'll have to think about it over time i just i don't know that i can see
he has both happened to him do you know the amount of bullets that were bullets
laser shots that are fired at him that don't get to him like it's significant and we're not even
counting all the times where he should get shot in just episodes one to three he no sorry it
happens in episode one two and three but two they're stun shots so i'm gonna discount that
uh one and three he gets surrounded by like 20 plus enemies that are all firing at him and he
manages to take no shots yeah like obviously if they'd hit his armor then it'd be like oh well
yeah obviously he should have and this is like i say i do agree with rags he should have been
using the armor as a last resort and taking cover and it's uh and it's there just in case that he
was put he act like and you should only put yourself in a vulnerable position making it shot
accidentally you should always be taking cover even with armor or the whole opposite his armor
should be covering every into his body without any opening and then you could just tank everything
because yeah it has to be specific like it they need to make a big deal of it like this is really
special armor it you this is an up-armored variant of something else or we built this just
for this one mission make a deal about it to say yeah it makes sense that he could go out there and
reasonably expect to just tank hits also i'm not i'm not saying he never gets hurt i'm not saying
he never gets hurt yeah uh so is that rags as complain is that he doesn't try not to get shot
yeah you should not you should try to not get shot yeah he behaves as if he can't be shot that's
the kind of the problem no no no there are cases in the series where he does try yeah there are
like in the first episode yeah in episode one like in the battle where he's fighting at the end yeah
yeah that's the thing that's why i like that that battle more so yeah i prefer that too yeah yeah
i prefer that too yeah like armor and it makes for a better life on the line yeah i agree yeah
i like that um and so um um oh just the other thing about how did he survive when he didn't
have armor i remember you making that comment i mean was there a point when he ever he didn't
have armor because even the foundlings have at least the armor helmet and it's pretty easy to
get juris still oh well it's because so the first uh two episodes he has the he has some
best guard but the other stuff is like normal look i knew i knew this would be a sensitive topic
but holy shit chat there's loads of like uh people assuming now that our point is he never takes
cover it's like no no we no one said this i don't know how you guys are extrapolating calm the fuck
down like they're doing it in caps lock as well it's like chill out chill out i know it's mandalorian
i know everyone loves mad delorean it's okay we're gonna get through this and like we're trying a
lot of uh i don't want to sound like an asshole but like we have someone saying he takes cover
in every episode lol there's like okay that doesn't address all the times where he doesn't
exactly right okay so like comments let's try to think before we finish diving this out all right
all right does he take hang on let's let's try right does he take cover more often than not
throughout this series uh he takes cover i would guess he takes cover more often than not sure
probably i didn't i wasn't counting it that's a good thing i mean yeah sure i mean like something
that's 60 bad isn't as bad as something that's 70 bad yeah yeah well obviously we're highlighting
the flaws we're not like if the parts where he isn't doing that it's it's strange um and you know
like if you're wearing body armor in in modern day obviously and shoulder pads that have
basically his stuff but in modern times and someone pulls a gun on you it's just rare to
just be like you'd be like oh fuck it's a gun yeah yeah but also it's uh one more additional
point of the armor defense right is that um i think he could be justified in saying screw it
and just jumping out relying on his armor because when people are firing it like i don't know how
much this applies in star wars but in the real world generally people always aim for center of
mass and so it's more likely he's going to be hitting his torso or head i guess if people want
to do an insta kill and those are his most armored parts and so he has more validity like to say to
rely on his armor because it does cover most of the vital areas essentially i'm not saying getting
hitting their legs and everything wouldn't suck it obviously would so there is a bit of a defense
here yeah and again back kind of back to chat a bit like i you understand there are points in
the show where he just like walks out i think to hails of bullets and gunfire i think my favorite
one is when he just stands to take the shot from the assassin sniper in episode five he like wants
to be shot it's really weird yeah like that's the thing he does things that see that i haven't
re-watched that one because i they were actively trying to avoid getting shot what happens again
he gets it's when he gets shot off his speeder he stands up she has him in the scope and he's
just staring at it and then she shoots his chest plate well well i'll talk about that when we come
to it because there might be a defense there so we'll see it's just it's just it's just strange
that he's not doing anything to like you know even getting behind the the speeder looking for
a get behind any anything at all drop do something he's just standing there that's why i think there
could be defenses because if she hits the speeder and explodes we know that nearby explosions can
damage him quite a lot and so if he knows he's gonna be get shot there's no cover he can take
by standing up there could just that movement could actually encourage her to aim for center
of mass more because there's it's she's also tagged him like three two i think two times before that
um yeah at first she hits him twice and so she should and she's supposed to be one of the best
of of like i don't i don't want to call her an assassin if that's not accurate but i'm just
going to run with it for now um it's weird that she just keeps shooting him in the place that
she knows doesn't kill him even though it doesn't do anything yeah well well i mean again this is
this one that one's hard to try and determine should she be out at or like i personally like
that because in the real world the best knife is in the world at such ranges it's very difficult to
get him in the throat purposefully and stuff like just hitting i know i want to just that's the
that's the i'm showing you the uh that's what she can see yeah that's uh it's and this is after
shooting him twice uh yeah yeah but but even if she sees that we don't know how much um straying
the blaster bolt does over long distances that's what she does and she hit him twice from an even
further distance while he was moving yeah but that's technically what a master sniper is trying
to achieve just hitting them and just hoping that it's strong enough to blast through his armor and
even mandalorian says he's not sure his armor could take it and so i like to me that makes perfect
says like like she just wants to hit him and that is an achievement after all of them but
she knows that hitting him in the chest won't work and he i want to clarify he's standing still
at this point and she gets a decent chunk of time to be able to aim this i'll try and show
chat now this image is this image on the stream it is and i want to show the clip itself i gotta
be really careful at copyright because youtube's annoying with this the assumption though even with
armor is that if one hit doesn't work you've weakened it and perhaps more hits what she
doesn't know that is wearing this guy does she she gives like i mean does with blasters does it
does blunt force is that like a factor or well well see my like i feel if they were consistent
blasters should have a lot more penetrative ability at close range they established it
kind of in the first episode but then they give up on the consistency of it because that could
be great if they were consistent that oh he's wearing armor we need to like get point blank
range to be able to kill him that could be that's a great limitation in the functionality of
blasters that they need to work through in the actual narrative of the story but they never they
never listen to go with it consistently because you know when they take cover or behind metal things
it's always strong enough to resist when the convenience of the plot so yeah and so to me
like hitting him in the chest uh center of mass at large range like if if in the styles universe the
master like if they take what a more realistic approach that a master sniper it's a great shot
if you can just hit them tag them at such distance in terms of pinpoint accuracy is just
something unattainable because yeah but he's standing still and he's way closer and she has
plenty of time to make the shot and she's put multiple rounds in his chest and she's extremely
talented from what we understand yeah and she's like really really good at this yeah like you
add that stuff together and you're like like your criticism is just as valid as also saying that
it's you know being master just means it's good that you're able to hit them and and and to expect
one or the other over the other option you can't really pick one they're both they're both kind of
arbitrary and so this is just like a freebie shot so that's him standing up in the thing
yeah he's just there he's either on his knees or just yeah i think i think look i'm not saying
it's a perfect defense but i'm saying the logic could be he wants her to hit him in the chest so
it's presenting you an open target to encourage it yeah that could work yeah and i just i find it
bizarre that she wouldn't go for you you can like see what's working on him in terms of armor she's
shot him in the chest plate already as far as i'm aware yeah yeah but the logic is why she didn't
hang on guys the logic is a lot closer and so he already said that he's not sure of the
his armor itself would be able to survive at that close range and so her logic is that i've hit it
twice it must be weakened he's closer now so she could obviously uh assume and rely on the fact
that this one should go through because he isn't aware of how strong he could just shoot him in
the neck because she knows that there's no armor there also wouldn't wouldn't you say that um him
acknowledging he doesn't know if it'll hold up is actually a reason for why it wouldn't make sense
that he's just standing here instead of well what else if he can't take cover because the
literally just moving moving will make you harder to shoot i agree maybe just ducking to the side
and rolling might have been that also like if you're risking you're putting a lot of hopes in
this sniper to give him a free shot that they're not just going to headshot you right here like
he's taken up half her scope basically and she's just staring at him i don't know yeah i just is
i mean we we can move on because yeah i don't yeah i don't think this is a like look there are
easily points to criticize it but it doesn't break the show and to me it's not a huge one even if
there is valid criticisms to be made it's just there are there are for sure bigger flaws for us
to get to exactly like when let's focus because for me things that break a show to the point where
something happens so dumb that it ruins my enjoyment is like hyperspace ramming or they
don't know which way is up that's like that's and you can't end that crap can i can we i want to
rapid fire some stuff just because i want to make sure we actually are progressing you know in some
way shape or form just some stuff just some stuff i will yeah i will just say about his neck right
his armor if you go back to the picture his armor went up high enough that it looked like
that angle yeah like there wasn't a gap between his helmet because he was like moving he's holding
his chin down and the arm but i don't think that yeah the picture we're just looking at i don't
think that that was yeah there's clearly a gap no i like his his hunching his his helmet like
i think he's looking slightly down a little bit but she's above him shooting downwards
yeah yeah so they're like aiming for that that's a very even if there is a gap it's very small
and there might not be a gap because the helmet might be covering it if there's hunching his chin
down so anyway that's just another observation yeah this doesn't also get rid of the why doesn't
she shoot him in the head thing when he's just well while his helmet's made of pesca as well
okay the slit the slit yeah the slit also the head shot with and i i i still think that the
fact that he is so much closer in range and she's already hit him twice it's an easy you know thing
further feel that all right there's surely this actually but now i'm thinking about now that i'm
thinking about the head shot it's like that that body shot it seemed to hurt him so the head
surely would be the best option at this point but the head could have enough concussive force to
knock him out that's true yeah that's what i'm saying like yeah i i think it's just like clearly
a better decision to shoot the head i feel anyway moving along um all right rapid fire
all right so don't you think it's weird that both satan and uh the blue alien for some reason know
that access code to get into his weapons or is it just that you press a button and it opens up his
weapons case yeah yeah i like i don't know what that's about it's weird maybe you should have
maybe maybe you should have locked them yeah but like i don't know it's weird like yeah if i was
going to let aliens walk around my ship that i had captured was going to throw bounty i would lock
up my weapon safe yeah so would i um pretty risky to let your bounty wander around with the
option to grab any guns it wants to i don't know why it just is just a weird moment that uh it's
pretty interesting that he left uh his ship open so that the baby could just like walk out of his
ship when he was on tatooine oh wait he does a couple times yeah yeah well when i say rapid
fire i'm actually trying to go chronological oh okay all right and some of these are gonna be
tiny some of these will be more significant i imagine um yeah uh keep going i should be able
to keep pace with you because my next one is the the little this is this is a nitpick of the
nitpikiest nitpicks but the little continuity thing with a table mauler you found oh this
the shadow disagree with it would agree with that nobody would disagree with that but it's
it's tiny so we're probably fine on that one like it's just they they put money on a table
when it's not supposed to be there and then it appears later it's just a small thing right
you guys are just nitpikas these are literally last jedi if anything we thought it was interesting
nobody on set noticed it all the editors um but it happens i didn't notice it the first two times
i watched the episode so i didn't either um so i find it interesting that um mando is meeting with
his the people are going to commission him for this job and a scientist walks into the room
unarmed and he pulls his guns on him and pulls out his obviously other gun to defend himself
for the room right so it's like okay so we established that mando is quite edgy uh on edge
i mean not edgy um and very careful i like this it's like he's he's like he needs to be in control
of the room he needs to know what's going on at all times and they do it again when a little girl
in episode four walks in like behind him and she's like she's just there and he goes whoa when
he i think he even might pull out his gun i can't remember but she's like oh it's fine it's fine it's
just kidding he's like oh okay and again i kind of like that as a sort of he's so
like riddled with ptsd that he can't even trust the idea of a little kid walking by it's like okay
however in episode four when he's working on his ship in the middle of the night in the
fucking woods two dudes come up behind him and he's just like what do you want it's like oh okay
uh we weird his his
interests just devil's advocate did he see him before an approach and so he knew who he was
they came up behind him yeah yeah but still like his visor thing could give him and he could have
just glazed that direction saw him much further away and so he knows it's them and then he keeps
working at this point creating scenes that don't exist he doesn't know who they are though he
doesn't know yeah you don't yeah like what do you think he saw about them that they're two
adult men like i'm just playing devil no of course of course of course i'm not gonna i don't
hate you shad i love you i know you just hate me um all right like i said rapid fire i'm gonna keep
us going uh are we still in episode one yes um every mandalorian constantly wears their helmets
question mark like in especially in uh not more sizely the the place that they are in episode one
i forget what it's called um navarro yeah so we should probably talk about that then the
the mandalorian sort of sect or whatever you want to call it in navarro um are they all not allowed
to take off their masks and they're all not allowed to go up more than one at a time except one at a
time that seems shad shad your your circle you're turning green but we can't hear you oh okay sorry
i wasn't saying i can hear you now okay all right all right good good good sorry uh the
mic is on sensitivity so you're gonna hear that it'll just go green with very minor background
also one more interruption before you go as someone said were they primitives so he's startled at a
little girl primitive but not two adult male primitives okay at night yeah that's okay all
right yeah um but yeah the um the we learned that they only go up the mandalorians only leave
their hideout one at a time yeah it'd be nice to have that explained like why so like i don't know
how a society can like if they're all bounty hunters and they all do either work for the guild
or they all are hunters of some kind i don't know how you could keep a society going if only one
person is allowed to do stuff on top side at the and surely they'd be found eventually
especially because he just walks in well one of the so this is the biggest thing that i didn't
even think about until me and rags re-watched it you have mandalorian go and get a big old tub of
beskar cool uh empire man establishes later that it's so neat to see beskar be crafted by its
artisans like because that's a very specific skill apparently mandalorian gets it done in
the same day he gets that beskar on the same planet he didn't even leave does that not make
ever wonder where exactly he got that done it's like hmm how did you and it literally does seem
like you can just stumble into their hideout yeah there's no security in the last episode
it actually showed that to get to that part you knew there's a big tunnel complex like
it's bad editing through the sewer because that's a bit that's me talking complex but it is in the
sewer he walks downstairs but i can't remember if there was a cut or not to like to establish
that he could have walked through a lot daylight in the staircase yeah but was there a cut between
the staircase and when he actually enters everything i mean so at this point we have to assume that
there was a door he opens but there's no check because it's weird because they show when the in
the imperial hideout that he has to the little butler robot pops out of the wall he gives the
credentials it unlocks he goes in they have it for the imperial place but not for the mandalorian
hideout seems like a very very odd choice yes it's hidden by um there's an opening because
i'm watching it now i would show it on screen but i'm trying not to risk a copyright he moves
like a blanket that's on a door he walks in and then he goes to a staircase that's lit up
from something i just presume daylight i don't know for sure and then he's already seeing
mandalorians from the moment he hits the bottom of the staircase like they are very close
and the second time in episode eight when they arrive they arrive there through the sewers through
a separate way and they just walk in okay well yeah terrible place to hike yeah not yeah yeah
all my point would be is i fail to believe they could have kept hidden for very long at all
and um this is much later on but when they exposed themselves why did they stay there
did they not leave i thought they were gonna leave yeah that's what that's one of my big
problems and how in the world how would the world of the stormtroopers defeat them i know
it's funny because stormtroopers are shit it's hilarious but they can also kill mandalorians
a whole whole coven of them yeah i agree big problem yep rapid fire i have here i have here um
uh i we talked about earlier just to reiterate why don't the imperials go get baby yourselves
things like later episodes show that they're not fledgling or weak they have lots of troops and
stuff like that but we talked about that earlier um i do want to say it is um i liked it first
that the stormtroopers were wearing dirty and poorly maintained armor that was clearly
worn and not to show that they're hiding and they're not getting cleaned up yeah
to show that they either don't have the supplies they used to that they are kind of skinned on
supplies that they're laying low that appearances aren't the most important thing for them right now
and then uh every other time we see stormtroopers later they're all super clean super pristine so
i was hoping that there might be a little uh showing of it it's just it's weird that one is
one way while the other hang on were they clean in episode three when he goes in and fights them
no okay well then it's just that these are the fancy ones for the higher up that he you know
expects them to be yeah but all of all of the servers later they're they're pristine cleaned up
perfectly maintained but these guys here who do have contact with the stormtroopers from later
i guess they're just making do without supplies it's just it's odd to me i'm not going to really
count it against the show much but i will say it is odd to see that inconsistency um you would
think that there'd be some cross i don't know it's it's it's odd that they wouldn't continue that i
think yeah for me i just assumed that the stormtroopers for the other guy are more well equipped
and maintained and present themselves and the stormtroopers on that planet who were stationed
in there dirty i didn't really notice um yeah you but you would still think that if they're
laying if anything if they're laying low and they're not in the field doing missions and doing work
that their armor would be really good looking i don't know when you when you're away from real
strict authority and stuff like that they weren't they were surrounded by the their guy they had
their guy that one guy but depends how strict that guy was on them in terms of just maintaining
presentability and yeah chat wants me to to clarify whether or not the mandalorians actually
died or if they left their armor um she says because mandalorian says did any survive and
she says i hope so some may have escaped off world which imply i don't know about you guys
but that tells me a lot of them died yeah also the armor has clearly got like hole shot in it
and stuff like that so unless stormtroopers just really hated that armor lying on the ground which
they should just use like that armor is worth a fortune if any of its best guys like what
and you would think that the empire who is supposedly not nearly as well equipped as
before for pragmatic reasons would be like yeah this is a lot of money in this pilot right here
we could use money for outfitting i don't know maybe buying our guys some not clearly it's an
in-world canon knowledge that stormtroopers are cursed and no matter what they wear it automatically
becomes it becomes paper thin they can wear they can wear mascara and it's paper thin instantly
and they'll still die in it well the rise of skywalker taught me that the force is a good
answer for literally the dark side of the force is a path like shut the fuck up sheep
um so i'm gonna for quick fire unless did you guys want to continue on that um
the point no it was just a minor thing i didn't mean to talk about it too much um this is this
potentially nothing i'm just curious did all of the bounty hunters get a down payment like mando
did in a bar of besco good question i'd say no because there was a shit ton of them is i'm
assuming like all i can say is did he get one because he's the best in the past they did say
he was the most expensive so i i i think that it's a different reason i think the reason is because
multiple times um i what does this character have a name the the imperial guy the ball in a
head sock guys werner client so werner says multiple times he brings up the fact that
the mandalorians and the rifle way of things and returning it to where it belongs the beskar so i
think it's specifically he gave the mandalorian the beskar because he was a mandalorian he seems
to have a um this idea of there's a a natural way for things to be that the world needs to be
returned to um or that things should be and for him part of that is beskar steel is something
that mandalorians have it's very possible that he probably gave down payments to the other bounty
hunters if he did it all because they probably weren't as good as he was in just things like
credits or whatnot but i think the beskar was specifically for him i think no i think i thought
it's an inference yeah i was just i just thought it was funny if they'd given the beskar bar to
like everybody i just like i like this uh i like this in chat uh hurt zog is amandabu
he does actually seem to me that's a good um that's a good my next in terms of when i'm
quite quick fire leads me to uh when he arrives on baby yoda's planet so i don't know if there's
anything else before we move in there for you rex um yeah the the next thing i have here is where
he has gone to land on the baby yoda planet yes right yeah i was wondering why he landed so far
away and i have heard some people defended that you know uh people could have seen you know him
from the sky but then why couldn't he just fly low once he landed on the planet and get closer
yeah or just if anything maybe they did like scanning but like scanners don't seem to be
limited in planetary range if you can scan something on the planet does seem to scan the
whole planet so there's that um and so it's hard to try and find a valid defense for it because
yeah like that's a that's a lot long way to land also uh john penn said you need to discuss the
size of a parsec as long as we establish that he's the best in out of the uh navarro that's
pretty significant because that's the bounty hunter's guild it's like all of them are there
yeah and and like even if you're even if you can't look it up and you're just going by
why would he say that no one says he's the best guy in the neighborhood or the best guy in this
building he's like okay yeah that's building let me see though how big is a parsec how i think a
parsec is six point uh something like this hold on a parsec is uh 1.9 plus 10 to the 13th power
miles three thousand two hundred and sixty two light years uh hold on let me let me uh
so one parsec is equal to 31 trillion kilometers and equates to about 3.26 light years so it's
nothing parsec is not that big in the galactic scale still if you're the best guy in the if
you're the best guy for six light years that means for basically in two or three star systems max
you're the best one which hey i don't think that's insignificant yeah there's a lot of bounty hunters
uh yeah no exactly it's it's just funny because parsec so yeah they're pretty big but uh
just because this does come up in episode one and we're kind of running through it quickly
i'll uh mention one of my points of praise for the series that was present in episode one and
then throughout the whole thing i like the consistent set pieces that were accurate
callbacks to establish war so you know the the weird eyeball thing that comes out of here we
saw the droids that we saw other things helmets and things and i like it it was done beautifully
well that like this is showing a very consistent star wars universe visually and i could enjoy
just watching the star wars universe in each episode which yeah it didn't seem like it was
just shoehorned in because it's a reference a lot of the stuff it seemed like it made sense
where it was not exactly it made they integrated it naturally and consistently and they didn't
like there were new things but they didn't make up crap that contradict like why like for instance
the bombers like you got y-wings that are so much better like where they're like and those weird
things on the on the uh on the assault planet and stuff like this was not trying to recreate star
wars it was this was just trying to be star wars and i appreciated that i agree so he he pulls up
his sniper and he sees a creature looks pretty vicious heading right toward him and instead
of firing his vaporizing flash gun he decides to try and pull out his pistol i think is it
yeah no no he does you flamethrower yeah flamethrower yeah so he's he he lands where he lands for
whatever reason he's scanning around for something uh he's looking through the scope of his rifle
with his rifle rays looking around a essentially a wild beast for all he knows pops up right in
front of his scope right in front of his um reticle and he instead of shooting it he instead
pulls his rifle away and then instead of getting his blaster he readies his flamethrower really
strange choice i would like to submit this for the list of he's an idiot um i would need to watch
that scene again because i can't remember also i've got it on screen if you're able to um hang
on i could if i can just bring up disney plus in the background um and that means i can also
reference things um just while we're talking about it and i can follow along um it's so strange that
his first port of call in terms of defenses is a flamethrower with which if anything would probably
piss the thing off seems very inefficient maybe he was hungry i just mean out of all of his choices
like he gets to kill it and eat a steak um but yeah it just obviously if you just well we also
know that his gun is like a cattle prod and he doesn't choose to use it that way he doesn't
fire it he doesn't pull his blaster he just uses his flamethrower yeah why didn't he immediately
shoot he like lowers his gun that's pointed right at it so he uses a flamethrower are you charging him
yes yeah it well afterwards yeah it pops up and instead of again shooting it he lowers his weapon
brings it to the side and he tries to flame he in fact he activates his flamethrower
but it grabs there's not even much of a chance for him to aim the the flamethrower he's a
it's all very strange it's a strange uh i like i can't remember so this could be a completely
inaccurate telling but my memory was like i thought he saw one it wasn't a threat because it
was far enough away so he lowered it and then he was attacked from the side from another one he
hadn't no no it's the same one here's the screenshot i don't know if it's the same one this one like
yeah yeah there's i mean even if it wasn't the same one you're still shooting the one that's in
your gun sight right there especially because oh big monster teeth it's strange that it wasn't
heard beforehand did these things go blah blah blah was they then they stamped toward you it's
weird that like it's sort of oh yeah the jumps yeah the jumps yeah it's kind of like the time
you know it's seen in in uh avengers where black widow's walking around and then she just looks up
and hulk is suddenly screaming at her it's like oh where'd you come from also he's lucky like i'm
looking at it now look at that bite it takes like he's lucky that arm didn't come clean off
because he he looks at one and he sees it in the distance and then he keeps on looking and he keeps
on looking around and then this one just pops up right in front of him right in the middle of his
scope right where he's pointing and i guess he's like oh okay i'll try to flame throw it
it yeah all i've got to say is just he likely didn't have it loaded ammo is rare okay what
hang on no i mean that's a very powerful gun and if you thought he could take it out easily with
something else and not waste the valuable ammo i think i don't disagree with that the idea that's
not loaded though i don't know yeah why would he not have a bullet in it well well no no if he
wasn't intending to use it and he just wanted to use the scope to like a telescope to no
wait because um he's there he had no indication that was a monster it really looked like he
just wanted to scan the this time now i know this is probably being too generous in trying to excuse
it because it's not explained in the show but if he was just using it as a telescope and it wasn't
loaded um it makes political sense that he would need to throw it all aside quickly to get his
flame thrower there um because the thing literally jumps up in front of him without warning and it
does look like it's a separate one i'm just looking at disney it is yeah it but it's not
like it's he didn't confuse it for a different one somebody's it jumps up in front of him it
jumps up in front of him now you can remove the scope yeah so this is invalid he no no no hang on
hang on if i had a scope on the thing and it's just as easy to look through it while it's attached
to the gun um and but well no if i'm holding the gun i and it takes you know i could attach it
i'm like that's that's not something to really do
does he yeah he does when he's later on he uses the exact same scope when he gets the compound
but he doesn't have it attached to the rifle when he knows there are bad guys that are armed
right in front of him that he's looking at i'll certainly give you that one but i think the
defense that um if he was just using the the rifle as a telescope to scan the vista this thing
jumps up in front of him and it's a very short time between um it appearing so yeah he sees one
in the distance and by the way this this loads more to the scene i'm happy to sort of if we can
slink along a little bit like whether or not all right the points have been made sort of thing i
was going to say uh of all the times to not use your flamethrower i would say this is really not
a good idea bad though you should probably use it now yeah which one is that when he's gone when
when he's got one arm trapped in the first one that's been tranked and he's like oh god i'm gonna
die it's like dude flamethrower now yeah now flamethrower gun something did the flamethrower
get damaged because he's trumped on his right hand side though his pistols on his right hand side
so he can yeah yeah right but it's his first time that gets um trumped down was the arm with the
flamethrower and so the yeah oh my god he has access to his gun he doesn't even try yeah i just
said it his pistol's on the right yeah you're right he took it to you when we watched it i'm like
man i guess he just doesn't shoot this guy well this is this is one of those clear plants that
he didn't need to shoot him because he was about to be saved by day six muck and i and he clearly
knew that that was going to happen all right well yeah i think we've established that that
can you at least concede he behaves very strangely in this scene um i think the the part that's
indefensible is it not reaching for his sidearm everything else can be defended mostly i reckon
um like it is literally a second one he's looking to his right when his and he sees the one in the
distance and then he then changes his perspective as looking in front and then one jumps in front
of it so it's a completely different monster he doesn't have enough time and if the gun wasn't
loaded he has to throw it aside and then he goes to try and use his flamethrower then his flamethrower
gets tromped but easy logic he's got a cattle prod on it yeah good point and you could have
used the kind of product okay so which is also which as you know you could have used the cattle
product yeah you could have used it further away from him too it's the end of hang on hang on well
the other thing is the cattle prod isn't nearly as deadly as a flamethrower and so he could have
been wanting to kill it because uh i don't know it doesn't have a guarantee no the cattle
point could stop it yeah i mean it's called a cattle prod because it's messing with cat
like if i was that beast i would much prefer he used the flamethrower because by the time that
even has time to like beyond me it'll just be a second and i've already charged him i'll probably
be dead if he uses the cattle procs he's gonna stun me to the point where he might be he can do
whatever he wants with me sorry i just saw one of the super chats it's great he says
he should have milked it and gained his trust what type of milk is that would that qualify as
rhino milk um space um something it it okay sorry going back with legs or something going
i guess going back to the argument um if someone look and again this is just me being devil's
advocate if someone was really desperate to defend it they could take the defense that
the cattle prod wasn't strong enough to take something down that big it's effective against
humans at no chance he could have knocked it out in one prod with this beast and so i threw it
aside to try and use a flamethrower wasn't quick enough his arm gets chomped that damages his
flamethrower so i can't use again but the thing that can't be defended is why doesn't he just
grab his blaster well the thing is with the the issue i have with the flamethrower is that
a flamethrower is not going to kill it straight away it's just going to charge you and be on fire
like it's it's not going to kill it straight away it probably has a really thick hide that's
because it's a wild hang on fire is usually extremely effective at scaring off animals
yeah but by that time it's already committed it's already turned close
getting burned on your face it's instant pain animals react very strongly but hang on if you're
arguing for the best thing to do then it would be the vaporizing bullet surely yeah well no no if
it's if it's not loaded that's that i refuse that argument it's not loaded hang on hang on hang on
this is one that you can't prove either way i'm sorry we have no reason to believe it's not
because he wasn't intending to use it he was just trying to scan there would be a bullet anyway
they're on a mission that he knows is very dangerous clearly scanning for something
the fact that it wouldn't be loaded is very silly yeah that's why he didn't use his pistol this
fight because that wasn't loaded either even if you say it's a mistake i feel it's a realistic
mistake that doesn't portray him being well i mean this one this one thing that he didn't have it
loaded even if it was a mistake it doesn't portray him as being a bumbling idiot yet okay well the
thing is i saw somebody mentioned earlier maybe he panicked and made the wrong decision it's like
well then he's not a very good bouncy hunter that if he's like panicking and making yeah like that's
what training is supposed to that's your job this is my job like like all of these things like this
is like eight episodes of all and these are like tiny compared to stuff he does later on
you know like this all adds up in this short amount of time it i'm noticing chat it doesn't
seem like chat and understanding that i'm purposely trying to be devil's advocate not
that i agree with the points i'm making all right well i'm just trying to give it the
clarify defense that other people would try and make for mandalorian because and especially
because by testing any defense possible i think it's much better it enables us to really find the
indefensible mistakes sure and that stand as a legitimate criticism like the fact he didn't reach
for his sidearm when he was about to be charged that one is indefensible but we reach that by
looking for any other defenses so that's what i'm doing guys okay i'm not trying to be an anal kind
of it's okay shad because whatever in chat sometimes i'm like oh no well for example i
said i would be more concerned about a cattle prod if i was that thing because then i'd be stunned
and you could do anything he wants to me and i was in my head thinking about like
you could take that joke in a couple ways but people in chat were like you realize cattle
pros don't kill people i was like that's not that's not what i was saying like that's not what
i was saying if you incapacitate something it's not your mercy yeah that's that's entirely what
my point was but you know it's all right you're strange it's it's fine chat doing it so everybody
yeah and everybody's as if the point as if the point that was if you have training you will never
panic as if that as if that's the point we made um i was gonna say we can we can kick on because
there's a lot with this moment so um lucky quail was in the area quill sorry lucky quail spotted
the ship slash mando and lucky quail is a person who is willing to save his life because he for
some reason assumes that he's going to be helpful rather than allied with the people he wants out
of this place yeah very convenient and it is a contrivance um yeah i completely agree and lucky
saved him before he was killed yeah like i like this one doesn't break it i fully admit it's it's
you know a problem and if i was writing this i wouldn't want something as contrived like that in
my own writing it doesn't break it for me because you do learn to have to put up with it because
this is the this is a very similar contrivance that happens in so much the thing is like i know
it's what about ism and it doesn't it doesn't invalidate uh the criticism the criticism is
completely valid and i agree well the thing is i'm kind of used to it because this is a common one
when it comes to contrivances anyway it's like yeah it could happen it's just really unlikely
exactly and it's a couple at once as well it's not just the one yeah it's pretty because the
whole planet seems pretty empty but he happens to land in the one place where he gets immediately
attacked and the one place where nick is just sort of around to clarify is his name is his name quail
quill or quill i thought it was quill his name is quill k-u-i-i-l quill it is all right okay
because i'm pretty sure mando at one point says quill yeah i was unsure but i had been writing quill
so i will go with quill yeah quill and so yeah i guess just one final note on the scale of
contrivances there are one like like there are ones that are so much worse like a dagger that happens
absolutely to the death star that you just happen to send the exact position and that you know that
all that stuff and so even though it is that there are ones that are far worse that if it was
something that bad that would kind of be like you know ruining the episode for me but this one all
right i can i can put up with it oh the this is one that's very commonly thrown at the episode
couldn't mando just parked his ship way closer to the outpost yeah yeah i agree yeah all right
yeah move on um all right hang on could we think of any logical way to just well one of the things
that i was thinking before was there was something along the lines of he didn't want to alert the
guys um he didn't want to alert the outpost that he was going to so his logic was i'll park further
away and then find a way to get closer to it um which makes sense but the issue is that he's parked
so far away he's parked really really far away i'm not sure what his plan is to get there yeah
on the back of uh riding on the on the weird uh runner things you know it's like yeah so can
i just point out and i know you'll probably mention this mauler uh because you're probably
a quarter as well but quill mentions you can only get there on the back of these things and then he
walks back he walks back he walks back and he doesn't need as i didn't need him in the first
and he seems to go a different way like yeah he goes a different way and also the path that they
take they don't show any terrain that a speeder couldn't cross yeah they're very small gaps
yeah it doesn't have a speed it does seem to be implied that you need one of these things to jump
the gaps and they're good jumpers but then it's contradicted by the fact that um the gaps didn't
prevent it because he just walked through the gap on the way back and in actual fact walking
walking through the gaps there seems to have been would have been a much better approach because
it provided him full cover and then it's still giving the gaps anyway and plus ig11 got there
like yeah i mean the next thing i have on my list is how come the ig unit only gets spotted
without cover when it approaches from a vast open i will i will provide a screenshot in a moment
it's it's quite hilarious actually because the all they i think all they should have done is
just have some caverns or something that had emerged from but instead they show this open
plane and uh i don't know if it was just like a default background but uh here you go what could
have worked what could have worked well if the facility was actually on a prominent hill that
gave it a really long vista and they had an anti-aircraft gun or something like that yes that would be
and you need to land it like because if you have a large enough hill
that could cover a really long range and could explain exactly exactly you know distance yeah
like did he walk the whole way does he has his own have his own ship that landed we know he can
i guess he has his own ship yeah yeah yeah we can he can yeah he surely didn't where's his
ship instance yeah just the whole the point is there's it's it's ridiculous that they didn't spot
him before he was 20 feet in front of him and i find it all because they're all just standing
around i thought the ig units were established to be like hunter killer droids and so they're not
i figured they should be like oh fuck it's an ig unit that sort of thing that's a good immediately
like i'm just picturing this that the ig unit commando crawled all its way on the side
got to those barrels right there and quickly ran out to the middle and like yeah i approached like
it did a uh it did a little t1000 jog before it got there it's like all right i need to
catch my breath all right and then it jumped out of the barrels on the side as like i'm here now
um so again some quick fire stuff i think there's these aren't necessarily flaws they could possibly
be explained but i find it odd that ig11's intention to self-destruct is counted by mando
like he's like don't self-destruct and he's like okay like they're not on a team necessarily it's
it's kind of strange like why would why would mando recommending against it stop his protocol
well you might not be fully aware of mandalorian's capacity ability in the firefight and so
it's just kind of mando saying yes we can get through it and without knowing the history of
this you know mandalorian the robot's just kind of going okay uh like i'm mostly willing to let
that one go i just find it strange that's all um i think that one passes i did have a um i did
have a thing of four so throughout the season it shows that mando has an extremely i'll be
inconsistent hatred and mistrust of robots um when he sees the ig unit what he does is he goes down
there and he sees that this is an ig assassin droid right and what does he do he walks right up to it
without any cover and says oh hi and then instantly gets shot conveniently in the chest
please you know that's good thing he had that good boy like he tries to make he tries to make a deal
with this robot even though it's established how much he hates and distrusts robot and this thing
is incredibly dangerous and to approach it the way he did was really dumb like his his position on
robots yeah he won't let pit droids fix his starship he will make deals on the spot with
assassin droids he just met yeah i don't get as hung up on the on the uh deal because he either
needs to kill it which is not sure he would be able to be or he could have just shot it from the side
well hang on hang on that's assumed that point blank but um the the part that's more indefensible
is it just walking down like i don't know why that what i i agree i would be that much of a
a change in the damage to prevent that headshot also we never see i would like it it was uh we also
never see ig taking a shot to the head as far as i'm aware he always tanks the shots to his armor
in his chest and they just bounce off we never see him get shot in the head i think it's weird
that his head isn't made of the strongest metal versus his body that's what i would have yeah
and this is the thing because i i actually like that idea if they if they make the uh
the utility of blasters far more something far more understandable and then you could apply it
in plot and if the rule was blasters can go through really dense durasteel at point blank
that would be a great mechanic that they could use if they were just damn consistent with it
which they're not and so i wish they were because it's it worked it worked well if that was a rule
in this episode um and uh yeah i agree it's dumb that he just walked out he should have been taking
cover and saying oi oi um yeah and if it was about if he was trying to be as safe as possible
then he would have just shot it in the head because he's really close to him yeah my my major
issue is just that if rags and i were approaching this area and we were like oh god there's robot
killing everything i would turn if i was part of the guild i'd try to address it from behind a
pillar or something not rush out and go hey i geodid la la la and then it just this is the
thing is though mandalorian's hatred of droids doesn't exclude him from being willing to use
i'm not even dressing that i'm not even addressing that part i'm strictly talking about from a
survival point of view it's a really stupid thing to do it would be like if you just saw somebody
undertake a really stressful battle and then you just leap in from the side like hey how's it going
yeah like how is he gonna know that you're a friendly like you nutball yeah like walking out
like that was a very bad uh this is a plus one for his stupid meter all right hang on hang on
okay so if we're gonna do a proper tally i think we should try and be aware of the
smart moves he does and then try and do it more objectively because he does do no no that's not
how no that's not how this works if you are in a situation like him i'm gonna explain it yeah
because if so if you use cover 60 of the time you say all right he used it mostly the 40 of
the time right he's doing something incredibly stupid something like this is insanely boneheaded
so i don't know how you're gonna objectify saying oh well he used cover in this scenario
or he did something smart in this scenario so this one time where he basically survived because of
luck oh he still looks good at what he does he still doesn't he's stupid i guess yeah go ahead
for me like i kind of expect just i've never seen a show where um uh and this doesn't excuse
it i'm not excusing it but i've never seen a show where they don't make a character accidentally
do something dumb because they didn't think it through i wish they would always avoid it
and so i agree this is a big problem but as to does it make me decide that this character
is stupid because of mistaken the writing or is the character still overall competent when
he's written properly that's true he is how the character is well the issue is the thing
but because stuff like this happens like if the consistency i don't think you'd have to look too
far say in the original trilogy to find han or han died i thought of one already where han is
you know is chasing down storm trooper and runs into you like a whole group of them and screams
and runs away now of course it was a mistake and so that one's probably more defensible but
what i'm saying is i think you could find examples in stuff that's just as criticizable as this
situation here um but it doesn't ruin those shows for us because i kind of talk in the same way that
it doesn't mean that the character is boneheaded to the point of being your redeemable it depends
on who you do a smart tactical character we see him do stuff like this throughout the season
and it's incredible well that's why i think we'll need to tally them up i'm interested in that
because if the tally is overwhelming i'm willing to grant if it's overwhelming i'm willing to grant
the concession that okay character but if we need it but to do that we wouldn't need to balance it
out against all the times where he does do something yeah but if every episode he foolishly
does something that is insanely stupid where he risks his life and only survives through luck and
that happens like every episode every episode at one point you're gonna be like okay yeah i agree
really stupid things consistently all the time and and it depends on the consistency for me to
how regular and this is definitely one i granted um well i mean i think uh i think it might be
worthwhile actually to just what was two instances where he nearly died because he did something
stupid yeah devil's advocate and then then yeah yeah um is there any justification that you would
have assumed him to be part of the guild because he's a famous he's a famous mental warrior i don't
think it matters if somebody's in the guild like even if it was even if you were fighting in a war
and you just he literally kills guild members in the next episode yeah yeah he did hang on but
that's but that's what that that's with cause and they're spitting well they they jump them
they jump in but he's literally jumping ig here like what does he expect yeah it could be a good
point yeah he just killed a bunch of guys there was just a firefight he just pops out hey yeah
that's a valid counter it's established in the next episode that they
bounty hunters are more than willing to attack each other um which is kind of weird and specifically
to to uh to get the bounty for themselves and that's the uh that's the point that plays into
this and it seems fairly consistent that bounty hunters will try and kill each other to get the
bounty themselves and so like jumping then to the droid saying hi is established that there's a
much higher chance the droid would shoot him to keep the bounty for himself and not say hey you're
in anyway i won't shoot yeah somebody's saying like and he gets punished for that stupid mistake
it's like but he could have died like he said like this is the problem is he makes a decision
that could have killed him and he does it in every episode where it's just like i mean i think i think
i think we're we're good on this right we can move on yeah on this one yeah um uh let's just real
quick why is it that ig11 thinks that it's a an absolute dead bounty versus dead or alive
doesn't this bounty come from the same person yeah that is odd um unless the droid just thinks
dead bounties are easier to transport and so unless he was killed in conflicting orders
maybe he was told something else could yeah could be conflicting orders or it could just be that's
what the droid does he prefers bringing him in dead because they don't have have a chance
of escaping and he gets sure yeah i i do also think it's it's odd i think that ig instantly
agrees to splitting the bounty when he just destroyed everybody practically effortlessly
i was against him sorry um ig unit he shows up he destroys everybody with practically effortlessly
but then he agrees to split yeah yeah i know exactly but then you have um but then he
instantly agrees to split the bounty with the other guy who shows up sorry i just thought
i just would have died on his own it wouldn't have succeeded why would have why would the
droid have any reason to believe that based on what it had just done it doesn't know the future
um i guess you know you're right they're right that there is some validity in thinking okay
there's no real big threats and i can take it on myself yeah like if you're steamrolling
everything in front of you with no issues whatsoever and someone's like hey i'll help
you if i take half of your reward you're like hell no i got the clock sorry someone's unless
the droid is just naturally cautious by default if it has the option to droids are always going
they generally always go for the highest statistical advantage which is generally what
c3po establishes in all and so even if the droid is winning because it's a higher statistical
advantage to succeed with his help it opts for that that's logically consistent for me i think
this would make more sense if it wasn't a droid because the droid is perfectly fine blowing itself
up if it instead of like it would rather blow itself up and by the way the first time it says
it's going to blow itself up it is a very flimsy situation where i would go oh i can't risk capture
i'm gonna blow myself up here it's like well calm down like it's not actually that bad the
situation we're in at all so sorry i uh i gotta interject myself you know so seeing a few people
said in the chat that only the scientists wanted it alive like what actually happened was um that
german man said like we want it alive but you know he then he does his whole like yeah i know
it's a complicated profession so if you kill it that's fine we'll just pay you less they do not
want to kill it i want to bolster fringy there um the robot the robot at the end of it says the
commission was quite specific i feel like i'm being ghastly at the moment now because people
keep telling me that i'm talking too much but i feel like i'm not no i i would i would say i just
had another i just read a chat saying let fringy speak damn it so yeah that's what it means this
is the thing chat chat is all kinds of opinions all at once but i was gonna say like uh the robot
does say the commission was quite specific and so it's not it's not the droids preference to take it
maybe they're alive good point also some saying it is a droid it would be considered expendable
no it's probably it's really expensive i have to imagine those things are quite valuable if
anything the ig unit is way more valuable than actual bounty hunters that you're hiring it's
way more valuable than like 50 stormtroopers oh yeah man like ig i i'm ready to say that it's
like insanely opie yeah i don't think it's a overly unreasonable thing to just take the
manufacturer's protocol so it can't be captured and stuff and and it would be unreasonable if
that's a core programming tenant in its head and so yeah like that doesn't bother me yeah i i do i
i understand why but i think that the first time that it activates that and says it's gonna blow
itself up it is definitely not really in a worse position than it was before in the middle of the
courtyard spinning around shooting everybody what would the big laser cannon blowing him to bits
oh before that notice before you remember that big like revolving shot they did where ig is in
the trailer where he's just there like doing shooting around and all that yeah like the the
big heavy repeater i understand that far more i have no complaints about that but the first time
it offers to self-destruct it is really premature it seems yeah and i would just take that as a like
a quirk in its own programming and that you know it's just over over sensitive to resort to that
protocol and that seems to be the case with it because it tries it several times but didn't
bother me um all right so wait wait just to clarify clear that apparently it's not clarified
enough still so the the script um i have a camtono of beskar waiting for you upon delivery
of the asset alive yes alive although i acknowledge that bounty hunting is a complicated profession
so uh fringy is right he's asking specifically for it to be alive however he accepts that it might
die and the doctor is like wait wait wait whoa you know we want it alive um so if you're going
to take the the specific uh commission off that guy it would be dead or alive um it wouldn't be
strictly dead and uh someone cited we'll wait but the doctor says in episode three that the baby
yoda is the only reason that he's alive implying the doctor is the reason it's like no no the
doctor's talking about keeping baby yoda alive post delivery for man yeah he's the reason why
bait because he doesn't want to get killed by mando he's trying to be like nah dude i want to
he's alive because of me don't you like implying baby yoda would have been dissected up to that
point uh if not for the doctor which is actually a good thing it's telling us that it's not
convenient baby yoda's alive still it's that this character has a vested interest in keeping it
alive which is supported by that so this is good stuff this is the good writing in the show whenever
it happens occasionally it does exist it happened more so in episodes one two or three than everything
that came afterwards and i just on that note then as well that bit because like i think that's good
to acknowledge as well that there's for me i found a decent amount of good part things to
enjoy in it that i enjoyed it overall and contrast this to other things when there's barely anything
good to enjoy like the rise of skywalker i feel there's a marked difference which is why i think
giving it something like a three is it's pretty rough because there's still a lot of good in it
and it's not near as bad what about the relative i guess because what would be the scores that
you mauler would give for like rise of skywalker and toj like we're looking at ones and zero yeah
i can't okay i can't say zero i'm not gonna say zero but holy shit 0.5 our expectations were low
but holy yeah and also like i don't generally assign numbers but we did that so for the sake
of that sure but like very good like if you have masterpiece uh like audio and like sound effects
if you have masterpiece level visuals those are not going to get you nearly as many points as
masterpiece level writing and direction i agree i agree that that but it does increase it still
like oh yeah it does i'd say i think i honestly raised my rating on it a solid point uh it was a
single point but still a solid point for how good the production values were well i guess maybe
maybe yeah if we were to divide it into like visuals production production wise it's like an
eight or a nine um it's really really good but the writing is what brings it down because the
writing is is low and i'm very proud like in terms of consistency of writing and stuff i probably
would give it a four i would say that the writing is consistent in that it makes the same mistakes
over and over again yeah like with him making bad decisions i was gonna say this is gonna get a hell
of a lot worse i'm so i just want to keep going yeah this is this is this is the better episode
yeah um is there anything else for episode one or not that i could pick it up so uh the last
thing i had was yeah ig says the bounty was to kill the the orders why would the empire have him
go kill it and yeah it doesn't make any sense especially because it's just right there and
they could take it back it's it's very odd that's the last thing i have for episode one well i
enjoyed mandalorian um taking over the the gun turret thing and then just yeah it was fine with
the distraction thing using this grapple to get to it yeah i and see the grappling hook was actually
one of the things i i enjoyed a decent amount it because it was like it was like a superpower
that had very strict defined uh uses and limitations and it was used consistently within those realms
um and he used it outside of just you know grappling things he did use it in combat and
i enjoyed it i was like you know they did a good job yeah and to add to that i i think that the
grappling hook is what he is is one piece of equipment that he uses very effectively yeah
yes he seems to use this very well but when you talk about i can see through wallavision
and flamethrower and stuff like that he is very inconsistent and illogical with a lot of uses and
he doesn't use them in a lot of places where he should be using them but the grappling hook man
he that is his favorite tool because he uses that rather well yes yeah that was great i like
that part yeah so like even at the beginning of the show should we move on to episode two
all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna start with saying oh wait go ahead i'm just trying to
think is there any any good positive things in episode one and there's a decent amount i guess
i don't want to i think uh i think mandalorian's character isn't tarnished yet in episode one
i think he's still pretty good i can just picture shad's face like
what do you need just just like the idea that he's doomed to be tarnished the way we progress
uh like well episode one you could point out one major stupid point yeah he makes a stupid
decision but his characterization is still pretty good and and showed competent and capable and is
he can kick butt when he needs to but he's not unstoppable he still struggles like yeah he's
oh yeah he definitely seems to be at his strongest in terms of being a competent bounty hunter
i would say either either in this one or three maybe the best candidate is i don't really do
anything he just sits in the thing yeah what about in the last episode when he shoots out his thing
and grapples onto the tie fighter okay that's that's okay that's yeah also six you're probably
right yeah six when he takes out each of the team he's probably best at what he does in six
except for hanging satan we'll get there yeah we'll get there there's still some problems but
he's probably wanted to highlight camera netherton said uh not a single person decided to take cover
when he was spinning around on that gun thing yeah they're a bit silly in the head apparently
there was a common theme in this entire episode of the enemies or the bad guys for the scene are
insanely stupid and they don't seem to show any real a lot of times they show a complete lack of
self-preservation we're actually about to highlight one of those significantly yeah go for it i was
going to say so uh i'll i'll throw in a good thing and then a tism thing so i really love
the the wide shot where you can actually see the shadows uh and then you can note the mandalorian
is reacting to like very small sounds i noticed that too that was that you saw a shadow move and
that was like the clue as to what is reacting to yeah um and then they attack him not all at once
which was a weird choice they like two of them there's one and then a second one comes in pretty
quickly and then a third one far later but i'm more forgiving of that compared to this weird moment
where he's like tussling with one of them and then another guy like just decides to sprint off
and away from him despite the fact that he knows he now has a fucking vaporized gun to kill baby
yoda and it's like if you are successful if you kill baby yoda mando's gonna kill you you can't
collect the bounty what are you doing if anything i'm dropping my weapon and saying i'll tell you
anything you want to know take everything i have just let me live like it's a bizarre moment in
the fight just sure is a good thing that none of those guys had guns yeah they don't stupid that
all three of them didn't jump on him at once though they so this this is the collection right
they didn't all jump him at once they all for some reason don't have blasters which are pretty
commonplace and one of them decides to try and kill baby yoda with the fight yeah this is strange
look at him he's so creepy yeah i think the honestly the biggest criticism is the fact they
don't have guns i can excuse you know stupid moves in combat because bad people fighting it's bad
but he's just like if we can't have him no one cares
yeah this is star wars carry games kids but the thing is the the actual fighting itself
is decent enough and it's enjoyable and you know it's deflecting and is cattle prodding them and
and yeah so i i still think that it's enjoyable even though there are still things that you say
are very dumb and i would say where are the guns but honestly they didn't have guns because they
wanted a choreographed hand in the fight scene are we supposed to assume these are bounty hunters by
the way yeah yeah they're false um is there any guild rules for this or no can any because the
problem right now i can obviously uh extrapolate isn't it incredibly risky to be going back to
navarro when apparently anyone can attack and take your bounty yeah i i assume this is i'm
trying to read the scene to try and have it make sense you have to do that a lot with this show
but i assume that with a guild it is strictly super against the rules to attack and steal
the bounties of other guild members of course it would be like one of the points of the guild is
that you're competing sure but you're also cooperating to a degree also if the guild
finds out that one of their guild members is killing other guild members yeah they're just
going to kill you they're not going to kill you also um what was i gonna say i would i would assume
that these guys are knowingly going against the rules because of that because if if it was the
case that you were allowed to just steal everyone's bounty everybody would just be waiting at the
spaceport at navarro to ambush people and steal their stuff yeah i think there would be a couple
of caveats to it like um there would be a race to uh to try and get to the mark first and so there
would be competition there and they might be able to fight each other on the way but as soon as you
have it in your possession then i think there would obviously have to be some type of guild rules to
say you shouldn't be able to steal it or they have the rule that until you get back to the planet
where the you know bounty was issued it's all it's always a free-for-fall anyone can get it
but as soon as you're in vicinity of the guild that's when you have to play nice because we don't
want to have bounty hunting people and i don't want to i want to i don't mean to interrupt but
i want to cut off chat uh i seen a few people notice that i'm not saying that what they do
doesn't make sense i totally understand why with the value of this bounty and with the fact that
mando mando is alone and they're on some somewhat semi-remote planet all out alone in the desert
i totally understand why they did and i'm not saying it's bad at all that they did from a
writing perspective i totally understand why they did i'm just saying that is super breaking guild
rules because we're talking about the guild and stuff like that that's what i'm saying i see there's
more of a problem for navarro than a problem for this scene yes uh this scene i totally understand
why they would i would like to sneakily throw in a detail here just slide it in a detail he did not
load that rifle before firing it oh my god oh no and it was on his back and you know why you know
why mauler why he learned from his mistake when it wasn't
after that he was like i'm giving this bloody thing all the time he was like yeah something
could pop up in front of me and might have to i might actually have to shoot with my gun i better
keep it loaded good lesson i'm glad to see he learned from it yeah so um let's see let me go
let me scroll down to my episode two um also my my notes start off as wise mando walking at the
beginning where is his mount can you not i thought you couldn't get there by walking you can only use
the animals to move we addressed that earlier though oh yeah why didn't he leave his mount blinds
maybe quill took it with him when he left and said that's a dick on your own i know i know you
think quill would have left him on so i think that's just bad writing he ate it he fucking
flamethrower that shit and he ate it he's finally a use for this damn flame i like the scene where
he is repairing his his arm or healing or whatever and yoda keeps walking toward it it's a nice little
like moment of just being like all right and it was foreshadowing with the healing it still
annoys me it gives us something to make because like the logic would be this little guy is like
my my my protecting man is hurt i want to help that sort of mindset which can sort of lead to
you being like i wonder if i can do anything in the you know it's a bit of an extrapolation but
it's in the same vein as luke like trying to pull that lightsaber because it's just out of his reach
um in an empire sort of natural actions that might lead you to attempt uh something or make you feel
like you have something as opposed to maybe i can brainwash this person someone asked me in
cantina if i guess this relates to the the gun thing someone asked if i keep a round of the
chamber on my everyday carry and i do um because you need there to be one there if you're going to
shoot um so but yeah that that is what i do personally and as far as i know there's a lot of
people who do it's certainly what i prefer so to answer that question there you go it was asked of
me well we have evidence of someone not doing it oh we did some people don't worry it clearly doesn't
but he does now because he went from it um so yeah and so it's foreshadowing he's clearly trying
to heal um and mandalorian's not letting him and and you know i have like i hate the healing uh in
star wars i i do think it's more defensible with baby yoda because of the uniqueness of his race
or something like that i still prefer that they just keep it out i don't know that i like i don't
think it should be about the race at all no no and i don't like that one races can use force
to some fairly extreme levels like even lifting the mud horn is an extremely powerful force move
but like healing a flesh wound that's that small and knocking him out for the day or something i'm
cool with that lifting the mud horn is like whoa that is i i'm gonna say that that is too much
that is way too much that thing probably weighs a shit ton and for how long and he doesn't just
stun it or stop it or push it off course he lifts that motherfucker and he holds it up
a couple of things at least they have him knocked out for like a day but yes yeah see the thing that
redeems it somewhat um is that uh at least it has a very significant cost on baby yoda and they're
actually consistent with that so that's good uh and it is a more unique situation that could help
explain that he can do it just because his yoda race or whatever uh so it's not as bad as just a
human suddenly lifting something up and not having needed to train for it and things so that makes it
a little bit more defensible still don't like it but i can i can go i can go along with it just put
it in the back of my life fine people people are citing size matters not it's like okay so guys
you know you know that size matters you know that it matters it definitely matters guys how i i think
they're saying size matters not as for the person doing it but this is a really large object moving
at a high speed with a lot of oomph and weight and effort behind it also let's just be clear
this thing isn't even smart enough to speak yet let alone understand what it's being told but it
has the mental capacity to do this i think that's really really pushing it when you look at the kind
of strain yoda had to go through to stop the falling rocks and things of that nature man this
baby stopping that charging mud horn and lifting it and holding it in the air for as long as it did
and i've got to say like you got to be careful on this because i'm assuming
right just assuming that most of chat will take issue with ray yeah so you you gotta reconcile
this matters not yeah yeah like half a mountain size matters not so yeah a couple of things is
like i said i i have issues with it but i do think there are enough significant differences
to separate this from just that's different it's definitely not it's not on the same level
yeah it's not as bad no way i think part of that is the fact that we have no idea about baby yoda's
history and i do appreciate that they knock him out for a while yeah and that's what i that
the team's thought for me yeah um in terms of size matters not that my own thoughts on is like
yoda does say that but that's outrightly contradicted by every way the force is shown to us being used
on in the movies where heavy things are always harder for people to lift oh i'm sorry i i think
when they say that they mean the person using the force well what yeah what i was kind of taking
from it to contextualize what yoda was then saying to make it make sense instead of contradicting
is that yoda was trying to say you can overcome size now i just do it focus enough and then
size weren't going to be an issue here i'll show you still more difficult for me but i'm overcoming
it i'm sorry also someone someone quoted me the ability to speak does not make you intelligent
i was like all right that this isn't child he can't even speak he can't understand the things
that he's told like yeah that has something to do with intelligence like sorry the ability to speak
does have something to do with intelligence and the ability to concentrate it does have something
to do with your mental faculties right and it's like you it takes training to use the force so
i find it very hard to believe that someone that is that young quote unquote young who can only
do so much has the fortitude and capacity mentally to be able to use the force to that you know to
to that capacity so i had a uh i had an unfulfilled fear in theory that um baby yoda was faking it and
he could actually speak and was actually fully mature like a fifth like a 50-year-old person
and that he was only faking being a baby because he was still really vulnerable being so small
he had the force but he could only use it and then it would get knocked out and so by acting as
a baby pretending to be a baby it got others to protect him and uh and uh and there was a protective
thing and that would have been cool if just somewhere i think at this point the fans would
find that annoying like they'd be like no they gave a weird voice no no i don't like him it's
like you know something happens and baby yoda is there and bando gets hit or falls down and just
waltzes up and says falling down you have and there's like what
and i'm like i'll let you know my secret and then he could be like if he was a smart
mouse then going on there was a lot of potential they could have known and again like some people
chat are saying like oh the intelligence is on a spectrum all right like like a like a cow has a
level of intelligence a human has a level of intelligence this is all in a spectrum like an
infant is not going to have the same like it's hard i don't believe that an infant has the
has the ability to access the force in a way that we know requires or should require training in
order to use if he isn't intelligent enough to speak and understand and communicate with people
and do stuff of that nature like when you're talking about how he hides from the droid on
the ship that's a pretty that's a very very base level kind of thing to do
yeah i don't know about that because there are certain instinctual things that different species
can pick up and just born with it just to clarify what are we establishing his intelligence to prove
that he has a certain amount of force power that he that he can use the force power for me that's
not too much to this degree is important the force power to this degree because like he doesn't just
use the force a little bit sure i can understand that a baby that's force sensitive can use the
force to a degree but this is like some stopping the mud horde from charging it and holding it in
the air i think that's a really big deal oh but it really struggled it really struggled to pull
that off i guess the thing is though is that luke luke had to like train to be able to lift the x-wing
oh no but he didn't let he only lifted it but yeah like he i guess my thing is is i'm kind of
an i'm i feel like i'm in the middle ground on this one again because i'm not sure that it's like
so far out of the room with possibility that a like baby yoda might just sort of in you know
like might instinctually know that the force is the thing even if he doesn't fully understand
what it is if you know what i mean like i'm i'm in the camp where if later on they explain
how it has had training or something then i'll buy it but right now i'm not convinced of it
you know like like is it's a i can't really buy it but it can be explained later
yeah like if they if they find out like he goes back to his family or his planet or whatever and
like oh yeah this is a race of people that are extra force sensitive even at a young age they
show an incredibly gifted connection to the force even infants and they're like they're
like super special in some way or there's some kind of explanation for it okay maybe i'll be
convinced but as it stands right now i'm not quite convinced that it's you know a thing yeah
i think that's fair i mean like uh yeah i don't like the implications of it subverting the fact
that you generally especially here to that level before you need to train and there's always been
you have to train to be able to know you the force so i don't like a subversion there
but i think it can be justified even though i don't like it um and which is exactly what you
were saying before that exit and also the the when he uses the force when baby yoda uses the
force i feel like that more than lifting the mud horn is a display of like i it's really hard
to get a bead on baby yoda and his um like his force competency and the training it's like i
i think there's still a lot that can be explained right now it's definitely not like mary sue levels
but i'm still not quite still not quite buying it like it still seems i think that it should have
just calmed the mud horde down that was all and keep keep it stunned but don't lift it i don't
know why they had to lift it up in the air because that's a cool shot it's a cool reveal yeah so
that's why i think they should tone it down we have skipped over there i'm not mad chat i'm
not mad you just don't buy it you're an angry male this is my white male range i got from joep
so it's all seeping out we did skip over the jawa chase scene which i thought was
good i really liked it it was like oh i didn't at all why so let me put my notes
all right so what is his plan get his stuff back climb on board how how is he so what happens
why wasn't his ship on lockdown yeah yeah good yeah and it's established that it can
go on lockdown in last second last episode here's an important one so when he you know like uh
nick nulty knows that jar was on this planet but i guess he just didn't tell
mando that that might be a problem for his ship
yep i would have told him by the way you're sure jar was here it's gonna get fucking on
maybe you should just drive a little closer to the thing you know two birds with one stone
yeah he should have pointed to his house actually yeah yeah my point was is the actual chase scene
i enjoyed it it was fun and of course uh i was just doing that first chronologically um yeah
why aren't the jowers shooting him with stuns immediately instead of throwing bits of junk at
him uh there seems to be a range limitation on those stuns they always use close range he's
right by the windows yeah he pulls one of them out he's so close yeah good point yeah um those are
they're all up there with the stun ones but um it was tough for him and in terms of his plan like
i can understand someone you got my stuff and just chasing after them without having enough
time to think of a plan and now i'm here well that's like that's something like an amateur would
do like we we've established this is another thing about like mando needs like if he is the
best bounty hunter in the parsec he's doing this whole life he's been trained in combat by the
mandalorians you expect better i don't know what what would you say would a master would have done
in that situation well i i can't say accurately because i'm not a master of combat but but but
but i feel as if that like i'm look i'm not a master he picks off a few at a distance right
and then he starts running close he doesn't like try to sneak on board he doesn't use his
grappling hook to get to the top before they start to take off um it boy yeah when you say take off
what do you mean like like when they start to close up the ship and go away spin away like travel
away move go oh so you think instead of like because for me if that was my favorite ship and
i see them stripping it i think it's a valid reaction to go use sunset and just go straight
yeah sure on on an emotional level sure but i expect better out of a seasoned veteran like him
instead of going all right i need my stuff back instead of him going you know or i'm mad i'm gonna
start killing them going oh well i need to get my parts back so what's the best way for me to do
that giving my position away from this distance at a long range i can't kill them all there's no way
i can kill them all i don't even have enough ammo for that how am i gonna get my stuff back do i
wait and then follow the tracks until nightfall do i sneak on board the crawler or at least try to
what is he what's he doing here yeah i don't know if you're like because it's established that he's
not flawless like he struggles and fails a lot and so that also is implied tactically he can
really kick butt when he needs to what are your yeah but i think that's that's just it's consistent
to show him you know reacting emotionally so he can so he can be really angry and behave intelligently
can't we all yeah why doesn't he yeah what if he's not just i thought i thought you were saying
that as a contrast saying you can be angry and make mistakes and be intelligent i because you
know it i i know it happens to me all the time when when you don't have enough time to think
something through or something like that yeah yeah but he had plenty of time i don't know they
were in the middle of yeah they had bottles everywhere the ship was open they were all just
saying he's not a veteran in chat surely he's a veteran isn't he like he's the best he's the best
in the parsec yeah how's he not a veteran how does he not have a lot of experience under his
belt he's been trained his whole life to do this stuff no no no because that doesn't mean that he is
flawless like he is really good at fighting and you could become the best bounty hunter
by being really good at fighting and is like depending on how smart he is i think we're gonna
have to determine that but just on this case study alone by itself it's not acting like a
complete buffoon idiot it's reacting emotionally yeah he wasn't he wasn't acting like a total idiot
sure and i feel like rags is holding him to a high standard you bet your ass i am
you bet your ass i'm holding mando to a high standard he's a mandalorian for starters
who are supposed to be the elite of the elite in this unit also this is what he's been trained for
his whole life he's the best bounty hunter in the parsec yeah i'm holding him to a high standard
yeah yeah but he you can achieve that high standard being an elite and the best in the fight
while being just by being good at fighting which he clearly is and have him make mistakes tactically
which he can do and i think that's yeah we think he definitely can do that in fact he it's almost
like he likes to well just just remind people he's been doing jobs we've really found one big
mistake he did in the first episode and i don't think this is a huge mistake in this one in just
reacting like you stupid things get out of my ship he wants to stop them stripping it so he
shoots them that you know makes them run away and then he chases them and stuff and oh you know
that's all that's you know it's fine like it's reacting the being real and i would be ticked off
if my shit was getting stripped like that um granted he could have acted more tactfully and
like all right i'll chase him down but if he didn't do something strike right off the get-go
they just would have kept stripping the ship if he like wanted to wait to sneak aboard
that's still the length of time in which they're damaging his ship further and stripping it even
further which means there's more stuff you would need to get back and so by fighting it will be in
the same place no no but if by firing he stops him stripping it in that very moment so yeah but
i guess it doesn't matter anyway because all those parts would be in the same place wouldn't
it have been a better idea for him to like sabotage the uh the vehicle so they could all
straight up just try to approach them he seems to be on good terms with tuscan raiders i don't
know why he wouldn't be with jowers well he's ticked off they're stripping his ship yeah yeah
you're right you're right you're right so the best thing to do yeah the best thing to do at
this point is to be like oh gotta suck up that rage and be like look guys this is my ship yeah
i'm not arguing the best thing um that you should have done i'm arguing what he did done is
justifiable and it doesn't make him an idiot and he still can be a competent one of the best you
know mercenaries in the galaxy you know not immediately shooting the tuscan raiders i
actually quite like that bit in that it's like oh it tells you that he's again i hate you with
seasoned he knows what to do around these parts he knows how to talk to these people he knows how
to deal with it like how does he not know what jowers do because this isn't even tattooing right
this is um it's another planet he can speak a little bit of jowers he's definitely had
experience with jowers and jowers do trade like we know that they're uh they're not like a they're
strictly scavengers i get his thing i would not want to have to pay money for that for stuff that
is mine and so if i can they took it you know without trading so if i could try and take it
back forcefully so i don't have to trade or go through crap like killing a mudhorn to get back
what's rightfully mine i would take it and what was his plan when he got onto the ship
what was his plan to get when he got on the vehicle like what was he gonna do kill every
single one and then drive it back to his ship like if he was able to pull it off i reckon he
would have done it yeah i i mean how's he gonna kill them all there's no way yeah but he had to
know that there was no way that he must he must know that they have stunned he must know they
have stun guns as well right well no no yeah because he scopes in on the guy who has a gun
well okay so if you see someone with a stun gun that might indicate but he doesn't know
how tough or weak these jars are in fact jars seem to have a reputation of being cowardly
because that's the way they act and so i think he could feel justified with it he has taken on
seasoned you know people and beaten them yeah but there's like 50 of them there's so many yeah
but they're they're all little and weak and they just he's on their he's on their sand crawler
where does he expect even like it goes badly for him and he fails yeah because it was a really bad
idea he should have i'm willing to move on yeah i'm fine with moving on i didn't mean to discuss
this in this detail but i still am i'm still definitely being critical of him for his i mean
there's more anyway for this moment first of all his fall yeah his fall is pretty significant
his fall could have easily killed him yeah oh well that one uh i i agree but and i find it really
odd it's like that happened in not in everywhere and you just kind of accept that these are heroic
characters that can uh i kind of we don't know what medical things but i just want to say that
i think what he did was valid and it doesn't underline make him an idiot and stuff especially
in the sense that he's angry and he could have very well been thinking as he's trying to climb
i was like all right i'm you know my head maybe i've bitten off more than i can treat which he
clearly did but he was committed by that point and so he was like i'm just gonna go with it and
i know i've done that when i've made i don't know i feel like but that just adds him to be
incompetent if he's like i'm just gonna commit to this terrible plan well it still might have worked
he didn't know that it would fail if it's a yeah i feel like committing to a terrible plan if he
acknowledges it some cost fallacy you know like he's he's got him already he's like fuck i guess i
gotta see it through and then of course that happens because he knows because he knows that
there's tracks on this thing too it's just yeah even if he knew that it was going to be harder
than he expected because he's committed he could still feel i'm still going to try and pull it off
and i think that's something that many people do i know i've found myself in situations like where
i've tried something good not more than two but i commit to it because there's still a chance i
could i could pull it off it is a fallacy though it's it's the sun it's called the sun at what
point does the yeah i'm not i'm not saying it's the best option no no no i didn't yeah yeah yeah
yeah we get that yeah it's just that as a bounty hunter he of all people should really be tuned
into sunk cost like this is something that he would be dealing with all the time yeah it's like
how many times does he have to do something foolish and stupid until i'm like man this guy's
just awful i don't think this one qualifies as actually being foolish and stupid i think
this is something intelligent people can resort to very easily by emotion and anger it's his
favorite ship yeah this doesn't make him an idiot yeah and i i think that i i like there's a comment
in the chat mando can be imperfect but it could be done in a way that doesn't make him look like
he's new to the job and i agree wholeheartedly with that i i really would and again i didn't
mean to have this be a huge tangent but man it's like it's one thing after the other with this mando
guy i think rags and molar are losing credibility with their nitpicking have you seen this show
before yeah like yeah um so yeah i was just gonna say moving on uh i think it's ridiculous
the fool he takes but fine i'll let that go i think it's ridiculous they don't scavenge his
armor after he's killed a whole bunch of them yeah they just leave like they know he's stunned
they watch him fall down and they're not they just leave so that he can survive to hunt them
down another day they just don't do anything i will see i think this one you could defend it
like i sometimes people just want to lick their wounds even when after the one and yes they could
rob the guy or do so whatever they want i do agree that it's probably a bit more out of
character with jarla specifically because they're known for scavenging everything um
but what do they know about mandalorians how long is he going to be knocked out
well just keeps just keeps just keep hitting him
well the thing is for all they know he you know could be stunned days whatever and they get closer
and then few are the ones again to die he's killed several already and so even if there's
a small risk factor and they are cowardly that's any number of them could die again
because they were forced to he was chasing them but now they're free and now they don't have to
risk any more lives i think like this one isn't um a strong point of criticism when it can be
justified that they it's time to lick their wounds they don't want to risk any more lives
and they are cowardly by nature that makes sense i i i don't think it makes any sense at all i mean
like i see your point but the idea that they they have all all of these guys have shot him with
stun guns they watch him freak out they watch him fall back and land on the ground far below
and he's just laying there and he doesn't have his like and they just leave
like that seems extremely weird for jawless to do with his armor and with the fact that he's killed
him at this point you could have they could have turned put the thing into reverse and back to
yeah because being god yeah the length of time being knocked out is arbitrary
for whoever the writer wants and so if they decide to back it up they just would have made it that
his armor prevented a lot of the stunning and he woke up and rolled out of the way and so
yeah but like it's an arbitrary when he's at the top there is one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten jawless that's done him at once do you say we're not sure of how long it took for him
to wake up no i think i think shut up no i'm saying that's just gonna make him knocked out
for as long as they need him to be knocked out if he got knocked down they came back for him yeah
it's an arbitrary thing to criticize because they could have just if they try to run him over
they'll just say beskar's pretty damn good at blocking those you know um things but now they
have established it so they should be consistent with it if they've ever has to get stun shots again
um but there there's a lot of ways in which it could have been written to avoid but i agree
there there is a question mark i agree that you know um jawless it's not a big one though for me
is like yeah they they ran away a few of them died time to lick their wounds they got there
they got most of the scrap they wanted uh let's not you know try and this isn't criticizing the
story for being unrealistic this is don't like what he did fine but ease off of it
is this a criticism of just disliking how he acted though or is it more like in service of
he's not that great about me i've been listening to all these others i just think he acted like an
idiot in this scene so i don't think it's an idiot i think it wasn't the best thing he could
have chosen but it's far from blatantly stupid i feel like he has a bunch of durasteel on him
and he has all the gadgets and stuff on him they know he's got a rifle somewhere oh yeah he's not
wearing the beskar good point good point yeah but the thing is is um i guess when i think about all
of his options this feels like the worst because when i think of things that he could have done
he could have done nothing and followed them to where they stopped for the night to try and get
it back he could have um shot his you know cindy area ammo at one of the wheels to make it so that
the the vehicle couldn't move anymore well no no there's no guarantee that he did try and shoot this
the thing and it did nothing and he did he try and shoot the ship he shot the back of it one time
and then gave up after that hold on i'm pulling it up yeah he shot the back of it once i i think i
think sending a shot to try and stop them from uh like completely dismantling his ship to nuts
and bolts is perfectly fine like they're stripping my ship i need to stop the damage before it becomes
irreparable or so bad that i won't be able to fix it with two weeks work or whatever and help and
stuff i mean even though you know you have like he was actually hoping that it would still fly
like he tried to get out i guess so and so so that the fact that he wanted them to stop stripping
the ship as soon as possible is a very valid option to resort i guess right away yeah sure but
but when he jumps onto it it's like you're not going to be able to take all this back to your
ship i mean because again he would have to kill them all yeah sure i think he's more than willing
to and um i don't think that he would be able to i don't think it's possible i mean i don't think
i think he could have been thinking all right i'm pretty over my head but committed let's keep
going because he killed a lot of them pretty easily already and so he could like because he
was typing him at a distance yeah but even even when he's trying to climb up he pulls several out
of their hatches i think he only pulls one out no no no more than one i'm pretty sure they can't
only pull one let me let me check i'm pretty sure it was more than one i think he pulls one we even
see it hit the ground yeah but i saw i remember seeing more than one fall so but it doesn't really
matter but still you know he kills several in his uh beginning of his attempt to get rid of them
i'm just rewatching the scene yeah he kills three of them and then he puts down his gun and then he
runs down this is so he runs down he doesn't make any attempt to stop the uh he doesn't make any
attempt to sabotage the vehicle like it's funny that they're throwing junk at him right and then
one comes out and prods him and so they're trying to prod him all right um and so the fact that
they're throwing bricks and stuff does mean that their stun guns aren't long range and if you only
saw one he might be assuming that they're not you know heavily armored with like lots of weapons and
stuff and so from his frame of mind he is but you know i think it's well enough for him to assume
that they don't have lots of weapons up top because as you've been throwing bricks at him
basically and so as soon as he gets up he could offload okay so yeah he throws two yeah he throws
a second one off right before ten of them all shoot him with stun guns at once and he falls off
and lands and he pulled out his gun and so he could have been expecting that they just had
bricks and scrap that they were throwing at him and he could have just offloaded his gun at him
or threatened saying i'm gonna kill you all unless you give my stuff back that's a valid thing and
in that sense he technically succeeded if his assumption was that they didn't have the stun guns
and how many stun guns was he you know justified in assuming that they had did he even see one
like that could have been a surprise to him he saw there were ten i mean he might he probably
might have kind of individually but there was there was ten up there right in front of him so
yeah yeah but but if he was assuming that they didn't have the stun guns technically what he was
trying to achieve he succeeded in what he was trying to achieve yeah he successfully climbed
up to the top pulled out his gun ready to threaten them at gunpoint to give him his stuff back
and then they stun him because he he miscalculated that they had stun guns and that's valid enough
if you didn't see them having the guns but he already saw them with guns through his scope well
i'm gonna check i'm gonna check because it's also how many guns because i mean if he sees one with
a gun there's no way he's like oh it's probably the only gun they have well what like
was he expecting ten to be up there i think it's his gun in his whole stream and that way he fell
and dropped it but they're not they're certainly not firing back when he starts shooting at them
and i there's only one with a stun gun that was hanging at their side and there was a lot outside
if he's assuming that's the entire crew oh no one is firing back actually but then he kills it so
he kills one of the ones one of the only ones with a gun actually and so he could assume that they
had that's a valid assumption they have no more guns if that's their entire crew that that was
stripping the ship is like uh 13 i don't know why the idea of making an assumption that that's all
the people stripping is all the people he could see and that there weren't any guns on board and
they didn't have a bunch of guns stored like that's a huge assumption to be making i think that's a
valid like they want to strip that they are scavengers they want to know it's not if they
want to ship the ship as soon as possible you would assume that the entire crew is working on
it to get it done fast and get it on board sure i just i find it unbelievable that he would think
that they have no guns um they're scavengers well if you see if he sees their whole crew that
is the safer something that it was their whole crew for just a piece of information they're using
ion blasters which is what they use to disable droids it's what they do with artoo in uh
new hope yeah and if he speaks jawa surely he knows enough about jawa's to know that that's
something they do yeah i don't think there's massive failings in logic here because there
are valid enough assumptions you can make him from what he's seeing if that's the whole crew
of the ship and only one of them currently has a gun which he kills um and it makes sense that
the whole crew would be trying to strip the ship before the owner comes back then they get on board
and then he thinks he could take him on and you know threaten them to give him his stuff back
that's fine for me i mean i'm happy to just keep going because again yeah it gets so much worse
keep it going yeah um do what is next uh
i like what am i does just says how common of frogs in a desert
oh yeah because we saw frogs and and then was like the desert frogs clearly guy
desert frogs all right um again this is just a tiny thing but like how did the dude know where
the jawa's were like i assume they follow the tracks oh yeah that has to be it right i guess
yeah okay okay because the other thing that we observed when we rewatched was if they have a
circuit then nick nulty was really dumb for not pointing that out to mando like hey the
jar was come this way so move your ship so they must have followed the tracks um i was surprised
that he like happily gives up his weapons to essentially barter with them with with how easily
they can fuck him up and then he should just play throw at them anyway and then and he's lucky
that doesn't screw up everything for him he technically still had a weapon so he didn't
give up yeah exactly maybe he was relying on his flame throws well like yeah it would be one or
the other right like as in the criticism would either be he gave up all of his weapons when
they are quote unquote his religion but he didn't find but it's like also then wouldn't
that fuck up everything with the the jar was wouldn't they be like motherfucker you just fired
fired us what the hell let's say he scorches like six of them at once like he knows the others are
right there yeah like this is the end of your body right it's his favorite ship he's ticked off
i was like yeah he's angry emotionally trying yeah i mean i want to try and get past episode two
because uh i just want to i just want to get to the bigger stuff especially episode four like i'm
looking forward to getting to four because four is where it all falls apart um so i guess we skipped
to the mud horn battle his approach is so this is kind of what i mean like every time he does
i want not every time right a lot of the times when he has like a thing to achieve or a or
just an event to sort out i always i'm just sitting there raising an eyebrow like why was
this your plan like he has to he doesn't check the cave from like a distance with his scanners
or anything like his his heat sensor on his helmet he just goes in with like a torch well
his helmet has he has he has the ability he we know he has thermals he uses them in episode five
yeah only like i said so he can pick up heat signatures but at what range and what will block
it um well we can do it at extremely long distances it will definitely work very close
up in the dark although apparently amphibians in the desert is a thing oh i had no idea i had no
idea here we go desert frogs yeah like i don't carry the weight this is fine um the you keep going
uh just just the it just his approach seems strange he he's uh he's not using all of his
tools to the best use as far as i can tell yeah he walks in with a flashlight looking around
instead of using the thermal vision that we know he has and all this stuff that he has ability to
see through walls and listen to people through walls but he doesn't he just goes in with a
flashlight and gets ambushed by it and i'm just i wonder if this is um a disconnection in directing
that um you know what and i'm not excusing it i'm not excusing it but it's perfect like because
it makes much more sense that thermal that he didn't have thermals in that you know context
which is obviously why because yeah why wouldn't you use the thermals if you had them um and then
someone later gives him thermals because he's got a mask and that must have taken it without
well you'd think you'd be like i like you very well might be right as that is the reason i mean
we've seen what a lack of consistent vision can do to star wars as a trilogy and you you would
think that they would have all the people that they know are going to be directing the episode
or they have like a sheet they give to everybody and say all right here this is his equipment that
we've established he has this is the knowledge he has here's who he is so make use of it and if he
doesn't then that's just an issue yeah it's definitely a problem in consistency and it almost
gets them killed all right all right so this is me being this is like being the the nerd defense
going too far but still what if what if the mud horns cold-blooded or something i don't know
i mean it's been i'm i'm happy to say it's presented even if it's cold-blooded you'll
still be able to make out the shape really can you is that how thermal's worth yeah if you have
never used them you could still like tell the difference in like objects even if they're like
if like if you're in a room if you walk into a room with room temperature desk and tv and everything
you could still make out objects look at this it's funny how mola brings up points and then
when they prove it incorrect he says the thing he was wrong about doesn't even matter what are you
basing this off a frog okay we're fine i i didn't know frogs lived in the desert but if you remember
i said yeah i said so frogs in a desert question mark i did it like a question i didn't say it's
impossible for frog to be in a desert when did i say that and i said that it doesn't matter it's a
fucking frog it's an alien world like what do you mean frogs don't matter wow wow okay i'm sorry i
didn't mean all species are beautiful um yeah i i would just rather kick on like uh because these
things are just yeah i think this is a pretty obvious it's not a small one i reckon it doesn't
make it it's a small one this one it leads to him nearly dying and having to be saved by baby yoda
yeah but i reckon even if they gave him thermal stuff like that of course they're going to have
him nearly dying because that's what they want in the narrative for a baby oh that's not a reason
though i don't know it doesn't excuse it but the thing is yeah that doesn't i'm not sure him nearly
dying is a result of stupidity because that's a really tough fight well no it's stupid that
he walks into a dark cave knowing he has like thermals and night vision and stuff and he doesn't
use it he carries around a flashlight like that's just that's really really stupid it probably yeah
there was many other there's a lot of other easy ways to kill the thing did he know what he was
getting into what he was about to fight apparently not i can't tell but even if anything that just
owes to him being doubly you think the jaw was would be cautious because he doesn't know do you
think they tell him though because they want him to succeed right well or they want to screw him
over and they like watching him they can't watch this they're not he travels too far away from him
to watch it yeah i don't know i'm just look i'm reaching for this all right um i was gonna say
i'm happy to just kick on because these are just ruining episode two so i don't know like this is
to establish if he is legitimately dumb or not and i'm interested to see all right because i
actually don't mind a protagonist who's a bit stupid and fails a bit because if they have other
redeeming qualities of making good um at the moment i don't think this isn't like this he
almost dies here because of a very basic mistake basic yes he's walking into a dark cave you have
thermals and night vision yeah i mean i want to hold on a process like because if he knew what
he was getting into that this is a big monster and it almost gets him killed
yeah yeah like he has to get saved by baby yoda for this that that's the thing like i don't
consider this pick because it leads to him basically almost getting killed and he has to
get saved by baby yoda like if he was just if if if if it wasn't for the consequences
i would agree it's a nitpick to a degree yeah but this is stuff that i'm
and i think my thing about saying it would happen anyway i guess that's a disadvantage counter so
i think there's more validity to yeah the stupidity of this point and i actually think
it's probably more for this one than the jawa one if i'm really trying to break it down um
next one i i do know what you mean though and and if i was in your position i think that
uh i would probably say having it be covered in mud would obscure it even then that's reaching
super far but at least that's something yeah uh but it's not much you could do with that i don't
think yeah exactly and like my point is to have people watching is that my whole role here is
am i the only one willing to defend it so i'm gonna try and play devil's advocate even on things
that i think are very indefensible and then after we test any possible defenses if they are still
if you guys can count it which i think you did in this mud old one i'll probably agree with you
and like i and i think one of those times like yeah this one's a bit harder to defend
uh someone in chat said but we don't know uh that mando has it yet it doesn't matter because mando
knows he has it right i mean but well it could be explained if he legitimately didn't have it
until he upgrades yes like if that would be really cool like uh i know mauler and i were
talking about this in fringy as well where we thought from the beginning maybe he thought
this as well but he would slowly but surely get his armor and equipment as time went on
you know yeah not just like oh it's a video game you know yeah yeah um so that would have been cool
if he gets night vision and then starts to use it and fringy said earlier about the pacing is really
quick i think that'd be nifty because a part of a bounty hunter's like his thing is his gear
so having him earn gear through missions and get it from the fellow mandalorians and stuff and then
seeing him that could be the entirety of season one leading up to him finding
baby yoda and then making the decision to kill ig11 and then it's like oh shit like we've seen
mando for a whole season being of single mind i want to get my armor i want to get my things i'm
completing my armor set i'm a really good bouncy hunter and then you see him make an emotional
decision it's like oh shit and then you continue from there there's what i mean i really would have
liked this show to have been just a little bit well a lot different i guess at this point i didn't i
didn't mind the progression of his armor and equipment and stuff that he got the most of the
it was just really quick i i mean it's not like a big issue but i think that it goes it's under
it's in i file it under my wasted potential thing and i'm not gonna hold the i can't hold the show
like it's not a negative on the show because it was something else but i feel like they could
have done a lot better with the progression so would it answer your objection here though
if he actually did not have the thermal scanning stuff on his uh in this helmet at that point
i'm sorry say that one more time would would that answer your criticism here if you legitimately
didn't have the thermal scanning stuff at that point i'm pretty sure it's on the scope of his
rifle as well isn't it yeah he uses it yeah it's it's not it none of it is new equipment that he
acquires later yeah it could be retconned but and because even even say if it was right the fact
that it isn't mentioned in the show is a problem with the writing i'm not excusing it because
the fact that like whenever the audience needs to step outside of what is actually said and shown
in the show to explain things to make things work is a problem that's that's not good writing right
yeah this is like if he didn't have thermals and if they didn't establish he had all this stuff
then i'm i still don't think i still think that he should have done stuff like
create a distraction maybe don't leave baby yoda sitting right outside the cave you know stuff like
that stuff like have a plan don't just go in there with a flashlight you know just just to
push us on um yes one shot from that rifle would kill that thing and his gun jams because there's
mud on it another it's very unlucky that's and that's that's unlucky yep um
uh i think i think most people here cast an audience alike will find it a little tough to
believe that that knife kills the thing it's got a pretty yeah i would have like sort of been longer
so it penetrated deeper you think something that big like unless you hit like something
massively vital to drop which again would be really lucky if that happened it's like wow
pretty lucky that you hit the one thing that killed it instantly again that one is a small
thing i admit it's a valid criticism but like yeah okay it's someone saying using a rifle in
a cave and looking through a scope is stupid it's like you could move forward use the scope and
look around also we know that the scope detaches from the rifle he uses also yeah and i can just
show you forward you look around yeah though like look around i'm showing chat the shots now so
obviously it'd be the entrance of the cave he'd use it and then as he progresses you can see that
this base is like back here like so look at look at this shot i'll even send it to you guys
this is him entering in episode five i can give the picture of him using
thermals lots of space to be using it as he approaches you know
so i like i still think the mud for horn fight is enjoyable because he's struggling he's getting
knocked around and uh and even if he's in a dangerous situation arbitrarily and it isn't
justified he is in a dangerous situation which causes suspense and you know you don't want the
hero to die and things and then there's a twist with the baby yoda thing and the the cg was
flawlessly done um all the mud and yet some indication of what the armor can take how much
of a hit it bends but it protects him to some extent and so i like even with the floors i still
think that scene is enjoyable um i i see why but i still think it's i still i i couldn't enjoy it
because i think man he has taken some insane hits it even hits him in the helmet with its horn as
it's charging i i think he's wearing a helmet yeah but still like if someone's wearing a helmet
you get hit with a hammer smacked on the side of the head like yeah okay but this is a heroic
show and it's almost takes like an established thing it all shows that the heroes can always
take a bit more damage and i will point it out as being unrealistic and i do that in my own reviews
yet i happily accept it as part of the heroic trope that they can just take more damage because
it's in a fantasy that's just explaining why it's bad no no but but it it's if these are
supposed to be heroes that can take more damage than the average person and they can keep fighting
and everything that's just i don't know i don't i don't know he's a polymer or he are heroes
legitimately tough i don't i don't i don't think somewhere it goes too far no i i yeah i don't agree
that well my my view is um i think this is the kind of critic it's not really like when you
talk about a video game it makes sense because you'll be like well there's gameplay concessions
that you have to make but like in the context of the universe you know when you play uncharted
yeah you're stronger than the the villains but you're not actually like you know like in the
in the context of the story that's ludonarrative dissonance yeah that's that's like a meta thing
that this is the thing yeah it's a meta thing it's outside of the universe no no no but but
okay yeah it's meta but it's actually an established thing in heroic stories that the hero is always
i'm not gonna agree with you on this i don't think i can't subscribe to this one yeah you don't get a
special you don't get a special pass on surviving stuff because you're a protagonist well hang on then
you should apply this criticism to nearly every single yeah it's always when it happens okay so
you so you criticize as much like you know because there are so many hits that so it depends on the
degrees it's always a problem in terms of the scale in terms of the scale the rhino hitting
uh mandalorian is on par but and nowhere near as bad as so many other sure and when i brought that
point up it wasn't like a be all end all of why i didn't like that fight okay it's just one aspect
of it it's gonna because i admit it's unrealistic don't get me wrong absolutely um but we see it all
the time and uh and so if we're gonna say this is a an episode breaking thing well that means so much
of pop culture it needs to be uh criticized done better i agree yes i think it should be done
better but yeah it should be done better no at the same time like jackie-chan fight scenes
the amount of times he gets hit right i'm willing to you know suspend my um disbelief that he can
survive all these hits for the sake of a longer fight scene so i can see him doing lots of cool
kicks happy to do well sure every fight would be analyzed based on the specifics of that fight
sure it depends on the scale of the problem but before i forget sorry before i forget everyone
his thermals are not the scope he uses in episode five he uses the thermals to look for the do-back
after they capture the sniper lady i thought it was not use the scope he uses this thermals in
uh episode three as well in episode three when he's eavesdropping on uh that's the scope right
or am i wrong yeah he here i like i posted in chat like that's not him using a scope that's
just him using his visor my impression was that this it's kind of like how it's canonized in halo
where when you scope in the idea is that the scope is projected against the hud like as in if master
chief aims his weapon inside of his helmet it projects the scope onto his hud i assumed it was
the same for mando yeah but everyone's saying the scope thing it's it's not just he he doesn't need
the scope to have thermal vision and night vision okay see there's like this point is done you can't
if you defend this you're just oh stop like i get the devil's advocate thing but come on guys
there is a point where you gotta be like it's just we have all the references and everything
i like this shot with the puny knife he doesn't have thermals yet are you fucking the puny knife
yo you see it yeah very little again this is a nerd this would be a nerd um defense and i would
say it's too too bold to be any level of valid but but clearly the vibrations when you stab into
someone you protect another nika into the flesh it's a it's a special knife it's a it's a plus 10
to mud horn damage yeah the thing is that could be valid if they actually showed it but because
there's no indication at all that these knives protect a deeper penetrating um you know stab
when they enter something we can only go off the length that it's betrayed and that's that is that's
a very southpaw just said iron man one tony gets blasted out of the sky by a tank plummets to the
ground survives walks it off like it was nothing yeah that's bad yeah bad okay but again this is
like it's good to bring up other examples because there are sometimes i feel that
for the sake of uh making something enjoyable in terms of lengthening out a fight scene and
having your heroes do remarkable things you can justify certain exceptional even unbelievable
feats because i can't justify it no i thought that the whole idea i've seen all right let's go
okay so you feel it can be justified then with it with each individual each each individual
circumstance needs to be evaluated for the iron man example it's like we need to knock him out of
the sky it's like can we hit him with a tank shell it's like and plummet him into the ground from
really high up it's like no that would kill him we're gonna do something else you don't then go
yeah but people will enjoy it it's like of course people people will enjoy palpatine returning that
doesn't mean you make him return right there is something there is something that is uh something
that i think people will resort to as an easy way to he's wearing armor it's space armor okay
but tony's armor doesn't work like that you don't know no we do know in the film it falls
apart after getting hit by all kinds of different things okay that would be an inconsistent yeah
like each individual thing like we we have scenes to establish what are the limits of what a character
can take and we base that off of i would agree with you if it was magical armor and yeah it's
just each individual circumstance can be good or bad and then varying degrees of good and bad
it's not something that i'm ready to blanket um i suppose the put on stuff the problem that i have
here is it's it's all this meta thing of oh well they're the protagonist in the world they are not
a protagonist they are one person in the world yeah like the protagonist is the meta so in the
world they're not remarkable in the sense that beyond beyond what they can actually do themselves
they're not are you talking because it's not it's flashing sorry okay no it's just like yeah like in
in the world they're not remarkable in the sense that it the the universe itself recognizes that
they're special you know what i mean no no they are remarkable mandalorian is no no what i what i
meant is what i meant no what i'm sorry let me clarify what i meant was they're not remarkable
beyond things that they themselves can do what i mean is that the universe is not like mandalorian
he's the protagonist of this story so he can do these things he's going to be okay it would only
be mandalorian can do the things that he can do because he learns how to or he's predisposed to it
or something like that the fact that they're the hero or the villain shouldn't be relevant
no no no because i i think absolutely because they become the hero usually by
ability competence that they're stronger tougher than the other people things that you shouldn't
be able to survive isn't isn't like competence it's just like because i fully agree that there
comes a level where it goes too far don't get oh sorry i'm not saying that he should be invincible
in any measure but i'm saying that in this context here he's got the armor he's a tough
you know mandalorian with all this years training and stuff like that all right i'm fine he survived
so i'm starting to get actually like i'm reading the chat now and i'm just like so what i'm trying
to explain is that the idea of they're the protagonist of the story so it makes it it's
acceptable that they can do certain things when i say that the universe doesn't recognize that
they're the protagonist what i mean is that there is nothing in the story that is this person is the
main character of a narrative that is happening and that is the reason why they are able to do
things the whole idea is that anything that they can do is justified in the universe itself within
the story not from outside the story not from the pov of they're the main character they're the
protagonist they're the hero or something like that i feel like this is clear but maybe it's not
i think it is connected that when you're trying to say the universe can't acknowledge it is
contradicted by the fact that the universe is literally created for this hero's journey and
so that's an open admission yeah the universe is created by the writer i'm sorry it's like a
chicken and egg argument that's hard to try and delineate what you want to know what i what i
mean is like the idea is that when you're partaking in a story you're not meant to be thinking this
was written by somebody this was fabricated it's kind of like uh talking yeah the whole point is
yeah you want to but there's a thing you want to fool the audience that's not it like the thing
is all stories are contrived no matter what but the goal of a good writing is to make it appear
that it's not that's yeah but giving giving protagonist special privileges does the opposite
it makes no no no hang on hang on they're always going to have special privileges not what do you
mean by that like that's that's not true no no the entire plot is structured around their journey
their story and so the plot is entirely arbitrary okay maybe i went too far when i said special
privileges but what i'm saying is that the plot is always constructed around that character and
your goal is to try and make it seem like this is a natural story following and the more realistic
you make it the more believable you can yeah that means not giving people special abilities and
survivability no no no i've seen that this is different because heroes right mandalorian has
those things by default for the nature right but the story has um no he has those things
he should have those things because of training equipment armor not because he's the protagonist
well no it's both because no it shouldn't be both the protagonist part shouldn't even
factor into it at all what do you mean of course because if you want to get a protagonist i didn't
say it can't i didn't say it can't it clearly does that's what my problem is well that's what
sorry i think i was agreeing then yeah yeah yeah he shouldn't have you don't get special
plot armor and everything you don't get special this that and the other thing because you are
the protagonist well no no i agree because i think i think but one of the main reasons you
give characters special things that should be justified with background training is because
they're the protagonist and i'm trying to deny that i think i think i think it's better to think about
it but but but the reason why they justify mandalorian's additional abilities with the
training and back anything is because of the protagonist i think that's self-evident i don't
like yes i think it's not in all instances but in many instances you do want your protagonist to
be special more people i think it's doing i think you have to explain that in the narrative yeah i
think agree completely i agree completely yes i think not because they're the protagonist
right if someone if you're going to follow the story they are the protagonist because
they have these things it's the other way you're starting well again i think chicken and egg
argument in this instance i don't think it's the chicken and egg because the idea is um like i.e
it's the same for your catalyst for the story you know where you have a big coincidence that
happens and then it thrusts them on the adventure you could look at it from the perspective of wow
it's quite interesting that the protagonist uh happened to stumble into this coincidence
that kicked off the story but it's more from the other way around of the reason why we are
focusing on this character is because this remarkable thing happened to them that kicked
off the story i don't think it's the chicken and the egg i think it's the the idea is that you've
selected that this is the protagonist and this is the things that they like the reason why you
pick them as the uh pov character for the story is because in the context of the world that they live
in they have these abilities no no no you don't pick a protagonist generally in writing you create
one and then yeah i know you create them but what i mean is that if you're viewing it externally
and you're viewing it in the sense that if this were a real scenario this character who exists
was picked by the you know the the sort of i guess the omniscient creator of the story
because it works well if you know what i mean like yeah they're created but yeah that's the
illusion from the context that they're not created yeah i know but that's the illusion that the whole
narrative is trying to create but what i mean is we're getting caught in minutia because i
i guess bringing it back to thing look i agree it's a stretch but it's not it's not an episode
breaking thing and i enjoyed the fight scene because he did struggle he got beaten up a bit
he survived and he needed help yeah it's definitely not the biggest problem but like i guess to to
put a cap on it like if your reason for something happening is because because they are the
protagonist like you're gonna have to do better than that like there needs to be in yeah there
needs to be i agree um and the at the end world justification is his armor that the armor protected
and could the armor truly protect me real life probably not but space armor it's one thing but
i get it yeah so i do get that much um and i would like to point out in chat someone said mcu rags
think about hawkeye and black widow and what they somehow survive yeah those are issues that's a
problem yeah yeah that's a problem so again this is when we cover videos in efap the whole what
about ism when we talk about oh yeah well then something else you have to have a problem with
something else i probably do right so to say that of all the things that i'm saying and then
bring up hawkeye and black widow and what they survive is like yeah those can those can both be
problems we're talking about this though also i'm not people like why aren't i talking it's like i
mean there's nothing for me to add the argument was being had i didn't need to add anything i was
happy to listen like don't worry i'm not dead sometimes i'm just like efap chat i listen
is all rags literally the stupid human being on earth what have i said that's stupid
i guess legit like to know what have you said that's smart rags
yeah i guess the thing is right the whole ludo narrative dissonance when we talk about video
games the whole idea of when you play uncharted and you can take down 100 dudes but in a cut
scene two guys have guns on you and you just surrender it's like it's one of those things
where you just have to go well it's a video game but i think i think you can apply i think
video games yeah i don't think video games in the same way no i don't either because
they have to be interactive and if the interactive and if the challenging part of it is you have to
fight 100 dude but then you have some games where the main character is totally vulnerable and then
it's a different thing but yeah then the gameplay is generally based around that but if we didn't
have that in video games you would have to be as good as a navy seal to actually play call of duty
in a way exactly which is just not a feasible thing to do for you know these games for being
interactive so i hope that explains it but uh yeah yeah i'm sorry yes i guess episode two i enjoyed
it yeah uh it's one of the better ones i'd say it's certainly one of the better ones and it's
funny someone else in chat pointed out uh you guys are ignoring the larger issue here how does this
creature exist at this size with no foliage in a desert planet like yeah i did i think i mentioned
the only excuse they've got is it's an alien thing who knows how it lives so like okay it's called a
mud horn it eats mud all right and you can you know get nutrients all right okay and that's its
food and it supports it larger life forms somebody had a big question i have why the hell does the
egg have fur yeah that's yeah that's that's going coming out i mean unless there's anything
significant for episode two we've gotta push on yeah i want people to be aware
yeah i want people to be aware the issues in four compared to one two or three are staggering we
really need to get there yeah we thought we'd blow through these fucking hell i guess because
this is the thing i think a lot of the things in that you know especially early episodes and
maybe even some of the other ones can be defended or aren't as big and when put in
i guess comparison weight to the really bad stuff i generally find that the good stuff
outweighs it overall and it's still mostly good um it's fun it's enjoyable um not to excuse the
bad when it's there that's what i've said all from the beginning and some of the bad can get really
bad but like i think that the first three episodes especially with the level of discussion we were
able to go into means i i think the decent amount when it is good is i you can the bad
parts are not nearly as bad and easily i've looked at it yeah so is there anything else for episode
two i don't know um uh did did we have a problem with them being able to fix the ship because i
was willing to buy it they fixed it very quickly yeah i think it's really quick it was a montage
that and we don't know how long essentially well it all happened it all was at night time until
they were done and it was day so it's so if it was over the course i never yeah i didn't assume
it was a single yeah it's not it's not a big deal i just wanted anyone had an issue with it i'm fine
with it because fine sure quill's amazing i'm fine to buy that yeah uh so yeah i guess as a reference
to what we're talking about earlier just walking through the town with the bounty that everybody's
currently chasing and apparently will apparently betray each other for it's just a bit risky yeah
unless there is that stronger rule that once you're in the uocation where the guild is
no guns out it would certainly be harder for people to get away with it that close to guild hq
yep uh yeah but still i would really be on my toes either it's just to me it's a bit
risky because of that is an extremely valuable bounty and uh he doesn't even have the um the
cover on which i find i'm just like careful man well hang on hang on how do they well they would
only know it's a bounty if they actively using the fobs to track yeah but everybody could assume
that yeah you could assume most of the bounty hunters are trying to find it they all have
planet looking for them or this thing if fobs have the range limit no they're there because it walks
in the bar and they're all there but they all look at him yeah they know that that's the bounty
yeah carl explicitly says i gave him to all and he looks at everybody and says it out loud so
everybody can hear so yeah they would have the mobs there yeah right yeah and then at the end
when he gets uh when he captures it back the fobs reactivate and everybody starts going on yeah
good point i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm gonna directly someone in the chat keeps saying that rags and i
hate this show and are trying to make everybody hated and then we came into it wanting to hate it
and that that's our goal can you just do you not remember us defending the show we literally said
at the beginning that we really liked the first few episodes when we watched them and we were on
this show's side so just can you like i thought i made a psa no ascribing motivations don't do it
like why do you like we don't hate it and look for reasons we see the reasons and that's why
we hate it at least give us the benefit of the doubt that we're not trying to pull the wool over
you we went back to watch episodes one and two because we thought they were the good ones and
we wanted to affirm that but it just didn't happen like yeah like we rewatched all of this stuff i
mean they're still they're still the better ones i would call episode one and two good i wouldn't i
wouldn't i think we argue and i wouldn't but they're the best i think i'd call episode one
good just like yeah it's hittering in actual fact i would consider them really good when you
when i look at it broadly with the especially production values and stuff like that yeah
yeah pretty good we gotta keep going we gotta keep going yeah keep going keep going go go go go go
um the for being very very covert the troopers don't seem to mind walking outside of their
hidey hole um i don't know what to think of that myself just walk out and yeah they just
walk right out into the street with their armor they don't have anybody to check who's not wearing
armor it seems like a really dumb thing to do i don't know if that's risky or not i was just like
yeah unless unless there was something that they're worried about and then it's past and then they're
like but you'd still think if if you wanted to send someone to check they wouldn't be wearing
stormtrooper armor it's not explained but at the same time it doesn't really doesn't need to be
because it's so small like it's just okay they're out in the open well they're they're trying to
hide but they do something that actively contradict well okay not a big point where is it where is it
established that they are trying to hide apart from staying inside why are they trying to hide
aren't they yeah the galaxy hate the galaxy if we're gonna say they're at odds with the guild
well it's still an assumption i mean this if this is a included planet that they could then
and so that they were inside for some reason which isn't defined and then they're outside
for another reason so again it's like because like you could explain a reason as to that that
they are hiding for whatever reason but that's the same as me trying to make up a defense for
something that isn't explained in world that and so it goes both ways i guess i think it makes sense
in a more obvious contextual way that they would be trying to hide because this is this is different
to trying to like sort of look at expanded universe because this is like the main saga stuff
you know the idea that this is the the the empire's ended they were underground they're on some
different planet i guess you think that they would be a little bit more it's not too big a deal but
it's yeah it's not it's not like a big deal but i would be like uh i would be certainly hiding i
would be want to keep and be keeping a low profile like notice they don't even they don't even tell
for instance they don't even tell carl weathers that they are imperial for him to tell people
they discover it face to face when they go to the their imperial hq someone asked it's not an imperial
contract it's listed as a like a private client thing i thought carl knew they were imperials and
he just didn't tell mando he did yeah carl knew okay but he didn't tell people who were given
the contracts that they had to go there personally he wasn't just telling people but again it's a
little thing i think it's unusual not a big deal we can move on uh yeah he says that uh the reason
he'd given out the um the bounty to so many people was because he had to ensure its delivery
i just find that interesting it's like it's a bit risky because you're sending so many people who
are unaware of each other after it that um yeah i would agree with that one i would think you would
actually get a big group meeting this target by hiring the one best bounty hunter at a higher
chance and then by hiring additional people you're just sending people to get in his way
or do you have like a big group meeting a big group meeting where you're like hey guys so you're
all going for this bounty just you know keep an eye out for each other okay don't kill each other
all right and i gotta just check really quickly uh someone said i really hope they show the scene
where the uh thermals are clearly only his scope that is thermal no that is wrong season one
episode five in the dark i can give you a time yeah he did he did bring this up before i have
the fucking screen caps in our chat of it you're wrong if you think that only the scope has thermals
get over it we need the nail in the coffin post a screenshot 20 20 i i have they're in the chat
right now until i see it with my own right there it's right there it's 21 minutes
he sees the zoo back the zoo bat he doesn't even have his rifle with him in this scene
and he's not using the scope either um so stop it stop it he says that uh mandalorian is a rarer
than beskar itself which is interesting to sort of consider alongside the position of the mandalorians
in this place just just a casual thought uh in relation to how how secretive they need to be
and for me it added to the idea that mandalorians would be very protective of their own numbers one
of them in this and the third episode here even comments on how we used to be numerous now we're
hiding not that many of us you know so it would give the idea that they would really want to
protect their numbers because there's not many of them um okay oh yeah these are the things we
wrote before about uh the mandalorians themselves um it's weird that when he gets into a fight with
the mandalorian he keeps like stabbing at the armor like slashing his armor yeah he takes his
knife and slashes across the chest plate unusual maybe they weren't trying to kill each other maybe
they were just trying to spook each other like for instance hema when you spar you spar in protective
gear and landing a hit is uh is a victory and so they don't want to kill each other but showing
that i can actually still tag you means it's a one-up yeah i can't believe it yeah i'm okay that
makes sense because there's not many of them they probably don't actually want to kill each other he
clearly slashes with a knife and i'm gonna be honest shad it fucking bugs the shit out of me
how in video games and movies daggers are used to slash it bugs me but yeah this is just
yeah that makes a lot of sense to me that's fair enough um
um let me see what i have for episode three oh he doesn't lock his ship when he comes back again
what in episode three is when is it yeah because karl weathers gets onto it
he's on he's on board yeah um does karl know how to pick a lock i don't know i don't know but
you'd still think that you would assume that it would be secured and locked and it would and that
he just was able to hack in or break the door lock or something maybe but he specifically tells quill
to like initiate lockdown mode uh that's obviously an additional defense apart from just yeah but like
always do that always yeah always well hang on hang on no because you would only do that
if everyone's a hostile and therefore anyone approaching it was going to get shot what if
a kid approached it you wouldn't want that on well it would just lock down you couldn't get in well
well it possibly could have been we don't know and that yeah you want you want to lock it down
so no one did you have it did you have a droid that can hack in because droids can always open
oh he he he owns the ship he can unlock it yeah i'm talking about hang on karl when he
well i'm talking about an episode we might be talking about two different things um in episode
seven he specifically tells quill to get into the ship and like lock it up like super tight defensive
mode right like that should be the default thing well no because that i thought that the super
defensive mode implied that it's going to shoot anyone over approaches with what he has guns on
the ship well yeah but they only point forwards well uh yeah do they how's it going to shoot
someone how's that how's the ship going to shoot itself or like people well i mean it's funny right
like i was kind of when i when i when i heard full defensive mode i was kind of thinking and
this isn't shown so i have no validity in saying this is what would have happened right
is that so someone a gun turret would have popped up that rotated because spaceships seem to always
have hidden guns everywhere we see it on the millennium falcon where if we don't say it on the
ship a gun just pops down from the other thing and then points at people and fires out and stuff
like that yeah but that would be very useful to keep karl weathers off the ship later this episode
but he doesn't do it but that would have prevented him from sinking onto the ship if he had yeah i
know i know right but um mandalorian he uh and we're like how aware was he that that was going
to happen when he landed the ship that should be the default that's what i'm saying well no no when
no no no because if you have automatic fire on thing and these there are families and kids in
this um settlement what i don't know where this fires coming from well that's the thing i like
i like again i don't have any justification for it but i guess we'll have to fight it but
i would almost expect a hidden turret a hidden automatic turret that pops out of the ship
to fire on people it's a it's a really assumption that's based on nothing you're absolutely right
yeah except that we have seen it in star wars before on the millennium falcon
and someone said you need to be in the ship for full lockdown if that is the case then fair enough
and just just on my point we have seen it before though the millennium falcon does it and a gun
pops out and treats people and so yeah but i yeah but that's the millennium falcon we know it has
turrets i know it's a stretch but yeah so all right here's my question what would full lockdown do
over just having it locked i don't know um wait so you can see that he should have it locked then
yeah so that's my real point here is the point i'm trying to make is he should have it like
locked always like when you leave your ship you lock it so people can't just walk in
well that's i thought that would be the default and full lockdown would be something that obviously
has some measure of additional defense something else like maybe it only responds to a manual
i was just implied by what full lockdown meant
and we've never seen it and so because we're not shown what full lockdown is in what it's capable
of doing to repel people trying to get on board it or we can assume that it must be something
better than just having the ship locked sure i i can assume yeah like there's a difference but
i'm not ready to jump to the difference is a turret a hidden turret that pops up and shoots
well well i i kind of assume that just because that's what we've seen in star wars previously
but if not it obviously has to be something um yeah uh point is the point is here lock your doors
well well my point my point my counterpoint has always been getting that you i assume that it was
locked not people just walk on board like carl just walks on that's that's one instance and
he could have hacked on because droids can open yeah but that's still going to stuff that there's
no scene to support i know i know but it's also implied and shown many times that you can i don't
know if it's implied that he hacks to get in as far as i know he just walks up to it and opens it
yeah mando's not like one mando's not surprised that it's like left open i agree but i just can't
remember it being left in fact let me go to episode one here and see if he has to do something to
unlock someone just said please moderate what do you want me to do shut up both of you
like no they they've got something to talk about they can talk about it
yeah i just think it's locked lock your ship fuck use a padlock if you gotta
um we we move in or we not yeah all right um i think it's uh tad risky of him to advertise
his best garama as he does in the cantina i understand that it's uh obviously a deterrent
to try and shoot at him because his best garama but at the same time it's like wearing a golden
suit or something of a very valuable set piece and i'm just like careful yeah but but but would
he ever not wear it and i mean yeah he's kind of he's kind of different things you could probably
cover some of it with some cloak or poncho i don't know i i think part of the thing about
a whole mandalorian is presenting that i'm a mandalorian it's almost even part of their religion
that they i mean i'm willing to accept that i just if i was a friend of his i'd be like dude be
careful maybe i don't know you know yeah that would have been good to have a line or something
like that and then you're just like no this is my honor or something like that and shut up i'm
wearing it i was like oh okay then i mean it's funny i have something like that it yeah i have
something like that in my book where the main character he has a sword that belonged to his
well when he was you know like an emperor an evil emperor and it's imperious it's this famous
indestructible sword that everyone recognizes and is told like it's that there's actually a
conversation in the book saying you're not going to just walk around with that are you everyone's
going to recognize it and so you know yeah and there goes and this isn't this is just me thinking
right at what point does a culture's culture uh become so counterproductive and potentially
self-destructive that you ditch it or cultural ties are very like i i know that yeah but i'm just i'm
curious at what points of that culture's extinction if we're looking at history i'd say yeah but still
i mean at what point are you like yeah maybe this part you know because like jango fet he could take
off his helmet without a problem so there's problems and i'm not discounting any reason why
in lord if you're not jango wasn't a mandalorian he was just right oh i had no idea yeah he was not
he stole it he wasn't oh fair enough yeah all right fair enough then okay and like i said i'm
mostly okay with it it's just uh just something to think about it's like be careful it was just
it was just amusing of mine right because later on i agree i think it would be it would add more
consistency to what this is implied by having people trying to jump him just to steal the armor
because he is wearing gold essentially like more better yeah um it's i think it's really interesting
because you have the whole don't take your helmet off thing and you can't do this and can't do that
and you have to do this and only one person up at a time and they're clearly struggling and a lot of
people there's a lot of unrest clearly i'm just like i'm wondering at what point would it take for
mandalorians to be like yeah maybe we could adjust this maybe we could change this and everyone's
like oh islam is like okay i guess there are no examples to a culture changing to fit anything
yeah okay yeah i i get you like i know i know what happens i know some i know cultures are
obviously very deeply ingrained i acknowledge that just i'm using just a thought you know
in chat you got uh in uh in the old eu uh jango and boba were both mandalorians in the eu and then
soon after you got a jango wasn't even a mando in the eu this is like i guess like his chat
disagrees with it so somebody's wrong all right my resources when i did my video on mandalorian i
looked up the mandalorian armor to find out what it was made out of stuff and all listed several
times on wikipedia that jango and boba were not mandalorians yeah that's fine with me well here
if they aren't mandalorians that's fair enough if they are something did change which i'm i'm ready
to accept both i'm just bringing it up as a thought um i like it could have been retconned it could
have been that they were mandalorians at one point then it got retconning lore who would have
done i like that i got reminded of baby yoda by going to pull the lever
yes i like that the little knob on the yeah i do like that i think well since to me this episode
was almost made by the kind of um uh heroic arc of him saying no i'm gonna save this little guy's
life and and that that was great and and it was a portrayed that the moment of decision was
executed really well for me and uh and so i really like this episode as well um and even if it was
like for a small well it's not a small reason it's the whole you know theme of the episode
and and you're like yeah cool you know go save him um of all the things i could say
go ahead i mean i think your thing is probably gonna be more relevant i'm moving on
i was gonna say in that aspect i think it is like i and i think this is going back to what
fringy said earlier about having them it feels rushed uh as i said big in the beginning i'm
fine with the idea of him like becoming like a father figure or a savior to baby yoda i do feel
with only eight episodes and some of them having nothing to do with the plot or advancing it in
any way they kind of rushed that a bit yep um i really wish we got more development on that i
really wish we got more justification for why did he choose baby yoda when it turns out that
his actions there got all of the mandalurians killed and caused all this all these problems
a lot of them hang on are you sure because i thought i was thoroughly justified when you find
out that he was essentially the same as baby yoda he was uh yeah but nothing is i know what and he
has a soft spot to family yeah i thought that was i understand why he did but i think they
should have taken they should have taken more time building it up show us what he was like before
you know like don't you know it'd be worth it'll make it more interesting to have all this time
where he's really hardened and really cold like he was in the first half of like he was in episode
one when i really liked him and then uh and then build up to it and then over time we the
mystery unravels and it becomes more apparent why he made that decision because we hadn't seen any
of the flashbacks it would have been and it was the end of season one everybody would have been
like wow holy shit like this is not something they would have expected you know what i mean
that's like they all didn't die is like okay they'll survive the survivor says some may have escaped
well no no hang on hang on hang on there was no guarantee that they would have died at all he had
no indication that this action was going to cause the death so yeah he had to know that he actually
you have to move now and his assumption was that they were going to move and be fine
and then they just did so i know that that's a plot hole that they didn't move this is shifting
a problem from one person to another yeah yeah well it should because if the main character is
so crucial to the story you should you know figure out what is which you had to know this would put
him at odds with the guild which would really hurt the reputation of the mandalorians which
would specifically give the empire and the more reason to hunt mandalorians which i think is
interesting because while they used to it's clear that i forget his name hurt burner werner hertsog
hertzvog i forget the name he clearly had some level of connection he like he wanted to see the
mandalorians succeed in a way but that's gone now essentially because of the trail now hang on
because i was there's a lot of problems by doing this it does it does i was half expecting
that the other mandalorians were going to exile him or hunt him down for causing but that's that's
the thing from his perspective that could have been a legitimate outcome and it just goes that
it was even a greater risk and even more noble of him to risk so much to save this little guy's life
because he's risking his own um uh you know exile from his religion and people and then luckily for
him and i don't think this is a stretch that it was convenient today that the mandalorian showed
no we're loyal to our own we're going to protect you and then um as a result we need a move we'll
be fine and so it wasn't him like saying screw you to his own race because with the intention that
now you're gonna die no i like i think um it was perfectly justified for yeah and one of the
reasons why they should have spent more time is because he has to weigh the people who saved his
life who took him in who trained him his ray who raised him his family essentially over a creature
that he just met yeah like that could be a really i give why he did but i think they really needed
to push just the like why he weighed why he weighed one better than the other well for me
it was perfectly fine i i found the indecision conveyed subtly but powerfully with uh just his
body language and the call back to you know um uh the little knob thing and then it was fully
justified when we find out that he was basically the same um and it's just i feel like it's just
not potent enough i feel like all you needed to do was take longer with it and give them more and
it would have been more potent i feel you couldn't criticize as an objective fault this would be a
subjective thing and for me it was fine yeah i don't think it's objective but i definitely i think
they could have done it better though i do think yeah i think the alternative is better yeah i think
the alternative is better yeah i would have been happy to have maybe one or two or many scenes of
just him and baby yoda hanging out yeah exactly maybe like you you should just prolong the amount
of time like you're i'm not saying it wouldn't improve it but i think the fact that baby yoda
legitimately saved his life was enough for him to be justified in what he did oh yeah i'm just i'm
just saying a little more flesh is all i'm after um and so and like i get like stuff chat saying
like i get that he sees the foundling thing in yoda like i get it i i really get it we all get
the concept that we have a problem with and as like i say like mandos protect the realm is like
sure but to the point like at what point do you say no we're gonna this is gonna ruin everything
for everybody yeah it wasn't stop you know personally i'm not a fan of how they protected
him despite him like majorly breaking rules like what he did hang on he didn't hey guys
he didn't break mandalorian rules no i didn't say that in actual fact it seemed like he was
obeying the mandalorian creed because it's already established that mandalorians protect
younglings like wait you know families so surely that causes them problems a lot in the bounty
hunting business it probably does then um but like how often would bounties come up for babies so
i wouldn't say uh well i mean children right foundlings are children so how can the bounties
come up with children like probably in star wars context and i think you could even expand this to
the expanded universe i think it's the first one ever portrayed in star wars and so maybe there is
a rule that bounties are not done on children i don't know because this is 50 years old so it's
why did he have a way to get around the rule that this isn't a child it's 50 years old but natural
fact it is because there is species and my thing is that when does like will you go like is the life
of mando worth all of the stress and the trouble and the danger that comes along to everybody else
to protect him like i'm i'm curious how far they know it it's actually to protect baby yoda
and honestly it makes me like the mandalorian creed even more that they would risk the lives
of their entire clan to save one child that that's like that's awesome you guys are boss
yeah they're really boss yeah um my yeah the the if we were to reach a core issue it's just they
were really uh crazy to have not have left as soon as possible and i don't believe they would
have lost to an army of stormtroopers like even a hundred stormtroopers i feel like they would
have annihilated them yeah yeah i agree completely the the true criticism uh that it happens after
this is that they don't leave and then they get wiped out and they're so tough it's like what
what happened come on um what i'm gonna say next up is uh mando is just doing doing a little
detective work spying and um he manages to catch extract the necessary material and be done with
it hurry i can't guarantee your safety basically he catches a line that's explicit about yoda is is
gonna be killed soon like of all the things he could have heard which would be including and
not limited to toilet sounds or people just breathing just nothing remember uh molar do
you remember that episode of community where they're they're telling halloween stories and
then arbed says you know like oh i was thinking of that exactly he turns on the radio and they're
listening to music for a while it's like well they're not going to turn it on exactly where
the important update is and then i did i skipped the update it's like according to the update we
just heard but not just just heard yeah i love community and you're absolutely right i love that
and you're right like if i was say writing this i would have had to have had i would have written
he was there standing for a while you don't need it it's an easy fix he's already interested in
saving baby oda and he already knows that they're going to do something to him that's not good
like he doesn't need this motive he doesn't need to hear them say hey we're going to kill baby oda
and we're hey it's just like no just go get him i know we all know you want to get him we can see
people through walls i'm curious there's a lot of things i could have done to fix what is very
clearly at super contrivance well i don't i wouldn't say it's it's obviously contrivance i would
i would class something as super contrivance if it was crucial to the plot to progress forward
and this isn't this is just a thing yeah i guess it confirmed something he already did so yeah and
that's yeah i mean just the going by odds it is like super lucky yeah it's just unlikely that's all
um what else we got
let's see what do we got so when he's blasting through i mean there was the classic storm
trooper is missing and like even for me that's the storm trooper was so close that they still
missed and then of course it hits the armor as well but then he does act tough and take him out
other ones in like cool tough ways and so yeah there's bag overall there's times in this fight
i thought the fights were really tisme uh there are times where storm troopers clearly should
have shot him but they didn't and also he he get he opens a door and instantly gets shot luckily
right in the shoulder um almost said it's clearly so we don't feel bad when he kills all of them you
dubby he's like i don't think we would have really cared either way i don't think we would have really
cared either way still troopers yeah i didn't need any didn't need any extra
of motivation to be like oh not too bad but um i do think that and i don't i don't count this
against the show because you know because i can't count against the show because it wasn't something
that wasn't in there i thought could be better moving on but i i would have been really really
curious and i kind of wished and i was hoping and this i think it would have been better if they
spent time and gave us something about storm troopers that makes me go why are they still storm
troopers right like the empire has collapsed the empire is very very weak they are that these guys
clearly are not well supplied their armor isn't maintained and yet still here they are why are
they here why do they still wear the armor why didn't they chuck the armor away and go live a
normal life how come they're still going through this is it because they need money is it because
they have an ideological reason for it i think it could have been interesting to explore the mind
of what happens to storm troopers after the collapse of the empire and what they choose to
do i agree actually i find it interesting that storm troopers are still so royal after the
fall here buddy you know brainwashing or something uh uh yeah yeah exactly so he's like annihilating
everybody in this place and i found it really weird that he walks into a room as empty a door
opens and he sees two troopers approaching him he just chooses not to shoot them and like this
goes on for a little bit and then people turn up behind him and he's like okay guys you know i give
up and then he's going to use his new gadget that he got earlier but it just it just struck me as
all just like why wouldn't he just shoot them why didn't he just shoot them as soon as that there's
a lot of those in this episode we see it in later episodes and we highlight it where if you would
have just shot the person here it would have been done this happens a lot in later episodes where
they just he's got the drop on them too and i just don't get it yeah but i think it's a half
the middle ten second but we know why it's there they just wanted to like i know it's not excuse
it but it's no it's a show of the whistling birds look he used a cool thing oh i was referring to
yeah i was i was referring to an early part but yeah in that in those two he's like yeah um yeah
when enemies pop up on your screen you shoot them um
what else we got
so up to now i'm not seeing massive like episode breaking flaws there are flaws but they're
they're small and they don't ruin the enjoyment for it overall i find i mean i wouldn't call what
we've highlighted small but the thing is the things that we've got to highlight to come are
so enormous that i wouldn't really care to call these i wouldn't care to call these more not okay
i again i gotta address the chat so is it rag is complaining that the troopers are slower to shoot
than mando is silly okay that is not what i said that's not what you're saying clearly times when
storm troopers have him right in front of him and mando's not even facing him and they just don't
take the shot i am not complaining that troopers are slower than mando you extrapolating what i
said to that is that's a problem on you i do not expect storm troopers to be able to one-on-one beat
mando i'm like this is ridiculous this is the stuff we need to avoid carry on though i guess uh
it's kind of like it's interesting i feel a level of empathy for uh karl weathers being like i got
you this job you completed it you got loads of money i did too now you're like fucking it all
up for everybody and then he like has you know from karl weathers point of view it's like wow
and your your team of mandalorians kill like all of my bounty guild yeah i mean i mean think about
it from the perspective that mando completed the bounty got paid and made his fucking armor
and then he's like lol nah i'm gonna go hang on you're this this isn't a criticism against the
oh it's a criticism i agree he's fully justified in being ticked off but it doesn't mean that
that actually can be it can be turned into a criticism by the time you hit episode eight
where mando is like karl weathers did you kill the mandalorians he's like really pissed at him
and it's like motherfucker maybe he did what if he did what if he did you killed all of his men
after you betrayed him like i just it really frustrated me as well you got paid you accepted
the payment and then you betrayed him so yeah what if he did it's such a weird like moral grandstand
it's like you did that to me it honestly reminds me of batwoman that part you know there is a
distinction in that the um the bounty hunters are not on the same moral level as the mandalorians
because they're willing to you know kidnap children off to be executed by whoever's paying
them and so i mean even the fact that mandalorian betrays the bounty hunter guilds isn't a bad thing
is a bounty hunter comparable for the bad things that they do on behalf of their clients well they
should be if you're willing to do evil for just getting paid that is you're not doing it you're
just doing what they want you're you're facilitating it you're carrying okay yeah sure i mean i'm not
sure that i disagree it's just an interesting little uh and i and i also don't aren't morally
good people unless they have like a stance that they won't do you know like kidnap babies to be
bounty hunting is a neutral profession that can go either way based on i would agree there and
perhaps it's based on but anyone who is then willing to try and take the baby yoda bounty
and carry it through is by definition evil because yes i would say that that is definitely
a moral flaw um one thing i will say though i guess if we're talking about it even though
you could say that uh mando is not like directly in the most personal personal way responsible
for the deaths of the mandalorians i would expect him to have like it on his conscience in some way
i agree i think that like that should be a good point of um conflict that he might blame himself
somewhat he didn't know it would happen and he you know the mandalorian should have left
yeah it would be interesting for as we go on whenever he looks at baby yoda he sees
the faces of all the mandalorians who died because of stuff that he did and the results
that thing is it can easily be justified that the mandalorians could have a creed that you
do not mourn those that die in fulfilling the creed and so it could be something and so i
think there are a lot of ways to spin it i feel like they won't though that's the problem i feel
like they're not going to do this and uh someone said what they didn't shoot him the stormtroopers
didn't shoot him on spot when they surrounded him because he saw a baby on his arm i'm not referring
to that i'm referring to something that happened man where a stormtrooper but also right beneath
right behind him and just doesn't german man at this point doesn't even really give a shit at this
point if he gets killed remember german man doesn't care about baby yoda being alive anymore yeah true
but do the stormtroopers know that and like they're probably not privy to all the progress
of things and all they knew is that this is a valuable thing that this bounty hunter was told
to get and now he's trying to steal it and even if they knew that much i don't know and he does so
like he tells him what i'm holding is valuable um that might have been enough so yeah at at that
point i definitely believe why they wouldn't shoot him uh the ones in the back maybe not so much but
still i totally get it it's not a problem i don't have any problem with that scene um i i'm referring
to earlier on before he gets um before he gets uh baby yoda you know i i just checked the script
so after he says i order you to extract the necessary material and be done with it um he
follows up with saying he he has explicitly ordered us to bring it back alive um is that
morph gideon they're referring to the guy who fires at them with a tie fighter when they're holding
baby yoda uh i can't remember because man yeah because episode eight oh look they've got baby
yoda that i need and i'm just gonna pew pew shoot him oh but also the bounty hunter who was trying
to kill mando on episode five would have blown up the ship not to mention the ig the ig unit as well
apparently he was supposed to kill baby yoda but not gideon monster alive oh no it's falling apart
again i i lost track of the conversation sorry um i gotta use the loo anyway so i'll be right back
oh well so um the the winner Herzog says um extract what you need to be done with it um
he it says he wants uh the specimen alive or something like that uh referring to the the
higher up the guy in the tie fighter yet but we assume gideon yeah because he seems to answer to
gideon um which is interesting because the ig unit was told to to kill it definitively um and
obviously the bounty hunter in episode five would obviously if it destroyed mando's ship
baby yoda's gonna be floating around it's like oh maybe it could layer it could do the layer thing
um yeah and even when a Herzog said that you could do it dead or alive so i'm just confused
that means we're up to episode four now right i think so interesting it is it's very interesting
what moth wants at the end because he still wants yoda but then they've extracted what they needed
have they or what like maybe they have extracted what they needed but it's useful to have more so
having the original source oh the only other thing was it's surprising how many of them have the jet
pack and yet all of them aren't allowed to leave that place more than one at a time and he doesn't
have a jet pack and he's the one who's bounty hunting you know what i mean i i get apparently
you have to earn it i guess does she does she mention that i don't really know yeah there's
nothing like it it is strange for me there's only one out at a time uh because kind of be useful to
have more you guys are tough are they staying there to protect it but that didn't seem to work
out for them did it uh so i don't know um it's not explained um all right and yeah i'm happy to move
on to episode four yeah here we go here's the good stuff here we go we should wait for rags for
this one oh yeah he will he will want to be here i'm sure i think you know that this has
been an adventure just just putting it out there already five hours wow i don't oh gosh i'm not sure
i'm gonna be able to stay for the whole episodes but who else are you gonna have to try and defend
i suppose we will have to be very calm and just state our criticisms and then
people may make of them what they will as opposed to saying they are definitive flaws
uh drinker he um he didn't mind it he said it was flawed but overly overall he enjoyed it enough
so i don't know maybe it'll still be too late if you could get him on board well yeah the other
problem is that we do actually need to round it off eventually to make sure we can get i know
i'm not going to be able to come back for a while to finish it off that is all right
we will we will have you back the moment we can um so well we can still talk about some things
like i mean the fight at the end where he jumps behind the uh the ship and suddenly the ship that
can block all blaster bolts and it's just made out of trashy well i assume it must be made out of
durasteel like a durasteel is a common type of steel everything is made out of because
my goodness that stuff gives him full protection for a good while um and as to how much cover he
has i think he has a decent animal good that he was jumping into cover so that's all right
and then when he disintegrates a fuel bin that certainly would scare off and not like as like
and i wonder how how exceptional his pulse rifle is because people are surprised by it
yet they're also familiar with it because they're the good old lady in episode four she's like
give me the pulse rifle so she's familiar with that kind of thing yet we've never seen anything
like that in the styles before have we because that's a full-on disintegration gun yeah um i
assume they they drew that out of um beta saying to boba no disintegrations like does he i missed
that yeah he's because he said he wants the the bounties alive so i just assumed that that's where
they were like hey that means bounty hunters or mandalorians have disintegration capabilities
cool um you know now that i think of it while rags is away i should go to the toilet as well
or do you have to wait until it comes back so no no you'll go for it go for it so you'll bring
you i'll be back in a sec we're on the cusp of episode four finally yeah i know it's exciting
because this is when it just deteriorates completely did a puppy in his panty hole
uh i guess for for the reference for how it was when we were watching the show by episode four
i was still on the show side even though episode three was i got very frustrated before i felt
insulted i was like this is ridiculous four was um yeah and i wasn't the only one i think most
people seem to agree that four was really bad like four i've seen people saying four and five
are the weakest ones and then six is really good the bill beer one which will be interesting if we
can talk about it i don't really like six either no i don't either i mean four and five are the
low point i would say yeah um and then i guess it picks back up a bit in episode seven but then it
kind of falls back down again there's a color chat i don't even want to watch the shows the way that
bollard rags do have a base they like anything um are you yeah i guess you're new to the channel
yeah we do so we like stuff that makes sense a lot of the time um i like plenty of stuff that
doesn't make sense uh the way we try and figure this stuff out is that sometimes whether i like
a thing or not i have to acknowledge that there is a flaw within it and vice versa i might hate
something a lot but i have to recognize that it's particularly well made and that's what these
discussions are for to try and explore whether or not something was uh well made or not um yeah
for example uh pretty easy one is just lord of the rings i'm pretty sure all four of us here
think that lord of the rings is incredible and uh yep the writing is staggeringly strong um yep
but there's there's a lot of stuff it's well i mean a good example of the it's good but i don't
and this isn't for me because i love this movie but the the common example of this is good but
i don't like it is blade runner blade runner citizen kane whether or not you find it boring
people say it about 2001 people say it about uh yeah people said about a lot of really good
movies but they are good whether or not you like them right and then conversely venom i like venom
but it's bad it's really bad are we still on episode three well we we're about to go to episode
four we're onto episode four we're waiting for you but uh shanda decided to go to the toilet as well
so and then we were explaining to chat that uh no we don't in fact hate everything
oh yeah it's just that this problem this like these were the best episodes and they have a bunch
of little problems and all of these little problems adds up some of these i wouldn't call
little problems like for instance him not using thermal vision directly results into him almost
getting killed and he has to be saved by baby yoda like that's not a little thing like those
are the things that stack up and stack up and it only gets worse from here would you say that
ruins the episode though that the episode is still enjoyable yeah that kind of stuff it certainly
adds to the pile for me that's the kind of stuff that ruins it for me like or adds to ruining it
for me i can't unsee it like it's not stuff that i can't see um but sub like subjective i i just
can't not see that stuff yeah and i get that i mean well the thing is i definitely see why
people like this which is why people who do like it like i don't have a hatred for mandalorian as
a show i just think it's bad i don't like i have a hatred for the last jedi you know what i find
interesting yeah is that i think there are things that i have criticized and say riser skyligram jedi
and some of them were on like they were you could say are as small as some of the things i'm
defending in this one and the differences i think is that there was enough good in mandalorian to
help me just and i admit like the the thermal thing and that that's a legitimate problem and
i don't think there is a real valid critic defense for it except for making up something that he
didn't have it beforehand which is invalid because there's nothing saying it and so that that's
completely valid but i can ignore i am willing to ignore it i think that's the difference i
acknowledge it but i'm willing to ignore it because there's enough good for me to enjoy
when there's no good for me to enjoy or barely anything i'm not going to ignore anything because
it doesn't deserve it it's like no yeah yeah like there's there's plenty of bad stuff that we see
that we like um but like subjective stuff is that's the thing about subjectivity
and that's why we treat it differently from objectivity like it's not
subjectivity isn't consistent you know that's it's a weird kind of thing yeah i just can't
not see stuff like i do yeah my contention is that there is a decent amount of objectively
good things in the mandalorian to make it good overall generally not in every episode don't get
me wrong but i especially with the episodes we've covered so far to me i think those are
mostly good episodes there's problems but i mean i don't know i would say a lot of your defenses
were a lot of inferences um lots of extrapolations yeah i agree some were more based like there were
some that were actually based on what is implied in the story and some were completely more kind of
leaps i fully admit that but the ones that are based on things you can actually point towards
have more validity is different do you want to get some yeah absolutely so where to begin i suppose
at the beginning let's do this so uh i guess should we just establish the raiders at the beginning
they seem to be interested in stealing food and then leaving they don't they only they destroy a
droid for some reason but other than that they don't destroy much and the implication being that
they're doing that sort of um raiding like pillaging where they're like we will attack this
farming you know out outset place every once in a while take their food and it'll just be a common
source for us like that seems to be their goal right yeah it seems to be what it is it's definitely
a recurring thing yeah okay um
now there's some stuff contradiction later on based on that it's just it's just good to keep
it in mind uh it may not come up again i'm just making sure of my own sort of framing of this
whole thing um reproduction is never fully explained in the star wars universe it does
seem that they rely on farming moisture farming whatever that really means and and old school
here it seems to be shrimp yeah and so they don't have like replicators or advanced
you know um industrial scale farming but it's interesting about that they i and it's nearby
they are aware of a settlement that is like essentially like a small town it's like a step
up from theirs that i assume that they do trade with on occasion because these people do have
access to droids and floating barges and basic stuff like that um so first things first i guess
then because we've talked about fobs and stuff so i don't want to repeat any of that uh the way
mando happens to fly to this place is a way that he's spotted by the village people and uh they
assume just from him arriving that he'll be somebody that they can sort of get to help them
even though when you when they talk to him they say that his armor is what gave him away as being
someone that can help him to help them sorry i found that very strange it is odd i mean it would
have made sense that they could infer that's a gunship that has big guns on it so that might be
someone who could help us out could be someone who could kill us um but but you know it's something
it's something to go off yeah oh yeah that's right um like he's really weird with baby yoda in this
episode first of all he's like stay on the ship on your own okay lol bye and then baby yoda's
clearly gonna keep up with him he's like okay he just lets him walk along with him and they do the
movie magic thing where baby yoda just keeps managing to not only keep ahead of keep up with
mandalorian but somehow get ahead of him when he walks at like incredibly low speeds and then
they'll show like mando's clearly getting way further ahead of him and you might be like why
are you bringing this up and it's like well because uh baby yoda's clearly like vulnerable um and
mando doesn't seem to give a shit to the point where baby yoda could have been eaten by that cat
monster it's just like yeah man mando shows a very very inconsistent care for this thing in the most
basic and common sense kind of ways that go past oh you're you're not a parent you wouldn't understand
this goes into just common sense yeah i i agree sorry i actually agree with this but i'm just
doing the whole devil's advocate thing yeah go for it if there's any defense all right could it be
that mandalorians have a very basically tough love mentality if you're not going to be tough
enough to fight off a cat you're not going to be tough enough to live by the way so they have a
very much you have to handle things even when you're little starting out from the outset could
that be the answer i don't i mean they it would they would have to really specify that because
he doesn't seem to do anything in the show that would have him especially at this point think that
this is a this child needs to defend itself and be tough and be strong he doesn't i agree and and
he's not raising it as a uh as a foundling yet so yeah exactly i mean it could be an instinctual
thing it could be an instinctual thing even though it's not a foundling this is just how he
feels he gets a raise and he just you know got to handle yourself a bit even at that age so then why
would he keep putting him back on the ship then why would he keep putting him back in this thing
whenever he gets out well i mean he knows that it looks like uh maybe he can get off the ship
whenever he wants but from this episode he does think the ship would hold him in but
his following so fine come along with me anyway well in the coin to the lady and
and like the the somewhere but he he just says come with him i know there'll be actually
why he like does he like his company like we're not giving anything as to why it just seems to
be that he's incompetent that's the that seems to be all right i think that's an uncharitable
way of looking at it well i mean why he's definitely because think about this point baby
you're just following him it's like right where we're laying low you want to come sure come along
yeah but then he's only how it in episode five he just leaves him at moss i like he leaves him
at the spaceport there are points when it is like you should have been looking after him more but
like there are some insane things he knows like yeah in this instance right here um i don't think
it's incompetence it's just like you want to come along sure yeah but then afterwards he he tells
some woman like look after him and it's like yeah we're definitely getting to that you don't know
who she is also i want to um i don't know that it's wise to devil's advocate every single thing
that exists like i mean pick the bells i suppose because if i said like two plus two is four then
you go well what if numbers aren't real i just be like okay all right come on guys when you say
something that's indefensible i agree with you and i've done that multiple times already
i'm just saying i i do want to challenge things when i think there is a valid enough defense
that's worth putting towards it i know sometimes i haven't where i've gone too far the tough love
defense seems uh shaky at best and it's not mentioned at all yeah i agree um but yeah it is
weird to see how new planet he was walking through the forest he doesn't carry viviota with him he's
like just walk and with me it's weird to leave him so open when he's checking this planet to see
it's suitable to be here so for all he knows anyone could be here right now that's dangerous
in fact he ends up getting into a fist fight check it out very soon yeah okay and i agree with you
there that i think it's it's fine to have yoda come along but the fact that he is not protecting
or cautious of him very much at all is it like and i yeah you're right the tough love thing
doesn't really explain especially with yoda's value kind of thing and he doesn't know that there
might be others on the planet it's one thing for him to check the town out and then bring him in
later but just right off the bat display him so openly and irresponsibly very like oh i thought
this thing was every you like you gave up a lot for this kid like you should take care of him
um uh cara dune we know that she's in hiding and later on she has to cover up her uh her arm on
on navarro to avoid people detecting that she's used x rebel or whatever i'm just like why wouldn't
she always have that covered if she's in the lighting covers it up what may have to do with
going to favor that she's x rebel most of the time i don't know because she said that she's
on the run she's got life sentences uh to deal with if the republic ever found her
yeah she said she's done things that would put her in a life sentence we'd learn this
i think at the end of this episode no we did learn this uh is that the end of no it's it's
when he comes back for her the second time yeah that's when we learn about it but this is still
knowledge that the characters have at this it seems weird that shoot because it's you know
it's very advertised that's i guess that's where i'm going with um uh it's funny the the the waitress
offers to give mando broth and alcohol i assume it's like a flagging or something and i just like
does he have a bendy straw or like how does he i an ironic thing that will like you can pull down
from underneath the visor that he could just i mean i would i would if i was a mandler and i
legitimately you what like it's silly sure you would want a straw yeah i could just stick up my
helmet i think they just wouldn't show us that because it would just it would just it would be
hard to not take it you'd you'd be laughing at it just it's weird that she would offer him a drink
when he clearly said in the man that you know but it's odd but also he gives her he gives her money
and she doesn't tell him anything and well you're trying to yeah the trusted to look after baby
yoda's like damn dude that's insane careful there and she literally doesn't like yeah it's crazy
yeah he just walks off and and and you'd think that if he did that like he would be really
cross with her he'd go back in and say give me my money back or something but he's not yeah he just
kind of he just like oh well i guess i just wasted my money for nothing with this person
and they put the baby in jeopardy and oh well i guess yeah um and i know that fringy can attest
to this uh because he literally did it while watching the episode if i remember correctly
but when mando's chasing her footprints he takes a really long time to assume the first
thing would have happened which is she's above you he's like hmm where could she have gone like
yeah it's like she disappeared into thin air just like dude just look up like also he doesn't use his
wall of vision oh and also yeah when i'm not sure if you just said it i think i might have zoned out
but like when they point guns at each other's heads it's like you you know you can just shoot
her and she can't kill you right you've got this big best car steel helmet just blow her brains out
she can't kill you well there's a lot of issues with this fight uh this is the thing we might just
machine gun this episode because there's so much wrong with it she so to clarify first she punches a
wooden panel when he dodges a punch and she's like oh i've got the screenshot right now yet she punches
his helmet four times in this fight and she's fine yeah best car steel you can slam that thing
to the point where he gets like punted straight into the ground and it's just not gonna bother
because a lot of people were like she's wearing special gauntlets like nah hitting wood hurts her
but hitting stuff that's stronger than do or steal doesn't so like okay it's funny all they
needed to do was not show her getting hurt by hitting the wood they wouldn't do that too
because i can get how punching a wall that solid would hurt but like come on you're still punching
like i know that armor will have a little give on someone's face it looks like they're just panels
punching steel yeah it's like someone said that uh mando didn't want to kill her why not
for all he knows she's a bouncy hunter trying to get baby yoda i just think it's funny that she's
aiming her gun at his fucking best car steel yeah it's like they both pull it's like it's one of
those things where they both pull guns they're pointing at each other for some reason mando
isn't like oh she can't hurt me because she's aiming at my best car and he just kills her
right there and they have that pause so that then they could go then they could hear baby yoda next
to him he's like oh okay something that rags pointed out when we were watching this so there's
several points where he's grappling her which would be a fantastic time to activate the flamethrower
instead he chooses to activate it when he has like no way of aiming it at her and telegraphs
it usually so she can just stop it immediately yeah like this whole fight is relatively
frustrating and i know a lot of people really enjoyed it i just uh i don't get so many things
that happen in it it's just like the hell saying weren't you and someone say fringy weren't you
and rags literally earlier the sniper lady should have shot mando in the head to kill him but her
doing it wouldn't uh she has a blaster that we know just bounces right off of him yeah where
she had a giant i'm pretty sure you advocated yeah or um his head would possibly kill him
because of the amount of damage it does to the chest plate yes and also she's a lot closer now
so it's a much more powerful rifle yeah like the better thing we kept saying it was aimed for the
neck because there's no armor there at all yeah you did you did clarify neck as well so you can't
get us on this one give it up you're not gonna get us on this one this is not a good one at least
you're paying attention sort of um so it's sorry sorry i guess i shouldn't do it very
even it's gonna do it for fun what if he's attracted to her and wants to flirt oh yeah
she's definitely hot what if she's not even real what if she's snoke rags you don't know his type
okay i guess i don't i imagine he would be attracted to the strong type okay i'll take
i'll walk that a little bit back she's not ugly she's fine she looks fine she's hot nerdy i think
she's beautiful rags you're a racist the rebel scum um so look something i appreciated just to
point out even if it's a small thing i like that they decided to cast a you know a woman who's
got a bit of muscle on her to reflect her characters yes that helps so much yeah i prefer
that like about skinny chick beating everybody everything strong man up it's like it's believable
from a strength yeah yeah it's believable from a strength perspective but i still think especially
in this fight i think mando should have whooped her ass i would like to steal that's the thing
like he's got the we don't know how many men he has and how strong like it's implied that she's
she is physically stronger than mando orion we don't know why i would assume because they arm
wrestle later and it's she doesn't beat him yeah she one punches him to the ground after it she's
yeah which is just they arm wrestle and she can't beat him really maybe he could punch her to the
ground you don't know maybe i was just gonna say though so when the rhino is about to charge mando
baby yoda saves him when he's having the arm wrestle with her baby yoda quote unquote saves him
when they're having this fight and she even pulls a gun on him baby yoda just doesn't seem to fucking
care i'm saying the character like just like with rose tico right the actress is actually really
good looking but what they do with her in star wars is like how did you do this how did you
manage this what black magic wizardry is this um how did they get that back yeah the reason i
brought this up is because i actually quite like that baby yoda's always going to assume any harm
coming to mandalorian is a bad thing but then in this scene baby was just like yeah this is fine
i'm just like okay because baby yoda chokes her while they're arm wrestling i know yeah that was
like man odd it's inconsistent yet it was a funny scene as well i chuckled at him just
slapping nothing it was amusing yes it's a it's a fun scene in that sense i like baby yoda a lot
i like baby i really do um yeah uh i guess just moving moving quickly uh the planet isn't big
enough for the both of them apparently they're strange they have completely different reasons
to be hiding i have it listed here um uh let's see uh she says that one of them has to move on
mando doesn't even ask why he just says he can't stay here anymore even though he explicitly stated
that they would be safe here and lay low he just completely acquiesces to her demand instantly just
like that she's he says the planet is taken he doesn't haggle there's no pushback he just totally
cucks out also it's a big framing in a more critical way but i ultimately agree with you
it's like yeah it's not explained why i get or it doesn't make sense that he now needs
like some chick is like there's not enough room on this planet for the both of us it's like
what are you talking about then we're jumping into the he doesn't get startled by the two
guys or seem to care which yeah we've covered that we'll just move on um it's very strange
this scene the way it sort of runs and this happens again in episode five that we'll go over
just mando being convinced of something that he's clearly against of like so in this one he's like
no i'm not going to help you and then he's like wait you guys came from a village so you have
lodging right and then they're like yeah and then i'm just like well wait but you already have
lodging with your ship and you were planning on leaving to find a better place to like why would
that convince you to go with them i guess yeah why is why is living in a shack a deal breaker
or i guess i guess the opposite of a deal breaker a deal maker i suppose very strange especially
because at least on the ship he's like well if we need to leave we could just leave any time
we're right here on the spaceship we could relocate whenever we want also walk this up
really securely him doing random repairs to his ship is very lucky because if he had just left
they wouldn't have been able to get him in time
like because he was in the daytime and he said they have to leave and then it's nighttime
and he's just doing stuff and things and it's like oh man yes yeah just tightening because
obviously they establish it takes a day to get to mando ship from where they are obviously they
couldn't have them turn up at daytime for that to be true so they had to delay mando and they have
it just be that he's just he's just just fiddling with the ship it's like okay it's not that big of
a deal it's just uh uh obviously allowing things to happen and i just don't believe that you would
have gone with these people under the promise of somewhere to sleep there's like you could sleep
in your ship near mandalor and like you don't really care about it like there was one other
thing does it justify it more a little bit but not fully there was that there was in the middle of
nowhere specifically then he asked yeah but the ship could go to the middle of nowhere whenever
it chooses it that's true that's what i mean but there was what if lodging implies food and and
um resources to live off for an extended period of time so i he was there for several weeks
and so even if he can take your ship to the middle of nowhere he would need a some type of
food resource or whatever to help him use the ship to fly to those i know but if you're wanting
to lie low you would want to fly around as little as also does he have access like there's that
that bar or whatever it is restaurant is right next to him anyway yeah but that's not in the
middle of nowhere that's where people often obviously go to when they come to this planet
regularly but yeah but the village is close enough and people are aware of it and i thought
he said that the planet like he has to leave the planet yeah i know i'm not like i'm not saying it
fixes it i'm just saying it's not like there are some things that make it a little bit less bad i
guess um how did he how did he find cara like so quickly i guess he just had a tab on there or
something he used a fob
let's not open that counter where it was like this and i don't think he did it no i see i'm being
an idiot um yeah he just found there because plot
uh just catch up with with minutes
luckily we've covered some of these things ahead of time um let's see um that's that uh he will
pull okay we're not there yet uh i think we said the next thing i have is he is not at all startled
when he has approached that night in the woods add a shit oh yeah we've done that do not announce
themselves yeah uh he'll pull a gun on an unarmed safe yeah that's he's his his his concern levels
and reactions are extremely inconsistent and logical um let's see he i one thing i notice is
he says the payment isn't enough before he knows how much the payment is a little strange uh let's
see we did the lodging thing he has man he goes to her to tell mando to help sorry mando goes to
kara finds her to tell her to help him
so all right i guess he thinks that here's a quick he does that i mean it's lucky that she's
willing to work with him she seems very against him yo she said he had to move on to a new planet
but she's like oh yeah i'll do this job with you i'll go to the village with you she's got the
hot for him okay all right all right um that explains everything done uh so now they have
entered the village at this point in my notes um he's introduced to his quarters he spins
and nearly pulls his gun on a child in a village that just goes with the inconsistent alertness
from earlier um he lets baby yoda go out and play without a supervision and he acquiesces
when the village woman just when the village woman just says this is yeah so about the tough
love thing right he's very against the idea of baby yoda being out of the same room as him
until the the woman says it'll be fine and he's like oh okay it's a very strange moment because
i think it would have actually been better to just not have him freak out at all considering
the other stuff we've seen but at this point it's just like wait so you do want to have baby yoda
just like right next to you at all times yeah and it's like well no not really because she just says
nah lol it'll be fine and he's like oh okay like i don't his attitude towards baby yoda is very
confusing why doesn't he just say sure but he has to play in front or where i can see him i mean come
on out of all the locations he's been in this is probably one of the safest ones well then why does
he freak out he's like wait wait no don't do that i look i'm not saying it's justified as jumpy i'm
saying it's fine that he just lets baby yoda go like i said i just it would have found him much
more smooth if he had just said play in my line of sight that's all i've been like yeah okay um
yeah minor but you know there's a lot of what i would call death by a thousand cuts for episode
four for sure uh and then and then comes the taking the mask off in front of like three
meters away from several people and if he is seen by any of them he cannot put that mask back on
again all right all right so nerd nerd response the window is looking is he even looking through
a window what if the window is the top still cut off at his neck and so and so his head was still
blocks behind the like the top cell of the window oh i think i know what you mean but no like i can
know here's a picture here's a picture yeah we can see it yeah i can
that's one picture um also what if somebody just walked in as has just happened moments ago that
he freaked out about there's not a door that there's no door here foiled again lost you rags
and uh i'd heard a lot of people didn't like this like this isn't uh not well known from what i
understand um yeah i'm very weird that it would take his helmet off with start easily being seen
yeah uh because he makes such a big deal about it in the episode and even later after this
big deal about it but i'm like man we know you're not consistent about this it's a one-way mirror
yeah this is uh this don't work man frustrating to say the least then yeah there's like yeah go ahead
well i was just gonna say to kick on we got um for some reason the villagers didn't tell them
about the huge monster thing that was shooting at them and you might be like well they wanted
them to come and it's like yeah but that's like the whole thing they need them for so
it's just weird they highlight to the villagers it's like you didn't tell us about the enormous
monster beast atst because they were like what even is that they're like the thing you didn't
tell us about i just thought it was weird it was like because that's the whole reason they're there
right um they have this line right so the idea is uh when when understanding this difficulty the
first thing you might think of is like relocate the village right and then they're like no we
can't because it took generations to seed this ground um i'm not an expert in in farming or
fishing but i don't know that that's how that works they seem to just have pits for like
molar alien shrimp it's alien fish in order to have alien fishing you need to seed ground for
generations yep i'm glad you understand it's just it's you know what the line is for it's
designed to say no they have to win this ground because this ground has to be won and you're like
okay fine if you say so we would rather all get blowed up and killed and our children destroyed
then have to move like okay i guess one is more important than the other um unfortunately
mando says there is nothing on this planet that can damage the legs on the atst
that is i guess it's ship can't blatantly not true yeah yeah uh blatantly like what about
two logs tied to trees that would swing in on either side for some reason i suspect that works
i don't know why well you must yeah but to rig a trap like that you must be big and strong and
you can't be small and furry
the amount of time it took to train the village to be able to defend them while they
try and shoot the atst is the time they could have just gotten his ship i don't know why they
didn't i mean i'm just going to go in further and say the idea that they try and train these
is insane target practice is okay but why the sticks yeah they literally have shot like like
this is on two different i still think giving them just guns randomly is stupid i think they're
going to be more likely to kill themselves especially with how hazardly he hands them out
but they literally have kara training them with pointed sticks one of them even is holding the
pointed stick with a pointy i'm facing backwards like you're sending these people to their deaths
uh yeah it's it's all very very bizarre they they fight the the plan is to bottleneck the
enemies into coming from one direction kara and mando will take out the atst while the rest of
them need to keep the raiders away from those two and they're going to do that with guns and sticks
and it's staggering they make barriers and stuff oh the barriers are to bottleneck them
oh but also they won't actually like have you seen pictures of the barriers actually because
they they don't actually do that yeah they're nothing like they're they're so pathetic and
widely spaced apart and they cover so little of the village that knows like the idea that they
think this will work is laughable it is this plan this whole train the villagers make the barricades
it is nonsense basically fences with large holes in between they um yeah and they they they don't
account for the they account for the idea they're going to have to try and trick the atst into
falling over and killing itself but they don't account for what's going to happen up till that
point like what about all the times the atst is going to shoot at us up to that point they don't
account for that unlucky for them they don't really need to because it doesn't shoot at them
it shoots at the houses in the background i think two or three times it just it just doesn't there
was no guarantee it would even walk yeah and there's no guarantee it would even walk as close
as it did it could have just hung back at the tree line yeah there's no reason for it to come
in in fact it's pretty lucky than it did when kara is shooting at it it decides to try and get closer
to her to shoot here which is precisely the opposite of what it needs to do we're skipping
well hang on we're skipping way ahead oh we've been doing that whole stream we jump forward and
back because i was about well i was about to say that in the first in the opening the atst doesn't
even go to the village it doesn't even appear when it assaults the village okay there were shots from
it are you saying it from the tree line huh you're saying there was shots from it from the tree line
yeah it shot from the from the tree line it didn't even it didn't even come into view
yeah and they weren't even like oh it doesn't even oh the big thing yeah it doesn't even
come out like last time it didn't i have been made aware of a defense chad i was gonna ask you what
you think about this uh the atst shot the houses in the hopes to kill innocent hiding people
in order to demoralize the attacking defending team uh no i wouldn't say that's a good defense
because if there are people well actually it depends i guess it depends how i guess um how
much of a threat it considers all the people anything and honestly by not shooting at the
people who can shoot back you might feel safe in your atst but all your other buddies are getting
shot and so by not shooting at the people shooting back at you you're just giving more time for them
yeah i feel like you should prioritize your targets i think it'll demoralize someone more
to kill their allies in war than killing their families and you know what demoralize is somebody
properly if you kill them for real then they'd properly demoralize because they can't experience
moralizing but yeah this the i this is i i don't think we would get any resistance from especially
you shad on this plan because it's just so this is probably one of the it's tactically inept like
this is insane there's a lot of dumbness they describe this comes back to the idea that this
is mando's plan and hers like these are both veterans of either wars or trained in tactics
they forget he has a ship they forget how to effectively also like just to reply to someone
in chat they're saying complaining about the distance of the atst that's this is a valid one
okay it actually is like when you have a tank you don't want to put the tank in any level of
vulnerability you want it to hold back and to blast the target to hell from a safe position
i was gonna say where was this guy when we were talking about episode three of game of thrones
those trebuchets are you really complaining about the trebuchets come on yeah this is what this is
being consistent right because the placement of the atst you're like oh you're just nick
picking about where it stands it's like no no this is integral to the survival of our protagonists
in the village like this is a huge deal it is it is i think a good distinction between something
that's that's lessened or something that's like either a super controversy is if the entire plot
is hinging on this thing happening and and that's very much it is i like the the whole fit the atst
is destroyed by it being used in such a dumb way and moving forward when it could have hung back
and just blown them all to hell and i mean the fact that when um mando and is a cara dune or
whatever when they're sneaking in but they don't go for the atst first thing to either blow it up
or to steal it or any number of things it's like yeah there are problems a lot of problems in this
episode so i will say there are some things i was able to enjoy i mean i enjoyed the production
value still i enjoyed baby yoda and out of like even though the atst was used in a very poor way
i did find a silver lining that i was able to enjoy i enjoyed the fact they showed it being so
menacing and threatening because usually they were just throw away pieces of junk and i i just
found it refreshing that oh good at least they're showing it as a true threat and danger and it's
not just some comical oh no logs off i mean like well i don't know because they act like it is but
then one shot disables it well no they it's hard to get that shot off though she has to get really
no it's no it's no that doesn't make any sense though what do you mean like it's that like this
is a rifle that has a scope can kill things at long distance this thing is standing still with
two bright legend of zelda weak points right on the front of it and he just doesn't shoot it from
where he is yeah good point good point you could have aimed for that earlier and i think the that
any defense to say the angle was better getting close up is undermined by the fact that being
so close and you fire through one of those eyes you're just going to hit the canopy top of it
yeah and also you can it's not covered because we could see the red lights from the inside
and in all honesty like the red lights with those openings the thing that mando did to throw the
bomb through the eye slit to blow up the people on the inside he could have just been hanging up
on one of the trees and as soon as was yes there was nobody on the inside oh what it was what oh
well so there's still discussion on this yeah that's the thing so we have plenty of
war either or because that's the thing we have plenty of references for atst's with people in
them there are no people in this atst it's just red lights on the inside i just i've always
i always assumed there was you just didn't see him looking through those eyes so it's because
it's no that's no no they're not no there's no one there well we don't see anyone there
but the assumption is that someone would be because these things no that's what we can
you can see in there and those are where people sit in atst's is people are arguing to this day
of whether or not it's an ai atst or driven by like a really short push in return of the jedi yeah
so my point i don't think it matters because those eyes are openings that you can throw
bombs through to take out the entire cockpit and if mandal if the mandalorian was just on a tree
um waiting for it great you wouldn't know where it would walk underneath but if you could climb up
on top and throw a bomb through the window why not attach him to his leg honestly yeah well honestly
this is solving a problem that shouldn't exist because and this isn't even going into how does
one shot up into the top of it disable the whole thing it doesn't make any sense but also this is
why is the aid why didn't they because we haven't even gotten into the whole what was their plan
in the raider encampment why didn't they just find the atst and put sticky bomb on it and blow it up
yeah that's what i said before yeah yeah like this is all because all the grunts like those
they're nothing because we don't have to worry about them the thing is the atst so why they
start blowing stuff up and causing a commotion in the camp instead of all right we need to find
where the atst is let's just follow the tracks because i have like literal thermal imaging that
could find tracks that could off that wow that could come in handy so i could track down this
atst and blow it up but they don't if anything the atst surprises them and then decides not to blow
them away and then they run for it and it misses all of its shots and oh yeah misses them like seven
times frustrating and everyone's like red light's better for people at night he's like i i understand
but there's nobody inside we can see inside and there's nobody i mean i don't know about the
nobody inside if there was a very short man inside it maybe but like it's just weird the
whole thing's portrayed as if it is an ai i don't really understand um yeah there was like and they
could have made it work like if um the the atst was used to patrol their camp all the time so you
couldn't sneak into it to blow it up when it's not active that it's always used in defense so they
have to deal with it yeah but the way they executed this was very poor and someone brings
up a good point why the red lights if it's controlled by an ai that's the thing that's
why it doesn't make sense because again like we can look it's to make it look menacing yeah
that's right but we can see inside of it where people sit in an atst and there's nobody there
hang on could you do that in um last as return of the jedi i don't remember seeing people through
only when they looked up like i thought you you would naturally be looking through a view screen
or something when you're piloting those things and no they are for only the backup you do but
you open up those hatches so you can look through manually that's what the hatches are for for people
to look through manually for the two people sitting inside to look yeah but therefore that
would mean it's not necessary to you to look through them to pilot it there's nowhere else
for them to be that's where they sit so that's where you sit when you can see but you don't need
if you're sitting your head wouldn't be in line with the window but you stand up and then you
will throw it i'm sorry well no no that's that's what the windows are for to for people sitting
down to look in and see see i don't know like this isn't yeah you can look at through the return of
the jedi and then you could also look at all of the models and all of the supplementary materials
of where it is and there this is how it works which is why it's so confusing that there's no
one there and also and it and i will say it would have been better if there were people there
so that when kara jade or whatever shoots into there to hit the guy he like slumps over or maybe
he could have disintegrated him but maybe he slumps over if he gets hit and it hits a control
and the control steers it over and it trips the thing or something like that well yeah i've looked
up the cockpits and sitting down it's perfectly in line with those window openings and so the only
way you wouldn't see someone is if they're actually sitting in between those window
which would be a little bit weird well there are screens in between that would give you your field
of view and that's probably what you're supposed to look through normally and the hatches are
supposed to be almost like backups yeah i mean like we have that in real life on tanks and stuff
um there are oompa loompas inside the atst okay
well i mean that would be that would have made for more interesting episode oh my god this
planet is loompa land oh my god the lord expand and i know that we've we've jumped ahead just
just just we're getting all through lots of things um there's a quote where they say cut down trees
and build barricades that are strong enough that they can't be broken or he says they can't break
it an atst shot to any one of those three collected logs it's just gonna obliterate it
yeah um can i just say this is an aside but atst's and atat's i've always thought were retarded in
star wars because they have hovering things and having things on legs is just stupid yeah i will
say i'm wondering i i will agree that they seem stupid i'm wondering if there is some limitation
of hovering that we're not aware of that would make it a certain way i just don't know but it
does seem like that is indeed kind of dumb because we have the imperial or the uh the droid
federation tanks those hover but they also have the ones that have those weird wheels that spin
at an angle so i'm like man that's weird like it does seem that hovering would just be the best in
almost every scenario exactly yeah um i've never liked him matt mando unloaded like all of his gear
but he decided not to bring his ship like he he took the time to get all of his gear out in
the case of needing to arm the village i guess but instead of just being like you know i'll just
bring my ship it'll be faster to get there you guys can come with me and uh i'll have all my
stuff like and my ship will be in the field of view so i'll know that nobody's stealing it
or fucking with it it's just a weird thing to me someone saying weight is a problem hover tech can
be jammed well i guess and and or dare i say it the rise of skywalker they confirm that speeders
can be jammed yeah maybe that's yeah so they fly now they can fly now maybe there's a reason i'm not
sure but oh to get a height advantage that's actually a good point um yeah so and then go
through shields that's strange because like they have spaceships where entire starships can fly
through shields into the interior atmosphere of landing bays anyway this is getting off topic but
it felt weird that he was like risking his life baby yoda's life all of his gear and his ship
and just just everything um for what was i don't even think he gets paid from what i remember yeah
again this is season three mandalorian like like man what an altruistic thing for you to do buddy
you're gonna help them be free of this horrible menace when you've got really big issues for
yourself to be taken care of but okay that's his character i think uh at least we're supposed to
believe that i i do think the show is trying to say that he has got a heart of golden golden gold
that's he would he would help an old lady cross the road i think uh he's a nice man um
yeah so the size of the atst i'm not convinced that uh the puddle would have been able to
uh down it it's like enormous and um the the the thing is only so deep that kara is like
waist deep in water and i'm trying to get a shot of how big this atst is
yeah it's really really dumb that they think that such a tiny distance
for an all-terrain walker will get knocked over by that like that's insane for them to think that
it will do that so what you'd expect to happen with uh the drop being i want to say like a third
of its lower leg at most is that it would bend its other leg to compensate right and it would be okay
because that's how legs work i mean maybe i'm wrong maybe they're really poorly mechanized
tactics are like a like a heap of rolling logs that i can't balance on or something
uh
because this thing is big and also like one of the reasons that people trip a lot when all of a sudden
they take a step they don't expect is because their biology gets surprised
which doesn't apply to an atst um i guess so we can move to the the original like the initial
assaulting the area plan so you have two guys by a fire that seem to be like scout-ish and uh
kara and mando knock them both out at the same time cool with me then they spot seven dudes
around a fire and so their plan from what we can tell is that they're going to walk into the nearby
tent plant a bomb and then either bait people inside the tent or just wait for them to walk in
they seemingly wait for them to walk in fist fight them and once all of them have been alerted to
all of this they're going to hope to just jump out of the tent while it blows up and kills all
those guys that seems to be their plan no i'm i'm trying to i'm really getting my noggin jogging as
best as i can to try and come up what the hell they are thinking and doing yeah this is a huge
tally mark for how retarded those two characters are for this whole plan i cannot believe this is
what they went with i have several suggestions for uh better plans first of all being shoot the
seven dudes around the fire you both can do that well before they'll be able to defend themselves
but if you're really concerned about not being able to do it throw a bomb at them as soon as
it goes off start shooting anybody who didn't manage to get blown up by it like just put a
low counter on it whatever but um their plan is ridiculous yeah the whole like the obvious thing
that they should be doing is we have to disable the atst before it gets up and starts walking
around and blowing things up so that needs to be our priority first and foremost and what do you
know i have trackers that will find footprints and i can see in the dark and i have thermal vision
and i have all of these gadgets and knickknacks and doodads that will allow me to do this and
they just don't and all of this with the assumption that he doesn't just blow it up with his starship
you could have just flown over and shot him all to death uh i mean the atst could have fired back so
i mean the logic of like would he really risk his ship it's like he's risking his life
so yeah might as well also that ship takes a beating from that other starships in the
episode after this true also there's no way that atst can aim straight up yeah well it's not shown
i mean you know i i'm less concerned with that i'm more concerned with the idea that it's
could have gotten kara to bait it out and then they hide the ship a little bit further back
he launches it and the atst is there's lots of ways to do this try and lure it over to then
blow it up yeah a lot of this is indefensible like very bad um and a lot of stupid decisions
overall now as to how much i feel it should reflect on the character is this a dumb or smart
character is going to be determined about how consistent things are in every other episode um
and also he honestly sees into as well i guess because for instance especially with tv shows
i always expect there to be one or two episodes it's going to be pretty lousy because that's just
the run of the mill i've never seen one whole series where there hasn't been horrible episodes
with terrible writing um and so then i'm general because of that i'm generally reluctant to take
on board the actions of characters make in episodes that are just bad because someone bad
wrote them as to a reflection on the character as a whole and i guess my comparison would be like
there there obviously must be bad episodes in buffy speckled around there oh there's a lot of
them yeah ones where the characters make really dumb decisions but i would assume that because
everything else is so solid and they and especially if actions of characters are contradicting how
these characters usually perform because overall like with the only other previous episodes and i
admit like they haven't looked at the the later ones but there's really one indefensible stupid
thing has done and everything else was mostly defendable um well this isn't one stupid thing
that's the yeah it's a bad but it's a bad episode and this is a yeah this is a long series of
terrible decisions well well hang on because i would need to take every single decision on
one by one to an hour to discern if i feel it's really indefensible and i and we have found one
that i'm more than willing to admit that that was bad that's you know they give villagers sharpened
sticks to defend against an atst but that but this is very much the result of a stupid writer
and and then and so does this mean the character is stupid because of the stupid writer
well it would depend on the larger body of evidence well well at the moment i give you
your saying evidence indicates the character shouldn't be this dumb um i don't know the
episodes say this i would say and i i'm not convinced i'm certainly not convinced that
his norm is to do intelligent things well i'm yet to i'm yet to give my call on that at the moment i
feel he is not wholly incompetent which is like and so i'm willing to admit that he he is not
perfect and he certainly fails to make mistakes and makes wrong decisions but as to being
completely incompetent um in this episode there's a lot of problems but again for me
i can't really just say that this is the problem of the character but more so this is just someone
wrote so they got the wrong person to write this episode because it's bad
and but if it's consistent in the next episodes then i would i would have you know probably
agree with your hair and chat yes i know what his point is um his point so when we say stuff like
han solo is a deadbeat dad that's fucking just like disrespectful but the only reason we're
annoyed is because that's what they're saying it is yeah like it you know people can say like the
sequels aren't canon it's like the reason it annoys us so much is that it is canon uh this is canon
to mandalorian all of his decisions in this episode of canon he's an idiot in his episodes
yeah ryan johnson was just a bad director that's not really
like we um and as for buffy for example like uh the characters are usually pretty solid it would
always be contextual and i have to go through the episodes if we were to point something out about
it specifically but it's usually the plot and the world that suffer in the bad episodes and
in this one i haven't watched the whole thing yet but i'm fair i'm very confident there's at least
going to be one blatantly brain dead thing that the characters have done probably multiple times
but you'd say you don't have to with series especially have to take it as a whole and not
judge it by its weakest point if that makes sense i mean i would probably concede that they they
were being an idiot in that instance um i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to be like no it's a bad
episode we don't count it but what if it's like what if it's so brain dead stupid that honestly
it contradicts how the character is established uh in mo in the context of the rest of the series
um i would say it's the flaw and that we have to consider it in the totality of the character i
suppose yeah i can't i can't i can't ignore it as being bad when the whole thing is you know
that's consistent but for me i'll just say it was a bad episode and they got the bit wrong person to
write it um i mean it's certainly a bad episode but these are still things the characters do in
the universe and their actions they are they're taken into account within the world that they're
in can you recap this argument because i obviously missed a decent amount because i was dropping in
and out yeah you were all it is me the connection so the idea is the the episode itself is so awful
that we shouldn't really count it as an example of mando's character as opposed to just counting
that doesn't make that no i don't agree with that well yeah like i can see an example my
justification for it so i guess um i could see an example being when the writing is so outrageously
bad and inconsistent with well like if you had an episode where homa simpson just got a hatchet and
started chopping people up it would just be like okay so we're not going to treat this as real in
my head canon you know something well i can understand this is episode four it's it's so
early on that at this point yeah you're right like i said it needs to be taken in context
with everything else but if i was just to look at these four episodes this one would be the
outlier for me and i would want to clarify as well it's not like he made a bad tax decision
or he made a poor decision in terms of cooking something this is like his bread and butter
yeah this is this is like what he does this should be his this is his thing yeah so it's
interesting you're saying he he shouldn't have made it like these decisions by the context of
would you also say well either that previous episodes it's portrayed him to have more
intelligence than what is showing in this episode this doesn't this doesn't seem like it's a huge
betrayal of his character based on previous episodes though see i don't know like is
it feels like if i take the things that he did he's done in the past all the stupid stuff that
he's done in the past and now he's in this situation why would those stupid decisions not
carry over because well one of the things is that i only agree that one is legitimately stupid i
don't i don't see a mentality of evidence to indicate is incompetent up to this point um i
mean decent overall in the previous episodes the big issue is that this is canonical like this
happened i made the point because somebody made the point like does that mean we ignore luke it's
like you can't really can't really yeah but it's canon so like this is why it's really important
when you add stories that's the issue is any that's why we're all pissed at the sequel trilogy
is that it's canon yeah exactly it's canon it ruins it and in this instance every episode you
watch afterwards you're like man remember that really bad plan you came up with on the forest
planet remember that really stupid plan you came up with that was really stupid like you can't
really ignore it because it happened even though we i don't know we recognize that it was the false
of bad writing yeah i think it's in a balance as well because if you consider mandalorian to be
incompetent and then in season two he's really really competent it comes out better writing
to me that's obviously a reflection of bad writing and inconsistent writing and stuff
and what should be the norm and consider of this character did you just get better or um and so
it's a it's a more complex kind of uh i guess argument way of trying to determine the way
characters especially have different writers on a series because it annoys me when characters are
inconsistent and stuff and so yeah really really bad to the point where i like the defenses for
this have been like legit it isn't just that the mandalorian is stupid is that a lot like of this
is all stupid overall like i agree with that and the use of it and so this isn't them actively
saying we're going to make the mandalorian make some mistakes in this episode it's just someone
wrote this who was bad at writing okay and everything and for someone in chat like i we
never said that he is a tactical genius or should be this is not like this is a lame thing coming
with a better idea than him like it's yeah like this is insanely dumb like you don't have to be a
tactical genius to just be baffled at this plan like that's the thing don't like taking our
argument and turning it into the absurd vision yeah like don't you think he should be probably
better than average don't just think he should be least better than average well i guess my point
is that i feel like they have shown him better than average until this episode that's why this
is the outlier for me at the moment i would say it's an outlier to me in that it's like incredibly
stupid compared to his other decisions yeah so like in a in scale but when you for instance like
in what the methorm he didn't use his thermal vision here he doesn't use it like it's the same
mistake just in different circumstances where the stakes he's forgetting that he has things that
he used for some reason yeah he forgets his thermal stuff he forgets his foot he never makes
decisions about what he should pull from his armory you know to to use for the best like in
the right circumstances yeah i would would have liked to have seen him use a couple of different
weapons and stuff but he's you know he uses his grappling hook cleverly and consistently and stuff
except when he tries to hang scene there are two points of uh sorry what except when he tries to
hang scene it all comes to that one also well yeah keep going um well oh nice little nice
comment here we want him to be better than average but we want him to be human and not a mary sue
um that is definitely our position 100 yeah we we want him to be if you don't think that
there is a huge grand canyons worth of space between being better than average and being
a mary sue i don't know what to tell you also we've always been okay with characters having
a specific trait that they're actually very good at that would be kind of refreshing to see actually
yeah it's when they're good at everything that it becomes a problem
yeah generally it's no problem if they're really good at one hyper specific thing
and look mandalorian he's tough he can take on multiple opponents is generally good with his uh
grappling hook and stuff and uh with the first three episodes that are again needs to be
contextualized with everything else but uh yeah i think is perfectly fine at the moment except
this episode but that the thing is the quote for me is that everything is dumb um and so um yeah
i think i mentioned it before but it's just is the atst just like doesn't shoot at them for ages
and then chooses to shoot their houses it's just bizarre like i was just like oh my god this whole
thing is over if it just nails mando like i'm not saying it should it's just that it doesn't shoot
at anyone so many people could be killed here and it's just like doo doo doo it's like looking
around like i don't know who should i kill it's like and she's like static ground because like
obviously the the light goes over some some people and so you'd think like oh no they've
definitely spotted us now and she's like no no no stay there like even if it's gonna shoot at you
you need to stay there but it just doesn't it's like people with sticks to just stay there die
don't know what's going on because the atst could have fired like so many more shots and it just
sort of doesn't yeah and i know there's someone in chat saying but how can you say it's dumb
plan they won after all i was like the reason they won come on it's just it's a it's bad writing to
fit it's it's something stupid to fix something stupid i shoot myself through my mouth it goes
through my head doesn't kill me and shoots the guy who's trying to kill me behind me and i'm like
hey yeah it's almost like i was playing against someone in a video game and they lagged and
disconnected for a moment so i killed them while they were afk i mean see i won right it must have
been better my plan must have been great right i mean i won after all but it's all consistently
stupid as well and so it's not it's like yeah they win in game of thrones if we remember
doesn't mean the plan was smart i mean it's all consistently stupid yeah yeah is that the outlier
well well the point that that's just why the example wasn't a perfect comparison because
technically they're all glitching and uh and so um just one being good and then taking advantage
of a dumb point anyway ara takes the rifle she drops into the water she shoots at it she doesn't
reload and takes a second shot huh and also out of anyone who should be risking um you know
running it would be mando it'll be mandalorian because it's got the armor and so another weird
choice yeah yeah i also i'm curious why she thinks getting closer to it would like you you
have a long-range rifle man like yeah i'm not trying to by the setup they needed it to walk in
the pond and and so by jumping forward and getting underneath their field of view to see her and fire
at her it needed to step forward no it would step backwards it would step backward in that scenario
and also it was shining its flashlight right at her like she was sitting lower than the ground
above her in the pond and so from the angle of the atst it needed to step forward to look okay
i guess in that case i'm a smarter pilot because knowing that the blasts from the atst are
essentially like grenade drops whenever it hits anything i would just back up aim in her position
if she's hiding behind a foot of soil she's still gonna feel this next shot yeah you're right it's
terrible power at bay but that i'm just funny yet that was the logic they were trying to pull off
and the atst does shoot at her and basically hits within like a foot of her and then
so when it's convenient to the plot soil can block you know cannon and if if you see if the
actual goal was well no because she had to get close to it in order to get under the flaps to
shoot inside it there's a shot that i'm showing right now that's just like nah you could have
done that from where mando was yeah yeah i mean again if you can see red that's looking inside of
yeah just shoot it man just shoot yeah which is what especially because it's standing still for
a long period of time yeah i i thought she was only shooting at it to goad it to get it to walk
forward to take her out or so she again fueled a fire seer of the ledge not that she was actually
gonna incapacitate it with a blast through the window because okay yeah man they they really
needed that roof is where the cpu was and she ruined the roof of the inside of it it took it out
someone says in chat wet dirt is very good at absorbing extra energy i wouldn't say grenade
explosive equivalent yeah atst is not gonna actually gonna and besides it's not like it
can only fire once like that thing's gonna fire again i'm gonna be i'm gonna be a little it's
strange that so mandalorian uh he shoots that rifle at the exposed back side of a sand crawler
and it does nothing but the same shot to the roof of a atst disables the whole thing it makes it
drunk that's the weird thing yeah it like goes whoa it's like what's happening well if there was
a pilot in there and there was an explosion they could have been stunned concussed or whatever
there wasn't a pilot in there though oh yeah wow yeah there's the question it is obviously people
are still talking about it could be a pilot in there but you're right it's a stretch i mean like
yeah and even if there was a pilot and it hits the top you're like oh okay well no no if there
was a pilot in there though those rounds seem fairly concussive and explosive and that could
really disorient someone if they're inside i know it doesn't do anything to the um
the back of the sand crawler yeah because it doesn't penetrate any armor she literally shot
inside and the explosion went off inside the cockpit and so if there was anyone in there
that would really ring their head around i reckon so that one i can and especially because i'm
willing to believe it could bounce off the wall and actually hit the dude who's in there assuming
there was one which i don't really there's just there's i don't know why they did it the way they
did it like it really gives me the impression it's an ai which is just odd i i if i had to gamble i
would say it's an ai as well but that seems really strange because the the um the atst is
like painted up and it's it's a little bit of disrepair like it's kind of dirty which makes
sense that they can't maintain it as you know up to super standard but you have an ai piloting in
it and not just guys sitting up there it seems odd but also i would like to uh make you aware
of this this this little bit shattered in relation to the fobs and and mando being maybe not but
maybe stupid let's just assume it does work in the way of proximity or whatever but once you're on
the planet it's not really the point i just want to get to um he says takara after they've killed
this atst and made some done some stuff he says weirds travel uh where's gonna travel fast you
might want to cycle the charts and move on implying that it may not be safe for her here anymore now
that we're going to get out about this happening and yet he's happy for baby yoda to stay here
he's a very silly man yeah at this point yeah in this episode yes yeah but what about this
i think at least i i feel i was able to defend most of his action in the previous one bar two
there were two legitimate ones that i don't think has any excuse
but in this you know how in episode five he's going to do a lot of really stupid things too
though add six we'll go we'll go i mean the assumption was that episode one two and three
still had a lot of things in there and i think most of it is excusable except like i said too
so i guess we need to go through it with my analness um yeah i also think it's doubly weird that
because after the fight weeks have passed no one's still come yet including the empire hasn't
come well the single bounty hunter does come because that's weeks later also if you go to
like the i feel like all of these people look in and all these resources and especially the empire
don't buy that they haven't been here yet honestly though i mean they wouldn't be able to tell the
empire baby yoda's there just that oh one of the you know one of the gangs got blown up and there
was an atst and maybe yeah but the empire takes over novara the novara towns they would have access
to all if you guys are able to uh pull my stream up i really this one shot that they show i really
think there's no one in there like you get a nice big clear view like it's not a particular screenshot
just look at the way the the hell the the head part of it moves around it's like this i don't
think there's anybody in there um i don't know what we're looking at but i've got disney plus
up i can quickly oh uh so the timestamp is around 28 55 i've got on repeat right now which luckily
for me does not get me in copyright trouble hooray hooray and yeah i just i don't know looking at
it's like how could there be a guy in there and we still can't see them with that shot yeah i mean
we know we know what the interior of an atst where are they they're ducking down it's piloted by
by ewoks they got sick of people shit and they took those atst's and they went to their own planet
the atst mercenaries we're going to buy themselves out from the ones that they
they kept from return of the jedi um play creation said they forgot to add pilots because
it's cgi that's possible that i doubt it that's like legit like would be like that actually might
be the reason um they could easily we just watch it you know a couple years later and suddenly
there's yeah on the extended editions when they come out and the blu rays and everything there's
all of a sudden pilots there and i can actually believe that um so yeah the last thing i have uh
on my list unless you want to continue to develop well i was just gonna say because i think i know
what you're gonna say and my one i think is right before it um pretty crazy that uh both mando and
baby yoda were like a split second away from dying there uh with the sniper yep like yeah
lucky cara did did cara yeah did cara hit up like just to bait him saving from you know someone
jumping off screen it's yeah i hate that crap very close if he had pulled that and they show
him pulling the trigger almost it's like woof yeah man he's like whoa cara cut it closer next time
all right and it's and i assume what you're gonna say rags was just like how did cara know
she just okay i guess she just did i was talking about how the widow wanted him to stay
and tells him to pack up his gear in the normal life and he like almost lets him take off his
helmet and he doesn't know why yeah he legit considers it and almost does i remember when
i was first watching this episode and i was like please don't take the helm off please please
oh thank god it's way too close i was like damn he almost was like yeah sure
yeah abandon his entire life just to stay in this swamp
oh yeah that's cool he's very consistent with his uh
accelerated years in this character development yeah like that's like that's something if it
happened at the end of season two season three i'd be like maybe maybe after all that he's done
he's ready to just this would be the end of the show honestly if we were at this point
yeah like he's done four episodes in yeah like man like a couple days of past or something like
chill and then the only other thing i've got before the end for this episode for me was
going to be that it's just lucky that nobody fucked with his ship while he'd been gone for weeks
question mark i guess there were no jawas yep lucky no jawas on this planet all right
it was on lockdown mode guys yes locked down that most definitely pops up and shoots at people
when they get close that's the thing that's that's it someone made the get out of my swamp
joke because as soon as i said swamp i'm like oh yeah like shrek yeah what are you doing you have
um anything else no that was my last note for this episode uh what a travesty dump dumpster fire
and uh i guess i'll show this yeah so let's go from one dumpster fire to the next oh wait i was
going to say that that photo i've just put up as well so that's um why we assumed you'd see the
pilots like how would you not have seen one or two of the pilots yeah definitely yeah especially
because what's doubly weird too is that this is an ai uh allegedly but it is using a flashlight
to look for kara i don't know man episode four is a fucking disaster if it is an ai usually
usually star wars never has ai piloted things so at the very most i'll have a droid pilot but not
an actual computer um i assume that if the droid can do it you can program it to move itself i
mean it's just it's it's the same thing it's like a tool assisted speed run essentially unless they
there is like an in canon you know thing that says no computer ai piloting stuff i don't know
yeah i because a rule might exist but i think it'd be more reasonable to have yeah yeah
absolutely an ai can do things it would be more convenient it's just more it's just an extension
of what auto we don't autopilot exists it's just an extension of that yeah it's just such a
consistent thing in star wars that droids are the ones piloting stuff except for uh in um in solo
when they uploaded the robot so yeah but she doesn't she can't pilot even when they uploaded
yeah no i won't no i know what you mean i think i agree with you like star wars has always had
it where it's like droids will do it not the computer itself yeah yeah but if this was a
real universe i would absolutely in reality about yeah yeah but in star wars not so much like even
in the first episode when you got droids you know driving the cars what about you know some of the
tanks in the droid army it looks like they were ai piloted um it's either way it's an odd way to
introduce this or to have this be in the show here of all places but yeah moving on to episode five
then episode five is horrible yes so five uh from what i have gathered is the the public people's
most hated episode i remember a lot of people saying this one felt like a cartoon in terms of
like yeah i don't care about that argument yeah no i don't care about it either because cartoons
can be amazing so but unless they're referring to because a lot of people use cartoon to mean
sorry he directed episode one too oh right i was gonna say like to give leeway though some
people can use cartoony to mean a lot of things not necessarily is the quality of a cartoon
yeah i mean cartoony is a style cartoon is a style not a line of logic but we know what you
generally mean when you say that so it's so good in the hood we open up with a space battle
uh space battle weird obvious things first of all it's just like why doesn't he hyperdrive
is it is it damaged or does he i well all we you know if i was to argue this myself i'll be like
maybe doesn't have enough fuel maybe hyperdrive's not working maybe it's just like they don't really
account for it but all right i mean it would have been so easy to solve with a simple one line is
like well damn or like no no fuel and yeah and so it's one of those just open the episode with
the engine damaged no but they need a battle they can still do that with the engine yeah they can
do that with them yeah yeah just show the engine obviously before his engine is shot uh i was curious
why he wouldn't have hyperdrive to get out of the way of this guy but yeah uh not i will say
that one's very defensible with a lot of reasons unfortunately then not nothing is given just yeah
just wouldn't need a throwaway line there's a lot of reasons why hyperdrive might not work and it
would have been cool to have accounted for it um but i am moving on first notice the guy who's
chasing him he says hand over baby yoda but then keep lasting the ship man be careful dude you're
shooting a laser blaster could have been really funny to blow it up and he goes out in a space
suit and looks for baby yoda baby yoda mary poppins itself to his ship yes uh also why i guess uh
bringing it in cold or bringing it in warm is like a thing bounty hunters say not because he
says that's my line it's like is it that guy just said it yeah it doesn't seem like it's like a
unique line i thought it was really cool that that was his line but it's like i guess a lot of
bounty hunters say that okay yeah it's not a it doesn't seem like a very
like i've had a lot of people would have thought of that and use it in any event um he this episode
also confirms that the the ship in one blast he can destroy spaceships so it would have obviously
destroyed the atst with plenty of damage a powerful cannon which will be relevant in the
next episode in terms of the firepower on his ship you might even say it's quite a dangerous
ship wouldn't your ex maybe an attack ship that ship might you refer to it as an attack ship
i might i would say that that ship if that thing was flying at me with those big fuck off cannons
in the front in a place where this particular tractor beam thing was activated not attractive
trace a track of whatever oh yeah we'll get to that oh shit this thing's coming right at me
anyway um i have so amando's ship is damaged he's close by to tatooine um i'm fine with him
being around tatooine uh but at the same time i just kind of wish it wasn't tatooine that's all
yeah it's like it just seems like we know tatooine and the kind of people who are on tatooine and
where he goes having baby yoda with that tracker fob that he knows is active like man what a place
to go hang on hang on we are assuming that everything on tatooine is the same as when
return of the jedi was around i mean a job of the hut was killed and no this is assuming like
there's a lot of how many yeah this is a couple years after return of the jedi right it's like two
years after return of the jedi i thought it was seven i remember someone saying it was seven
yeah still not yeah still not still not very long um moss isley's not gonna no longer become
a hive of scum and villainy like right um it just doesn't it's just dangerous like yeah like it he
just he goes there and i understand it's probably out of necessity but man you gotta go in there
you gotta be really what baffles me is that he seems to forget that baby yoda's a thing
like he walks off his ship tells her to repair it without droids and then goes and finds a job
and it's like dude there's a baby on board i know and what we there is a motherly like character
right there who ends up being able to take care thank goodness and he and he could have asked her
before you know i just yeah we should have made a lot more sense yeah and she's willing to do it
incapable of doing it and they just needed to do that earlier than later but they don't that's just
okay and uh call back to the first episode i still think is an issue he won't let pit droids fix his
ship he will make deals at once immediately with assassin droids yeah i agree that's an inconsistency
um i wouldn't say it makes him incompetent but i'd say this is definitely an inconsistency
i'd say the choice with baby yoda makes me competent out of necessity yes i would what
he did the whole not mentioning baby yoda and letting it walk around willy nilly was
in extreme incompetence on his part especially in moss isley dude in moss isley yeah like um
anywhere really well yeah i was gonna say that's why i said especially just makes it doubly so he
just leaves the ship door open doesn't tell the mechanic about it and so it's obvious like at least
with children he's very incompetent with um but honestly even as a bounty hunter and this is such
a valuable you know target and everything the fact that is not treating baby yoda with more concern
and protection is very odd there i'll add that to my list i think that's definitely an issue with
mando yeah i like the reference to the droids from the prequels there i said it
yeah they're fine i mean that's where you'd expect a pit droid to be a nice little detail
that they're on tatooine as well you gotta throw some some pluses in yep you gotta you gotta be
perfect sense that they're there yes yeah um luck the next thing that i have is again he
doesn't mind talking about the droids i kind of think it's ridiculous that he has this
droid racism because uh it gets to like you can't have a droid that's designed to repair my ship
repair my ship because i don't trust droids question mark like what does he think they're
gonna do it's like how far does this go mando when someone makes him a piece of toast is he
like nah i don't trust toasters well i mean it depends how deep the bias goes and i totally get
it with ig units they're literal assassin units or whatever so like ah cool but this is like a
mechanic droid that's only point is to fix things and he's like nah don't trust it it's like uh
and all i'm saying is right this can be a part of his character i'm okay with it if i was in the
room with him i'd be like you are irrational as fuck that's all i have to say about that
but fine he has extreme droidism sometimes yes um so like again the next thing that happens he
goes up and chats with the droid at the bar he doesn't go to the per he doesn't go to the person
he hates droids a lot he doesn't go to the person he goes straight to the droid at the bar yeah try
to get info was like click all right i thought he hated droids a whole lot didn't trust him the
lady pulled a gun on baby yoda by the way what if she had just shot and killed
mad to have been like oh damn it just just ruins everything but yeah you shouldn't have
left him alone hell you know yeah yeah um someone said droids can be hacked or in like in episodes
uh five when they sabotage the ship it's like well why does he trust her if you're gonna talk
about how someone could be like ill as as a quill quill points out in the last episode a
droid is like not good or bad it's just according to whoever programmed it in the first place and
if they're her droids then surely he trusts her enough to fuck with the ship so surely
should trust the droids and if we're using the droids can be hacked thing what about the ig unit
we literally know it can be reprogrammed the show tells us that can happen yeah like people can just
decide to sabotage your ship i think they could have done a better job explaining to us his
position on droids it seems strange to really figure out exactly i think it definitely could
have been done with more consistency because i actually i really like it the idea that you have
a division to droids in general um not because like it kind of reminds me of um ripley and aliens
she like hates the androids but then she wasn't a nice little arc with uh bishop could have done
that with mando is it they kind of try it in this they kind of yeah they tried to pull that off
because he ends up liking the droid not wanting to die um all right um so i say um droid the droid
says the guild doesn't operate here anymore and he's immediately uh summoned over to by toro i
believe his name is who is trying to do and do a job to get in the guild it's kind of funny to
think about this is a job that the guild is okay with well what do you mean that they're okay with
the guild doesn't operate here i guess he means that there's no hq here maybe that's what it means
but the guild clear it's okay if a known job because it's okay if there's a known job here
and someone's here wanting to use that job to get in the guild but the guild doesn't operate here
no no i i think you're just reading too much into it there's no guild hq there but if you
have any target there you can go to the planet to grab it yeah that that's not that makes sense to
me i just find it funny that there's a guy who's got the perfect setup for mando to join him
sitting two meters away from him when he asks publicly i need work i don't think that one's a
fair christen either because assumedly he might have gone to many planets and found nothing and
then well i guess it is convenient that it's the one he got he broke down on that he finds work
well i i'm not even going to go that far right i would just say all i need is for like you could
be like has anybody got work here and then that's how he finds it as opposed to the one
guy to overhear their conversation is like oh i do it's like oh good um obviously it's
to facilitate the story moving moving moving i'm just like oh okay he stands out like a sore thumb
in his mandalorian armor all he needed to do was not even have the conversation have someone walk
up to him and say hey yeah mandalorian i think that would actually be better can you help me out
and that'll do it it's like okay um so moving on to toro when he has mando come over he's uh
so mando declines the job to bring in the super deadly galaxy known assassin which is a wise thing
that mando does to decline that it's a very very dangerous job but when toro says he's new and has
no experience he agrees to do the job yeah this this would be another moment of mando being
ridiculously stupid like this makes no sense if you say it's a suicide mission and he's like
if he feels sorry for the guy and wants to show him the ropes a bit and stuff and you know all
right i'll help you out because you knew wow where'd that come from what do you have didn't you just
say that he said no but then it's because he says um yeah he's not looking okay wait so let's clarify
right so the the stakes of the of the of this proposition are mando pretty experienced dude
is talking to guy neutral at this point who's claiming that he's got a bounty to capture assassin
lady mando is very strict in saying that i will not pursue this with you because she's incredibly
dangerous the guy says hey i'm completely inexperienced kind of heat yeah he says i'm
completely inexperienced so that changes madness by and if someone wanted to argue to me that it's
the fact that instead of getting half the pay he could get all of the pay mando's point isn't
about the pay it's about the danger yeah yes it's the fact that he specifically says i don't need
that kind of heat because i assume this is when he remembers that baby yoda's a thing and he doesn't
want that kind of attention that this high profile target brings see i think what they were trying to
pull off is that they're trying to show his compassion that he feels sorry for the young
guy is probably going to get killed if he tries it on his own and when he finds out his news like
all right i don't want to see you get killed i'll help you because ultimately undo's helmet
mando orien is a really good guy yeah but if he thinks that it's gonna kill him what good is it
to help you'll just both die why wouldn't he be like no don't do it he doesn't think it's a
suicide mission he thinks he'd be able to take it on but he he first did it i'm willing but then
i think he said that he wouldn't even do it did he well he declines of course he wouldn't do it yeah
mando said no he leaves he he walks away he's gone he says no i'm not looking for that kind
of heat is super dangerous yeah oh you don't have any experience let's do it oh let's do it yeah
yeah i'm i'm just reading the subtitles here he is fairly explicit that she's an elite one who's
used to taking out uh she made her name by killing yeah he's looking for work but he's not looking
for that kind of work okay okay all right well then apparently they just they just made the
mistake of making her too tough because he clearly is looking for work um yeah what's weird though
is that the fee that it takes to get his ship repaired is apparently the money that someone
carries around in their wallet well i mean we can bring that up later if you want because that's
the end we will bring out a player but it's have the money for the repair and so forth nope nope
he uh takes it from toro which toro didn't get it from any bounty that's just what he has on him
yeah he just pulled just toro's wallet that was enough
so yeah moving on um so he's got the uh the fob and mando's like give me it and then he breaks
it and says it's in his head how the hell does that work how that doesn't make sense you can't
memorize a fog it's it's it's a homing device you can't memorize a fob he didn't break the
fob he broke the puck he broke the fob he broke the fob he didn't have a pretty sure he didn't
oh no we did you know he did have a puck but he broke the fob i will double check just to make
sure but i am i can promise he broke the fob take a little look see oh yeah he says give me
the tracking fob and he holds out his hand yeah and then he breaks it but this makes no sense
you can't memorize a fob yeah he can't memorize a fob it's a tracker yeah also i have no idea why
he broke it i guess i guess because he assumed that mando could memorize the location it was
pointing because i guess he didn't want mando to take the fob and run yeah and go the bounty is
on his own i guess even though he wanted it to be that he's invaluable to the uh to the operation
which i kind of understand but how the hell do you memorize a fob that doesn't make sense yeah
if she moves you're fucked like this is insanely rude the whole thing
still goes along with the plan even after he breaks the fob in front of him
he still goes with the plan he still goes still goes with it and then again like this this episode
is pretty damn bad so so immediately after right you got the his knowledge that this guy is
desperate to get into the guild he's aware of the guild he got a job from the guild and he allows
him to see baby yoda while also being a mandalorian i can't help but assume which is confirmed later
actually but there's a story going around right now that reaches the port that he ends up in the
next episode and it reached the uh the assassin lady thereafter that there is a mandalorian
that did not uh well that took back his bounty that's a baby and he's on the run like why would
you let anyone see baby yoda why are you not saying hey lady keep him in the ship don't let
anyone see him and of all the people you would have to see him why a guy who's directly evolved
with the guild and again like this is just mando being an idiot hey guys um unfortunately i'm
gonna have to call it quits i got you that is absolutely all right yeah over six hours so oh my
god oh it's fucking 10 20 oh my goodness uh it's been heaps of fun and you know it was a good kind
of relaxing thing to do before i head off to surgery tomorrow so uh lots of fun guys appreciate
it uh sorry i can't stay for the whole thing though um well do you want to uh talk about
what's coming for your channel even though technically speaking you're talking about stuff
sort of yeah it's not much uh and everyone kind of already knows where i'm from so there's not
much much to say just when you press the update yeah yeah and so i appreciate you guys appreciate
the chats well yeah thank you for coming on and giving us quite the uh the conversation to have um
i i wish i wish mando learning in this body i know that was so good the thing is why i gotta go
now we like with all the episodes like i easily go for another six hours and i should really you
know spend some time with the family and things and get rid of that yeah absolutely man thanks
for hanging out for as long as you did thank and good luck with uh good good luck with the surgery
absolutely appreciate it man it'll be fine be the best patient you could be
we look forward to your speedy recovery movements all right yeah so the surgery itself is the easiest
part is the damn recovery is going to be miserable so anyhow i hope you're a good listener thanks
all right guys i'll catch you later yeah see you later bye bye
all right so i suppose should we just try and machine gun these out yeah we can machine gun
these out um the yeah we we got all these bullet points we can go through them i'll try to pay
attention for chat to get some potential counters to a lot of these so we can go through so there
is a delay on the stuff we say and when chat scrolls up so give it some time but if you think
you have legit counters to some of the stuff we say or just funny jokes then by all me and send
them through yeah we're in we're in efap after hours at this point we're into five a.m britain
time midnight almost for a lot of americans like if you're here with us tonight that means you're
in uh you're spooky after hours for efans you're a you're a real fan okay this is this is real
loving hours um we are at um him seeing a let's baby yoda be seen by toro apparently doesn't seem
to care if people see him yeah it's very weird uh next up i only got a small thing which is
the tuscan raid is magically appearing um yeah they're like nowhere to be seen they only magically
appear well i'll say they only magically appear to him who's inexperienced mandalorian knows they're
there but like looking at this shot i'm not sure where the hell they came from i guess they were
like just beyond the ridge um maybe um i but i did the show does point out that they only surprise
the the green guy they do not surprise mando he probably sees him walking up and is like gonna
talk with him so yeah i mean like i said it was only gonna be a it shows the skill gap between
behind him you know how they did it but yeah all right fine i'm willing to let that one go anyway
um i have the do-back with the writer it's a fucking obvious ass trap slash it's just man
just walk up to it i guess flip them right on over
yeah and uh mando relying on rookie man to defend him it was like okay yeah instead of saying hey
you go do it i know he has the armor but i just it just surprises me that he's not uh he seems
very trusting and so he's more trusting of humans than droids but i guess that's a part of his uh
his character you think you think a guy in his position would just be really resistant to trust
people a very hesitant to place that kind of trust in strangers he just met but i guess he's
just a really trusting guy you know those bounty hunters just just be trusting too wild and trusting
guys i was racist whatever you just did you don't get the reference i guess someone said why do you
think his thermals would detect the mud horn when there's the predator movie so a mud horn is really
really big and it's inside of a cave that's fairly close to you and when it comes to the predator
schwarzenegger specifically and the people who do that they are sapient and intelligent
beings who are specifically trying to hide from thermal vision yeah so i understand what you are
saying i don't think that they all apply i just i but i do understand what you're saying
rags has to love mandalorian now take shad spot i'll fucking do it i'm sure he gets hit by by
the second shot it seems to hit him in his bum and make loads of sparks i don't know what this
means for mandalorian maybe he has some kind of it means he's got that fucking ass like fire he
has a best car butt plug managed to hit that but uh yeah uh so they established that there is a
sniper lady she hits him in his armor twice and they decide that they'll wait till night for this
the weird part of this is that they want to wait till nightfall so they can flashbang her on the
way to getting to her which would work in daylight i don't really know why they need to wait for
nighttime because it's like a almost like an electrical because she's looking through a scope
it's like a thermal scope essentially um so they could have done that during the day i'm
not going to count it against him though because it is a it's it's a risk that he shouldn't take
to assume that the scope is electronic and not optical um so i'm fine with him waiting till night
in that regard but my issue is why are you not taking these speeders and fucking zooming all the
way around to get to the to get to the stone why are you remaining out here until nighttime you
need to be here with your speeders behind the dunes yeah i mean that's that's how it works in
star wars you can only go forward you know you can only go through the fight cloud you can only
go through the desert to go get space cancer yeah also i gotta say this is another part where using
his thermal vision would be very useful and he does not use it because he can see the do-back
with his thermal vision later in this episode from where she was sniping so he asks her where
is she instead of him even making the attempt to use his thermal vision to try and spot her on the
ridge so someone said i don't know who steve martin is yeah i do he's the guy because i did the the
two loving crazy guys reference and you didn't acknowledge it oh i don't think i've seen that um
god um it's it's really good it's probably it's really good it was back when the guy who had like
white hair for 60 years yeah he's panther yeah yeah steve martin and an acroid too he's just
like perpetually white hair but he he's one of those people who just never seemed to age because
he got white hair early i guess that was this is more real life tech being applied to star wars
no i'm using the rules what they show they specifically show him in her spot where he
can see using the thermals the do-back yeah to which you would immediately think well why
didn't he use it earlier when he's trying to find her yeah it's like he never he never is fully
aware of his arsenal and what he can use he always seems to be oblivious to what technology he has
it is very strange because like i'm like i play armor and all sorts of video games and
rarely am i like forgetting shit like thermal vision and like grenades and equipment that i
have you would think that if your life depended on it you would be really well attuned to your own
especially you got time to kill if you wait until the night you might as well
unite your uh thermal out um it was kind of weird that he concluded what make of sniper she has when
being as of being shot by it um yeah how could he possibly know i guess that's how that works
like i don't know i just thought it was like huh i i like i like the idea that in the real world
you shoot someone with a gun and they're like oh fuck 17 oh there's gotta be times where you have
tell certain things about certain guns i just didn't it's a it's a rifle blast like i don't really
only a something something mark be your modified rifle could make that shot is like that's fucking
bullshit this is star wars do not tell me that only one rifle can be a sniper rifle fuck off
now there could only be one in the universe where there are apparently 70 million inhabited
planets therefore countless numbers of people a different weapon someone in the chat makes a good
thing mando should have used the thermals only to have them not work because the assassin's clothing
has anti material that would have been nifty it would have made her more menacing he would have
been like i can't see her on the thermals maybe she's using such and such fill in the blank tech
it's like yeah that makes her more dangerous oh she's
but then they sneak anyway but that's the worthwhile thing to think about with a lot
of the flaws is there's always an opportunity to do something better with even with a little bit
extra work like a little extra you know explanation and someone said they shouldn't have given him
this much tech to begin with i agree because he doesn't use it anyway like if they would have
given him a bunch of tech and he actually used it in logical ways i would have loved to see him using
all his gadgets andres edgewood said he gets shot in his armor a lot so he's learned to know the
feeling well that's is that real that doesn't bode well for him he's been shot a lot so he
can tell what guns are being shot at like wow like i'm so shit i'm really good at being shit
i mean it would have just been easier if he's like shit he got hit and he's like hmm range
tries to figure out range or something and tries to figure out you know what i mean
it he needs to be so specific or if he just said he's like did you hear that sound that sounds like
it did a rifle yeah exactly as opposed to the way that that felt when i got hit makes me think that
it was this rifle oh he said it was a joke okay because for a second there i was just like jesus
yeah and i and i would have been thinking if i was directing i would have been like it would
have been so cool if in star wars that the blast hits him or the blast lands next to him and it's
quiet and then you hear the of the laser going off that would have been that nice little detail that
gun lover and me would have loved um let's see they let like a whole day pass while he's sleeping
in front of a guy he's just met with baby yoda so far away on its own i just it all seems so
like wow he's so casual about all of this like it just feels like he should be a little bit more
consumed but um he's very confident man it's nothing to do with his lack of i don't know
intelligence it's all to do with the fact that he knows what's up and he's in control
someone said he could see the heat of her gun that would be a nifty detail i'd have an issue with
that would be nifty um it would show that like he knows to look for it or he knows to really zoom
in or like she shot twice three times whatever so he's like he's looking for the hot bug there's
all these rooms for these cool ass little details that would give us an insight into
all the tricks he's learned all of the training he's processed all the stuff that he's processed
along the way but instead we get him doing stupid shit all the time when uh assassin lady is
like she knows the guy is behind her with a gun she like flips around throws it and it hits him
and his gun knocks it out of his hand which happens again in the next episode if you remember
yeah there are two consecutive episodes where someone comes up behind someone else with a gun
a a woman specifically and she turns around throws a knife and knocks the gun out of
their hand and i'm like oh oh i guess it didn't work i just watched the clip it doesn't knock it
out of his hand it knocks his hand really far away and before he can re-aim it she kicks it
out of him oh very strange um yeah no it's effectively the same thing no if someone throws
a knife at your your gun it's not gonna be like that's what i mean i don't understand why he
flips so far back it's like like he is like his gun was hit by a fucking punch he's like she threw
a knife at you mate calm down it's one of those like it's almost like throwing star-sized as well
it's not very big also like it's really weird that these people have all this incredible training
with throwing knives in the star wars galaxy yeah like that seems like a really specific skill
that like man all right like i get it she's an assassin but then the person in the next episode
she's good at throwing knives like man everyone knows how to throw knives in space they're not
even like space knives they're just sharp metals they glow blue uh in the next episode
she has blue knives ranks they glow blue that means they're space knives fucking space knives
with a heavy knife so let's see so what uh fennec has apparently got so fennec is the name
of the assassin by the way fennec has a rendezvous point to get to why does she stay here
yeah it's just a good good place to shoot people who are coming after i guess um also um he doesn't
take his because someone brings it up i don't want to forget the point for later someone says mando
probably has the gun and knows what equipment goes with it um don't know if if he had it why does he
use why does he not use it ever why is it never brought up it isn't shown on his uh gun rack
or anything like that also i think it's really strange that a bounty hunter who wants to have
very non-lethal options especially at range carries a disintegrating laser that leaves no body behind
comment if necessary um i was distracted by vibro blades apparently that's what's being
used as vibro blades many people have said it apparently it's a thing um well i just i and i
know this is take taking video games into account but i know in everything from dishonored to metal
gear solid to all these to splinter cell and all that stuff non-lethal takedowns at a distance are
extremely valuable but he has a disintegrator rifle which just seems like a bounty hunter who
would want to if he kills somebody it could be the mark that he has to kill he might need
confirmation of the kill so a disintegrator leaves no body and even earlier in the original trilogy
vader says no disintegrations to boba fit right because bodies need to be confirmed or brought in
i mean it's weird i'm not sure what how that works it's weird it doesn't bother it doesn't
bother me much i just think it's really weird um someone says utilizing throwing knives makes
some sense rags normal people do not have access to lightsabers in universe that is an interesting
therefore like i know i understand that it makes like logical sense that it's a thing that is done
but like like back to back we have two people who are so good with throwing knives they could spin
around and specifically throw the knife to hit guns out of people's hands it just seems like a
very specific skill fibro fibro blades can disable lightsabers oh uh so yeah they capture her um
yeah they capture her uh he shows up mando trust this guy enough that he's gonna go and retrieve
the do back and leave him with hair and a speeder that could easily take them both away
um a lot of trust to put into that guy and it's not rewarded because the guy decides that after
what he finds out from the girl that he can go and get the bounty by taking baby yoda hostage
and using it to try and kill mando he kills krennic can can whatever assassin it's not krennic
because that's rogue one um yeah he kills her and he doesn't sling her body on the back of
the speeder because you can do that uh to collect the bounty he just leaves the body because he
thinks that it's much more worth it to just set up this whole mando killing as opposed to you know
just putting her on the bike and potentially getting double the money yeah yeah it's it's
really strange and here's the thing it's really strange that rookie guy doesn't do it that's the
whole reason he's fucking out here in the first place no he's a rookie he gets tricked really he
thinks he's biting off more than he can chew ranks he thinks like yeah i could go for the
silver medal but i want to go for gold oh boy even though getting the silver medal he can also get
the gold medal too you're just two gold medals taking her body along doesn't contradict us but
also it's super super weird that mando doesn't take the body either yes specifically took this
job for the money i'm guessing he needs money he legitimately just doesn't bring the body that's
worth a lot of money also let's do some logistics shall we uh they at nightfall they go to attack
here and they go from where they were hiding around where the doobak was uh all the way to here
and then mando immediately goes back to get to the doobak right so the time it takes him to get
to the doobak and back to them it's day how long is it going to take him to get from that spot on
that creature all the way back to moss isley it'll be an immense amount of time we're talking
like a week something i don't know yeah someone say he's not after the money is like but it's
like he's basically turning down free money it's free prestige it's not even about the money yeah
this is free prestige and free money like the whole reason that um the whole reason like because
remember both the new guy he needs the body for the prestige the money that comes along with it
i mean he says he's not in for the money but like that's free money that comes along with it at this
point especially if he's planning to double cross mando how is he going to give it to repair the
guild actually how is he how is mando going to claim the money if he's on the bad side well
you could you could probably hire someone to do it i'm sure that there's yeah i'm sure that there's
not yeah there's a way there's a way right like oh yeah absolutely not every like the guild isn't
the be all in doll of bounty hunting in fact he could make a deal with a bounty hunter he could
be like pay me now and i'll give you this bounty for free well not for free obviously i mean
i don't lose anything by taking the body anyway and there's potentially very good rewards
yes that's the important thing also gonna say really really bugs me that they don't take her
amazing rifle and scoping helmet yeah might as well like i am and we have this problem in a
later episode but man you got this new green guy and he's learning the ropes he wants prestige
not only would that make an excellent trophy because you took it from this specific person
but that is an incredibly valuable useful tool that you will need like this rifle is probably
worth a lot of money he could use it in the future the fact that they just don't take things that are
super useful bugs the shit out of me
so that pushes us all the way up to when he actually gets back i guess um
and someone says yeah they mentioned guild rates he's like yeah because in the first episode he
says there's a lot of business but not everybody wants to pay guild rates there's plenty of places
to get bounties and turn-in bounties that don't involve the guild also there's no way that's the
only guild there's no way if there are 70 billion inhabited planets then there's more than one guild
yeah don't tell me that carl weathers runs this the the whole galaxy's guild from this one bar and
navarra yeah the one i can only pay you in flam from flanville or imperial credits that's all i
have he's like yeah there's no way there's there are many guilds there's a flat guild
the next one he was just when when he's like reveals himself to baddo he's like here i am
amanda's got like a clean shot of his head and he doesn't take it and it's like okay i guess he
thought it was too dangerous to try but he does later when it's essentially the same scenario
except not really like like the guy's still holding baby yoda he waits for a worse
yeah he waits for a worse time to shoot instead of that's the thing how you want to make mando
badass toro walks out of the ramp with her and baby yoda in his hand and remember mando's already
pointing his gun at him they're having a standoff he just fucking pops him in the head just right
there just not even doesn't even say he just poof a 2804 ish uh the guy's like taking aim
and he looks like he's gonna fire and i'm just curious what he what is he aiming for it looks
like he's aiming for mando's head he's gonna do fuck all why does everybody keep aiming in his
head it's like snap um it is very weird um i guess because we know that his best car armor will stop
blaster bolts he's seen him get hit twice but he's like i'm gonna hold you up with a blaster
like okay it's really lucky he didn't just execute baby yoda when he does this whole
flashbang plan yeah but um yeah uh looks like he wins he takes the money off his corpse
and it's enough to pay for for the repairs as we mentioned earlier like all right i'm like
yeah somebody's supposed to be covered mando doesn't shoot toro toro threatens to shoot mando
despite knowing his armor manage his toro after this traction i'll be standing still with his gun
already raised at him so mando gives her money taken from toro so the amount of money as i said
before with shad the amount of money that he needed to get in order to fix his ship and pay
her and be on his way it was the amount of money that apparently the guy carries around on his
wallet like he literally bends down takes the money out of the wallet and just doesn't
even count it he just dumps it into her hand i guess it was a sign of him saying this is all
i have hopefully it's enough and she was like okay i guess so okay um of course um let me see
a lot of there's like the the the majority criticism from like fans in general where the
this kid was invented for this episode and he was killed the assassin was invented for the episode
and was killed the ship was damaged for the episode and repaired and mando leaves and so it's like
inconsequential i mean nothing is accomplished well nothing's accomplished by this episode
no but gosh um gosh shows up right at the end well here's the thing that doesn't actually
that doesn't that's no that's of no significance i mean if anything it hurts because shouldn't you
then have access to like oh baby yoda scanner baby yoda where are you it doesn't solve anything
and there's still there there are other tracking fobs on her body of course other
other bounty hunters would show up and i guess a bounty hunter just gets a freebie so lucky him
i guess which is fine um but it's of no surprise that someone shows up to her body you would expect
that but this is an episode where nothing happens that's meaningful and one of our complaints is
that they breeze by a lot of stuff that really needed a lot more development and you have episodes
like this and the next episode where just stuff doesn't happen uh next episode is completely
filler yeah it's total and i'm fine with filler but the problem is that it's half the show is
rushing other yeah they're rushing other stuff that needs to be developed before i feel should
we uh what critical episode yeah i was just gonna say because like we're at seven hours um we need
you know at least try get some super chats done before we hit the the timer and theoretically
we forgot six seven and eight should we just uh do this again one shot back or i'm fine with that
because episode yeah like these i have a lot of notes for these we are not going we are not going
to get through i don't actually yeah i was gonna say well i didn't even realize this but apparently
half of my notes are episodes six seven and eight so yeah six seven yeah they are they are
a big chunk six is really i got a lot of filler in this show there is yeah which uh i think that
we'll have to save us for another for the next time we talk about it i guess but like filler isn't
inherently bad or anything um just when this when the plot's already being rushed as it is and half
of the episodes superfluous yeah stuff doesn't happen on the middle like no like stuff doesn't
happen that's meaningful in these specific episodes like he begins and ends with nothing having been
accomplished that they are filler episodes like the plot is not advanced in any way because you
think about the plot event episode one is when the plot starts so there's obviously a lot going on
episode two main advancement is maybe yoda knows the force but that's not that's that's sort of like
not important until later then episode three is obviously really a plot important episode four
totally a tangent it's a complete tangent lots of stuff happens but it's not directly
tethered to the baby yoda thing episode five happens and it's over and nothing's changed
episode six happens and there's over and like five and six are the real filler episodes yeah
and we're fine with filler as an idea we're fine but you have you only have eight episodes here
like you don't have a lot of time for filler there are only eight episodes here a fourth of the
episodes that are in there a lot and not even 40 minutes long a lot of them are less than 40 minutes
this is not a lot of content yeah this one is like this episode is let me go to the credits
the credits are at four minutes in at least now you're more than that five minutes in so yeah
this is like a 25 minute episode yeah again it's it's a problem because so much is really rushed
before this and after this that needs to be developed for it to be impactful but instead
we're fucking around in the desert and so i was going to say like uh hopefully we have provided
a lot of uh food for thought about mandalorian perhaps people won't take it that seriously and
then it seems more like nitpicks or it's exploring some stuff that maybe people weren't uh as aware
of who knows because we'll find out in the comments i have a feeling that this one is going
to be controversial but uh we will return i suppose once shad comes back we'll try and organize an
episode for the remaining three episodes and um i i was going to say i'll just uh i'm happy to
kick on my super chats unless there's anything else anyone wants to say not right now nah no um
i all of our complaints have been on a spectrum we've talked about stuff that even we admit is
nitpicky we're just bringing it up anyway all the way to really really impactful stuff that's
huge and everything in between not all of the criticisms criticisms we have should be placed on
the same scale and of the same importance um and i think a lot of the little stuff really adds up
into a big pile yeah yeah we still have six seven and eight which are bad um kind of piqued my
hope uh in the first half but then right at the end it just yeah completely plummeted
um and yeah um i don't think anyone can say it's a circle joke on ephra at least with this episode
for sure like this is just i don't understand how you can say that um yeah just like like i said
there will be a lot of motivation ascribing i hope uh people try and avoid it as best as possible
but um i know we're gonna get the whole you just don't like anything disney all right yeah well
we were on record of that not being true so yeah like we want it to be good like guys we want this
to be really good i want to be excited in the same way i'm excited for the next batwoman episode
like i want to be like oh sweet the next mandalorian's out i can't wait for this kick ass
amazing character to just be doing stuff and watching his exploits and seeing how the story
progresses like guys i want good shows to watch especially if they're star wars and we've had such
terrible star wars stuff yeah it'd be good to have some good star wars content and of course it's not
as bad as the sequel films it's not yeah and and it's not like maliciously bad and like i'd say
it's not insultingly bad it's not it's just incompetent we're made yeah it well
i'm competently written um and i can't and i'm not sure who that i guess it comes down on
john fabro because he wrote a lot of the episodes and here's the show run because i know that i saw
in the comment people like oh episode four bryce dallas how directed it's like how much blame can
you square on directors for television shows i don't think you can do a lot i think it's mainly
the writing team that you gotta hold accountable i'd happily say it's it's john fabro and bryce
dallas had on dave falloni to a degree right you guys just hate bed yeah someone said wait what
six seven and eight is bad then by definition you consider the entire season bad he's like
buddy where have you been i mean yeah what are we being right give it a three as we get into this
so i gave it a three man i gave it a four i think you're showing good as much as i wanted it to be
yeah and there are good parts yeah trust me guys like if you saw how i was reacting to the show
you would have seen the disappointment on my like the disappointment i had as it deteriorated was
really even after episode four i was like oh i still get better you know this is a bad episode
now but it could get better and by the time episode like how worried we were when we watched episode
three like we were worried and then four came out and we're like well well i think there was
a logic of like that one was one that was sort of fillery though like it could be ignored like
hopefully they kick it back up with the plot episodes the plot didn't come until seven it
was like uh yeah it's way too but you could have stretched out the material in this season
but a wire you could have done three or four seasons with this material it's funny because
people saying it like that's stupid just want it to you just want it to you know meander along
but it's you know you need that time that's valuable time
someone said tyco ytd ruined episode 10 hands down or whichever one he did that's episode eight
and yes he did terrible uh what do you mean like in that episode you like oh do you do you mean
because you like jojo rabbit and he made that so i love ragnarok and i love jojo rabbit yeah
yeah no i'm episode eight and it is terrible um he wrote directed episode eight yeah who's
john p addressing it says so you're arguing it's as bad as black batwoman rise of skywalker
last jedi and captive marvel your high on cracks like does eddie would actually think that uh no
like i look forward to batwoman because of how terrible it is yeah like no way yeah like zero
on the scale is tism infinity tisms right batwoman's like a one yeah and that's where
the star wars sequels are about one to one and a half range yeah yeah maybe it's worth
a while to set the scale here zero is yeah like crisis on it but it's one is i think that's going
to be the bottom of my scale i don't know there's anything worse than crisis if they break every
possible rule you could ever have yeah like it's incomprehensibly bad i couldn't believe
the plot is actual nonsense the cgi is terrible the writing's horrible it's just yeah there's
everything is bad about it whereas in mandalorian like at least production values and everything
is really good but and the act is good as well but whereas yeah with crisis that's gone um i
mean yeah but the scale i guess like there's also someone saying oh come on it's a six at least
it's like six things good you know six is good yeah i don't see how it shows a six
it's above average is the mandalorian above average from a writing standpoint absolutely no
no way no what was the questions right oh it's just because someone's
and they were basically saying really it's at least a six the mandalorian did rag say
wreck it ralph instead of ragnaroff did thor wreck it ralph okay i was about to be like that
i like to wreck it ralph though but did he do wreck it ralph no i want to watch thor wreck it ralph
i want to see thor rak thor rak Thor brick season well he was playing fortnite maybe he did
all right um that happened to everybody yeah it'll be a perpetually promised episode as in
the next time we do uh the second half of this but we'll get there eventually so it looks like
it'll be at least a month so crap in i guess but uh yeah you guys good for me to start reading out
these super shorts yeah fucking dude i will skip ones directed at shad and save them for the intro
to the next time he's on this show we'll save them all up for him uh this one just says oh my god
oh uh what's your biggest issues with pirates the caribbean at will's end
uh i can't even fucking remember which one that is i don't that's the third one
normally have to go upside down to enter exit pigatory i can't even remember it's been so long
since i've seen them davey jones locker i guess uh yeah i would have to rewatch it to be able to
tell you the last time i watched it was i want to say a year ago and for some reason i have forgotten
a lot of it like it wasn't even that long ago uh and why do people never
and why do people never mention elizabeth swan as a strong female character
yeah i suppose because of how bad the later pirate movies are that people kind of forget about it
um is there's probably far better examples most people don't remember will turner as a character
i guess the issue is that you can every time because we always default to ripley and uh
sarah connor because they're such great examples but people now think that there's insidious intent
when someone says those two they're like oh of course you would so now we need to find different
better example well they're really good examples people it's people have ascribed political
motivations behind citing those two now so in order to get around that you have to cite different
people yeah it's like we use those examples because they're so good yeah it's kind of funny
how good a lot of 80s movies are on the objectity scale like like diehard's really high up on there
uh terminated well terminator two is the 90s terminated one even predator
yeah sorry i'll distract from this it's all good um are any of you going to watch the sonic movie
yeah i figured we would say that for refab movies or at least some of us will i don't know i i was
gonna just go what are the reviews come out it's really good well the thing is um because of course
initially my reaction when they fixed the cdo was oh no instead of having a meme bad movie it's just
going to be bad but there's some clips coming out and it doesn't look too bad i mean i'm sure it's
probably just going to be like mediocre at best but i couldn't but yeah i i mean i will want to
see it but i'm not going to go to the cinema to see it and i'll be interested to see what the
reviews are like numbers see what see what everyone's saying should be amusing um and so
it begins also the wills of the wisps are shown in clone wars season six but you stopped watching
for that long time ago didn't you mauler i did stop yeah i will do my best one day to restart i
suppose um the mandalorian is some people's last hope in star wars can't wait to see you destroy it
i mean i think you know season two could be good yeah it could be good it won't be that good
and i you know i have there it is a new hope uh but you know it's not going to be the only one
they're going to be making more and more stuff hopefully one day they will strike gold
uh you guys like how gideon needs baby yoda alive so he sends a flamethrower trooper into
burn him alive yes it's so stupid and none of them choose to shoot the flamethrower dude
they all just allow themselves to be killed but then baby yoda's like nah i got this bro
such a weird moment because it like even goes to like slo-mo of everybody just reacting to him
in the room like even if they have guns in their hands you take it take it one by one you're like
ig11 would obviously insta kill this guy but just doesn't um mando despite being injured has access
to his pistol can see the guy coming he's just like well we're fucked cara dude he's got this gun
in his hands he's got two it's such a stupid moment that episode is really retarded and
it's unfortunate we couldn't get it to it tonight but honestly if if shad had stayed i don't sure
if we could have gotten through like all of it before the stream cap uh yeah it's it took
surprisingly long we we had a big old conversation about the fobs and i'm really curious if season
two is just going to shut that down in terms of what they actually do i wonder if it'll like
be definitive or not it'll be because i think they'll have some throwaway line oh the fobs expired
i just think they're avoiding explaining it on purpose because it's it's really tough to be
definitive about what they do well they work themselves into a corner yeah the fobs are just
it's a bad idea and i think they're yeah i agree i think they're a bad idea they shouldn't have
had the fobs um i'm just gonna read this one out uu pickle pea pickle pea me me pumperum
all right i just want to make sure you guys hear that so they try to make a magic aids i mean
school bus episode of star wars i mean i guess coming out of my bum would be a great climax
i don't know what to make of that yeah all right
hop on the magic school bus um i messed up a super chat last time i meant to say you should
efab one of his movies like you did with chris is as i'm referenced so um uh ref the movie maker
oh right uh yeah we could i mean i guess we watched parts of it it was offline but we were
looking over so doing that people get very upset when when you review a youtuber's movie because
that's like mean even though you know that's like yeah but it was shit you don't like chris tuckman's
work no i don't none of it wow um but yeah maybe i don't know do do do uh i got really drunk one
night with some friends while watching the mandalorian and called mando the matadorian
because he's played by pedro pascal nice um okay have you seen cinema wind's new joker video he
says every movie will fall apart when you look at it objectively then says lord the rings is full of
contrivances yes full sure depends uh you have to give me some references wait what do you mean full
uh yeah yeah i say that like dismissively like i don't buy it oh thank goodness like you have to
like you have to make your case on that one that it's full of contrivances um me and uh we i don't
think i don't know if ringy has i guess he could speak for himself but uh we have watched the
cinema wins and sins videos on joker they're both very well cinema sins video is very bad
makes those mistakes cinema wins is one quite a few good points in there quite a few that are like
wow you're reading into that and reaching and then this weird shit he goes on several rounds about
how the film is being made political uh which isn't necessarily untrue it's just like it feels
odd in his video because he's like look how good this movie is also it's not making people kill
each other you're like all right um yeah yeah and then he he can he like concludes like yeah
there are problems in the film but every film has problems when you look at it objectively and it's
really weird because he dismisses it but he's also conceding then that that's what objectively would
mean that you look at those floors he says there's a razor thin line between amazing movie and a
terrible movie and i'm like it's a weird weird weird one yeah the second half of his part two is
just just just fucking autism but um it's a really good candidate to have our very first episode
where we cover a cinema wins and sins video back to back yeah um well yeah because a lot of people
don't like cinema sins but they like cinema wins because he's positive which is positive
is fine being negative and inaccurate is well that's wrong this is it's funny right because
this is an opinion that a lot of people actually hold right where they're like you know you know
it's the same thing with like you're opinionated and that's something they'll say if you say
something negative but if you say something really positive you're not opinionated you're just
nice you know i mean like it's it's kind of the double standard of being nice and negative people
just dislike negativity well the tagline for his channel is like because loving things is more fun
than hating things or something like that okay i mean i like to bang movies yes uh are you guys
going to go through the leaked scripts slash how jj got screwed by disney in depth uh all i plan to
do is to read a like script summary of what uh colin trevor's script for episode nine was and that
would be uh next week uh also i gotta admit first few times you guys referenced shad i thought you
meant a different shad yes yes a lot of people have not i don't even know i don't think there's
another shad out there oh well there's one there may be one or two i don't know maybe uh i think
it's the only one we got him on lockdown speaks in sheev i i have waited a long time for this
by the way watched john wick two the other night the best part of it was ruby rose's lack of spoken
lines woman should only speak when spoken to but women should only speak when spoken to i was
thinking the reason she's fine in that is because she has she doesn't have any lines i was gonna say
she's downright uh neat in that film like she's fine but it's probably like if anything when we
watched the episodes 10 and 11 of batwoman which will be coming eventually people uh i really
couldn't help but notice her acting like i was just like oh oh it's so weird um oh by the way
you guys are gonna love the videos that we have episode 10 and 11 are real doozy yeah they got
infinite systems 5 and batwoman 10 11 uh coming to moolah eventually uh no problem exactly they are
wild i mean we hit the ground running ladies and gents oh we lost our shit within the first
like minute of the first batwoman episode it was so wonderful yeah because batwoman forgets
that momentum exists it's wonderful you'll see soon enough it's incredible yeah and that ends
with other than that it was shit um john wick two is shit i don't know what you mean uh john wick
three was definitely shit and metal commander will happily explain that to all of us in in
possibly like two weeks to a month's time very excited and then he's gonna make a john wick
two video uh so that will prove that it's bad that's gonna go real well i feel like both of
those are going to be controversial videos to start with well the john wick one is definitely
controversial there are a lot of people who still think john wick is really good yeah no john wick
one is really good but two and three yeah yeah one is great i love john yeah
there's a reason like again there's a reason why we hate the things we do
and you could all tie them back to pretty consistent you know criteria
oh hate the thing i thought you meant hate the things we do is in the actions we take rather
than hate the things that we hate oh no the hate the hate the things that we hate yeah
this one says try dark souls too if you've never played it don't listen to mauler he's
being a complainy boy it's a good game just level atp and have fun i mean i would recommend you
play it if you're a dark souls fanatic it's just that uh don't assume it's your fault
when the things go horribly wrong that's all that's good game design yes green man good
also ooh ooh rags how can the dragon demands get in touch with you he'd love to come on efap and
he believes in objective standards and has many long man documentaries uh best way would probably
be dm on twitter or atm on discord or email yeah these i don't know has he tried any of those yet
because um i usually catch a lot of what comes in i do miss stuff i um and a lot of stuff ends up
in spam i really hate that about email it sends a lot of useful things to spam but i mean it's
just trying to protect me so you know do do uh hey guys love your work for those of you that play it
how are you guys enjoying halo on pc and do you think an efap gaming on it could be in the future
halo on pc has been fun but i they need to add in halo one two and three i'm kind of sick of reach
i need to add everything yeah i want forge and the thing is it's not right it's not reach
his fault as a game it's that 343 like somehow fucked up a lot of stuff about it which is like
inexplicably incompetent the spawns the you the user interface is a mess yeah the changes to the
progression and unlocking the dmr starts no forge like there is just some baffling
apparently there's some bad audio issues going along like man they took a game that you didn't
have to do anything to and changed it and made it worse and it is so frustrating it's one of the
problems with 343 in general i seem to think that there were ideas that all look great you know it's
like i know that bungee had these ideas we can do it better and every single time it's it's worse
like just leave it alone just don't touch it and and yeah it's taken a little bit too long to
release the new games can you add them in and add in forge and you know theater mode and these other
features and oh yeah no theater mode so yeah i forgot is there split screen either is there
is there split screen support on our pc i do not know i'm gonna look that up because if the
man surely they know that nobody thinks about four and five as like first off let alone good
but definitely not nearly as good as you know one through reach nobody think everyone thinks
bungees is better and 343 is just making all these changes it's like no what do you stop stop
i'm like you're killing halo in some respect it must be weird to be a studio that has been
created solely to continue a series that you didn't make um that must be a weird position
of being where for the rest of your existence you're gonna be making the other game yeah like
when you haven't done well and you sort of got halo infinite and they're being weirdly quiet
for a game that's coming out at the end of the year i wonder if they're gonna talk about it soon
because they have to it's time is short the xbox series x is coming out like October or November
and we don't know anything about halo infinite we don't know what it plays like we don't know
what the story is but yeah um so yeah um if you if you think halo infinite will
i do not know why you would think that yeah you have no reason to really believe yeah i would be
curious why you would think that that thing that you think doing like a maybe halo reach
on legendary with four players on efap gaming is totally a possibility uh i'm i'm down for it it's
totally doable um so you know sure and it ended in also hyragas
ah hello first live efap got my viagra lube and tissues oh
did you hear the leaked audio of johnny depp and amberhood she confesses she hits him and tells
johnny to stop worrying about it hashtag johnny depp is innocent yes and she's under there's a
few tweets too well she's under more and more fire as time goes on um well did you guys listen
there was a video where it was an audio recording of something a session that they were having
yeah it it was bad it was really bad yeah he's um people are very sorry for not believing him
at this point i think which is uh interesting with all of the like believe women stuff that
goes on it's like maybe believe people sometimes depending on maybe maybe believe evidence yeah
um in efap too you used palpatine coming back in a hyperbolic joke and that was months before
the trailer for episode nine came out also high rex that make i feel like a lot of people would
have joked about that like oh yeah they'll bring palpatine back lol that's like oh oh they brought
palpatine back they ran with a joke okay i guess somebody lost a bet at lucasfilm i don't even know
uh react to snar wars three revenge of the sif please or edge of the sift
i'm guessing that's some kind of like parody video i don't know but uh
mola would you consider replacing wolf spot um yeah i guess uh i mean i'll also be replacing my
spot at the same time complete sense no one can have my spot permanent guest
i've heard brexit happened congrats on the uk regaining its independence also when fobs appeared
in mando i was like the writing will be shit here i mean you were correct i just think that uh
they didn't want to have to explain how he could possibly find a lot of targets that are galaxy
wide i guess but you still didn't necessarily need the fobs you could just he could have just
been good at his job yeah you could do you know you have montages and talking different people
and tracking different things and just give us some nice calls and effect for how he would have
been able to find certain things and i mean this is the thing i'm changing the entire season at
this point but i really would have been settled for you know the payoff of him killing the robot
and rescuing baby yoda that could have been the season finale for me
and um it would have been a really great mix of genres because bounty hunting would be like part
detective part heist part action you know these are all you know aspects of it that kind of mix
cowboy noir in space yeah but uh yeah we'll see what they do with cesante
hi rax cesante hello thanks for tuning me on the masquerade it was phenomenal love you massives
oh god you like it appeals are coming up february 18th for vick manana fair enough best of luck
hopefully justice is served also yeah if anyone feels like they're not having the thing read but
it had something to do with shad in it like i said i'm just i've stolen and kept all of them so far
we've got 11 already so they shall be savorude for him uh bid on one of the efaps about movie
circle jerk it's disheartening to know that the film community is so negative to discussion and
differing ideas anyway keep with the good guys keep with the good work guys sorry yeah they don't
like us we'll keep up the good guys they do not like us we're nope they don't like you movie
sickle jerk they uh oh they don't like us no no they spent eight hours talking about huff the
mandalorian god those why didn't they just say it with shit or good just say what you think
and don't substantiate it at all and then just yeah uh dp was trying to tell me how to feel dp
is now proudly sponsored by rage shadow legends they sort out the sponsorship themselves
i have fair enough and i hope that they keep the show going with all the money i hope that it keeps
them i don't i don't know anybody who isn't sponsored by rage legends at this point except
efap everybody in in this cold yeah oh well yeah uh that's kind of what i bet by efap i guess well
the the regulars of efap like jay hasn't been sponsored by them yet right not me yet
um yet oh that's for shad efap sponsors rage shadow legends rhino milk
um i would i would allow them to sponsor us if they had models in game that were a long man and
a doggo and a frog and all these kind of things loggy man no play doctor come on okay but alternate
skin big froggo all right uh if efap was a theme park what rides restaurants and stands would it have
which hosts would have what kinds of rides also high rags hello um i think i would just be a big
roller coaster the entire thing is one arm that's stretching all the way across the whole thing
um i don't know what else what else guys spooky an efap ride a spooky oh i know it's a haunted house
oh i know it's a haunted house where people jump out and say stupid things like there's no such thing
as objective all words only have one definition that's cool in my subjective opinion and then
you just scream in horror and then they come out rocking in like a the fetal position and rags
could have like a like a brothel or something could be his theme park ride oh wow we're going
we're going there huh yeah let's do it i mean i guess uh suggestion yeah i i'm just funny efap
efap world yes we need to lots of things to be kept at life but not long here are the lines yeah
yeah that's a good yeah efap world go fring boat with my favorite honky long boys toot
fring boat uh fring boat hi fellas have you seen that there's a new Star Wars comic revealed how
Maz Kanata got the lightsaber sent you a meme about it on twitter i have heard about this
so though that they have provided they've kicked the can down the road as as we would say um
apparently when the lightsaber in empire was falling down the into bespin a hooded figure caught it
no okay okay uh and they get it to baz i guess apparently more of the story will be revealed
across the comics but that's the biggest thing about it so far it's just like that's a very
unsatisfying answer i don't know what you need got it just like the kind of thing we want um
hey do you hey fellas have you seen that there's a new oh wait i read that already we got that one
oh boy bracing myself for this one like i also think season one is jankers frick especially the
finale how do you have zero knowledge of the force you survived the cloud wars but i know i
like it a lot more than regs yeah i think i have it brought up as well in a later episode
one of my points is people like there's no way the universe forgets about the jedi there's just
there's no way it'd be like even in the 1970s they're like so what's a nazi it's like this is
not gonna happen um yeah no i i completely agree with that as well the the clone wars would have
been majorly impactful to him and uh the clone wars ended with all of the jedi being killed
so wouldn't people be like wait what are the jedi and be like uh nothing uh hi rags hello
if you go outside but you shit with the door shut how do you get back inside the house
hmm oh that's uh that's a trade secret
okay and mules lee any thoughts on ford versus ferrari i need to watch it there's still a couple
oscar movies i need to see i'm behind on that i've been uh distracted with oh yeah i best so i have
completed one of two april fools videos i'm very happy with the state of one of them the other one
is being edited by mr das bullshit so that's on its way right now i am two-thirds of the way
through the next redraft of tfa part three which has been interesting i've had to cut lots of bits
and bobs to do with uh things that are no longer accurate uh definitively instead of like speculation
i speculated what um all of it could mean about kylo talking to vader's mask and we have all the
answers now so i can actually be definitive about it but brilliant answer oh yes i did it so uh i
should need like one or two more days to finish redrafting that recording it editing and sorting
it out and then once that one goes out my next plan is to actually go for joker so that is what
should be happening unless i'm i'm hoping 2020 will be the year where i catch up with all my
stuff because nothing new and shocking will come out but that never seems to be something i can
rely on unless black widow is really bad and retconce for war in a negative way yeah yeah
i like how these are things we have to think about now with movies what if this new movie
comes out and ruins the old one that's the thing like we love joker i am terrified for a sequel
i am too i know i'm terrified for obi-wan the series yeah like you know like it feels like
rolling a dice and and and well rolling the dice and you only get like the only good answer is
snake eyes as in the likelihood of getting it good so i'm like just don't roll it
i don't want to risk the other results i just don't want it um but fuck if we get those snake
eyes though even though that's always associated with a loss you know what i mean though double
six is whatever just oof i don't know yeah um uh when i get my book published in a few years
and become the next shakespeare i'll be sure to give you boys a shout out uh thank you i guess
also there is a no i go on well there's a thing that says uh scallogram versus shad sword fight
who'd win i'll have to save that for him got my pocket pussy and mini bullet from amazon today
gonna use it while watching this later tonight baby gonna be a lot of self-discovery for the
next few hours hashtag blessed fucking go for it gotta go with the flow at that point uh more
let's say my name in a welsh accent what is that michael and andreotti so it'd be like michael
andreotti probably uh nice and welsh any of you seen sargon's black panther video if so what did
you think i think i might have watched it but i can't remember it now if it came out i saw it but
it's been so long i can't quite recall it uh i thought it was real good in the context of the
framework you used to analyze it i honestly can't remember what what the video is um greetings you
massives my birthday was a few days ago long man my birthday wishes for you to sing the birthday
song in your best gedel voice can you do that for me also high rags i don't wanna sing fucking
birthday songs stupid gedel voice there's i'm just gonna say happy birthday and happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you that's probably what it would sound like
mark proud happy birthday to you happy birthday to you yeah it just seems weird pauses that don't make
any sense uh rags which morin natsu character would you uh let's say morin
sue character thank god it auto fills all right uh images what is oh these are animal people
um let's see i am gonna go with
i like that gray wolf there and the bear they are both
yeah i guess those would be that that's uh who i'm tied between
all right i i don't know their names or what they're from or anything about their personalities
going straight from the looks there there you go uh rags do you have any musical talent because
i want you to play me like a trombone oh my god we would play such sweet music um but
do you have any i do i've played uh i i haven't played it in a while but i
uh took piano lessons for like nine years and i was not to toot my own horn uh but i was rather
good i can't hear you you tune your own horn what are you saying oh my god you see that's the thing
i didn't actually take two horn lessons um but uh yeah played piano pretty good at it just grew out
i just not grew out of it i mean like i i grew to just not care about it anymore it just didn't
interest me is one of those things where parents make you do it and you don't want to do it so
yeah maybe you're good at it but your heart isn't in it and once they say you don't have to do it
anymore you're like i don't want to do it anymore i want to do something fun and interesting that
i care about hey rags yo you're gonna try getting world of darkness to sponsor efap or do they only
endorse dreams with nazis oh my goodness i hope that world of darkness if we can't get world of
darkness to officially sponsor in the claws of the eagle then yeah maybe efap is the next good uh
a good second place um banned for the discord from the discord for posting fem boy luke skywalker
hashtag no regrets fab boy luke skywalker all right uh that's a shad one efap have any of you
seen the edge thoughts the edge i don't recognize that i'm afraid the edge movie it is from 1996
this is the one with uh or 1997 or 1990 yeah 1997 i do not know what this is looks like it's uh
like a survival action kind of movie wait who's an anthony hopkins alec baldwin
yeah i don't know about this oh my god barth the bear is in it
he plays the bear well that makes the most sense it's on the cast list uh outside of the sequels
what is the least practical star wars ship slash vehicle
oh in this thing in theory the tlj bombers have some use was it outside of the sequels
oh okay outside of this most impractical space ships outside of star wars outside of the sequels
sorry that's how the sequels um i'd have to think um i'm just trying to think of ships and stuff
you can choose a ship or a vehicle um
um i feel like the um the yeah the the trade federation like tanks that have the two wheels
that spin at an angle um which ones are there ships i'll get you a second um images i will get
one for you here
if i can find a picture of it it's showing me all the ones from episode one which are actually
probably perfectly fine tanks in fact i don't have an issue with them at all what's with the death
star uh there is uh there are a couple people who criticize the 8080s
so it's this one here i'll put it in chat outside of the sequels that
oh hellfire yeah the hellfire droids i don't know what they were called but yeah those
seem super impractical
you just hate wheels rags is that it
yes but yeah 8080s i think they're very impractical they're very imposing sure but
you could be imposing and practical yeah they look cover their impractical um but generally
by the way one of the tanks that generally pops up are uh are these ones and i really like these
tanks these tanks are actually kind of cool i think they're really practical in the 80s
yeah the way that they're shaped kind of deflects a lot of shots they got all kinds of uh stuff in
the bottom uh the turret can swivel all around they got turrets on the side uh i think these
are kind of cool in fact i remember them from battlefront 2 yeah it was really a lot of battlefront
series you guys you guys know the uh the old like see-through uh books and stuff that had all of the
yeah all of yeah the for star wars those were insanely good i loved those books those cross
section books man you could just read those for ages that's awesome look at that those are so
great maybe if i can get some high res pics of these but i remember like everything from the
republic cruisers to the uh tanks and stuff these cross sections of how it works on the inside i'm
like man especially if you're a kid that's the thing the prequels they weren't good movies
but man if you were a kid especially your imagination would run wild with all the stuff
that was in there it really expanded the the universe in a crazy good way
um hi everyone except rags also hi rags oh hello hello uh i never got why if one taps into the dark
side they are better at lightsaber fighting more aggression doesn't make one better just different
style uh i never got the impression that you were better innately because you tapped into the dark
side yeah i never i never knew that the way that it worked was that it was easier to tap into the
dark side not that it was any better if you know what i mean like it's easier whereas being a jedi
is a harder path but it's a path to greater power i don't know is that true considering the emp
the emperor yeah but remember darth vader beats the emperor he throws him off a thing no yeah
that's right no he didn't oh yeah all right maybe um well i guess so because it was the dark side
that killed palpatine because he couldn't stop shooting blazers electricity out of his finger
i like how he just melts himself one idiot just stop shooting electricity stop it
speaking of epic fights doom eternal is looking fantastic i'd also like to apologize it is
i would also like to apologize for telling you guys to watch jojo rabbit again i missed the
beginning where you guys mentioned it in efap 70 what are your thoughts on it um i enjoyed it a lot
jojo rabbit i really liked the performances i quite enjoyed what you would call the message
of the film a lot of the jokes had me laughing and the drama hit quite well too um though very
much deliberately they play with tone quite a bit in that movie like comedic to dramatic is
swapping in and out regularly but i think it works really well and dare i say it
it's kind of the theme and it works really well because they do it well
despite making up just 13 of all dc comics i represent 50 of maula's favorite heroes
bill nigg yes the steamboat baguins oh my gosh
i cannot was that them trying to get you to say the follow-up one from this person says i
cannot believe that went through well i mean remember that the one that the one that gets
through at least if you've seen wings of redemptions rage uh rage compilations or troll
name compilations is nick gur that's that's the one that seems to sink it don't read that too fast
no you got it you got it deliberately or say nicholas gur that's probably the way to get around it
rags have you got your albion yet i have if so what do you think very oh it's very impressive
i i think it is a it is a fine piece of work i love it i i take it out of the closet where it's
temporarily uh resting and i swing it around half hazardly all the time it's great i love it
uh it is so cool to have it
huge fan just saving up more for shad uh oh my god opinion on internet
historians game of thrones last episode i don't think i watched that um i know about that video
though um doo doo doo um i guess that's a message for shad okay uh they fly now they fly now
they really were probably hoping that would be referenced when they made that joke
but not in the way that it ended up being referenced i think
um because it's embarrassing but hey well you know whatever um i thought in the original they
use lightsabers like that because the technology available to them at the time that's why they look
heavy um i mean i thought that the the whole heavy comments were more about the sequels rather than
the uh dot but i will you know i'll save that one there's a lot of shad questions uh that are
delaying my abilities not a lot of free questions though well you know what can i say man do you do
you have a sword channel i don't think so yeah you're gonna write that in your ideas thing
maybe sword maybe do swords yeah uh marry fuck kill ray padme layer um mari layer and then
yeah it's probably obvious next question sorry ray
yeah uh say again well it was it was marry fuck kill ray padme layer so
you marry layer the rest is pretty obvious fuck padme kill ray yes yeah pretty much i feel like
that would that would answer itself doesn't it this is like yep uh rags don't think i don't
catch all the references to the best show ever what sound does an arctic turn make
backstreet boys oh what a good show oh my god
collin oh my goodness people imagine that you can't kill ray and which is true no according
to the rules in this game we were allowed to she can't beat the rules of fuck marry kill
she could try uh fringy did you receive a set amount of n-word passes at birth or you
give an additional ones periodically wait sorry you you you gotta set that again i was lagging
oh this is a very important question uh fringy did you receive a set amount of n-word passes
at birth or are you given additional ones periodically well passes for me or like passes
for other people i don't i don't understand well an n-word pass can be for other people
right because you already you have a permanent pass yourself well i mean from what i yeah i
guess so um and they ask if you're able to create your own passes uh oh right okay i mean
the whole topic is so stupid she's so dumb wow you're not even choosing to answer this
incredibly philosophical question yeah i don't i don't have an answer i don't understand
uh me need to get an extreme amount of schoolwork done before working all of today and tomorrow
efap let me stop you right there also star wars breath of the wild wen but what am i reading
star wars breath of the wild i mean when i see sw i think star wars then cola b-o-t-w i think
breath of the wild i don't well then yeah like i don't sw b-o-t-w what is that why what am i
my brain's a little melty someone in the chat has made the fatal mistake about the the word
um this you gotta you gotta ignore the american-centric aspect of it
america is not the only country in the world where black people exist
all right lies you gotta remember that
all right then uh oh sorry yeah i i just don't know what best w oh star wars best of the worst
who's that i don't know i don't know i don't follow um
backstroke of the west that's probably what it was yeah um
at some point uh no promises right now efap jinn and a bit of gaming hi rags love you all
hey uh evening fellas and rags what did you think of sc 38 reimagined
i haven't seen it i haven't actually seen it it's pretty good
i don't know what it is what is it sc 38 was the obi-wan reimagined fight with uh oh yeah
i have seen that okay yeah
yes it's cool fight i'm not sure that it would have been better in the movie but it's a cool
fight outside of it yes very dynamic for new hope you know yeah um
my tithe to the shad man rags list your top 10 art surrealist films justify your choices
my top 10 fuck that's a jesus tough christ talk about making up a list on the spot
um uh legend the lighthouse will be in there tom cruise um
that is from 1985 uh wow what a film i love i love the critics gave that a 36 what the fuck
anyway i love legend it's so great i don't even thought we need to watch legend sometime
that's up there um i like the imaginarium of dr parnassus
i like the lighthouse that's really good we saw that recently um um let me see
um gosh i like there's probably more that i just can't think of uh help me out guys
this is your list ranks this is your list you have to see the film i can only think of a few
does gattaca count as an art film i'm not sure it's an art film art is like art or what was it art or
like trippy sort of surrealist like empty void i imagine we can't
i guess at eternity's gate would be an art film i like that movie a lot
but uh i'm not sure if you see art or surrealist does the barber duke count what about which
which might be one yeah which um that could definitely be one
let me see the room surrealist yeah um surrealist oddly enough in a way uh moni python in the holy
grail yeah i guess you could say so yeah um of course le fromage that's very good absolutely
um anything from downward thrust anything from downward thrust
let's see i'm trying to think um
oh yeah mandy that's probably a fair choice
are i i'm almost tempted to say blade runner
i don't know if i pull that and oh yeah it's like in a strange way i would say that
blade runner is an art film yeah um it's a normie great movie let's see black dynamite uh
let's see event horizon no no no that's not that's pull ws anderson
wow you're saying you can't make art
oh ruby rose Australian i didn't know that oh i did her accent breaks constantly in batwoman
you did this i thought yeah i thought you we i thought i said i made you apologize for you
remember oh what is that how it works yeah and you did let me look up let me look up bad welsh
actors
i don't know any welsh act
i'm not going to apologize for christian bale or antony hopkins they're uh they're awesome
it's christian bale welsh is anthony hopkins i don't know that oh wow so you've got two really
good actors yeah he is
also why a black moon and tetsuo absent from the list you just came up with
i don't know if i've seen those no yeah i haven't seen those
why are we talking about lightsaber stick like wait whoa why are we talking about lightsabers
and then no just just just stick like weapons are coming out
needed a comma there okay how am i supposed to work with these conditions but yes true there
is a part in clone wars where obi-wan had to impersonate mercenary sniper and he is best shot
among all of bounty hunters that gather for mission yeah that's a really weird arc and it's
one of the reasons why i selectively view the clone wars in canon because they just do a lot
of goofy things in that show maybe using the force to be accurate you never know
yeah see silence do it oh sorry i didn't know that there was anything i could say in response to that
uh i make it my first ever video on civil war because my favorite mcu movie i made a poll
and evan monroe smud boy the fan delorean and a bunch of others helped me out efap fans are
best fans they're pretty damn good as fan bases go i think it's pretty solid and you know good
luck there's lots to say about civil war for it's writing but i guess discounted because it's a it's
a capeshit movie it's a it's a who cares it's a superhero movie superhero movies can't be well
written fringy my girl no wait fringy my girl and i hate joe such a douche hello wait what's
it i said again i don't understand fringy my girl and i hate joe he's such a douche
i don't understand what this i don't well i mean both of you reacting to i was like is
there something i'm missing i don't understand like i don't i don't get it all right then
this one just says deez nuts you know i don't think i don't think any of us disagree with that
thanks jay uh 34 15 the sith home willed in eu was corriban it's canon it's morriban
forget poaching that deserves a youtube copyright strike
all right then oh so and now in the canon it's morriban not corriban anymore that's
just plagiarism it's just like yeah though right it's not corriban it's morriban just
keep the eu already like jeez we're gonna do this um beetroot and pizza is the best
beetroot sounds like an interesting hmm i've never had beetroot and i only know it exists
because of minecraft minecraft teaches people about all kinds of things great
i'm glad my month-old question was answered and that corvo and emily aren't entirely
screwed because of the folding sword someone should tell jay i think we're all
yeah and i think jay's okay with not knowing stuff he's very used to it it's fine
um so quick question 3po can read ancient with language was that just sitting around in
water's junk pile when little anakin was scrounging around to make him and he said this'll help
mum uh what i think the assumption is that it was just like a standard operating system that
was given to c3p or something i don't think we're supposed to assume that anakin uploaded all of
those languages himself um is that'd be weird uh doo doo doo how repugnant would someone's
political views have to be for you to consider or actually stop being friends with them after years
of friendship uh i don't know it'd probably have to be like a fundamental moral disconnect
like some really harsh and often brought up racism slash
bigotry in general like a strong hatred they're like you know who i hate black people i just hate
him yeah and if it just like keeps showing up and you're just like okay all right every day he's
just like hey uh what do you want to do today run over people at that point i'd be like how
the hell were we friends how did that even start i mean i'd probably be calling the police at that
point but yeah like fundamental value differences if they shifted uh significantly there's actually
a jedi with a red saber also trolled cosmonaut variety hour with obvious bait and he sent his
fan base at me discord and i had a laugh at his hypocrisy oh yeah did i i don't know if you saw it
rags on on twitter um he quote tweeted somebody who said that trump you can't just impeach somebody
because you don't like them he quote tweeted them from a year ago and said sometimes i like to just
look back on my haters and like fuck with them or some shit like that and he um he scrubbed out the
name but you can see everything else in terms of like his the cosmonauts tweet right and his what
he said and what the guy said and so someone uh commented on his thing saying like i'm a fan of
yours but didn't you call mauler out like not a couple of days ago for doing stuff like this
and then he was like uh it's different because one he blocked the name out and two uh this is
more for funnies while mauler like does it because he can't take criticism um first of all like him
blocking out the name doesn't stop anybody with two brain cells from going to find that account
it's really not hard you just you just literally google what each of them said and you'll find that
thread uh secondly he was like oh it's just funny and it's like wait so what about if i'm doing it
to have some fud like i think these people are funny and then people will highlight he's like
you saved this from a year ago like how do you how is it that like this doesn't come across as petty
and then um he he got into like an i guess an argument with some people and at one point you
put out a tweet saying um listen if somebody's talking down to me i reserve the right to clap
back no matter what the like follower counts are and like i just collected up some tweets i was
like i literally said that in response to you like you've copied my argument after saying like
you should find a better way than responding to people while simultaneously saying like i get to
respond to people if they say stuff about me like oh i was kind of annoyed i was just saying
he's such a hypocrite it's beyond yep very hypocritical he's comfortable i guess so that's
all that matters um asoka left the jedi after being framed for murder in the clone wars
uh yeah that's right yeah that just reminded me yeah that's what happened mauler heavy sword
shad ree i remember that that was like eight hours ago um yeah that was a while ago saw an ad
for arc nights where they say the game is objectively better than your life have you seen it
i have not how do i know what arc nights um
no idea i guess it's some anna i guess it's some anime game uh
it's a mobile game not interested uh asoka was forced to leave the jedi order at the end of the
clone wars so when she says i am no jedi she is telling the truth all right yeah but she but if
you're forced do you have to be in the jedi order to be a jedi at this point i don't know raise a jedi
yeah and there's no water it's all shambolic but she sits on a throat of lies
yeah i'm just here for the memes you guys are great enjoy the meme memes will be coming next
episode plenty of memes um in riser skywalker is no shields in atmosphere only on exegol
uh they don't specify that but uh that would be the only way they could actually justify it but
even still how would that make sense what what on what on exegol's atmosphere would prevent a shield
from behaving as normal i have no idea yeah it's evil sith atmosphere it's lots it's carbon dioxide
there's lots of it you see if you're like oh the ozone the global warming you're evil so lots of
global warming the ozone look look at that man over there pouring out his chemicals it's a guy like
a little big toxic side of the barrel with our sludge shadow we'll see that one what is everyone's
favorite war movie also hi rec oh hold on hello i feel like so what what was it they said about um
oh that's not going to work i wanted to do with a joke but it's not going to work uh what was it
with the on exegol with the navigation what do you mean what was it they they could they couldn't
know the up was down right wasn't that the whole idea they just didn't know how to go up without a
tower right and now that's not going to work hello and this could have been a good joke i wanted to
do a stone cutters joke simpson stone cutters joke oh well now you know that i tried and failed i'm
so sorry to come up with a good joke my favorite war movie is still probably saving private ryan
but runners up would be anthropoid 1917 black walk down i like all four of them a lot
great move what about everyone else favorite war movies a war movie uh saving private ryan 1917
black walk down yeah
those would be the ones yeah full metal jack is very good
platoon apocalypse now i assume will pop up well uh oh no i got it what makes spaceships fall to
ground what keeps i don't know spaceship shielding down we do for exegol one wasn't very good i
appreciate the effort simpsons reference is always good uh thoughts for a plasma bayonet on a rifle
plasma bayonet on a rifle that seems really dangerous so i think they have that actually in
halo i have now uh it gives you a one hit melee kill it is fucking broken shit um so let me see um
so the positives would be that you could turn it on and off it didn't always have to be deployed
the bad news is it's a another move like i just it seems like it's a lot of
work and effort to make something that probably wouldn't be useful in almost all scenarios
and you could just put a knife up there
i mean why not put a knife up there you said put a knife up there i was just thinking of
bumbums are you going with that or fuck your bum bum but yeah i mean it'd be spacey and nifty and
maybe there could be practical use for it it seems like it'd be more of a tool than anything
to cut things to open stuff up to get through doors and stuff i could definitely see how like
police forces and SWAT teams in the future would have stuff like that but uh like to cut chains
and lock doors and stuff but as a standard issue thing no i don't see it uh fringy the use of the
periodic table of elements as powers is in a trash anime manga series psychon no quasar
where random people get the ability to control an element on the table
okay that's kind of interesting but you said it was crap so i guess it's not all right
the trash part was their powers were fueled by breast milk
okay that's a bit weird that is a bit weird i think you're right
okay how cool would it be if women's boobs only inflated when aroused and were otherwise
always completely flat half cubs would only mean one inflates i think he means chubs and uh
that would be weird that would be very strange but that'd be bad because you would have to like
think about the sizing for your shirts that you'd have to have and they'd get stretched out and then
they'd get loose depending on how aroused you were and you wouldn't be able to hide it at all
which would be super awkward and if you especially if you have big tits um yeah that'd be a shame
it's funny but imagine they were huge and so when you get aroused it like slowly inflates it's like
and then something really horrible happens and it goes that's it like um deflates this is dumb
but funny anyway uh columbus sucks that was from Ferdinand Magellan
more you just don't like it because you're a massive very true oh well and he falls over
saying shad you just like it because you're the ultimate neckbeard which i think he would own at
this point he's cool with that pass this along to oh that's shad again uh whether you like the
mandalorian or not you have to agree the biggest problem is that 85 000 children died in yemen of
starvation oh um i don't think mandalorian anything to do with it but you know the dead
kids and mandalorian were because mando and they yeah
uh toss a coin to your mupa oh yeah mupa's doing all right he's uh
pushing away yeah mupa what is the uh what is the stream length limit by the way i what is
it like nine hours or 11 54 59 is what i would say to be safe ah right oh so we could still
be going for like another two and a half two and a half what do you mean three and a half
oh right okay all right well three and twenty minutes something like that but yes uh
the visuals good no the cgi was pretty bad oh about mando i don't know cji seemed pretty good
i disagree i think it's pretty darn good but i'd be curious what you think is good cgi then
yeah controversial take baby yoda is a mary sue
i don't know baby yoda gets tuckered out quite a bit and uh close to kill i mean i see why people
might think that but i do think that he um does that is like the redeeming aspect of it
is that like after stomping the mud horn he is just like out for at least a day so that's something
i
the writing is so bad i feel like this is the only place on the internet where it's okay to
dislike it can't wait to hear the arguments you guys bring me joy like none other can truly
appreciate you hey rags hey um yeah i mean we got through the first six it was no five we got through
the first five we got three left they shall have their time um tv for all the hours of
entertainment gentlemen oh ty um no pro blamo um
every fobber pause fobs are just mcmuffins
fobs uh yeah because fobs were talked about for a while but at least we know where we're in the
stream we are right now all right trackers take away the intellect of the bounty hunters they
use to find clues and hunt their target now anyone can follow a beacon makes them less unique
i mean yeah not much stopping you from signing up to be a bounty hunter quite quickly
you should be like give me that fob especially if you've got enough money to buy straight up
armor and a blaster you've mostly got all you need you think yeah
imagine the first guy who's like guys you could buy armor and they're like wait what
is like yeah down the street they just like yeah like fucking hell man why didn't i think of that
uh why didn't the imperials just do it themselves with special recovery teams and lots of fobs
well that was something see and that was something we brought up in the first like selection of
discussions and i'm pretty sure shad conceded that especially when considering the finale
and yet like he would look back and be like nothing's hugely significant in terms of flaws
have really been discussed i was like isn't that doesn't that destroy the entire season
the idea that the empire just really stupid
like they didn't just go get baby yoda themselves like oh but they need to protect their men
outside of the ones they murdered god damn it uh late so y'all might have to cover this but i
think fobs are significantly limited by range hence trying to hide in the middle of nowhere
also we know aa capabilities of atst's what are uh aa capabilities and here oh so it looks like
they're just slow they they seem to be slow firing blasters and they only have two of the cannons if
you wanted aa capabilities and you want blasters for it they needed to be and all you need to do is
park a ship like like a while away well not too far away but away enough that once it's drawn out
you raise up the ship and just immediately go for an attack it without it realizing it's a thing
as long as you fire off one shot that would be and besides we've established he's willing
to risk his own life so of course he'd be willing to risk the ship uh also high regs hello
movie fob yeah an atst taking care of taking down that ship is like no way it ain't happening
the mandalorians contradict falloni's retcon of the law in cw they in clomalt i think uh they took
off their helmets in it the mandalorians in the old republic were better because they weren't all
fairies on jet packs yeah these mandalorians are kind of shit when those guys that's more of a
point we bring him later but yeah when you get beaten by the guys who have a specific
scene to let you know how stupid they are like not looking good hello long man from a quebec
city listener do you and fringy feel vindicated to always wear a mask since the beer virus started
to spread obligatory high regs hello i feel like my mask is gonna be more effective than fringy's
but yeah so i think we'll both be fine well yeah i guess who knows uh fobs are the biggest
plot hole since ryan johnson's anus it makes the finding of bounties irrelevant what if they don't
have dna to lock onto does the person get away also seven too many montages
yeah there's uh in seven you get you get the the the robot becoming a friend montage and don't
you get the flashback montage as well where he um i think he where's that eight i think that was
eight eight because he learns that that it's moth gideon right yeah yeah um yeah i don't
disagree with that and uh yeah we don't know exactly what the fobs track yet they've been
nice and vague on it or at least vague enough but we can't be sure movie bob bounty hunter name is
boba fat nice i enjoy the mandalorian let's see if that lasts i mean i'll be paying attention to
season two i i hope it's better to say the least uh r e fobs let's assume there are 10k
hunters in the guild how many planets do you think there are in the galaxy 10k hunters covering
billions of planets one per hunter per day would take decades well i guess it's just this
this entire as he said before this entirely depends on what if if it uses range um it depends
on what the range is like that's that's the entire crux of the whole thing yeah and there's
you can't have it both ways you if you want to establish it's gonna take them decades to find
then how come that dude found him on uh the episode four the randy found him like didn't
take that long apparently and i don't know man like it's just that they're playing
fast and loose for uh for sure they just don't seem to um care too much and i just feel like
once season two locks down exactly what they do which i assume it will who knows maybe they'll
just avoid talking about it um it's gonna fuck up season one even more potentially uh i just got
into an argument on why ruby is badly written and i thank you massive for showing me how to
accurately break down how something can be bad oh i hope it's uh been useful for you i've never
seen i'm pretty sure i thought a lot of people had were of the opinion that ruby has been bad
for a while i don't really know much about the show yeah i've never seen it planet hopping the
way you guys are talking about isn't feasible there were over 70 million worlds in the galactic
empire and more than that charted again then how is it that he got found so quickly what is the
this is what i mean like the rage seems to just be whatever the plot allows it to be at the time
in terms of just like it was it was however much it needed to be for that guy to have found them
and when we're just sitting here like so what then it's like hmm
like um the guy in episode five he knew that the assassin lady was on tatooine i guess
and the fall pony activated once he got there question mark i don't know
no longer these trapping fobs existed seems like it would have been useful for tracking down the
rebellion i don't even know what they lock on to uh we didn't even manage to figure that out
exactly if it is because they're the two halves of the problem what is it that it's locking on to
and what is its effective range assuming it uses range yeah we don't don't even really know
because when he because remember we're using like if we can communicate across
insanely vast distances with each other like the technology is incredible so who knows that's thing
who knows i'm like i haven't watched the show yet so i'll just say hi to all that includes you rags
good luck tomorrow shad made the light brighten your the light brighten your fall
um we'll save that i suppose but what do you mean light brighten your fall
do you have any advice for writing scripts i'm looking into doing my own series
like tv shut oh wow we can't clarify it um i mean it's quite it's quite hard to give
decent advice that's generalized uh someone like writing a script i know that we we usually stick
to the whole like you know stay true to everything you write down from the moment it's become a rule
work to try and make things feel natural i suppose uh redraft redraft redraft send it
around to different people see what they think i remember um smud boy talking about when he was
writing some stories that he would have friends of his write dialogue uh based on how they would
react in a situation after being told the basic like the skeleton of what they'd be wanting to say
and stuff just to see how they would say stuff and change up the dialogue i guess um oh it probably
is a reference to shad's book actually yeah that's a good point like i said i've saved that message
read edition as well but yes um without going into too much detail uh it's tough to
give strong advice for writing a script it's a very complicated process yeah man
give me the big corona daddy rags i love the content of two of you
that was when all four of us were here and they said it just says i love the content of two of you
oh my god maula chat has some things wrong chat is messed up oh no this crap are we gonna end up
debating the morality of adoption again sad face perhaps we will perhaps we will oh no i'm literally
in the middle of writing a script for a breakdown of the show outlast part five 11 50 to 11 54
and 20 50 to 58 what does gratuitous mean uh gratuitous means like yeah i would
if let me check it because i feel like more than is necessary oh really you know
i feel like it's the perfect synonym is excessive um gratuitous apparently is
primarily that a primary definition is done without good reason or uncalled for
interesting um more than is required so you'll often find it associated with violence
uh sexual content that sort of thing when they put it in because you're like oh i see why you're
doing this because it's not to do with the story it's to do with you wanting to see this stuff
springy if fobs have a system-sized range oh yeah you did respond to that one
yeah no worries about specificity and devil's advocate shad and the rest of you explicitness
is the point of efab and that's what i love yeah we like it when there's uh definitive references
and they don't have to be overt as long as you know their information why are you talking with
shad the ultimate neckbeard is coming out and can we get some slowneld in here mando debates are
boring as fuck the show is mad best oh well you know what we had a super chat in the last one
didn't we that said like when's the next debate happening they're my favorite kinds of episodes
hopefully that person is satisfied with this episode who knows yeah i hope that works out
good day mauler finished your soma amnesia videos in the last part you mentioned you finished uni
and you were stopping youtube altogether what did you study at uni what were you going to be
and what made you push on prior to tlj's release um so i figured that i was getting a new job at
that point that was uh extremely taxing in terms of like i wouldn't be free other than maybe the
saturday and sunday of the week and i figured that i'd be spending my time having fun doing
normal things instead of like working on videos and stuff but i decided that i really wanted to
keep making videos um i was uh when i finished uni i was doing illustration um i liked it but
the course was awful and i really hated it and i kind of wish i never did it but i did two years
and then i didn't want to do the third because i i'd pushed through on the second one i didn't
really want to and uh what are you going to be i had no idea i did illustration because i enjoyed
drawing but i didn't know what i was going to do with it um but i knew i kind of wanted to always
get into youtube in some way shape or form um i really liked lots of people's videos that were like
analysis of uh media and i was like i'd like to do that in some way i tried out a bunch of other
sorts of videos and um i settled on making reviews long form
long man long time uh i meant in charted space for me not the whole galaxy the star wars
galaxy is actually slightly bigger than ours um i think we we have more planets right but
apparently it's like bigger in just general size
uh but yeah it's just too tough to figure this stuff out because we don't have enough information
on how the fobs work like all this stuff is extrapolation from just assumptions
i just figured the fobs pretty much worked at infinite distances like i didn't really have
assumed any other reason uh anything other than that i guess who knows
hyperspace is like highway with gravity points as junctions planets etc that's why
some planets are dead ends and others are high value for travel very well talk about all the
great montages i assume they're referring to when he's flashbacking is the only other montage
i can think of is one maybe he's talking about all like the great montages of movie history
oh yeah i gotta told you could give it the best and you've got to reach your something
you remember that one from uh team america yeah yeah and show us the passage of time
you're gonna need a montage montage you know that's a good one yeah i'm so talented
in cotor it's implied that tatooine is earth oh my god i thought it was a galaxy far far away
well maybe it's not so far away at all
maybe that's the secret because when it's far away but it's not uh yeah i'm i got nothing
my brain is dying here i think i might have to call it i know i it's funny because i woke
up for this but like i'm really tired now well i think i need some z's that's all right would
you like to uh tell chat about how you're totally bringing out loads of new videos soon uh yeah
maybe video but definitely i've done some streams on the switch uh hold on i need to find the link
i want hold on hold on hold on oh my god uh even though i haven't done one for like
a week at this point because my you may have noticed it during this stream but the internet's
been real spotty today i'll be honest with you i did notice that i'm sure you did yeah yeah
that's been doing streams and i'm working on uh i'm working on things but i i'm not gonna say
because i don't want to give people expectations hopefully there will just be something that comes
out maybe and then you'll be really surprised like with the christmas video oh wait ringy isn't
the thing it's dubious yeah yeah that's the one but this freaking one's there too because i hosted
through there anyway so either way either way that's fine come come along whenever my internet
starts working again you can see me playing halo mostly and xcom 2 i was gonna play before my save
file corrupted yeah yeah i like xcom 2 a lot i know top hats doesn't like xcom 2 but i don't
care i like xcom 2 uh but yeah that's it this was fun discussion i'll guess i'll be around for the
part two right yes that shall happen eventually one day it'll be wonderful uh
i guess yeah thanks for popping in for the good for a good near nine hours it's been fun yes
absolutely we will yeah we get wait only nine hours i know right i'm pretty sure that's my
luck i think my longest oh yeah for me it was uh remember that mission impossible one we did
that went for seven hours and we were all like wow this was a long one oh jesus alan like we got
three hours to kill what do you guys want to talk uh all right i need to catch some z's but it's
been fun i will catch you later see you later everyone all righty yeah i'll see you later bye
why are you leaving or we do the stream okay all right i didn't know i wanted to kind of do
like a goodbye justin cake i didn't know if he was leaving or if the stream was cutting
so i wanted to make sure this goodbye would be both applicable to him and to everybody just in
case that makes sense i wonder i think chat is staying they're not leaving yet so we'll
we'll hang around with them for you know yeah i guess we can hang around a little bit i'm tired
but i can uh i can hang around put push on this efap is cursed very well hi rags
hi hey there have you heard about jtech tv
i have all right then yeah there you go check out it's a gundam's video
on jtech tv i'm not interested i'm not interested in people's personal drama
in the of that of that kind i have i have no interest in it it's not it's not something i want
to not not something i want to delve into it's not my business uh it's probably due to how
inoffensively the show is that i actually enjoyed it although it definitely has problems baby Yoda
is adorable as well yes he is how do you think the mandalorian compares to rise of skywalker
and the last jedi the show has been propped up by how bad those movies are it's better than those
but like yeah it's better than those i don't think that's an achievement
just those those are so bad uh i miss wolf he would have called anyone who liked the show
an objective retard would have ripped them a new brown table can we go back to ripping on tlj
probably there's loads of videos it will happen yeah
well the mandalorian wears best car but the silly thing about best cars it's
actually supposed to be invulnerable to blaster fire but extremely rare to get
yeah i have no doubt that it is extremely rare to get of all the armor it seems to be very high
effective uh shag marry kill work for befriend in slave they they are our option i'm gonna have
to paste this to you in case you have to keep track of all these options yeah let's take a look
let's take a look your options are layer padme kira jin ray and rose who's kira
yeah well kira is the one from solo oh yeah that's right um and this is fuck mary kill
i'm gonna marry leah immediately yeah mary leah in slave rose i imagine
well that way then again we've got to kill somebody oh maybe in slave ray she's pretty
powerful as a slave you know yeah if she was in yeah so in slavery kill rose
mary leah yeah plus you could fuck ray uh if you needed to yeah we got that we got shag we got shag
some padme probably uh i'd be friends but kira's i'd shag kira well you uh i guess it's between
you gotta be friends with slash or shag between i would work for padme because she's like super
rich so she probably works in really nice upscale places and uh she's like a queen and everything
senator queen lady so probably really nice working for her go to some nice fancy senate
parties on place planets um be friend hmm i'd probably befriend kira because she's ruthless
kind of yeah i would if that means she's gonna be our friend then yeah yeah and so that means
we shag jinn okay let me see uh
jinn erso yeah she's a good looking uh she's a good looking chick yeah all right so she looks
fine yeah she looks good uh all of my first choice for shacking but you know i think that we came out
i definitely see this as a i absolutely see this as a win all of you are great keep up the great
work high rags hello okay i understand it's convenient he's constantly shot in the armor
but he has way better coverage than captain america and cap goes against trained soldiers
who almost always hit his shield yes part of one of the issues with the winter soldier is they
never shoot his legs they always shoot the shield and i think that um they comment on it in civil war
um vitamin says he told me to go for your legs or something like that because that's the obvious
weak spot but um yeah i don't ever assume that just because me and rags like something
that means that we don't recognize a fault in it that we are pointing out in something at the time
like there's a good chance that we agree because yeah we're fine with saying that this other thing
also is bad maybe not to the same degree but we're absolutely fine saying yeah other things
can be bad too we're not talking about those things now we hate it when people do this on
videos we cover any fat so don't do it here after episode one i had so much hope for this show god
knows we could all use some good star wars again yes ma'am a hundred belly rubs for rags yay i'm
going to bed see you in eight hours because i'm certain you'll still be streaming we might very
well be he might be right yeah oh god for example when you're playing halo games on legendary you're
not going to run into a horde of enemies as you'll die very quickly even with your armor
agreed exactly that's the thing and like the way his armor even covers his body
latin latin was being generous too let's say it will stop 90 of blaster bolts from hitting your
body that's a one in ten shot that um uh you know it hits you like that's not something i'm risking
empire had laser proof metal but use it for money
say that one more time the empire has a laser proof metal but they use it for money i guess
they're referring to the best car it's like they're not using that for their own armor they just use
it for exchanging for goods and stuff like yeah i mean it's yeah it's still yeah even if you don't
use it as armor it's still like super valuable as a material yeah mola makes good objective
critique of tlj chat i like mola makes good objective critique of mandalorian gay idiots
and chat re i mean i can understand in chat i can understand it though because it's just
it's hard to get used to because it's like but this is so much better than the sequel trilogy
why are you ripping into it in the same way it's just like i don't know we're just judging it with
the same standard we judge the other star wars stuff and it took a while to get to references
hopefully with what we piled out in each of these episodes uh people are going to be relatively
satisfied but there's a lot more to come for episodes eight seven and six so we'll have to
get to them when we get to them as well but uh the season as a whole it's just it's very
limsey also would you you're probably going to be able to do most of your video by the time we get to
a stream with those remaining three right how maybe it depends on what depends on what order
i do stuff in but maybe that's very possible episode five and six two is just dumb episode
criticism of don't apply to the rest of the show it's not nearly as bad as some moments in five
i'm not sure what to make of that one
getting hit in armor is still should be extremely painful with at least a couple broken ribs or
worse i'm willing to understand that it bounces the standard blasters away from it but the ones
where he gets hit and he actually like it explodes on him and he falls over like the sniper shots in
episode five you'd think that would do some permanent stuff to him maybe i don't know yeah
i mean i can it's it's i see it as like a really heavy punch or getting hit with a hammer or
something like that can't be good can't be good and again when you take it's not just the amount
of times he shot in eight episodes is like it's almost like every time he's fucking in combat at
all he gets shot snipers aim for the largest part of the body so if you're playing a video game
and i'm like against rags and i see him in my sights shoot him and it sparks off and he survives
and is zero damage and i'm like what the fuck i do it again and it's just yeah his his body armor
protects him 100 then uh i see him standing still in the open i'm not going to shoot his chest again
yeah and i mean like watch watch the episode he is right there he's just still as can be
she has him dead in his sight like he's taking up like half of her scope she's an expert marksman
and to argue that she's obviously going to shoot the biggest portion of him it's like
i think she'd rather shoot to kill at this point yeah especially because he's getting that close
and she could tell he's a mandalorian like come on like this of all the things to defend you're
trying to defend this it's like come on quit love the streams and i'm currently marathoning all of
efap not sure it's been said yet snipers are trained to aim for center mass like the chest
i mean we pretty much just went not here it's yeah we just explained just explain that yeah
uh 0.5 moa groups at a distance a kilometer are impressive at a kilometer it's 26 centimeters
even more at longer range good luck aiming at a neck i mean she literally just had to move up
slightly sold the screenshot just had to move it up just a little bit yeah and then she pulls the
trigger and it hits him right in the chest where she was aiming like she clearly could have hit
him anywhere she wanted but she just chose to shoot him in the chest again and once again
it protects him fully again for the third time like quit defending this guys come on
um just just she didn't even try as well she just aimed for the chest again oh well
uh i used to be with it but then they changed what it was and now what i'm with isn't it and
and what it seems to be is weird and scary to me a baguins that is a good simpsons reference
approved nip pic efap bad i'm so sorry that these are considered nitpicks
uh shed as far as i remember the distance is larger than just one kilometer in this
case so the fact that she can consistently hit him is impressive
i mean yeah she is an extremely good shot yeah very good
and as far as i remember the distance uh oh wait yeah uh the mandalorians lose because as good of
war as they are they have no cohesion they fight as individuals what do you mean they didn't do that
in episode three uh yeah what was it they clearly can even in the flashback they are clearly
communicating with each other yeah and besides like they're in like tight hall tall uh sorry
tight hallways and tunnels and stuff and how much cohesion do you have to do you need if you're a
mandalorian to fight stormtroopers they literally make a point about how worthless and shitty they
are like how much teamwork do you need exactly i miss ot stormtroopers st stormtroopers look bad
i mean i don't i don't really mind the redesign in the st the dt as they call it uh
it's i just i just i'm just getting tired of incompetent stormtroopers
seeing so much of it now yeah it's like because now we know in the episode whenever they say oh
we can't fight them or oh we can't do we know that that's just a lie just throw out literally
like a duck the duck will kill him don't do it they can't do it with a blaster would kill you
not even the blaster duck with the knife just the duck
what if joker was a person of color rather than a white male the performances and everything else
was the same how do that change things for movie blob and jebby types they'd love it um they
probably prefer it to say the least like if joker was trans they would think it's the greatest movie
ever made the proper term is fandalorian rags not mandebu you silly fury i was reading someone
else's thing in the chat so that one is not on me this guy said what's a y-wing boo boo not everyone
knows what a y-wing that's for sure uh tlj bombers are do wings i get it do wings do
blurgs are the dumbest looking creatures ever invented with a dumb name to match biologically
how does such a constructed creature work i have no idea i am not jeepers i do not know how these
species work i'm so sorry it's very mysterious he should have milked it and gained his trust that
is true scopes need to be zeroed in fire scares animals you didn't it filled his scope
and you remember this part they're talking about episode one again yeah like it filled like it
you can't miss he's had to fire yeah he couldn't miss it was right there it pops up right in front
of him uh pretty basic firearm safety is to not have a firearm you don't intend to use loaded
it's a bit odd that the rifle wasn't loaded but not unimaginable he wouldn't have loaded it when
leaving because he didn't plan to use it apparently he does so yeah he does need it and if anything
like he knows why he's going there right there's no reason not to load it i don't see why you
wouldn't have it loaded yeah who's who is he afraid of shooting exactly out there
himself yeah i don't know about that also they have like safeties and there's the whole finger
on the trigger thing i'll have to watch mando now so i'll watch this efap later in the meantime you
dumbos have to watch hardcore henry it'll be perfectly balanced one day one day uh
it just says s dash was too drunk to respond the first time so i'll repeat
i guess this is about directed at you uh he's wrong about armor in fantasy needing to be
practical fashion over function rags oh yeah it's like an mmo
um to me it sounds like will smith's robophobia in iRobot is more consistent
yeah yeah he is very inconsistent if i remember that the in iRobot a robot decides to save will
smith and not save his is it is a family member maybe his daughter because the likelihood of his
survival was higher and so from that point on he just hates robots because they're too cold
and calculating that sort of thing um and obviously it associates directly with the
death of that family member and stuff but i'm pretty sure even will smith is like in that movie
willing to talk to robots and deal with them and stuff he just kind of hates them because
of that scenario in his life and he ends up being friends with one in that film i think but
they do it weirdly in mando they're just it's weird uh to clarify the 70 million point
because i got a bit inconsistent there it's 70 million worlds in the empire millions of
independent but charted worlds beyond its borders then a huge chunk of the galaxy unexplored
which means that um they would always like we're almost advocating that fobs are useless
because you'd have to know what planet the person's on for the fob to be worth anything right
can't go around jump in between them so again like we're it's like lots of arguments happening
at the same time when we don't have enough information to um be definitive but i seriously
doubt the only work within the range of a planet or a system gotta be more than that
at least i would imagine so um i just came home from the hospital as my mother had a heart attack
today um for those of you hope she's hope she's all right for those of you who believe in such
things could you send your prayers or wishes she's very important to me of course dude yeah i
good things she's at least getting taken to the hospital where they can take care of that man
yeah sorry to hear it um hopefully she recovers
all right there's a question for fringy and shad uh just watched your surgery video that's for
shad shad molar and rex as anyone else who feels like it do your best wesker impression
oh we've done that before yeah we've done that before like where he says like complete global
saturation total global saturation seven minutes seven minutes is all i can spare to play with you
to play with you crass crass are you going to cry
quest god maybe shit and come um
um ah foundio
resneel five is a strange game yes it is oh what happened yoda's op powers are okay if he's some
kind of special force thing like a species powerful in the force i like he's sleeping
for a while so they need to pay this off when they explain him i mean we'll get more info on
him in season two i imagine women of color some bunch may refer to as a female ewok along with
the delightful dwarves still deserve the proverbial unbridled peen biggidius uh that was a message
of some kind uh anakin was literally made by the force and he couldn't match anything
before training and he couldn't do much of anything before training
uh you know i'm willing to bet people can do something to a degree uh without
you know like like off instinct i guess but yeah like self-taught sure i i totally believe
self-taught but lifting and stopping a charging mud horn is just pushing it a bit too
um
danny devito should voice baby yoda if it happens agreed
the rags pooped with the door open while in vegas
too proud of them wow that's uh
uh wow that's uh oh i guess if you're gonna do it do it in vegas yeah that's that's the
place to do it they got some nice bathrooms in there oh and they're vegas like at vegas not in
like in vegas like in general around the vegas area um good luck with the surgery oh yeah i'll
save that how was luke able to learn force choke in return of the jedi was he taught by obi-wan or
yoda to use a power like that also baby yoda so forced choke is an interesting one because
forced choke shouldn't even be a thing it's just telekinesis which is something they already know
to do yeah yeah you're just using force push to push their throat closed like calling it
forced choke is a specific ability to me seems kind of silly we should just assume that he's
though i will mean odd that he knows forced choke odd that he knows an application of that is to
choke people for a baby like hmm right you'd think you would instead try to pick her up maybe
yeah or push her back or something yeah lift her in the air who knows also using for baby yoda
using force heal was awful would you guys be interested in reviewing the leaked duel of fate
as you did with the tro s leak yeah we're going to look into a summary for it and probably talk
about it a bit um chat has put on their retarded hat for today i i don't agree entirely with that
i think the we we got to explore a lot of counter arguments i think a lot of people
this thing about mandalorian is loads of people hate it loads people love it loads people are
indifferent it was a full selection today we're not because like rise of skywalker it wasn't exactly
a fucking surprise that the people who hated tlj hated that film too um but mandalorian is a bit
different and it was it was cool to have something in this community that isn't um definitively
agreed upon or at least 80 agreed upon you know it's quite the uh diverse set of opinions
and once we get through talking a bit more about the last few episodes and maybe some
stuff about it as a whole and once season two comes out we'll be able to definitively say
small stuff about mandalorian the discussion goes on and who knows what's gonna happen when
we get an ob1 series if that actually happens uh do you know of a response to your ds2 vids
from a small youtuber named modie it puts into question your objectivity i've been told about
quite a few now that are responding to lots of different videos of mine um i just don't have
time to get around to each of them but i'm happy that it's happening good to get that discussion
rolling i have i know i made mistakes in the ds2 one um if you go to the comments on a selection
of them i'm in there trying to like explain how i made certain mistakes or uh i didn't mean to
stuff like obviously the easy reference is the jester robes which i still don't think really
matters that much because i showed so many other examples of the backstab not working but
there are other things as well um there are droid scavengers
hours aren't rare it should be common knowledge that they would have they would have shock based
weaponry yeah especially if you care enough to learn the language i don't know yeah i felt like
that was a bit graspy at strawsy like um i was trying because i was letting the argument run out
between uh you guys but i was just like i was listening to all of it and i just i just think
his approach with the sandcrawler was retarded i think that uh there's a lot of other things he
could have done i don't exactly know what he expected to do i think he just hoped that they
wouldn't have hit him with the shock guns and that you would have killed all of them
killed the driver managed to find all of his parts and take them back to his ship i guess
i think that's what he was gunning for it's just uh it was always gonna be tough mando
uh move on you're spending too much time on this why do these people watch efap and not expect
examination and discussion that's the whole premise yeah i mean everybody has a limit right
on how long anyone can spend on a uh on a topic and some feel that i mean we spent a while on
the fobs even i think so but yeah thorough there are in fact frog species that live in deserts
their life cycle pretty much involves hibernating until a rainstorm then eating and breeding and
then starting to hibernate again hmm interesting hmm i can't believe that
mauler when do we get an unbridled rags from you um bridled rags
i don't know if that means rags being angry or uh unbridled rags
i'm excited to know what that means i never wear a bridle also i don't have a bride
but if you were to uh have one of those i could create a video in which you were un of that
totally makes sense yeah the mandos in the 90s comics will like on predator okay uh you don't
even know what race of aliens he is from he can have powers that we don't even know about because
he was saved by the mandalorians and adopted maybe and if they explain that later on i'll
be down with it but i hope they don't pull that out of their asses like uh 13 15 rebels made fun
of stormtroopers first the rebels had a strike team led by vader's former clone commander using
stolen st uniforms he kept missing until he took off his helmet in anger and then he gained sniper
level aim oh so the rebels show made fun of stormtroopers first i don't care who did it first
really i just don't like it i think it's dumb and uh it really only gets in the way when
stormtroopers do good because you're just like wait i thought they were a joke
and i did see people commenting that it's just those two stormtroopers at the beginning of episode
eight but uh it's a bill beer comment as well he says he wasn't a stormtrooper in relation to
having good aim like he's like i wasn't a stormtrooper wise ass i don't like it i don't like it i don't
like it either night vision and thermal are sensitive equipment wouldn't getting shot by
ion blasters fry them apparently not no apparently not future me remember you parked at lot a
all right there you go oh there you go i miss full metal alchemist brotherhood where main
characters could bleed break bones and be out of action for episodes except alphondes obviously
very true molar have you ever thought of doing an unbridled praise and unbridled rage on the same
movie pick apart what lifts it up and what drags it down i think spiderman far from home would be a
good candidate for that it's um it's got a lot of good stuff in there but a lot of it is half baked
which is the kind of film that could work for that sort of thing
what do you say it would be a good contender yeah to a degree uh what do you think of abstract film
i don't know what you are referring to specifically
it's something like films that are primarily allegorical or interpretive
and um i can like them a lot depending on execution yeah i i'm fine with the idea
he's gonna be super artsy but do something
hi there efap what is the best way to get a hold of any of you for business i'm the weirdo making
the fighting game and i would like to make some inquiries about the characters if at all possible
oh my god uh discord message me uh or email me on uh my youtube email probably email
but uh email our discord message is the best way to reach me that'd be nifty let the uwu flow
through uwu mube schlie thank you also slams fob and puck on dust what'd you bring me also
also hi everyone hello hi on wikipedia it states that jango fete was a mandalorian who was adopted
by them after his family is murdered in the shitty new canon he is nothing more than an
impersonator lame disney god that's all good isn't it yeah yeah well hope the story is still
kind of interesting at least there's an account called baby odor it says you talking poop about
me yes talk poop about me what are you gonna do i'm just having a fun time and enjoying the ride
i even made a meme for you guys but it has godzilla in it so you'll probably hate it i'm
just messing with you either way i'm glad to listen you know it's funny that our godzilla
efap movies still isn't out yet jesus i mean the fellowship of the ring one isn't i was thinking
do you think it's risky to try and do a premiere for the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring
efap because like copyrightisms and stuff i don't know if it's not been detected while enlisted
then theoretically streaming it should be fine right theoretically good crash and burn
yeah it could crash and burn and or you'll get a strike tism on the channel and who knows youtube
is a fickle thing um but i need to use the loo so i'll be right back did they finish all the
episodes we did one through five j we've got six seven and eight to do uh hopefully we will do them
in a part two style thing once uh once shad has recovered toriel critics efap are just bigots who
won't let people have opinions also critics the right opinion i hate everything just right you
are watching movies wrong my god maybe a few of the show's logical issues could be fixed if
mando was a talented novice with lots to learn instead of mando king of the bounty hunters
yeah that's the thing like i wish his mistakes were more
uh say reasonable compared to what we expect of his level that makes sense
his mistakes were more comparative to what we would expect a man of his
ability to be making this was my first participation on efap love you well thank you
love you too she's hot you massive fig trees sans is in smash that's very good i believe she is
attractive i believe everyone else said she was attractive actually that is uh in reference to
gina careno i believe and that means we'll be talking about episode four at this point in the
super chance not bad uh frog lives matter mauler i apologize
i'm off to bed but i've been enjoying the debate so far excellent in the episode with the defense
of the village it is clearly a rip-off of magnificent seven the entire show is a garbage
rip-off of a classic western see i don't 100 mind if it'd been a rip-off if they had done it well
though you know i mean like i think a lot of people feel that way it's like as long as you
copy it in a way that gives it a new skin and sort of maybe explores different things
with different characters of their own but also kind of you know feels a bit of the um
bit of the plot if not all of it just but just but in any way that's believable and insistent you
know they didn't really do that uh fortunately this whole teach villages to fight back thing
was done way better in clone wars season two episode 17 same plot just done much better
oh clone wars has them beat as well uh loll short men inside the atst loll what a garbage
episode so contrived yeah episode four is probably the worst one uh i don't know what they were doing
with that like episode five's poopy as well for sure but i mean one of the greatest flaws of the
show is that mando never uses his ship in tactical situations it's as if his ship is treated as a
horse would be treated in a b movie western i mean you probably use a horse more often than
the ship at that point is er ever coming on again more should do a sci-fi episode with borzoi and
sven from the right stuff biz i have no idea who they are and as for er coming on again yeah
probably um he was actually on the last defap i believe the super chat section i remember correctly
good old misty yeah um just because it's a seven samurai reference does not make it good watch
clone wars for a decent seven samurai homage or omar they did it okay the way that they did it
an epic line from an incredible philosopher uh my favorite part is when the other mandalorians
just showed up out of nowhere for no reason just in time to save our heroes ask great writing
i think it's reasonable to assume that they were vaguely aware of what was happening up there
because lots of dramas were going on maybe they have some kind of
informant that came down to tell them about it but um yeah they got ready quick i don't know
shad is doing an excellent job of mando apologetics bless his heart i mean he felt
he would uh try and counter the arguments um as best as possible with each of the arguments that
were provided i suppose um it's a thankless job a tough job but he did it there are so many desert
plains planets in the show it's ridiculous and feels lazy they even all have jowers at least
geonosis was distinct yeah i agree geonosis is very distinct one of the ones that uh looks
people remember
wow rax must be taking an old dumparoo i suppose
mando ah you're entirely inexperienced in matters like these this changes everything sign me up
yeah it's it's a weird moment all these criticisms are good it just hurts to hear them really like
this show i want it to be good i mean there's still good stuff in it as as we did discuss
it's not like it gets a zero just that uh there's a lot of stuff that i think does not work sad loser
reads super chats all by himself 2020 colorized i'm not going to be alone forever rags is totally
on his way back may shad's surgery oh i'll save that for him we've got a lot of shad messages
i don't even know if we're going to be able to read all of these in the intro for the one where
he comes back it's gonna be crazy mauler how do you feel about being free from article 13
that is pretty hilarious that if article 13 goes forward i will be saved because of brexit i
suppose i don't know what to think we'll have to see how uh everything goes mando is the gedel guy
of space wizard characters um i can see the connection can mauler be called britain man
not british man britain man pull upon your celtic britonic ancestors screw the anglo-saxon invaders
very well britain man it is that can be one of my aka's
nothing to say but i always run ad block so here's your ad money thank you hyperdrive requires
calculation time see episode four mando is engaged in a space battle while waiting for
calculations and before he's ready to jump he manages to destroy the other ship also high rags
well that's we did say there's lots of ways to explain it but they don't bother with uh any they
just uh we're just meant to assume that for whatever reason he was unable to do it and we're
like all right then be cool to know what it was so this is a selection of super chats all in a row
i'm gonna read them is uh one two three four five six seven eight quite a few but uh here we go
pee pee poo poo pee pee pee pee pee poo poo pee pee poo pee pee poo poo
uh sorry mauler it's cortosis blades that can disable lightsabers not vibro blades vibro
blades can just deflect slash parry lightsabers my bad very well i am back
uh there were two they were two for you that you had missed oh my god i'm sorry rags buff
chicks are hot not everyone is into pregnant chicks like you man her personality is okay
but i definitely agree on that though i mean yeah the actress is hot sure absolutely i do
think there's definitely some appeal to be had in you know strong buff chicks absolutely
uh rags is scared of a strong woman i've seen him irl a lightweight no wonder two beers make
him drunk oh if it takes more than two um if you have you see old pictures of me and stuff
sure but those were years ago and i have i don't box up a fair amount i'm not really
scrawn anymore i like think i've been taking pretty good care of myself
well i think dave falloni's episodes are the better ones you can tell how inexperienced he
is with live action shows uh which ones are his dave
he direct and write
lorian oh he wrote episode five the one that everyone hates so that's awkward
and directed
episode one and episode five how strange oh man that's weird like i said i think that we agree
that episode four is worse than five but like i said most of the general public seem to think
that five is the worst um yeah i i think it's i think four or eight are kind of up there for me
up there for me i'd give it a seven out of ten all right have a happy 0 2 0 2 2020 guys
oh yeah it's a palindrome
at least that's what i read online mullah what do you think of luigi's mansion three
i haven't played it i'm afraid uh moose lee what's your favorite corruption of your name
moola muleb schlie etc also high rag
what it was a high rag i i said hello didn't hear anything i'm oh that's weird yeah but just in case
it didn't come through hello yeah my favorite is probably the muleb schlie one because it's such a
crazy nonsense version but i guess the more insane and crazy it is the funnier i find it um
but then again there's a balance there's a balance so muleb schlie is is quite the
quite the amusing one uh watch jay longbone's new video it's fucking great
uh are you talking about the one she did for cinema sins
or has she done something else oh she's got one called bids of prey looks great
i will check that out after this through you me
uh halo four and five were okay games just bad halo games in my opinion
rags you're standing yeah i was like i didn't play five four was fine i guess but you expect
better from halo uh baby yoda asks do you like me though i'm gonna go ahead and say yes
all right so you like baby yoda it's fine he's fine fine i just don't like babies in general
somebody's fine purple ones that can save your life he's not i'm not i'm so glad he's not just
like whining and crying all the time and just being an annoying little asshole
does anyone remember halo forward unto dawn and if so what are your thoughts
on it as a video game movie and could it work for the big screen i have not seen it i have
not seen it i have not seen it but there's nothing about the halo universe that wouldn't lend itself
well to a movie so uh would you call saving those chats for foreshadowing ah foreshadowing
very clever um in shad's book the protagonist catches a rapist rips his wang doodle off and
kills him later would be rapists get decapitated in the street my goodness oh my goodness uh guys
what is the best monster horror movie and why is it tremors i'm sorry i like tremors but the thing
beats out tremors in that category uh why do monster movies not have such creativity anymore
it bums me out yeah i agree it sucks uh i don't know because they made that thing remake they
probably gonna remake tremors right that sounds like something they would do give it time yeah
uh i'm sorry yeah uh you know maybe we shall have a renaissance in terms of
movies a whole bunch of crazy new movie monsters all come out i'm sure it'll happen renaissance
uh fuck padme and mary layer banjos intensify all right oh oh boy springy sword channel wen
also hyrax i guess i'll keep that message for fringy and one day i will read it out and he'll
be confused he'll just be like what what is the context i'll be like maybe you don't deserve the
context springy how about that yeah brainy how did you free home wars was fracking gold even
the goofy stuff except except that one bit where grievous was captured by gungans oh
sounds funny so many people here are thirsty for rags is piping hot homo milk
all right this is the very first time i catch you guys live and super stoked i'm a huge fan
of you guys and wolf love you all also high rags lol hello hello there happy to see you
and hope you haven't gone tlj's light speed tracker was just a fob
could be oh my god it could have been you never know oh my god it could have been uh based neo
sophistry yeah hyperspace is really cool ignoring riser skywalker frack hyperspace skipping
civilization settles around and expands based on the hyperspace lanes
like real life civilizations did around rivers heat uh will smith wasn't related to the girl
and i robot truck pushed both their cars into the water will smith wanted her saved because
she's a child and it went for uh for him instead yeah i haven't seen that film in a while i just
remember somebody died also high rags hello greetings come from frozen wastelands love your
work you absolute massive ds2 series was amazing wish you could hook up with tb god rest his soul
oh yeah it would have been really awesome to have met him oh yeah man and fucking i can't imagine
the amount of shit you would have ripped into had he still been here with all the shit that's
happened with the the gaming world yeah for those of you who really like total biscuit um
if you don't know richard lewis he's uh yeah if you if you like total biscuit you might like him
i listen to his uh stuff fairly often he's a pretty decent guy so that might be an option for you
yeah um of course y'all still going on a side note i work as a dominos delivery driver and this
podcast will get me through super bowl sunday thank you logman and rags may the dawn bless your
souls oh and you too may the dawn bless you be safe and always it's always great to hear people
saying that we help them get through work can jetta use the force to squeeze titties and ass
yes yeah boy i bet they have some crazy sex i just took a huge dump and clogged my toilet
mauler please say the n-word in celebration thank you in advance ewok
uh not sure what the other person is talking about but vibro blades have a cortosis weave
which makes a person able to use one against lightsabers i don't know man i i i'm just
just you i'm i i don't know what vorp vibro blades are i don't know swords never i have
no idea what those are i don't know is that the thing that the that moff gideon has in the last
episode that's a dark blade idiot that's a dark blade yeah they're made of sins some of these
they're lightsabers there's dark blades they're powered by being evil swords like stick-like
weapons if ever it's running out of power you have to start swearing and saying racial slurs
and it gets powered up it's a very strange sword design but it works very much so very very does
much is the mandalorian not allowed to have a moment of weakness his ship was broken and he
had everything to lose shadlow baggings um i'm not sure what part of the entire discussion
that's referencing yeah it probably probably the jawa thing and if anything that's all the more
reason for him to keep his cool so he can get it back negotiate yes negotiate like imagine if he
had snuck a bomb on board the uh sand crawler ship and it was like listen here you little shits
if you don't put my shit back exactly how you found it i'm gonna blow up your fucking sand crawler
pp right speaking of good monster movies what was your thoughts on a quiet place
uh i like the idea the execution was horrifically bad yeah yeah the execution was really bad
uh the yeah i mean i it's kind of like i was trying to think of what i could do with that
i don't think any fab movies would work and i don't think i ever want to make a video on it myself
but uh yeah like i don't hate it it's just a poorly executed idea for a film monster like
the river part just destroys the entire film uh mupa what's your take on the walking dead
i watched the first five seasons i want to say up to when beth gets shot in one of the
most funniest death scenes i've ever seen spoilers if you haven't seen it at all you'll
forget who that is i'm sure about it before you finally decide to watch it but if you're like a
couple of episodes away from seeing that moment and i've just spoiled it for you i genuinely
apologize but i mean it's been out for a really long time um but yeah i don't know i've always
found walking dead be pretty dumb season one's definitely the best but it's not exactly non-tism
and season two is a joke and i can't believe they actually managed to get that to be something that
people enjoyed it's impressive for me season two yes the one with the farmhouse the one where they
try and i haven't i saw like the first so okay yeah let me ask you a question rags okay so we're
in a farmhouse right we're surviving we're surviving some zombies around the the world
but we're mostly okay in our little farm yeah i imagine if you're up at a farmhouse there's not
that many zombies around and uh we have a water supplied by a well isn't that wonderful now
one day yeah you walk to this well and you hear some noises and you're like oh what's this you're
like oh oh my goodness there's a zombie in there there is a literal zombie swimming around in the
well water now uh i i'm standing there with you and you're you're there and i say rags let's get
a series of pulleys to get a lasso type rope to wrap around this zombie to pull it all the way up
and out so that we can uh drink the water well that sounds like uh one of the stupidest things
i've ever heard of my life but why it's not contaminated if we get the zombie out right
oh my goodness did they do that yes and the hilarious part is they spend a while doing it
and when it finally gets to the top of the well when they pulled it all the way up with the rope
its body splits open and its bottom half just falls into the well bleeds all over the place
and then they're like well the water's contaminated now do they drink it no but it's just funny that
they thought it wasn't contaminated until that point yeah i guess if they were thinking they
could uh yeah like i would have been like this well is now off limits
uh like obviously mauler please say this same you did for wolf story
what does that mean you covered our viewers you covered our wealth your channels fail while we
endure what you will find is our curse our true king will show them we do not serve we roof
all right uh yeah uh walking dad's a really dumb show and uh i really wish the yms continued
to rip it a new one um but he decided to fry different fish yeah i heard it got pretty bad
my parents used to watch it and then they just said they just stopped caring and got bad um
okay so these are the stream labs ones now we've managed to catch up to super chats
oh my god love you guys can't wait for you to finish the breakdowns of tfa and the newest
star wars abortion mauler your rage on ros is fantastic well done bud thank you two questions
for shad i shall save those mauler please read in your best english policeman voice
oh this is for shad as well all right i'll have to save it all
hello massives on 15 you say limiting artists is bad but on 16 you say limiting artists inspires
creativity do you remember that rags we got called out for that uh way back when we said
so the idea is that we say that false diversity is bad because it limits your artists abilities
to make the stories they want but then we say also that limitations through like say for example
you make the force in future episodes of your thing you want to make certain things happen but
you've made the force a boxed in thing that can only do certain things means that you are
forced to be creative in terms of solving problems or creating scenarios and so people managed to
construe from that that we simultaneously said that rules are restrictive and rules encourage
creativity but obviously um the qualifier was basically arbitrary rules versus rules you set
within your own universe yeah within the universe yeah don't like it's just like rags writes his
own story and then i'm just like hey uh all of those white people have to be black
yeah it's like uh you can't have the letter uh r in your script you can't have any three-wheeler
or four-wheeler cars it has to be six-wheelers you're like what he's like well we're promoting
the the six-wheeler fucking car thing i don't know like just just arbitrary restrictions versus um
ones that come with creating universe um i agree with the latter and you briefly addressed this on
17 but i don't feel it was a good justification ps i i feel like we said the same thing because
that's the same uh explanation i just gave um can i use em's avatar for a project
i assume em refers to mauler in which case yes go for it have have fun with whatever you're doing
um yeah absolutely
another confusing element in star wars is the color of lasers empire ships fire green rebels
red stormtrooper blasters are red clone troopers are blue padme's handgun fire is green
clone shooters chips fire blue and red are they food coloring them lol i don't know i think that's
a fair confusion to have though i've always wondered if there's like a reason why it's
different colors like does it have different properties is it slower but have more mass in
the plasma does is it like are there different properties that they have just like you know
ammunition and you know the real world has different properties very very curious i wonder
if there's anything behind that oh that's what they meant by for wolf story the wolf uh sorry the the
knight the dragon the king i understand uh have you guys played the last of us it's a ps4 exclusive
so not sure if you would have it's a good game i am oh also rags oh hi new massive oh hi i have
played the last of us i played the last of us years and years ago i never finished it i liked it
but i was surprised with what people had said about it up to the point of me playing it i was
like wow this is the game everyone's going nuts over okay yeah i don't know man like yeah it was
fine it was fine um
they said arbitrary restrictions can result in some great creative stories though you know this
because you've seen midnight yeah but you didn't require restrictions to make midnight
like so in that case they would have made them in spite of restrictions rather than because of
restriction um as opposed to having to write your stories within the rules of your own universe which
can i mean any restriction can promote creativity but it's like we said the whole uh arbitrary ones
yes and get the right answer that doesn't mean guessing is a good pathway to truth
and midnight is a matter of budget uh not necessarily anything else like like katherine
tates barely in the episode and then mostly in one room so if the restriction there is low budget
as a writer um it just means a story that doesn't go to many places or has many people which isn't
necessarily like i you know i i don't think that that's such a harsh restriction compared
to something like you have to have this character this character this character or something
but yeah uh any any restriction can technically encourage creativity it's just um i don't think
you should impose restrictions for no just for arbitrary reasons especially after the story is
completed as opposed to before it started um
you both need some r and r ra and rooftops sounds wonderfully relaxing
doom annihilation is on netflix efap movies when um oh is it on it's on the list you gotta see it
we've known it's been outrageous oh i know but i keep forgetting about it
so it's every time i'm reminded of it it's like a new experience apparently tom holland got swapped
in the mcu what really uh tom holland um what the fuck marvel reportedly plans to replace him
really that can't be real like why the hell would they do that
um
yeah i'm just reading a sec
okay this looks like after this
yes when holland eventually makes his exit from the role the franchise will be in need of a spidey
and according to industry insider daniel rpk that new hero will come in the form of miles morales
um okay
i mean this is all like down the line and stuff i yeah we're not yeah we'll see what happens with that
um originally the color of blasters was dependent on the different types of gas that were used to
fire right huh i can believe it i wonder and i wonder if they have different properties to
them but interesting um maybe the use they they use the ship on the atst means a long trip back
to the landing site and spending money on fuel far more expense than he's willing to manage
you mean say that wait say that one more time the use the use of the ship on the atst means
a long trip back to the landing site and spending money on fuel far more expense than he was willing
to manage he puts his life in jeopardy if anything he only survived because of the of luck of the
terrible incompetence of the atst like he's willing to sacrifice all those other people's lives like
yeah for for what for some fuel
and and and for a walk like that's insane yeah it's kind of rationalizations nuts to me
um but they should have just bombed it in the sneaking segment since it was sitting not patrolling
agreed that nothing works about that episode there should have been their top priority is
putting a bomb on it blowing it up uh the one bad visual is from the trandoshans looking more
like ds9 jim hadar than trandoshans in episodes one and two because they use prosthetic makeup
instead of non-emotive snouted masks all right the easy excuse for the fobs is that they only
work a few miles range and only on pre-chipped people like baileys or prisoners assuming yabi
was empire held and need dangerous emp or surgery if they're just genetic trackers it would be bad
i suppose we'll have to find out yeah but once you once you got out of prison you're fucking
taking that thing out if you're any kind of ne'er do well if you're any kind of what if they
establish it'll kill you to take it out of you ragged hmm it's like that just seems like
something there's they work around and they would know about it and then mando would say something
but again like i said before they never even entertain the idea of how to deactivate it or
to fool the system or spoof the system or anything and if it's not possible then like man they should
have said it's not even possible or someone suggested mando's like nah can't be done i should
know is no uh i liked the scout trooper banter scene but hated the marksmanship scene thought
they were damn good with their actual main weapon the cannons on their bikes mando's weakness is
going to be concussions best cars rear cars and droid tanks with thickness they tank with
thickness i mean the thing that he was on in episode three didn't seem very thick and yet it
was tanking a shit ton um and yeah i hate the marksmanship scene too i hate it and yeah once
we get there we'll be able to highlight that they're not even that bad they managed to fucking
nail quill but i guess that was because the plot needed them to nail quill
rifle could have been unloaded to prevent negligent discharge disintegrating something
he should have used the prod maybe he was worried the charge inertia would break the rifle
maybe there's a bit of back blast if you use the disintegrator point blank
love i don't i don't buy a lot of that i mean the idea i just i don't know man it comes across as
people are really desperate to make him seem like he's not an idiot yeah like who is it out there
that he's afraid of disintegrating i don't know but that doesn't even match up because later he
just has it loaded yeah he walks around with it loaded and if you're thinking well in that
situation he's with baby yoda and he has to fucking discharge and kill baby yoda what about that
yeah and also like he knows what he's going to do right to kill a bunch of dudes and there's
an outpost and a compound and people have died going there like man that should be loaded
also surely mandalorian whose weapons are a religion to them know things like trigger
discipline and putting the safety on like basic stuff
given they take 50 years to still be an infant yoda species would not exist if they didn't have
natural force talent to protect them in infancy what do you mean why wouldn't they just be protected
by the adult versions of the species yeah they have like parents right it's consistent dumb
but consistent i don't know about that and in new canon the dummy the dumber you are the better
you are at the force what you talking about ray stupid i don't know i don't really think she's
stupid sometimes she does she does some weird stuff in the third film now the jawa guns are
ion cannons most models of which are actually not very good at stunning organics if only two or
three hit him he would have been fine other than some armor glitches you need to fix there were 10
and there were actually a variety of different weapons in the still in fact they actually one
of the things that they did was kind of nifty was one of them it looks like they took three
rifle scopes and stacked them on top of each other and connected them and basically added
a handle to it to make a strange little space ion laser it was kind of kind of nifty but yeah
there were like 10 there's a shot of i'm sorry can't just shoot more than once you'd think maybe
they maybe they have to be reloaded significantly yeah they gotta pop it up or something desert
frogs have been a thing since return of the jedi well apparently they're a real thing so
yeah sure i'm fine with that absolutely uh haven't you heathans watched predator
mud blocks thermal vision or it's cold-blooded you have a even in predator they uh they
like him covering himself 100 isn't uh i think they they cheat a little bit with movie magic in
that moment because he goes from being like mostly covered to just 100 um the part that
i do love is that when the predator scans the area you can spot him it's just hard to see and uh
i like this uh the iod blast has left his helmet scrambled and glitchy you don't know this shit
like this is just being made up
maybe he did get the the baby didn't get the thibbles later once he got the breast plate
it's like oh my god so many excuses have to be made because it doesn't make sense on its own
uh um yeah and also a mud horn is really big it has a lot of body space
and when it comes out it is clearly not actually covered in mud
like there's no way he wouldn't be able to see it especially in a cave where it's cool
and that thing is putting out an immense amount of body heat like there's no way like i get what
you're saying there's no inertial compensators and anti-concussion fields are things in star
wars his armor may have had something like that in the circuitry to deal with blunt impact blunt
impact is always weak in media anyway plus he's just a tough bastard i guess this is to explain
how he wasn't hurt more significantly by the fall man he is really tough inertial compensators
anti-concussion fields circuitry to deal with blunt impact blunt impact is always weak in
media also he's really tough like wow some some reaching right there gotta make sure we make it
believable can't have it that he's just extremely protected by the plot the other upgrade possible
to make the lockdown bigger than just a normal lock is maybe a light lightning field the way
slave one destroyed obi's tracker in episode two but maybe but mando probably opened the door by
remote as he ran and carl was just waiting for the ramp to drop um i suppose that's a potential
explanation but you'd think that he would have had a straight shot to the ship at that point so we'd
see him get on i don't know why he wouldn't uh he would open it well before getting the you know
it's just risky i don't however you cut it there's an issue um i love the clatoonian makeup in episode
four but the episode was weak as hell the raiders should also should have been the same raiders as
the second ewoks movie they have the same mix of mealy and duct tape blasters atst should have
patrolled during sneak time all right um the crime racket went bust when java died they were right
you don't know that you can't just base that off like third party shit yeah and i'm like i don't
see how hut getting killed makes all the crime go away like all the criminals are just java has
like a family there's the uh what's your name the huts there's even even if the huts all disappeared
like people are still there like they're all there they're not gonna leave i mean it's still
maus aisley yeah wouldn't yeah it would just be a power vacuum or crime vacuum or whatever
essentially the crime racket went bust when java died they were revolutions in the hut slave
species when they saw mere slaves strangle java to death that's why what do you mean saw nobody
lived to tell that tale everything exploded on that thing outside of our main heroes unless they
would run around the universe telling everybody that got strangled that's why episode one nikto
and episode four clatoonians were totally mono monoracial they no longer had the huts to tie them
these explanations man like there's so much that comes from just content that's dotted the
made light stuff what up my jawas hi fringy have you seen mr robot he has i don't know if you've
seen the he's seen the newest season but he's probably going to be on it um
gordula the hut gaudula the hut yeah i know that it was because she shows up in um phantom menace
she's like behind him and just imagine that when you kill a hut another hut would take the huts
place or someone would take his place yeah it wouldn't even need to be a hut at that point
you guys ever get tired yes i'm actually uh uh yeah i'm currently tired mm-hmm you fool killer
queen has already touched this super chat have fun repeating the last two hours love your vids
good night mauler good night night night i made it just in time to spill my shackles on the boys
thank you for doing what you do best wishes my guys best wishes to you too all right and that
is us caught up with all of today's stuff um how how how much of an overflow thing do you think we
could do rags well i am rather tired as it is so i would like to go sleep all right well as you
when you were gone last time i collected up all of the rags related comments as in like two word
stuff i'm just going to read them all out to you in a row okay oh yeah go for it all right
night rags oh good night hi rags oh hello hi rags hello bye rags oh goodbye hi rags
hi also hi wags hello let's rub our doggo butts together let us rub our doggo butts together
traditional greeting of course also also hi rags oh hello a chat or so back i said hello rags
backwards just in case it was confusing sorry if it was on the subject how is rags doing
rags is doing good my life is going a okay uh i guess right now i'm just tired it is
one thirty in the morning here it flies when you're having fun uh this one just says rags
oh hello waggers
hello hi rags hi also howdy doggo howdy to you too hi rags hi also hi rags
oh hello also hi rags hello also hi rag hey there what kind of tea do you drink rags also hi
hi um i just drink louzian just iced tea nothing fancy there i don't and unsweet i don't like sweet
tea uh it's a really common thing here in arkansas and the south especially that you have sweet tea
but i really do not like sweet tea i i just i don't like it i like unsweet tea that's why i
that's by the way that's why i take so many bathroom breaks in the stream is because i drink
a lot of tea which is basically water yes yeah i'll go through yeah uh hi rags hi also hi rags
hi good night rags oh good night hi rags hello this also says hi j but i kind of find that offensive
i'm just gonna move on uh yeah i wouldn't worry about that i haven't watched the review what are
your thoughts i think that's about uh episode nine which has been thoroughly done uh oh yeah i think
uh i think your question has been answered once or twice hi rags and hail the god emperor of man
oh hello and absolutely um all right and that leads us up to where we're at with the overflow
which normally i would tackle a bit of that but i am very tired as well and i don't like giving
really schlumpy answers instead of giving uh more more um flumple dances that makes total sense it's
proper english i'm not sleeping up flump and there was a superchild came in saying hi rags
oh hello and then i rags
hi rags someone's claiming to be rags top them oh i think it'll be obvious once they try and
pull it off nothing like the real deal
and uh yeah with that i suppose that brings us to the end uh next week we're gonna be doing the one
with all of the things i said we've been trying to do for ages oh we got a shit ton of memes i'm
gonna have to spend a while sorting that out in prep uh we're gonna listen to that i hate
everything conversation i'll probably release it as a separate thing once it's covered on two new
on two new layer it'll be an extended universe like a mini uh no like so the conversation i
actually have with him will be an eu thing and then we will actually play it uh on stream as well
so uh all right i got you um and yeah there's the movie bob thing and reading the script thing it's
gonna be this whole thing it's gonna be great i think we'll have i think j is the only person
i could think of who would want to do all of those things because it's going to be a weird
stream i don't know what kind of guest would even want to be on that one but once that one's done
we we will be in a position of who knows what's going to come next for refap because we will have
done all of the ones that we expected to do like this was one the mandalorian stream we only managed
to do five episodes so yes we should be chastised for that i'm sorry the long man was too long a
runny um but of course we're very much uh hoping that uh we can get that all sorted out
and yeah stuff is on the way working on tfa part three april fools is already set which i'm very
happy about getting all that sorted out nice and early uh we got infinity tisms five coming soon
and the batwoman episodes coming soon what else is there oh yeah the wolf part one and part two
videos for refap minis i'm gonna i'm trying to find a good place to release those instead of
just like piling a bunch of things out at once um i'll figure it out and i guess yeah that's that's
about it anything anything else other than obviously yeah um i i hope that we can get
back to these episodes later so we can wrap up the mandalorian talk and discussion a lot to cover
a lot to discuss um so whenever we can get back to it man let's do it yes uh thanks of course to
all for watching hope you enjoyed thank you very much for the donations the memes that i can find
will be collected and placed in for the next one uh and thank you to our guests who stayed for so
long i'm going to guest mr rags so that about brings us to the end i will read out um these
these other superchats that came in from uh so the last one was irags then it was rags and eggs
and giz then i don't know what to make all of this oh my god someone's really stretching that
one out and yes uh like i said streamlabs and superchats they're all they're all caught up
outside of the overflow which shall be dealt with been uh chipping away for a bazillion years
definitely going to get it get it down it's just um obviously very very tired tisms right now and
shall be continued and yeah the the sargony fab should happen eventually um armit skeptic said
he was interested but doesn't respond to dms um i'm eventually gonna just fucking tweet at him
saying you're annoying like response keep track of the abs awful awful cuban come on man um i think
like we're supposed to at some point do tldr i think he was interested i need to get back to him
